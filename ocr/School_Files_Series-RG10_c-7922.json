The receipt of the news of this fire is very disturbing to the officials of this Branch and to myself. There have been five fires at Indian residential schools since our 1939-40 estimates were prepared last fall. The Carcross Church of England Residential School was totally destroyed by fire and certain sections of other schools were damaged by fire and have to be rebuilt this year.\n\nI note that it is your intention to rebuild the Albany school in the near future. I would suggest that before even the preliminary steps are taken toward the construction of a new school at Albany, the matter be carefully reviewed by you or representatives of your Church and the Minister and his officials here. In view of the large number of disastrous fires that took place last year at educational institutions in the province of Quebec and the number of fires at our own schools in recent months, I am of the opinion that Parliament will hesitate to vote per capita grants for the operation of residential schools in the future,\n\nReverend Henri Belleau, O.M.I.,\nMoose Lake,\nOntario.\nother than those that are of fireproof construction. The Government, in the construction of its own schools, has definitely decided that these buildings must be of fireproof construction throughout, and it is just possible that an attempt may be made to extend the same policy to the construction of church-owned schools. In any event, a conference such as the one I suggest will enable you to learn exactly the policy of the Government and will tend to prevent misunderstandings that might arise in the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION FROM THE ALBANY\nR.C.

This would make the work of the staff much lighter during the intervening period.

This is the only Catholic school on the west coast of James Bay and during its life span an area in which there are over 800 Roman Catholic Indians.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary that this building be replaced immediately and the Oblate Order respectfully submits the following for your consideration:\n\n1. That a fireproof building be erected costing in the neighbourhood of $60,000.00.\n\n2. That $25,000.00 of this amount be provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 and the balance in the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\n3. Provided you agree to the request contained in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Oblate Order is ready to proceed in the summer of 1940 with the erection of this building following plans prepared by your architects. Every possible assistance will be given by the Oblate Order to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\n4. On the completion of the payments requested in paragraph 2, the Oblate Order is prepared to turn over the new building together with the property and the out buildings to the Government without further remuneration.\n\nIn explanation of paragraph 4, I may say that this would include the following:\n\na) Three hundred acres of land of which approximately 120 acres are under cultivation.\n\nb) The out buildings at present located on the property. These consist of:\nOttawa, October 21, 1959.\n\nFor Construction of Albany Residential School\n\nDear Father Plourde,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 9th, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, certain specific proposals with respect to the rebuilding of the Albany Residential School.\n\nI shall be glad to submit these proposals to the Minister for his consideration at the time the 1947-48 estimates are under review. In the meantime I am not in a position to state, however, what provision, if any, is likely to be made this year by the Government for the building of Indian residential schools. There are, as you know, two or three residential schools at this date in the process of construction. Provision will have to be made in next year's estimates for the completion and furnishing of these institutions.\n\nIn your letter you estimate that a fireproof school can be built at Albany at an approximate cost of $30,000. Our experience in the construction and reconstruction of residential schools in recent years would incline me to believe that the cost at Albany would substantially exceed the figure quoted by you. I have been wondering, therefore, if it would be possible for you to secure from someone familiar with construction costs an estimate of what in his judgment it would-\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n612 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nit would cost to rebuild the particular school,\nI feel confident the Minister will ask for a specific\nstatement of the cost before committing himself to\nthis project.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter\nto the Reverend Father Belleau.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with reference to supplying laundry machinery to the Albany residential school. At the present time I am not certain that our funds will permit purchasing the equipment you suggest. However, I will discuss the matter further with you on the occasion of your next visit to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n519 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nthat owning boats and using our own skilled labourers, Brothers of the Order, will reduce materially building expenditures.\n\nI hope these data will be found satisfactory and will establish that $60,000 is an approximate but fair estimate.\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenri Belliveau O.M.I.\nLES MISSIONNAIRES OBLATS DE MARIE IMMACUL\u00c9E\n\n\u00c9glise Saint-Pierre, Ap\u00f4tre, \u2014 1201, rue de la Visitation.\n\nMontreal, October 30th, 1949.\n\nDoctor Harold McGill\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, in which you state that our proposals concerning the reconstruction of the Albany School will be submitted to the Minister.\n\nWe wish to thank you for so dealing with and promoting our work.\n\nThe estimated cost of a fire-proof building at Fort Albany was mentioned by us as approximately $60,000. Our estimate was based on the comparing conditions and rates prevalent in Keewatin and Manitoba, where two Catholic residential schools have recently been built, with conditions in James Bay.\n\nThe Sandy Bay school cost $40,000, and is a concrete fire-proof building consisting of two wings measuring respectively 60' by 30' and 60' by 30', having a basement and two storeys each added to the old building. Transportation to Sandy Bay is costly and everything in the nature of building material had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\nAt Fort Albany, we were intending to build, if the Department saw fit to approve, with stone available along the Albany River, a few miles away. However, the Albany Mission owns a seventeen-ton schooner; another schooner of twenty-five ton owned by the Oblate Order, will be available for transport.\n\nThe distance between Albany and Moosonee, as you well know, does not exceed ninety nautical miles, and the transport of building material will not amount to anything like the former rates which prevailed at the time of the erection of the school destroyed by fire.\n\nWe were induced also to estimate at about $60,000, the cost of a new school, because His Excellency Bishop LaJeunesse told us that $60,000 had been spent in the erection of a new school, in which case transport alone had cost $10,000. We believe\nOttawa, November 26, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Construction of residential schools at Albany, Ontario, and Carcross, Yukon.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Bethune's memorandum of November 20, in which he seeks information with respect to representations that have been made to the Minister for the construction of the above noted schools.\n\nIn my memorandum to you dated November 21 I dealt with the construction of both these schools, together with four others, for the construction of which requests have been received from the church authorities by this Branch. There is little that can be added to the information supplied in that memorandum. If it is the intention of the Government to proceed next year with a building program, both the Carcross and the Albany schools have in my judgment a greater claim for consideration than any of the others. In view of the fact that the schools at these points were totally destroyed by fire during the last year, steps should be immediately taken to provide either Indian day or residential schools at both points. In view of the nomadic habits of the Indians in these districts, I cannot persuade myself that the construction of Indian day schools would meet the needs of the Indian population. I intimated in my memorandum of November 21 that the estimated cost of both these buildings would be approximately $185,700.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAB\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1939.\n\nDear Father Belleau:\n\nOwing to conditions at the present time I am still unable to state definitely how much or how little will be provided for the erection of the Albany school. However, I was talking to the architect of the Surveys & Engineering Branch and he wants to have the plans prepared as far as possible so that in the event of money being made available we will be ready to start as soon as conditions permit. I would like very much to see you and if it is possible for you to come to Ottawa within the next week or so you might do so. If you call at my office I will take you over to see the architect.\n\nI want it definitely understood, of course, that this action does not mean that the question of erecting a school at Albany has been definitely settled but only as stated above that we are trying to have everything prepared so that work can proceed if money is procured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

At the time I had not the exact information. However, I am in touch with the agent for the firm today and they advise me that the clothes press has gone forward and should have reached Moosonee by this time.\n\nThere has been a great deal of delay in supplying the washer and extractor. This is due to war conditions and the impossibility of obtaining certain parts that are necessary for these machines. However, the company assures me that they have a definite promise that the parts will be supplied by October 10 and if they receive them by that date the washer and extractor will be shipped from Toronto not later than October 15.\n\nThe company expressed considerable regret that there had been so much delay but, as you are aware, present conditions render it very difficult to obtain certain materials promptly. I am also sorry that the equipment has not reached you before this but as it is due to conditions beyond our control I know you will be patient in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. H.

Rev. H. Belleau,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ont.\nVicariat Apostolique de la Baie James\n\nMoosonee, Ont. July 11th, 1942\n\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nOn my arrival here, three days ago, I found your letter dated June 18th. I thank you sincerely for it, as well as for the interest you take in our Indian Schools.\n\nWe have no brick chimneys at the Fort Albany Residential School, but are planning to build some this summer. In fact, we have received quotations of prices from Hill, Clarke and Francis Company, of New Liskeard. This firm also has an office in Moosonee, Ont. They can deliver hard brick (not pressed, but ordinary) F.O.B. Moosonee, for $56.00 a thousand, if a minimum of ten thousand bricks are taken; this constitutes a car-load.\n\nIf the Department could purchase ten thousand bricks from that firm, it seems that such a deal would be advantageous, since freight rates are so high if goods are shipped from points south of New Liskeard. I doubt whether any other price quoted by a firm could compete with the above-quoted prices. The brick mentioned is made at New Liskeard, I believe. However, if any other price can be obtained, better than that, I see no objection whatever to have the Indian Affairs Purchasing Branch buy elsewhere. Hard brick is necessary.\n\nWe have already asked A. Prud'homme & Co., 358 Craig Street, Montreal, to send us equipment for the laundry boiler.

I am supplying them with the information contained in your letter. In the event of the brick being purchased, it will cost $350.00, which will leave a balance of $650.00 available for other expenditures. I should appreciate receiving, as soon as possible, detailed information regarding the other supplies required in order that any requests in this regard may be submitted to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRe. Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ont.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRecently the Purchasing Agent submitted for approval a requisition to purchase, at a cost of $325.00, 10,000 bricks for the Residential School at Albany, Ontario.\n\nWas any arrangement made with the church authorities when the new school was built that the Department would contribute any portion of the cost. If the above purchase is approved of it may be taken as a precedent and further requests will be received for other similar expenditures. It would seem advisable that you should have a definite understanding with the church authorities with regard to the matter.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, July 27, 1942.\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of July 27, with reference to a requisition to purchase bricks for the Albany Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, this school was destroyed by fire in August, 1939. Last year His Lordship Rt. Rev. Henri Beilieu, O.M.I., advised the Department that the Church authorities were erecting a new building from missionary funds. There was no commitment on the part of this Department toward paying any of the costs of this building.\n\nI attach, for your information, a picture of the building and I believe that a brick chimney is essential to eliminate fire hazard as far as possible. In view of the increasing costs of operation, I consider that it would be advisable for us to assist the Church in the erection of this chimney by supplying the bricks ordered on the requisition. Funds for the purpose are available in the current year's appropriation.\n\nDirector.\nOffice of\nThe Director.\n\nOttawa, August 6, 1942.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. Jackson, in his memorandum of July 27, refers to a requisition for the purchase of bricks for the Albany Indian Residential School. A memorandum dated August 4 has gone forward to you on the particular matter of the requisition referred to.\n\nThis raises the whole question of our financial assistance to Church-owned schools.\n\nIn some cases the Branch supplies equipment or repairs, this being done through grants from appropriation. However, there have been instances where funds voted for repairs to present buildings have been used to assist in the construction of new buildings and thus our responsibility for the care for these affairs has increased. This phase of the matter is not satisfactory, in my opinion, as the practice is quite unsound. I would recommend that the matter be discussed fully when our new estimates are being determined, and that a definite decision be reached as to whether or not any money should be voted for this assistance.\n\nMost of these schools are not fireproof and I would recommend the retention of the grant to pay for night watchmen, therefore, as by this means provision is made for the safety of the inmates which is a definite responsibility of the Branch.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJuly 15 1942\n\nFile No. 46-1-8\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Albany Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 99 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO R.

Bilodeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nAlbany Indian Residential School,\nFort Albany, via Moosonee,\nONTARIO.\n\nI have to refer to accounts from Sherwin-Williams Co., Montreal, for paint and oil supplied the School on September 21, 1942. In the accounts are charges for containers - 1 drum at $5.00 and several cans - $1.95. Have these been returned for credit? Will you kindly look into this matter and let me know, as these charges are outstanding in the Recoverable Accounts Ledger.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nVER/J\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Treasury Office,\nParliament Buildings\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.W. McCutcheon.\n\nDear sir:\n\nAnswering your letter addressed to Rev. Bilodeau, O.M.I., Albany Indian Residential School and dated March 10, we inform you that the drums and cans containing paints and oil bought from Sherwin-Williams have never been returned for credit.\n\nAt this time of the year it is rather hard to get a quick answer from Albany due to poor means of travelling and communications but we imagine that these containers must have been used for several purposes as we always need things of all kinds in these remote and unorganized places. And so I think it would be their desire to keep these at the school even if they had to pay for them. Just advise what is to be done and we will conform to your will.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlbany Residential School.\n\nBY J.

Fr. Langlois, but I received from him and sent to Dr. Orford, some invoices of Sherwin-Williams, certified correct by the Father. Dr Orford is at present in Ottawa, I believe.\n\nThe paint was received O.K., at Albany, by the last ship, and this winter by mail, the Rev. Fr. Principal sent the certified invoices.\n\nI trust they should be traced and found correctly signed, without difficulty. If they have not turned up at your office, I shall ask the Doctor when he returns.\n\nSincerely yours, in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada  \nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, March 12, 1945.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nAlbany Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 77 ALLOTMENT 10-691 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Right Rev.

We are attaching hereto copy of Freight Bill in the amount of $1.73 to cover prepaid freight to Rev. H. Belleau, Moosonee, etc.\n\nOur Billing Department find that they overcharged you on the prepaid freight and we are attaching hereto our credit memorandum in amount of $1.65 to adjust the overcharge.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCRANE LIMITED.\n\nBY [Signature]\nH.J. Statham, Chief Clerk.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: The Rebuilding of the Albany School.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Albany School of my diocese was destroyed by fire in 1940, and due to the war and its demands on the finances of the Country, was not immediately rebuilt. However, plans for the new school were prepared by your architect Mr. Buck. I have these plans in my possession, and I must admit that every time I look at them, I become more and more anxious to see them put into execution.\n\nAt the present time, the building, serving the purpose of a Residential School, was erected by myself without any help from the Government, but it is a very temporary structure, too small to accommodate the number of Catholic children in the James Bay Agency that should attend school.\n\nAccording to the 1939 Census figures, there are 1069 Indians of the Catholic Faith in that Agency and there is only one school for all their children. Catholics number 52% of the total Indian population, and if this figure of 52% is applied to the total number of school children on the whole Reserve, the figure obtained is 171. Therefore, the Albany School, even if a day school were established at Attawapiskat, would still serve about 140 children.\n\nWhen the question of rebuilding this School is placed before Honorable Mr. Glen, the nomadic way of life of the Indians of the whole Reserve must be borne in mind, as day schools can certainly not be operated for Indian children whose parents are forced, by circumstances, to lead such a life.\n\n2......\nIn making the above computation, I am obliged to use the 1939 Census figures, but I am sure that the 1945 Census will show closer to 200 children of school age in the James Bay Agency.\n\nI confidently hope, therefore, that my request for the rebuilding of the Albany school, during the fiscal year 1946-1947, will be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ Henri Belleau\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 14, 1945.\n\nMy dear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 10th, in which you discuss the desirability of establishing more adequate residential school accommodation at Albany.\n\nIn this connection, there is little I can add to the remarks I made during my conversation with you yesterday. It is just possible that we may make provision in the immediate future for a thorough educational survey of the Albany district, with the object of asking for the Parliamentary appropriation necessary to proceed with either an addition to the present school or a new school at this point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

This is due to the fact that it is the only means at the disposal of the Principal, of giving any precise data regarding hardware. Even if items differ somewhat from those specified through this catalogue, they will be satisfactory as long as they are the same tool or piece of hardware.\n\nThe kitchen range mentioned in the requisition is to be used for training children in housekeeping and cooking.\n\nThe Canada Cement Co. have quoted 76\u00bd cents per bag F.O.B. Moosonee, as car-load price, meaning a minimum of 600 bags. A car-lot may go as far as 1000 and even 1200 bags. The quantity required for Fort Albany is 600 sacks. Fort George needs 320 sacks. If shipped separately, Fort George will not benefit of car-lot price. If suitable to the Department, it would seem preferable to ship both the Fort George and Fort Albany requirements together, making a total of 940 sacks.\n\nWhatever cannot be shipped before the end of March may be left aside by the Department. We shall purchase afterwards; but in that case, we would appreciate being told as soon as possible what is left out of the requisition and remains to be bought. If this can be arranged, we shall appreciate it.\n\nMany thanks for your co-operation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar apostolic of James Bay.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, March 22, 1946\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nAlbany (R.C.)

As no authority has been previously granted for the incurring of transportation expenses of children going to the Albany school, the Department desires to have a full report from you before considering payment of this account. In connection with it, I might refer you to official letter of July 4th, 1929, in which you were informed that the Department considered that it should be possible to arrange with parents for the transportation of their children to the school without expense.\n\nWhen replying, it is requested that you explain the matter as fully as possible and advise why it was necessary to incur this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

If, however, a pupil is absent from the school longer than 43 days, grant should only be requested for the actual number of days such pupil is in residence plus the 43 days holidays, for which grant is allowed. For instance, for a pupil allowed home on holidays on July 1st and who returns to the school on August 11th, grant should be requested for 92 days, which is the number of days in the September quarter. If, however, a pupil allowed out on holidays on July 1st does not return until September 1st, grant should be requested for 73 days (50 days in September plus 43 days holiday leave). In preparing your September quarter return, you state that the total number of days in the quarter was 82. As pointed out above, the correct number is 92; viz., July - 31 days; August - 31 days; and September-30 days.\n\nI also enclose a supply of admission and discharge sheets. One or more of these, giving the information requested, should accompany each quarterly return.\n\nIn reviewing the return, it is noted that Lucie Katakwpit is eighteen years of age, Mani Sutherland nineteen years of age, Jane Spence twenty years of age, Bernadette Pony eighteen years, Cecelia Napishish nineteen years and Mani Shakapunitam eighteen years. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the Department allows grant for pupils of eighteen years or over and, unless there are special reasons for retaining these girls in the school, it is considered that they should be discharged at once. You should report fully regarding the reasons why you consider they should be in the school.\n\nThe Department has endeavoured to make this letter as explicit as possible in order to assist you in the correct preparation of your return and I trust that you will prepare the returns of both the September and December quarters in conformity with the instructions contained in the letter and on the back cover of the return form. When these returns are received here properly completed, the grant due for these two quarters will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. Bilodeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Albany, via Geral Rapids, Ont.\nOttawa, January 19th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIt is regretted that the Department finds it necessary to send back the September and December quarter returns of the Albany Indian Residential School.\n\nIn preparing the returns, the names of the pupils should be shown consecutively, according to numbers - the names of the boys and girls being entered on separate pages. A number should be given to each pupil on entrance to the school and this number should be retained during the whole period of residence and such number dropped when the pupil is discharged and a new number given to each new pupil.\n\nEnclosed with this letter is a statement showing the names and register numbers of the pupils whose names appeared on the June quarter return. You will see from this that the names of the boys appearing on the September return are totally different from the names of the boys appearing on the June return and that the register numbers have all been changed. If all the boys in the school at the end of June were discharged, their register numbers should have been dropped and new numbers given the boys admitted after July 1st.\n\nI would, also, point out that, under the heading \"Date of Entrance to School\", there should be shown the day of the month and the year in which a pupil first entered the school. In preparing the September and December returns, you simply show July 11th, which must be incorrect in the case of a number of children who have been in the school for some time.\n\nGrant is allowed for forty-three (43) days holidays and, for those pupils who were allowed home on summer holidays and were not absent from the school longer than 43 days, grant should be\n\nRev.

One or more of these forms should accompany each quarterly return, giving the information requested in connection with all pupils admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nAs every parent applying for the admission of a child to the Albany School has an annuity ticket giving the name of the head of the family as well as the band number, the Department desires that such information should be given in connection with the admission of all new pupils.

Ferrier\nDept. of Indian Education\n6th Building\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter no.44-2-10, dated January 19th, concerning the quarter returns of the school.\n\nI must thank you for the full explanation on the subject of the number to be given each pupil. From now on, every new pupil will have his or her own number, and the register numbers of the pupils discharged will be dropped.\n\nYou notice that under the heading \"Date of Entrance to School\" in the September and December returns, the date of entrance is July 11th. Necessary corrections have been made in the new copies of the September and December returns, in connection with the date of entrance, allowances being made for forty-three (43) days holidays.\n\nIn consequence, for the pupils already registered and allowed leave on holidays, we request a grant of 92 days, viz., Sept. 30 days, August 31 days, July 31 days; for the pupils who enter for the first time on July 11th, we request a grant for 82 days, viz., July 21 days, Aug. 31 days and Sept. 30 days.\n\nConcerning the pupils aged eighteen and over, Moni Sutherland is the only one whom I can discharge at once. The others cannot be sent home this winter; their parents and relatives reside from 75 to 375 miles away from Fort Albany. Among them, Beni Shapawitam came from Winisk and has never, until this year, had an opportunity of entering the School. Cecilia Nppashish entered six years ago, but could not then remain more than one year.\n\nBernadette Peny and Jane Spence will be discharged as soon as possible.\n\nHoping you will find the quarterly returns satisfactory as corrected,\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, April 29th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing the September and December quarter returns of the Albany Indian Residential School. A cheque in payment of the grant due for these two quarters will be forwarded to Rev. Arthur McGowan, O.M.I., 218 Visitation St., Montreal, P.Q.\n\nIt is noted that the returns have been prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in official letter of January 19th, last. I note that, under the heading \"Band Number\", you give No. 9 for each pupil - I refer, no doubt, to Treaty 9. I would point out here, however, that the information desired under this heading is the individual band number under which the parents of each child are paid their annuity. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of the 20th instant.\n\nThe discharge of Henri Sutherland - No. 01, is approved.\n\nIn preparing the admission and discharge sheet (Form No. 35) which accompanies the quarterly return, the information requested on this form regarding the pupils entering during the quarter should be given as well as the information regarding the pupils discharged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Some came from Fort-Hope and the others were brought from Wenusk. In September, it is not very easy to travel as you know by experience, so we could not consider the possibility of sending those children back to their respective families. In fact, it was absolutely impossible to turn back those children from Wenusk. The family which came from Fort-Hope was so poor that it was also out of question to send them with their parents.\n\nWe accommodated them for the time being until we report the matter to the Department. As the school was already full to capacity I advised the Principal to enlarge the dormitories which enlargement should be completed by the first week in November.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa by the end of the Month and take the matter up with the Department, unless you would kindly bring the fact to the Department's attention, for which I would be very much obliged to you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

McGill, M.D., Deputy-Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nBooth Building - Ottawa - Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my visit to Albany Post non-catholic Indian families have requested me to admit their children in our Residential School. Though I was inclined to receive them on account of their destitution, I did not give any answer, inquiring if there is a departmental regulation objecting to such admittance.\n\nI would be very much pleased to hear from you in that connection, at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. E. Davidson\nSub-provincial\nOttawa, August 1, 1934.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you advise that you have received a request from non-Catholic Indian families to admit their children to the Albany Residential School.\n\nIf the children to whom you refer are pagans, the Department is prepared to consider their admission to the Albany School, provided application forms are properly completed and forwarded to the Department, through the office of the Indian Agent, Dr. Tyre. If, however, the children to whom you refer are recognized as members of the Anglican or United Church, the Department could not consent to their admission to the Albany School, in view of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Emile Gaindon, O.M.I.,\nMoosonee,\nE N T.\nDear Doctor,\n\nEnclosed herewith are the report forms for the past quarter which I trust are satisfactory. Mrs Joselyn carried on in my absence. Thus school was not closed.\n\nThere is a matter I wish to draw to your attention. Three of Henry Rubens' children have been taken into the school here (R.C. school). You will recall assuring me that you would not permit such a thing to go on. Therefore I wish you would drop Fr Bilodeau a letter telling him that we do not want this kind of thing to go on. The result of this case is that others tell me that they will put their children in the school too as they cannot keep them. Thus you see the schools are going to become an ideal place for parents to put children they cannot keep. Wonderful outlook for the future!!!! Last winter the priest spent all his spare time over here asking my people if they wanted to go into hospital. As your records will show you he had great success even if the dept had to foot the bill. This winter I suppose it is going to be \"open house\" for school children. At any rate I am fed up with the antics of the R.C. church here. They do as they like apparently. Anyway I am not sitting idly by now watching them get what children they can.\n\nPlease advise me will you that you have written Bilodeau & then I will proceed to take the children out. We had a similar case I am told in Dr Hamilton's time & he very promptly turned the children out & made it plain that such tactics would not be tolerated. They need another reminder apparently.\n\nI hear when in Moose you might have to make a trip through here but we have given up hope now but perhaps may see you this winter.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nR.A. Joselyn\n\nP.S. Should you come over you are quite welcome to stay with us. There is always a spare room. My wife sends kindest regards to Mr. Taylor.\nMoose Factory Oct 9th 1934\n\nDoctor McGill\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Rev. R.A. Joselyn of Albany, for your consideration and advise.\n\nAs you know the Department does not approve of Protestant children being taken into Catholic schools or Catholic children into Protestant schools and the Father at Albany knows this and that the Department will not pay a grant to them for that child if we know it; but there are some things to be considered\u20141-If the application form states on it that the family is R.C., have we any right to question that as the father of the child has signed the form. 2-Have we any right to say to the Mission that they must not take a child of another religion in to the school even if they do not ask for a grant for the child.\n\nYou may disregard the portion of the letter about the hospital, I am aware of what is going on and took the matter up when I was in Albany this summer, but it is a very hard thing to control when you are not on the spot.\n\nYou may keep the enclosed letter if you wish but I think it would be just as well to be on my file.\n\nThis is a personal letter but you may treat it as you think best.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Tyrer M.B.\nOttawa, October 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a letter received from Rev. R. A. Joselyn in connection with the admission of children to the Albany Indian Residential School.\n\nIn July, last, Rev. J. E. Saindon, O.M.I., wrote the Department stating that he had received a request for the admission of a number of non-Catholic Indian children to the Albany Residential School. In letter dated August 1st, the Department replied to Rev. Father Saindon as follows:\n\n\"I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you advise that you have received a request from non-Catholic Indian families to admit their children to the Albany Residential School.\n\nIf the children to whom you refer are pagans, the Department is prepared to consider their admission to the Albany School, provided application forms are properly completed and forwarded to the Department, through the office of the Indian Agent, Dr. Tyer. If, however, the children to whom you refer are recognised as members of the Anglican or United Church, the Department could not consent to their admission to the Albany School, in view of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act.\"\n\nThe Department has not received any applications for the admission of children to the Albany Residential School during the last six months and, consequently, we are not in a position to decide whether or not there are any children in the school who should not be there.\n\nWith reference to the second question contained in your recent letter, I may say that the Department does not approve of non-attending children residing in an Indian residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. L. Tyer, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nHorse Factory,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nNassau Factory Oct 18th 1934\n\nFather Gaimon\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a complaint from Rev. Mr. Jeylin of the Anglican Mission at Albany that the H.O. Residential School at that place is admitting Protestant children, special mention was made of the Reuben children. Will you please give me a report on this matter.\n\nI might add that the Department does not approve of non-Indian children residing in an Indian residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J.

Andrew\nMarguerite Sutherland Lucie Loutet\n\nIn comparing this return with the June quarter return, it is found that, on the June return, pupil #88 was shown as Raphael Okitikwurk, while the September return shows pupil #88 as Willie Sutherland. Please explain this.\n\nThe names of the under-mentioned children are shown on the September return but did not appear on the June return:\n\n#007-G. Okimawimi #095-L. Noah #49-L. Eirington\n#048-A.

Bilodeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nAlbany R. C. Indian Res. School,\nFort Albany,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\nThe Department regrets that the quarterly returns from the Albany Residential School do not appear to be very carefully prepared and, especially in the case of the September return, it is almost impossible to check it as compared with the June return.\n\nPlease note that a new number should be given each pupil on first entrance to the school and this number should be dropped whenever a pupil is discharged.\n\nThe figure \"O\" should appear before the number of each girl. For instance, the first girl on the return should be shown as \"016\".\n\nThe names of the girls with the lowest register numbers should appear first on the return and the higher numbers should follow in consecutive order.\n\nThe names of the girls and the boys should be shown on separate forms, not on the same form.\n\nThe Department would appreciate if the above directions are carefully carried out in future when the quarterly return is being prepared. You will note on the back of the return full instructions with regard to the preparation of these returns.\n\nThe discharge of the pupils mentioned on the admission & discharge form is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The name of Alexandra Wesley, No. 0152, is not on the return for the quarter ended September, 1939, as you say. Looking through our records, we found this mistake; her name was written with the No. 0156 and so it should appear on that September return by mistake; the numbers were changed from 0152 to 0156. If really that name does not appear at all with any number, it was forgotten; the girl is still in the Albany Residential School, and her name will appear on the next return with the No. 0152. You would oblige me if you could let me know whether her name was on the September return with No. 0156, or not at all.\n\nNo. 071 M. Theresa Scott, No. 0116 Caroline Jakasum\n= 072 Louise P. Martin = 80 Sapier Wesley\n= 0105 Angele R. Martin\n\nThe above mentioned children have been absent from the school for some time and were readmitted last summer. The explanation is this: the James Bay West coast Indians are generally weak; and their children cannot stand more than three years the indoor life of the school at once. So after such a period of time, we allow them to go into the bush for a year or two; and then, if they are not above the age allowed by the Department, they come back.\nOtherwise, it would do them some harm.\n\nI have not sent to the Department the application forms for the new pupils, last summer, because we lost them in the fire of the school. I am sending you some new ones which cannot be signed by the parents who are away in the bush.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPaul Langlois\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo I may say that Alexandra Wesley was shown on the September return as No. 0156 and grant was allowed for her for 92 days. Her correct register number is No. 0158 which, of course, should appear on future returns during her period of residence. The admission of the under-mentioned children is approved:\n\nNoah Edward Joe Jacason\nRachel Sutherland Louise Nakotchi\nSimeon Speese Anna Aitel\nGabriel Sutherland Angelina\nAntoine Wisk Marie Therese Okitiko\nPiten Wabano Moni Wisk\n\nThe March quarter return from the Albany School showed Anna Wesley, No. 091, and Cecilia Wisk, No. 0131, to be 16 years of age. These pupils may remain in the school until the end of the current academic year, namely, June 30 next, but must not be kept after that date unless the permission of the Department is obtained.\n\nThe ages of pupils numbered 0158, 0155, 0153, 0157, 0188 and 0159 are not shown on the return. If any of these are 16 years of age by June 30, 1940, they should be discharged unless you apply and obtain the Department's approval for keeping them for a longer period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. P. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nAlbany Residential School,\nFort Albany,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 1, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe names of Anna Aitel, No. 0182, and Sapier Wesley, No. 80, were shown on the March quarter return of the Albany Residential School but do not appear on the June quarter return although no application has been received for their discharge. Please advise regarding the above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. P. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nAlbany Residential School,\nFort Albany,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nThe Dept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAgnes Job, an Indian widow of Moose Factory Band, a member of your Church, has placed her boy, just 5 years old, at the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Albany in direct disobedience to advice given her. She wanted to send this boy to the Chaplean Boarding School in the idea that our Boarding School at Moose was filled to capacity, but it was not necessary that it be. Moose was filled to capacity, but it was not necessary that it should go to Chaplean because he could very conveniently attend the day school at his home in Moose, and she was told by the head master, Moose and by an local missionary,\n\nIt is subversive of all discipline and, of course, is also against the regulations of your Department that no Protestant child can be admitted to a Roman Catholic School and vice versa. There is also the consideration that if this boy were sent to Chaplean, it would add to the expense of your Department as well as to your church for travelling and other needs.\n\nI therefore protest against the admission of that boy to the Albany Roman Catholic Boarding School, and request that he be sent home.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nOttawa, September 5, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, in which you state you have been informed that Agnes Job has placed her 5-year-old son in the Albany Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have no correspondence on our file indicating that this has been done. However, the Reverend Principal of the Albany School is being written and advised that if the boy has been placed in the school he should be returned to his mother.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nBishopsthorpe,\nCochrane, Ont.\nOttawa, September 5, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to the Department's attention that Agnes Job, an Indian widow of the Moose Factory Band, and a member of the Church of England, has placed her 5-year-old boy in the Albany Residential School.\n\nIf this woman has done so, it would be appreciated if you would arrange for returning the boy to her immediately. He is not eligible for admission to the Albany School. Please let me hear from you as soon as you have carried out the instructions contained in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A.

Apost. of James Bay\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI am very much worried over a report that has just been received from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It appears that three pupils truanted from the Albany Indian Residential School last April and are presumably drowned.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. Police consider they should have been notified sooner, but it is doubtful if they could have done much in the matter at that time, in view of weather conditions. However, the Department should have been notified immediately. Any unusual event at a school, especially when the results are fatal, should be immediately brought to the Department's attention.\n\nWhile I realize that there are difficulties that would be encountered, at the same time it is felt that a more determined effort should have been made by the Principal and staff to locate these boys. This whole happening is likely to have a very disturbing effect on the Indians and will naturally react on the school. I feel it advisable to recommend to you that very strict instructions be issued to the Principals of the residential schools in your diocese, to the effect that when any pupil truants from the school immediate and effective efforts should be made to locate the pupil.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ont.\nThese two pupils were shown on March 1st, but not on June Return, no correspondence or discharge.\n\n132.

The reason is that the mother is not doing her part to help in keeping the boy in the school. That boy did not want to accept any remark from the sister. So one day, he started to fight with another boy; the sister stopped them and told Solomon who had begun not to do it any more. He did not like it and quit the school. I went to his home and took him back to the school; I had been waiting to see if the mother would send him back herself; but she did not.\n\nA few days after again, he was not doing well in the refectory and the sister told him to keep quiet; but he refused and when he was outside for recreation, he quit again. I waited, but the mother did retain him. So I let him out. That boy has changed very much in his character during the year he spent in the bush.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

Though they are both overage, I am sending a word to ask you if you could not recommend their admission for one year in the school, as they were never in school before. They are both attending class since a month and they are doing fine. Annie Okimawinew's parents are spending the winter at Lake River and Frances Noah's parent probably left Attawapiskat now for the bush.\n\nHoping these applications will receive favorable attentions from the department, I thank you very much.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD.) J. Laguerrier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI returned, on Sept. 27th., two applications for admission to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Albany; one for Frances Noah who is 18 years and 2 mos., and one for Annie Hockemawillillene who is 16 years and 7 months, as being overage. I asked the Principal of this school to submit a report as to why they should be admitted and if there was any special reason for his recommendation.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of the Principal's reply in this regard for your information and consideration.\n\nMay I please be advised if you approve of the admission of these two overage pupils into the Residential School at Albany. Frances Noah was born 15 July, 1931 and Annie Hockemawillillene was born 18 Feb. 1933.\n\nJ.S.

As we receive the first winter Mail only yesterday by the plane, please excuse me for being so late in sending the Return.\n\nAs for your other observation about the register Numbers, I want to say that in the past we were giving the same number to a pupil that was coming back to the school after having been away for a year or two as it has been the case in this Return. Should we continue or should we give new numbers to those who having been discharged in the past, are coming back to school?\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nJules Leguerrier, O.M.L.\nPrincipal\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Admission | Band |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|\n|     |      |                  |      |\n\n### SCHOOL DURING\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Discharge | Band |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|\n|     |      |                  |      |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Discharge | Band |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|\n|     |      |                  |      |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**RECEIVED**\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT WELLSVILLE\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Admission | Band |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|\n|     |      |                  |      |\n\n### SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 19\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Admission | Band |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|\n|     |      |                  |      |\n\n### NAME OF PARENTS AND ADDRESS OF FAMILY\n\n| No. | Name | Address |\n|-----|------|---------|\n|     |      |         |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name | Date of Discharge | Reason |\n|-----|------|------------------|--------|\n|     |      |                  |        |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\nJanuary 27, 1951\n\nMr. J.S.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThe applications state that the religious denomination is Roman Catholic. Superintendent J.S. Allan has approved these applications by signing them and by so doing verified the accuracy of the information shown thereon.\n\nOn receipt of these applications the Superintendent of Education advised Mr. Allan approving the admission of the two children to the Albany Indian Residential School. The two children were admitted to the Albany school on September 20th.\n\nOn March 29th we received a telegram from Bishop Neville R. Clarke reading as follows:\n\n\"Reverend Elliott of Albany advises Two Children of Joel Wesley Albany 293 Anglicans Are Enrolled in the Roman Catholic Residential School at Albany Please Arrange Discharge or Transfer to Moose Fort School\"\n\nOn March 27th Right Reverend Neville R. Clarke confirmed his telegram with a letter a copy of which is attached.\n\nOn receipt of Bishop Clarke's protest the matter was immediately referred to Mr. Allan and he was requested to report fully on this situation.\n\nWe have now received a reply from Mr. Allan which reads as follows:\n\n\"I am in receipt of a letter from Bishop N.R. Clarke re the admission of George Wesley and Bertie Andrew Wesley into the R.C. Residential School at Albany.\n\nThis is the case of a mixed marriage, the father being Anglican and the mother Roman Catholic. According to the Indian Act the admission can be signed by either parent and according to the Roman Catholic Church, here, the children of mixed marriages are considered as belonging to their faith. I cannot recall who signed the application for admission but as this application was signed there is not much that can be done from this end in the form of a protest and I am afraid we do not have the answer to these problems at this end\".\n\nIt would be appreciated if a ruling were given on these applications.\n\nDirector.\n| No. | Name          | Periods in the School | State of Education | Trade or Industry Training | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n|     |               |                       |                    |                           |                       |\n\nOne or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\n\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nFebruary 6, 1952.\n\nMr. J.S.

However, these instances were outside of my diocese and I could make no official protest, but in the case of the Wesley children I most certainly do.\n\nThere is no question that Joel Wesley, the father of the children was encouraged by some member of the Roman Mission staff. I know my people well enough to know that he would not suddenly pick up his children and take them over to the school at the Roman Mission without previous encouragement or discussion. I feel that the opportunity of Rev. Elliott's absence was taken advantage of.\n\nI am well aware, that it is not your desire to have these unpleasant instances occur, nor do I derive pleasure in submitting them to you, but they have to be dealt with.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nRt. Rev. Neville R. Clarke, D.D.\nSt. Thomas Church\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSupt. Education, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have to hand a letter from Rev. C. Elliott at Albany, which informs me that, during his absence this fall, two of our children were recruited by the Principal of the Roman Catholic Residential School at Albany and were admitted and are at present enrolled. I wish to lodge a protest against such action.\n\nThe new Indian Act is not as definite as the old one in this matter, and section 117 is quite ambiguous. However the action of the Principal at Albany establishes a precedent, which I wonder whether you will be willing to accept. Children can be recruited wherever we may find them, as long as we get a signature of one parent? I am also interested to know which parent should sign?\n\nI see another problem arising from this action. There is at present in this area a Pentecostal Assembly; or I believe, the other name they go by is Jehovah Witness; missionary working out of Hearst. He has a personal aeroplane, (a luxury neither I nor the Roman Bishop can afford, evidently.) He has visited Moose and up both coasts of the Bay as far as Teensuk, and Fort George. Also at inland posts of Mr. Swartman's area. If section 117 stands as the Roman Principal has interpreted it; then you will back this man if he desires to establish\nApril 22, 1952\n\nMemorandum for Deputy Minister\n\nAttached are applications for the admission of Andrew Wesley age seven and George Wesley age ten of the Albany Band in the Province of Ontario to the Albany (R.C.) Indian Residential School.\n\nThe applications state that the religious denomination is Roman Catholic. Indian Superintendent J.S. Allan has approved these applications by signing them and by so doing verified the accuracy of the information shown thereto.\n\nOn receipt of these applications the Superintendent of Education advised Mr. Allan approving the admission of the two children to the Albany Indian Residential School. The two children were admitted to the Albany school on September 20.\n\nOn March 29th we received a telegram from Bishop Neville R. Clarke reading as follows:\n\n\"Reverend Elliott of Albany Advises Two Children of Joel Wesley Albany 293 Anglicans Are Enrolled in the Roman Catholic Residential School at Albany Please Arrange Discharge of Transfer to Moose Fort School\"\n\nOn March 27th Right Reverend Neville R. Clarke confirmed his telegram with a letter a copy of which is attached.\n\nOn receipt of Bishop Clarke's protest the matter was immediately referred to Mr. Allan and he was requested to report fully on this situation.\n\nWe have now received a reply from Mr. Allan which reads as follows:\n\n\"I am in receipt of a letter from Bishop N.R.

According to the Indian Act the admission can be signed by either parent and according to the Roman Catholic Church, here, the children of mixed marriages are considered as belonging to their faith.\"\n\nRecently the Right Reverend Neville Clarke telephoned the Director and stated to him that Joel Wesley has been married three times - that his first wife was a Roman Catholic but the second and third wives were members of the Church of England. He also advised Major MacKay that the two boys are children of Joel Wesley's second marriage and that Wesley himself has always been recognised as a member of the Church of England.\nBishop Clarke's information regarding Joel Wesley's second wife, who was the mother of the boys, is different from your statement that it was a mixed marriage.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make further inquiries regarding this matter and let us hear from you at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am now in receipt of information with regard to the admission of Joel Wesley's children into the Albany Indian Roman Catholic Residential School.\n\nInformation received from Church records is as follows:\n\n\"Joel Wesley married Christiana Rickard, 22 July 1925, both Anglican.

It would be appreciated if you would look into the matter again and advise when Joseph Mark returned to the Albany Residential School.\n\nIn order to avoid delaying the Per Capita Grant payment to the school we have disallowed any grant for this pupil on the June Return.

Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Albany Indian Residential School, please advise the Principal that we have allowed 146 days grant for pupil # 195. This is the pupil for whom we disallowed grant on the June Quarterly Return.\n\nAs we have not received the necessary applications for admission for pupils # 219, 0336, 0337, 0341 and 0343 we have disallowed the Per Capita Grant claimed for them. When the necessary applications are received and the admissions approved the Principal may claim retroactive grant for these children on the December Return.\n\nAs the admission of Alice George to the Albany school has not been approved we have disallowed the grant claimed for her.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following:\n\n| # 154 | # 185 | # 200 | # 0171 | # 0225 |\n|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 175   | 187   | 201   | 0196   | 0230   |\n| 176   | 189   | 206   | 0216   | 0234   |\n| 183   | 195   | 207   | 0215   | 0239   |\n| 184   | 197   | 208   | 0219   | 0257   |\n| 0258  | 0267  | 0281  | 0295   | 0306   |\n| 0307  | 0310  | 0323  | 0299   |        |\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 13, 1952\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 3rd regarding the admission of Charlotte Kibokse and Emilda Okitiko to the Albany Indian Residential School, it is noted that the first girl is seventeen years of age and the latter twenty years of age.\n\nYour letter is not clear as to why you consider that institutional care is required for these girls. It would be appreciated if you would obtain more information as to the reason why these girls can not obtain employment rather than attend school. It can be readily understood that as these girls have never attended school they would not adapt themselves to classroom activities as it would be necessary for the teacher to place them with a group of youngsters who are taking Grade 1. We are disallowing the Per Capita Grant claimed for these girls on the September Return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 15, 1951\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt.

The fact that the children will remain in the school for one year does not enter into the matter.\n\nPlease advise the Principal in this regard instructing him that he should not include these children's names on future quarterly returns as the Department will not allow per capita grant for them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 16, 1952.\n\nRight Reverend H.

Indian Residential School, you are advised that it will be necessary for you to arrange to have an application for admission and physical examination for this girl completed.\n\nWhen this has been done, this form should be forwarded to Indian Superintendent J.S. Allan for necessary action.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nNaomi George, an Indian widow of Richmond Gulf, and a patient now hospitalized at Moosonee, was officially received into the Roman Catholic Church on October 30th, 1950.\n\nThe undersigned received her Profession of faith and abjuration, in presence of two witnesses, and entered same in the register of the Roman Catholic Mission of Moosonee.\n\nMr. J.S. Allan, Superintendent of the Moose Factory Indian Agency, has been officially notified and it was requested of him that he enter her name in his books as that of a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nNaomi George has a daughter who is a pupil of the Anglican Residential School at Fort George. That daughter of hers now being about eight years old, she wishes her to be admitted into the R.C. Residential School operated by the Grey Nuns at the same post. She has signed an Application to that effect, and this Application was given to Mr. Allan, with a letter of explanation also signed by herself.\n\nShe would like her daughter to come and pay her a visit at Moosonee. Transportation on one of the R.C. Mission boats can be arranged, from Fort George and back, before the opening of School in September.\n\nWe are taking up this matter with Mr. Allan; in view of giving the Department an accurate description of the case, I thought it advisable to write you these few lines.\n\nWith thanks and kind regards,\n\nYours truly in Christ,\n\n+ Henri Belleau\nCOPY\n\nSt. Thomas Church\nMoose Factory\nOntario\n\nAugust 13, 1952.\n\nThe Right Hon. Walter E. Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI have asked my good friend and compatriot, Canon H.G. Cook of the Indian School Administration, Ottawa, to lodge a protest in my name regarding the petition of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Moosonee to have one of our Anglican children placed in the Roman Catholic School at Fort George.\n\nThis case is a very lengthy one, and Supt. J.S. Allen is submitting a full report to Dr. MacKay Director of Indian Affairs Branch. You will be able to obtain all the details there.\n\nHowever I will give you a short resume of the case. The mother Naomi George was hospitalized with a T.B. in 1949 being brought down from Fort George. She was put in the R.C. hospital over my strong objections as one of the reasons for her leaving as the request of her people to do so to avoid the pressure being put on her at Fort George. In April 1950 she wrote asking that she be moved to the Anglican hospital owing to proselytizing by the R.C. priest. I contacted Dr. E.P. Moore and an investigation was ordered. My claims were substantiated and the woman was ordered moved, but as the local doctor gave her such a short time to live, it was decided to leave her there. She has outlived medical prophecy, and is still alive, and has been converted, as I maintain under pressure.\n\nNow this woman is not mentally nor physically normal, she has been under the influence drugs for the medical two years her condition is so serious.\nThe petition is made by the Roman Bishop under section 117 of the Indian Act. This I feel cannot be considered owing to the mother's condition. Also the child ten years of age is at present being detained against her will. She entered the hospital in company with the Principal Canon H.S. Shepherd of our school, for the sole purpose of visiting her mother. The request being made by Sister Roland that, the child be allowed to visit her mother who is on her death bed, a very unpleasant scene occurred as reported by Canon Shepherd and the child was returned.\n\nThe Church of England closed its hospitals on James Bay to co-operate with the Govt. and assist in making the Govt. hospital at Moose-Factory a real asset. The Romans took the exact opposite course, and today a building new hospitals. So we cannot be expected to accept such actions as the above without protest.\n\nTrusting this will receive your attention, and thanking you for your kindness,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\"Neville R.

James Bay Agency,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Allan:\n\nThe attached letter was sent to Charlotte Thom, who is in Bishop Newnham Hospital at Moose Factory; the contents to be translated and given to me. It is written by Mrs. Daisy Acheenayee who is at present hospitalized in the Hospital of Le Assumption at Moosonee. The contents of this letter speaks for itself, as you will find upon having it translated, that this woman is objecting strongly to the pressure that is being put upon her by the local Priests of the Church of Rome, to change her religion from Anglican to Roman Catholic.\n\nI wish to register on behalf of my parishioners very strong protest against this practice. I know that your Department do not agree with such practices being indulged in by any religious group.\n\nAs the resident Indian Health Service Doctor is not on the Island, may I suggest that you take this matter up with Dr. Cronk, the Doctor who is relieving him at present, and ascertain whether or not this woman is receiving medical treatment that cannot be given here in the Bishop Newnham Hospital. If this woman can be treated equally as well in the Bishop Newnham Hospital I ask that she be removed there immediately.\n\nAnother patient Naomi George of Fort George who is also hospitalized at Moosonee, complains verbally of similar treatment, and I wish that her case be considered at the same time and similar action taken.\n\nThe effects of such practices as mentioned above are very far reaching and I am appealing to you for the consideration of this matter, rather than take the step which I would be obligated to as Archdeacon of Moosonee, by the Canon Law of the Church of England in Canada; that is to submit this as a brief to the College of Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario for their judgement and action.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) Neville R. Clarke\n\nVen. Neville R. Clarke, L.Th., D.D.\nApril 3rd 1950\nMoosonee, Ont.\n\nTo Mr. Clark\n\nI would like to tell you all of what this woman by the name of Daisy Echeena told me when I go to visit her in the Hospital.\n\nShe says she isn't at all happy in that Roman Catholic hospital in that case because one of them Sisters there, always talk to her about their religion. Meaning that she should turn to it. And had told her once already that there will soon be some body coming to Baptize her and turn her to a Roman Catholic. And also I think you gave her some kind of a book, I mean a prayer book or else a Baptism card, for her infant son. She said she had layed it under her pillow and that was when she last seen it. And she thinks this Sister must have taken it. Because this Sister always says things to her.\n\nAt one time I was visiting her on a Sunday evening, she told me she had been crying because of this. She told me, she couldn't tell every thing what this Sister had said to her.\n\nI'm sure if I was in her place and if I couldn't speak a word of English and couldn't understand I'd feel the same way as she dose. Isn't that because she is my cousin, but I'd feel the same way for anybody else. But I know it's not a very nice to do that to anybody. And I feel very sorry for her and hope that this won't go on any further. Because it doesn't at all make her happy.\n\nThe same ting happened to her when she was in the Fort George Hospital. She had also told me about that.\n\nShe had also said that she never had a chance to talk to you about this whenever you were visiting her in the hospital, because she never had anyone to talk for her.\n\nI had a chance to tell you all this lot of times; but then I used to wonder if I should or not and I'm glad now that I've told you in this letter what all she told me. And hope & pray that there will be something done about it.\n\nI will now bring my letter to an end.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Mrs. Daisy Hester.\nMarch 26, 1950\n\nTranslation\n\nI am writing to you Anne. I want to tell you I was told they wouldn't give me anything or for my child to wear. Try and see where I could get things from to wear when we get out of here.\n\nTell the Doctor I don't like staying over here. Tell him I would like to go out now. I don't like staying here because they don't do what the Doctor says.\n\nHe said I could walk around now. But they didn't let me do that. They really don't want to treat me right.\n\nHurry and tell the Doctor so they won't fool me when I was told I could go out now. I don't like staying here. So you will tell the Doctor for me.\n\n(Sgd.) Daisy Atsynia.\nMoose Factory, Ont., August 12, 1952\n\nThe Superintendent,\nJames Bay Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Alice George\n\nSometime in July, last month, I received a letter from Father Couture at Fort George regarding the above mentioned Alice George, then in residence in our School at Fort George, requesting that she be allowed to go to Moosonee on their boat to visit her mother who was ill in their hospital and not expected to live. I answered this letter stating that if he would give me a promise that Alice would be returned to our school at Fort George before the date of school opening in August, that I would allow her to go. He did not give me any such promise and Alice did not go.\n\nSometime after, I had a letter from Sister Rollande at Fort George saying that she had promised to bring Alice from Fort George to Moosonee and would I please see that Alice was put on the plane with Sister Rollande. I asked the same promise of Sister Rollande as of Father Couture and Sister Rollande would give me no promise that Alice would be returned to Fort George. I refused to allow Alice to go with Sister Rollande.\n\nI told Sister Rollande that since I was then about to move from Fort George to the Bishop Gordon Memorial School at Moose Factory, that I would get in touch with the Indian Agent at Moose Factory and if he, Mr. Allan, would authorize it, I would bring Alice with me to Moose Factory and take her myself to visit her mother. The Indian Agent gave permission and I brought Alice to Moose Factory on Saturday, August 9th, 1952.\n\nYesterday, August 11th, I took Alice to visit her mother at the Roman Catholic Hospital Moosonee. I had with me besides Alice, an interpreter, because I wanted to be clearly understood by Naomi, Alice's mother, who is a Cree Indian and understands no English, and further I wanted to know exactly what Naomi had to say.\nWe were admitted to the Hospital, but asked to wait for some considerable time before being allowed to see Naomi George, Alice's mother. When we were admitted to the patient's room, which contained one other patient besides Naomi George, Father Couture of Fort George, another Priest, possibly resident at Moosonee, and two sisters were in the room and remained there for as long as I stayed.\n\nAfter Alice had had a reasonable length of time with her mother, I explained to Naomi through my interpreter, that I would have to take Alice back to Moose Factory, but that I would bring Alice again to see her and possibly several times before I needed to take her back to our school at Fort George. I then asked Alice to come, which she proceeded to do, without any hesitation. Alice was then caught by her mother and there ensued a most unpleasant scene of Alice trying to free herself to get to me and her mother trying to restrain her. It would have been easy to have forced Alice from her mother, who is a person very ill, but that I would not do. No force was exerted by anyone except that of Alice trying to free herself from her mother and her mother's effort to restrain her. All the time Alice was crying violently. After some minutes, I decided it was inhuman to allow the struggle to continue and so I left Alice, much to her distress, but with the promise, that I would not forget her but would see that the right things was done concerning her.\n\nNaomi George was a member of the Church of England when Alice was placed in the school at Fort George. At the time of the proposed visit Alice had no clear remembrance of her mother, nor any desire to see her. Alice is now ten years of age and has spent four year's in our school at Fort George, a member of our happy school family, quite content and making excellent progress. It was quite clear that the child was greatly distressed yesterday by being kept away from me, and that the child's desire and happiness would be to return to me and to my care.\n\nI would recommend that Alice be placed back in my care, be kept at Moose Factory, if Alice desires it, and allowed to visit her mother under normal and happily conditions, for the period Naomi might yet live and at the end of that time, return to her people and home environment at Fort George.\n\nFaithfully submitted,\n\n(SGD.) H.S.Shepherd\nSt. Thomas Church\nMoose Factory, Ont.\nAug. 7, 1952\n\nMr. J.S. Allan\nSupt., James Bay Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Allan:\n\nRev. T. Masson brought a matter to mine attention on my return from up the coast. Alice George from the Anglican residential school at Fort George is at present in Moosonee. She is visiting her mother who has been in the R.C. Hospital at Moosonee for more than two years. It appears that Mr. Masson who was acting upon a request from Canon Shepherd of the Anglican School at Fort George to look after this girl, by virtue of a wire sgd. H.S. Shepherd, dated 29/7/52, was refused the privilege of even seeing the girl in a pastoral capacity. Also I am informed application has been made to have this girl transferred to the R.C. School at Fort George under Sec. 117 of the Indian Act.\n\nAlthough you are well acquainted with the facts I will review them briefly. Naomi George was brought from Fort George by Dr. B. H. Harper, and was placed at Moosonee instead of in the Bishop Newnham Hospital at Moose Factory upon the direction of Dr. Harper who claimed an over-crowded condition existed in our hospital. Objections were made to you, but you rightly felt you could do little against medical advice. Naomi George xxx herself at that time expressed a desire to remain with her own people. As this was the definite wish of her husband now deceased.\n\nIn the winter of 49-50 I noticed evidences of proselytizing and along with letters from Daisy Ackynia, made request that in view of such evidences they be removed.\n\nDaisy was transferred over to Moose Factory but again it was stated by Dr. Harper that moving Naomi might bring about her death. Later in the year along with the Rev. Wm. H. Thompson I visited the R.C. hospital where we were told she had turned to the Church of Rome. I immediately telephoned Dr. E.P. Moore who was in conference with Mr. F. Matters in North Bay, an immediate investigation was promised. Rev. Thompson visited Naomi all signs of her turning had vanished and she received Communion.\n\nNow this woman has been at death's door ever since she came down from Fort George, and I leave it up to medical evidence whether or not she was entirely of a healthy mind and body. You have the evidences of Daisy's claims to whether there was any pressure being applied.\nI would suggest that, though this child nor this mother be deprived of what little consolation remains for the mother in life. This should not be allowed to be another opportunity for proselytizing. I don't think in Canada, in our wildest imaginations can we find justifications for such actions.\n\nI feel that if you find it impossible to deal with this, and I thank you for your previous fairness and considerations. The only course is to have this dealt with at the Meetings of the House of Bishops meeting in London and give it a public airing.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Sgd.) Neville R. Clarke\nRt. Rev. Neville R.

George telling us that Alice George, schoolgirl from the Anglican school and daughter of Naomi George, formerly Anglican and now Roman Catholic and a seriously ill patient at the RC hospital here was due her visit today. We have her mother on the RC boat. He asked that I arrange to have her boarded and sheltered at the Bishop Horden school until the boat returned.\n\nThis evening I called Fr. Houle but he insists on keeping her there, apparently on the grounds that she is \"her mother's child\".\n\nCan you tell me if the girl's father is alive and if he is an Anglican, and whether the RC's have legal grounds for their claim? If not, I would appreciate it if you would, in your capacity of Indian Agent, restrain Fr. Houle from keeping the child at the RC hospital.\n\nThis kind of thing is disagreeable and I have to bother you with it, but I have found it more difficult to maintain any really cordial relationship with Fr. Houle\u2014though this is not true with any others at the RC mission.\n\nYour co-operation in this matter will be greatly appreciated. I only hope that the mother's deathbed and the child's sorrow are not disturbed and increased by this dispute.\n\nP.S. Fr. Houle was unable to say the day their boat will arrive\u2014\"depends on the weather\"  \n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Thomas H. Masson  \nThe Reverend  \nThomas H.

Allan, Superintendent of the Moose Factory Indian Agency, has been officially notified and it was requested of him that he enter her name in his books as that of a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nNaomi George has a daughter who is a pupil of the Anglican Residential School at Fort George. That daughter of hers now being about eight years old, she wishes her to be admitted into the R.C. Residential School operated by the Grey Nuns at the same post. She has signed an application to that effect, and this Application was given to Mr. Allan, with a letter of explanation also signed by herself.\n\nShe would like her daughter to come and pay her a visit at Moosonee. Transportation on one of the R.C. Mission boats can be arranged, from Fort George and back, before the opening of School in September.\n\nWe are taking up this matter with Mr. Allan; in view of giving the Department an accurate description of the case,, I thought it advisable to write you these few lines.\n\nWith thanks and kind regards,\n\nYours truly in Christ,\n\n(Sgd.) Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rt. Rev. N.R. Clarke, Suffragan Bishop of Moosonee, copy of which is attached, protesting against the conversion of Naomi George to the Roman Catholic Faith and the entrance of the daughter to the Roman Catholic Residential School at Fort George.\n\nBishop Clarke called at my office and discussed the matter with me at length, protesting, most bitterly against the method of forceful actions of the Priests and nurses towards adherents of the Anglican Faith who are admitted into Roman Catholic Institutions in this Agency.\n\nThere are two cases to which Bishop Clarke makes special reference, viz., Daisy Atsynia, Old Factory Band No. 69 and Naomi George, Great Whale Band No. 8. Protest was made by him to me during the winter of 1949.\n\nI will take each case separately and will deal with Naomi George, and without favoring either, I will describe her case since this matter was first drawn to my attention, without judgment or favor.\n\nDuring the summer of 1949, I was visiting the Roman Catholic Hospital at Fort George, and was in semi-private room in which Naomi George was a patient. She requested Bishop Belleau, Vicar Apostolic of James Bay to interpret on her behalf. She explained, through his Excellency, that she was doing well and as I was going through to Richmond Gulf, she would be glad if I would bring her daughter back with me to Fort George for a visit and place her in school where she would be near her.\nDuring my stay at Richmond Gulf, I called upon the family of Naomi George, conveying her message, and the suggestion of moving the child to Fort George was violently protested on the grounds that they had received word from her mother that the people in the Hospital were interfering with her religion. They demanded that Naomi be removed from the Hospital at Fort George and be transferred to Nursing Station at that point. Dr. Simpson, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, was at Fort George upon my return and the reported proselytizing, of which there was no evidence, was discussed. The question of transferring this woman to the Nursing Station was also considered, but due to the fact that this building was much overcrowded the idea was abandoned. It was then decided that she be moved to Moose Factory during the winter.\n\nIn the early part of the month of March, 1950, this woman along with Daisy Atsynia, Old Factory Band No. 69 was transferred to Moosonee and complaints were being registered within one month of admission to the R.C. Mission Hospital at Moosonee, to the then Ven. N.R. Clarke. First complaint was registered April 3rd, by Daisy Hester, cousin of Daisy Atsynia and this continued until I transferred this woman to Bishop Newham Hospital 24th May, 1950. This transfer was in full agreement with Bishop Belleau, who expressed the desire that anyone who was not happy in the hospital, it would be in their own interests to have them removed.\n\nThe case of Naomi George was thoroughly discussed with Dr. Cronk, who, due to her critical condition, advised against moving her. She required special care and treatment which could not be rendered in the Bishop Newham Hospital. Her condition was also discussed with Archdeacon Clarke, who had no other wish than that she have her last few days in peace and agreed that she remain where she was.\n\nFor your information and perusal, I am attaching copies of all letters from this file.\n\nDuring the month of April this case was thoroughly discussed with Mr. Matters, Regional Supervisor in North Bay, who took the file through to Ottawa for discussion.\n\nThis case has again burst forth with very strong protests from the Rt. Rev. N.R. Clarke, Anglican Bishop of Moosonee, upon the proposed transfer of Alice George, daughter of Naomi, (who I am informed was received into the Roman Catholic Church on October 30, 1950, the ceremony has been registered at the Roman Catholic Mission, Moosonee,) being transferred to Fort George R.C. School.\nI am attaching copies of all correspondence for your own information and judgment and will appreciate having your comments and direction with regard to the two children of Naomi George, viz., Charlotte and Alice.\n\nDue to the dispute regarding the admission of this child into the Roman Catholic School, and religious denomination not being shown, Form No. I-A406, has not been completed. Bishop Beilieu advises that child Alice George has been admitted to the R.C. Indian Residential School at Fort Albany which is in full agreement with the mother.\n\nJ.S.

Clarke, D.D., Suffragan Bishop of Moosonee, regarding Alice George, daughter of Naomi George a member of the Great Whale River Band, James Bay Indian Agency.\n\nSuperintendent Allan's report has been read together with the attached correspondence. It would appear from this report that Naomi George would have been received into the Roman Catholic Church on October 30, 1950, but that her daughter Alice has remained in the Anglican Residential school up to now. It will certainly be necessary to have a more complete investigation of the statement made on presslytiming in the Roman Catholic hospital. I would like to discuss this matter further with you before leaving on my Western trip.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is no doubt that additional investigation will have to be made, which may take some time, and as the child has always been at the Anglican Residential school pending investigation she should remain or return to that school. In reaching this decision I am taking into consideration the fact that the child has been raised away from her mother, and the only friends she has are those she met at the residential school.\n\nWill you please have an interim reply prepared for the Minister's signature to Right Reverend Clarke's letter.

As Bishop Belleau states, and you also mentioned by telephone this morning, you and Mr. Phelan received him last Friday and discussed this case. In this letter he makes no promise that Miss George will be returned to the Fort George School pending a decision.\n\nThe Minister has not been able to see Miss George since her return from hospital. I had an opportunity to see her today and she appeared to be recovering well.\n\nMiss George, daughter of Major Allen, Church of England have been in touch with me regarding this matter. I am fully aware that the Agency, Mr. J.S. Allen, has been following pertinent information;\n\n1 - Mrs Naomi George, a widow, of Richmond Hill, P.Q., formerly adhering to the Church of England, has made her Profession of Faith in the Roman Catholic Church during the fall of 1950.\n\n2 - Before Mrs. George made her Profession of Faith, I notified Mr. Allan of her considerate decision to enter the Catholic Church. She had previously requested several months before her admittance into the Church, and she was given ample time to weigh her decision; she was further advised by us that the step she was undertaking would be decisive and final.\n\n2...\nThe Honourable W.E. Harris,\nMinister,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nWoods Building\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nWhile in Ottawa last Friday, I had an interview with Major D.M. MacKay, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, together with Mr. Philip Phelan, Director of Education, and Reverend Andre Renaud, O.M.I., Superintendent of our Welfare Commission.\n\nThe case of Alice George, daughter of Naomi George, has been brought to my attention by Major MacKay. While the officials of the Church of England have already presented their case to you, I am fully aware that your superintendent for the James Bay Agency, Mr. J.S. Allen, has not forwarded to Major MacKay the following pertinent information;\n\n1 - Mrs Naomi George, a widow, of Richmond Gulf, P.Q., formerly adhering to the Church of England, has made her Profession of Faith in the Roman Catholic Church during the fall of 1950.\n\n2 - Before Mrs. George made her Profession of Faith, I notified Mr. Allen of her considerate decision to enter the Catholic Church. She had previously requested, several months before, her admittance into the Church, and she was given ample time to weigh her decision; she was further advised by us that the step she was undertaking would be decisive and final.\nSoon after her admission into the Church in 1950, I advised Mr. Allen verbally. In February 1952, Mrs. Naomi George signed the usual Application Form for admission of her daughter Alice, age 10, to the Roman Catholic Residential School at Fort George, P.Q. This application was shown to Mr. Allen with this comment: \"When the school year is ended, I shall request that Alice's admission to the Roman Catholic School be approved by the Department.\" At that time, Mr. Allen expressed a view that Alice's admission would be approved by the Department.\n\nI then gave official notice by letter, of Mrs. George's admission into the Church to Mr. Allen, (July 1952).\n\nI also wish to state that I had previously requested that Mr. Allen make provision for Alice to come from Fort George to see her mother at the Moosonee Hospital. He answered that he would notify the Very Reverend Canon Shepherd, by radio. Canon Shepherd brought Alice to Moosonee in August 1952; while Alice visited her mother, Mrs. George decided to request the admission of her daughter to Fort Albany R.C. School, instead of the Fort George R.C. The Application Form was amended accordingly and given to Mr. Allen for his signature.\n\nMr. Allen forwarded this application, however, without his signature to Mr. Phelan, who returned it to him; Mr. Phelan states that Mr. Allen had not as yet re-sent the form back to Ottawa. Meanwhile, we decided to send Alice to Fort Albany R.C. School.\n\nThen on September 19th, your Department sent a wire to Mr. Allen ordering the return of Alice to the Fort George Church of England School, pending an investigation and a final decision on the case.\n\nI regret that the required information on Alice's case has not yet been transmitted to the Department by Mr. Allen. Had you been informed of all the pertinent facts, this present situation would not have arisen.\nI feel that Mrs. George's right to have her daughter Alice, educated in a Roman Catholic School is clear, according to Section 117 of the Indian Act.\n\nBegging you to give this matter your immediate attention, I am,\n\nYours truly in Christ,\n\n+Henri Belleau OMI\n\nMost Reverend Henri Belleau, OMI,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: The Director,\n\nRe: Mrs. George,\nJames Bay Agency.\n\nAs requested when in Ottawa recently, I carried out an investigation as to the circumstances of the above case, which involved a change in religion and the transfer of a child from the Fort George Anglican Residential School to the Albany Roman Catholic Residential School.\n\nMrs. George is presently in the Roman Catholic Hospital at Moosonee. The circumstances covering her arrival there are covered in the report of Mr. Allan.\n\nAll through the case reference is made to her being in a dying condition, this from three years ago. For this reason, it was suggested that I should have a doctor accompany me when I interviewed her. On my arrival at Moose Factory, I found that the two doctors who had been attending her were absent and Dr. McKee did not feel that he could give any report as to her condition either by a single examination or by being present at the interview. I, therefore, visited her accompanied only by an interpreter.\n\nThere was another Indian patient in the room, at first the Sister, who is the nurse, wanted to stay but acceded to my request that she leave the room.\n\nI found Mrs. George to be bright and to my lay mind quite alert. Had I not known of her long stay in hospital, I would have said that she was not very ill. After chatting for a while to relieve her of any tension and explaining why I wanted to speak to her, I asked why she had\ndecided to change her religion. The answer was that it was from what she had seen in the hospital and that no influence had been used on her to change. This latter remark was rather surprising as no mention had been made of influence and Indian women especially very seldom volunteer statements.\n\nWhen asked if the child Alice had been happy at the Fort George Anglican School, she said that Alice was happy there. With regard to the change to Albany Roman Catholic School, she said that she did not know beforehand that the girl was going there but she was quite satisfied with the arrangement. She further said that she had had letters from Alice that she was happy to be there.\n\nWhilst there was much more conversation of a general nature intended to engender confidence to talk freely, these answers covered the main points we wanted to clear up. I had no difficulty in seeing her at least semi privately.\n\nThe next day, October 15th, I interviewed the Rev. Canon Shepherd at the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. He outlined what had happened in the same way as is done in the letters from he and Mr. Allan. The only new points he mentioned were that when Mrs. George was in the Fort George Roman Catholic Hospital, he had no difficulty when visiting her or seeing Alice. He had known her for a long time and she was always friendly. When he visited her at Moosonee, he could not see her privately and with the other people in the room, she refused to even shake hands with him. This he claimed could only be due to something that Mrs. George had been told at Moosonee.\n\nI do not think that this case involves any opinions from me. I simply tried to get answers to questions on certain points, verified as far as possible that the statements made in the previous correspondence had been made by the persons concerned. All the Indians concerned in the correspondence were away from Moosonee. Most of them live at Fort George and were visiting Moose Factory at different times. I will be glad to try to enlarge on any point of which I have knowledge if you so desire. As I see it, the case is simply the matter of religious denominations and how the change affects children already admitted to school in proper form.\n\nF.

It appears that three pupils truanted from the Albany Indian Residential School last April and are presumably drowned.\n\nThe R.C.M. Police consider they should have been notified sooner, but it is doubtful if they could have done much in the matter at that time, in view of weather conditions. However, the Department should have been notified immediately. Any unusual event at a school, especially when the results are fatal, should be immediately brought to the Department's attention.\n\nWhile I realize that there are difficulties that would be encountered, at the same time it is felt that a more determined effort should have been made by the Principal and staff to locate these boys. This whole happening is likely to have a very disturbing effect on the Indians and will materially react on the school. I feel it advisable to recommend to you that very strict instructions be issued to the Principals of the residential schools in your diocese, to the effect that when any pupil truants from the school immediate and effective efforts should be made to locate the pupil.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nHonesse, Ont.\nLake Ste-Anne June 14th, 1941\n\nReport on the death of three boys of our Lake Ste-Anne School, at Albany, James Bay.\n\nNames:\nJohn Koki, 14 years old, from Attawapiskat,\nMichel Sutherland, 15 years old, from Moosonee,\nMichel Matinas, 11 years old, from Attawapiskat.\n\nStatement on each child:\nJohn Koki: He had been accepted last year only after he had promised to be quiet, obedient and respectful. He had already been three years in the school and had not given much satisfaction to the members of the staff. He was hard to control.\n\nMichel Sutherland: He was in his second year at school. We have to complain about him.\n\nMichel Matinas: He was in his first year at school and we had nothing to complain about him too.\n\nThe facts:\nIn the night from Friday, 18th of April, to Saturday 19th, the boys escaped from the dormitory early in the night and went away; and we are without news from them ever since.\n\nWhat was done to find them:\nIn the morning when we noticed these children had escaped, we thought they had been going into the bush around here so we waited till the middle of the afternoon, hoping they would be back in the evening; because when some do get away in daytime, they come back at least in the evening.\n\nAlso, we built two camps where the children prefer to hide in the winter time. So we sent an Indian to visit those camps and walk in the bush around here; the Brothers also walked in different directions, but they did not find them.\n\nNearly all the Indians were away for hunting. On Sunday, they were reported to have been seen at a small distance near here; so the Indians went, but found only tracks that he followed till dark, and then he cut. These tracks were leading to the North (Indian's Bay) Co.\n\nOn Monday morning, our team got back from Moosonee; the trip had been bad; so we let the dogs rest that day.\n\nDuring that time, we inquired among the children and the result was this:\nJohn Koki was the chief of the band. He gave reason for his escape that he wanted to go back to Attawapiskat to see his mother. He had asked his former brother and many other boys to go away with him; they all refused; and like young men, neither answered \"I will not go out\" nor are well treated here and I like to be at school.\" At last he found two with whom he went.\n\nThe head teacher said: \"I am going to give the children slices of bread every hour between meals, in the morning and in the afternoon, in a few days, when they left, they started to hide those slices of bread they were given. John Koki had also his bow and arrows, and he was reported by his brothers to have said: 'I don't need food; I can take much grub; I have my arrows and I will kill something to eat.'\"\n\nWe did not notice that they had stolen anything like axes or food before they left.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, I sent to the south of North River, a Father with an Indian and the dogs; but they did not find them and came back just in time in the afternoon; if they had turned back two hours later, they would have been caught by the break-up which took place that same afternoon. After that, we could not do anything to find these children.\n\nThen the Indians were back after the breakup of the ice; they reported he had seen a small wigwam and arrows on the south shore of Moosonee River, about twenty miles from here. I sent five men to look for the bodies, but they did not find any.\n\nSo the children might have been able to cross the river on the thin ice; they broke through and the current carried them out into the Bay.\n\nThe parents have notified.\n\nPaul Lanklois O.M.I., Principal\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nof the Albany Residential School has thorough experience of life conditions in James Bay District and is conscientious in the discharge of his duty as a Missionary and Educator. He has devoted twelve years of his life to the welfare of the Indians and has not spared himself in his task.\n\nAs soon as the boys had gone, contact was made with the Attawapiskat Mission by wireless, and the Father in charge of the latter notified the father of the leader of the truants. This Indian immediately set off for Albany. The break-up of the ice was earlier at Attawapiskat than at Albany. As no further news had been heard from the man, it was believed that he might have already found the three boys. An accident had happened to him and he had given up the search. It had then become utterly impossible to continue looking for the truants, because of the break-up of the ice on the Albany River. In fact, only three full days elapsed between the departure of the boys and the breaking of the ice. Conditions of broken ice, jammed and varying at times make traveling impossible or across any river. This and only this was the real cause of the loss of the three boys.\n\nOn arriving in Albany and learning with all evidence that all hope was no more, Charlie Kioki and his wife, parents of the leader of the truants showed not the least attitude of regret toward the Father Principal. No word was uttered by them against the Staff of the School, but they burst into tears and with great spirit of faith, loudly spoke us God words of deep resignation. The opposite might have been expected from them at the time. You will please find enclosed a translation of the letter they sent to the Father in charge of Attawapiskat. A similar letter was sent to the Principal of the School.\n\nThe desertion of the truants had not even a shadow of reason and they had received no punishment to cause them discontent. Moreover, the time of their departure (three days only before the breaking of the ice) made the members of the Staff easily believe the three boys had not gone any distance, and consequently, to search within a radius of a few miles, the first and second day.\n\nI frankly confess that I cannot understand how any accusation of negligence could be substantiated against the Father Principal of the School.\n\nI thank you very sincerely for the interest you take in the welfare of the Indians, concerning their education; Thank you also for the advice you have given in your letter concerning situations and occurrences like those of last April.\n\nYours very truly in Christ,\n\n+ Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nBishop Henri Belleau O.M.I.,\nClear Apostolic of James Bay.\n\nP.S. Rev. Father Bilodeau tells me he has misplaced the letter he received from Charlie Kioki's wife. When he finds it, you will receive a copy translation of it. + H. B. O.M.I.\nMr. Phelan,\nChief of Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter no. 44-2-1, dated 17th instant, regarding the loss of three truant pupils of the Albany Indian Residential School. I am enclosing a copy of the report made by the Reverend Father Principal of the school to Constable Dexter of the RCMP Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe Father Principal had transmitted a message by wireless to our Moosonee Mission in order that I should notify you. He thought at the time that details would not be necessary in the message. Unfortunately, I was somewhat puzzled by the lack of details and put off until later when further particulars could be obtained. I now realize that the very scant information concerning the loss of the boys should have been forwarded to you; in this, I readily admit that I was wrong, because it was difficult to get a lengthy and complete report on the affair before June. The message sent by the Reverend Father Principal over the radio was transmitted soon after the escape of the boys.\n\nAs for notifying the RCMP Police, we could see no use in doing this soon. I am still of that opinion; nothing in the way of rounding up the truants could have been done by them because the Police are stationed in Moose Factory, over a hundred miles away; and moreover, a plane could not make a landing at the time because the ice on the lake was just about breaking. There was no open water where a plane could have landed. The Albany School dog sled was used to bring back from Moosonee at the time, and the early thaw obliged the Father and his Indian guide to take weeks over a week to cover the distance, traveling in water and over dangerous ice. Help from Moosonee or elsewhere was therefore out of question.\n\nThe truants knew that their chances of desertion were better in the absence of the Mission's dogs. As soon as the exhausted dogs had been given a rest, another Father set off with an Indian in pursuit of the fugitives. It was considered too risky in so doing. After a fruitless run of nearly twenty miles, they had to return; but they did so just in time. Two hours after they had left the North Branch of the Albany River (about fifteen miles from the School) the break-up of the ice occurred. They had to wade in water well over their knees in certain dangerous passages.\n\nYou state \"that it is felt that more determined effort should have been made by the principal and staff to locate these boys.\"\n\nThe Father Principal himself was confined to the hospital for a severe illness at the time of the evasion. Nevertheless, it being during the night of the 18th-19th April that the boys escaped, the search for them began on the 19th. Some reports on the case may have been worked up to maintain the impression that the Father Principal cared little or not whether the boys got into bad straits. This is absolutely false, however; the principal\nOttawa, August 11, 1941.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 8th ultimo, submitting a report with reference to the three pupils from the Albany Residential School who truanted last April and were, presumably, drowned. I appreciate the very complete information that you have supplied in regard to this very regrettable matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H.

If you think it is well, give it to Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se so that she gives it to Albert Matinas.\"\n\nAgnes Kicki.\n\nTranslation of the letter written by the same to Albert Matinas.\n\n\"Letter of consolation:\n\n\"My friends whom I love and with whom I share suffering, I wish to console you although I suffer from anguish myself; but wishing to show you that I love you, being at heart (i.e., feeling as you feel) exactly as you are, I beseech you to accept as I do, this suffering, I wishing to accept it with meekness for the sake of God. For God Himself is the one who will judge us with mercy, let us accept our suffering to please God. Let us hope that the bodies may rise again, just as we lost them and let us be consoled by the fact that the body dies only once in this world (on earth). Let us do as God wants us to do, in order to redeem those who are the worst sinners and to redeem ourselves, and to not lose these our children in the next life. If we try to please God in this suffering which He gives us, the heaviest, which He has chosen for us, let us thank Him feeling how much He loves us; and let us listen one to the other with pit\u00e9 when we who suffer this suffering for the first time.\n\n\"My friends, that is how I accept this suffering given us by God. I cannot go to see you. Their is only one road, I think, the one which leads to the church; that is the only way that I am able to walk.\n\nFrom this happening, I do not wish that rash judgment arise, so that (in turn) we be rashly judged. Always, as much as we could, we minded our children well. But to them it happened just as God willed (thought), I don't wish that judgment arise from this about my child who is already without life. But I only wish that search be well made for the bodies that they may be buried, if they are now lying in the wilderness. Not that anger arises; I suffer more when I hear that this was taken with resistance (without resignation). I listened patiently to the news told to me about the event at Lake Ste-Anne (Site of the Albany School). One thing only did I detect, everybody saying that Father Paul (who was then the missionary who was the Father in charge of the School). When I heard this, I went to tell God our Father all that I thought and he was glad to hear it. Above all, I am sorry for you whom I love and who are religious people (the writer here seems to address the missionaries) and who are also about to be judged, it being without reason that you be judged, as it is without reason that God be judged. He who is God Himself! It seems to suffer rebellion in such a case.\n\n\"Do not think that I alone or both Charlie (her husband) and I will join in this if it is done (that any judgment be passed on the other parties). I will not give myself up to rebel against God who loves me.\n\n\"I cannot speak long, but I have written this letter wishing to state well what I think.\"\n\n(This letter is from Agnes, wife of Charlie Kicki, of Attawapiskat.)\n\nCertified correct translation.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nPlease find enclosed translation of a letter written by the mother of one of the boys who deserted the Albany Residential School and was lost.

Accidental deaths.\n\nThere has come to my attention only within the past two weeks a communication from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dated July 14, 1941 and an enclosed report dated at Moose Factory, June 17, 1941, dealing with the above noted. The knowledge of the incident came to me quite by chance and in looking into the matter I find that there is no record of a report of the tragedy having been made to this Branch by either the school principal or yourself previous to or immediately following the police report.\n\nAs you had but recently taken over the office in the James Bay agency I am assuming that you were possibly unacquainted with Form #412 which sets forth the procedure to be followed in the event of the death occurring of a residential school pupil. I am sending you under separate cover a number of these forms with the thought that possibly you may have none in your office.\n\nThis is a matter that of course should have been dealt with on the occasion of your visit to Albany and Attawapiskat last June at the time the police constable conducted his investigations. Although a year has elapsed from the time of this accident I still think that you should form a board of inquiry and make a full investigation into all the unfortunate circumstances of the affair according to the instructions set out in Form #412. I have taken the matter up with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who are instructing their Officer at Moose Factory, Corporal W. G. Kerr, to act as a member of the board which would thus consist of yourself as Chairman, the principal of the School, Father Langlois, and Corporal Kerr.\n\nI wish you to go very . . . .\n\nDr. T. J.

Three boys truanted from the Albany Mission Residential School early in April, 1941. As the spring breakup on the river occurred shortly after they left the school, it is presumed that their bodies were carried into Hudson Bay;\n\n2.

Police investigation was all that was necessary.\n\nThe fathers of the boys will be notified by radiogram to be present at Albany to give evidence before the board of inquiry.\n\nI would appreciate copies of correspondence on your files.

It appears that three pupils truanted from the Albany Indian Residential School last April and are presumably drowned.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. consider they should have been notified sooner, but it is doubtful if they could have done much in the matter at that time, in view of weather conditions. However, the Department should have been notified immediately. Any unusual event at a school, especially when the results are fatal, should be immediately brought to the Department's attention.\n\nWhile I realize that there are difficulties that would be encountered, at the same time it is felt that a more determined effort should have been made by the Principal and staff to locate these boys. This whole happening is likely to have a very disturbing effect on the Indians and will naturally react on the school. I feel it advisable to recommend to you that very strict instructions be issued to the Principals of the residential schools in your diocese, to the effect that when any pupil truants from the school immediate and effective efforts should be made to locate the pupil.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay\nMoosonee, Ont.\nreason of his escape that he wanted to go back to Attawapiskat to see his mother. He had asked his younger brother and many other boys to go away with him; they all refused; and his younger brother answered him \"I will not go out; we are well treated here and I like to be at school.\" At last he found two with whom he went out.\n\nThey had very little food to go away with. We used to give the children slices of bread every day between meals in the forenoon and in the afternoon. So a few days before they left, they started to hide those slices of bread they were given. John Klok had also his bow and arrows, and he was reported by his brother to have said: \"I do not care to take much grub; I have my arrows and I will kill birds on the way.\"\n\nWe did not notice that they had stolen anything like axe or food before they left.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, I sent to the mouth of North River, a Father with an Indian and the dogs; but they did not find them and came back just in time in the after-noon; if they had turned back two hours later, they would have been caught by the break-up which took place that same after-noon. After that, we could not do anything to find these children.\n\nWhen the Indians were held after the break-up of the ice, one reported he had seen small wigwams and arrows on the south shore of Chickney River, about thirty miles from here. We sent five men to look the bodies, but they did not find any.\n\nSo the children might have tried to cross the river on the thin ice; they broke through and the current carried them out into the Bay.\n\nThe parents have notified.\n\nPaul Langlois O.M.I., Principal\nLake Ste-Anne, June 14th, 1941.\n\nReport on the death of three boys of our Lake Ste-Anne School,\nat Albany, James Bay.\n\nNames:\nJohn Kicki, 14 years old, from Attawapiskat,\nMichel Sutherland, 13 years old, from Wooniek\nMichel Matinas, 11 years old, from Attawapiskat.\n\nStatement on each child:\n\nJohn Kicki - He had been accepted, last year, only after he had promised to be quiet, obedient and respectful. He had already been three years in the school and had not given much satisfaction to the members of the staff. He was hard to control.\n\nMichel Sutherland - He was in his second year at school. We have nothing to complain about him.\n\nMichel Matinas - He was in his first year at school and we have nothing to complain about him too.\n\nThe facts:\nIn the night from Friday, 18th of April to Saturday 19th, the boys escaped from the dormitory, early in the night, and went away; and we are without news from them ever since.\n\nWhat was done to find them:\nIn the morning, when we noticed those children had escaped we thought they had been going into the bush around here; so we waited till the middle of the afternoon, hoping they would be back in the evening; because when some do get away in daytime, they come back at least in the evening.\n\nAlso, we have built two camps, where the children go for picnics in the winter time. So we sent an Indian to visit those camps and walk in the bush around here; The Brothers also walked in different directions, but they did not find them.\n\nNearly all the Indians were away for hunting. On Sunday, they were reported to have been seen at a small distance from here; so the Indian went, but found only tracks that he followed till dark, and then he quit. Those tracks were leading to the Post (Hudson's Bay Co.).\n\nOn Monday Morning, our team got back from Moosonee; the trip had been bad; so we let the dogs rest that day. During that time, we inquired among the children and the result was this:\nJohn Kicki was the chief of the band. He gave for\nreason and they had received no punishment to cause them dis-\ncontent. Moreover, the time of their departure (three days\nonly before the breaking of the ice) made the members of the\nStaff easily believe the boys had not gone any distance, and\nconsequently, to search within a radius of a few miles, the\nfirst and second day.\n\nI frankly confess that I cannot understand how\nany accusation of negligence could be substantiated against\nthe Father Principal of the School.\n\nI thank you very sincerely for the interest you\ntake in the welfare of the Indians, concerning their education;\nThank you also for the advice you have given in your letter\nconcerning situations and occurrences like those of last April.\n\nYours very truly in Christ,\n\nHenri Belleau, O.M.I.,\nBishop Henri Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay\n\nP.S. Rev. Father Bildeau tells me he has mislaid the\nletter he received from Charlie Kicki's wife. When\nhe finds it, you will receive a translation of it.\n\nH.B., O.M.I.\nafter they had left the North Branch of the Albany River (about fifteen miles from the School) the break-up of the ice occurred. They had to wade in water well over their knees in certain dangerous passages.\n\nYou state \"that it is felt that a more determined effort should have been made by the Principal and Staff to locate these boys.\"\n\nThe Principal himself was confined to the hospital for a severe illness at the time of the evasion. Nevertheless, it being during the night of the 18th-19th April that the boys escaped, the search for them began on the 19th. Some reports on the case may have been worded so as to create the impression that the Father Principal cared little or not whether the boys got into bad straits. This is absolutely false, however; the principal of the Albany Residential School has thorough experience of life conditions in James Bay District and is conscientious in the discharge of his duty as a Missionary and Educator. He has devoted twelve years of his life to the welfare of the Indians and has not spared himself in his task.\n\nAs soon as the boys had gone, contact was made with the Attawapiskat Mission by wireless, and the Father in charge of the latter notified the father of the leader of the truants. This Indian immediately set off for Albany. The break-up of the ice is later at Attawapiskat than at Albany. As no further news were heard from this man, it was believed that he might have already found the three boys. An accident had happened to him and he had given up the search. It had then become utterly impossible to continue looking for the truants, because of the break-up of the ice on the Albany River; in fact, only three full days elapsed between the departure of the boys and the breaking of the ice. Conditions of broken ice, jammed and moving at times make traveling impossible on or across any river. This and only this was the real cause of the loss of the three boys.\n\nOn arriving at Albany and learning with all evidence that hope was no more, Charlie Kicki and his wife, parents of the leader of the truants, showed not the least attitude of reproach toward the Father Principal. Not a word was uttered by them against the Staff of the School, but they burst into tears and with great spirit of faith, loudly spoke to God words of deep resignation. The opposite might have been expected from them at the time. You will please find enclosed a translation of the letter they sent to the Father in charge at Attawapiskat. A similar letter was sent to the Principal of the School.\n\nThe desertion of the truants had not even a shadow of\nLES MISSIONNAIRES OBLATS DE MARIE IMMACULEE\n\nMoonseee, Ont. July 26th, 1941.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief of Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter no. 44-2-1, dated 17th instant, regarding the loss of three truant pupils of the Albany Indian Residential School. I am enclosing a copy of the report made by the Reverend Father Principal of the School, to Constable Dexter of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe Father Principal had transmitted a message by wireless to our Moonseee Mission, in order that we could notify you. He thought at the time that details would not be necessary in the message. Unfortunately, I was somewhat puzzled by the lack of details and put off until later when further particulars could be obtained. I now realize that the very scant information concerning the loss of the boys should have been forwarded to you; in this, I readily admit that I was wrong, because it was difficult to get a lengthy and complete report on the affair before June. The message sent by the Reverend Father Principal over the radio was transmitted soon after the evasion of the boys.\n\nAs for notifying the R.C.M.P., we could see no use in doing this soon. I am still of that opinion; nothing in the way of rescuing the truants could have been done by them because the Police are stationed in Moose Factory, over a hundred miles away; and moreover, a place could not make a landing at the time because the ice on the rivers was just about breaking. There was no open water where a place could have landed. The Albany School's dog team was on the way back from Moonseee at the time, and the early thaw obliged the Father and his Indian guide to take well over a week to cover the distance, traveling in water and over dangerous ice. Help from Moonseee or elsewhere was therefore out of question.\n\nThe truants knew that their chances of discretion were better in the absence of the Mission's dog team. As soon as the exhausted dogs had been given a rest, another Father set off with an Indian in pursuit of the fugitives, assuming considerable risk in so doing. After a fruitless run of nearly twenty miles, they had to return; but they did so just in time. Two hours after\nOttawa, August 11, 1941\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, submitting a report with reference to the three pupils from the Albany Residential School who drowned last April and were, presumably, drowned. I appreciate the very complete information that you have supplied in regard to this very regrettable matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. M.

I don't wish that judgment arise from this about my child who is already without life. But I only wish that search be well made for the bodies that they may be buried, if they are now on shore lying in the wilderness.\n\nNot that anger arise; I suffer more when I hear that this was taken with resistance (without resignation). I listened patiently when I heard tell about the event at Lake Ste-Anne (Site of the Albany School). One thing only did I detest very much. It was that the Protestant chief wanted to accuse the Father in charge (of the School). When I heard this, I went to tell our Father all that I thought and he was glad to hear it. Above all, I am sorry for you whom I love and who are religious people (the writer refers here to the missionaries) and who are about to be judged, it being without reason that you be judged, as it is without reason that God be judged. He who is God Himself seems to suffer rebellion in such a case.\"\n\n\"Do not think that I alone or both Charlie (her husband) and I will join in this if it is done (that any judgment be passed on the Missionaries). I will not give myself up to rebel against my God who loves me.\"\n\n\"I cannot speak long, but I have written this letter wishing to state well what I think.\"\n\n(This letter is from Agnes, wife of Charlie Kicki, of Attawapiskat.)\n\nCertified correct translation,\n\nHenri Belleau\nV.

I wishing to accept it with meekness for the sake of God. For God Himself is the one who will judge us. With patience let us accept our suffering to please Him and to please our children (the three dead boys) who see us and who see God. Let us hope that the bodies may rise again, just as we lost them, and let us be consoled by the fact that the body dies only once in this world (on earth). Let us do as God wants us to do, in order to raise those who are the most heavy and so redeem ourselves and to not lose those our children in the next life. If we try to please God in this suffering which He gives us, the heaviest, which He has chosen for us, let us thank Him feeling how much He loves us; and let us listen one to the other with pity we who suffer this suffering for the first time.\"\n\n\"My friends, that is how I accept this suffering given us by God.

I searched all day until dark Saturday west of the school, but found no trace of the missing boys.\n\nEarly Sunday morning I started East and discovered some tracks, three sets, going in a north east direction which I followed until late in the evening when a storm obliterated all signs and I had to turn back at midnight.\n\nOn Monday I did not go out as it was still storming and all signs would have been obliterated.\nStatement of Brother Lapointe.\n\nAt the time the boys disappeared from school I was detailed to search for them by Father Langleis, who was ill in bed.\n\nOn the Sunday following their disappearance I went at 5 a.m. to the Lakes west of the school and searched all day making a circular tour of about ten miles without seeing any signs. On my return I was told by some Indians that someone had been seen on the mainland south east of this Island, and it was assumed that it was the boys. Breaking ice prevented us from going to this point until Wednesday when we took a canoe through the ice floes only to discover that those who had been seen were some other Indians.\nStatement of Joseph Kamalatisit\n\nI was at Lac Ste. Anne at the time in 1941 when the three boys left school. I was sick in bed and only heard about it two days later. John Sutherland was searching for them but other Indians were waiting for some instruction to start searching. The ice at that time was very bad and break-up occurred about three days after the boys had left school. John Sutherland searched well but I think more could have been done. The dog team which the Father sent to search should have carried a canoe and they would have been able to search farther, but ice conditions were very bad.\nStatement of Charles Kieki - Father of John Kieki\n\nI am not sure that sufficient search was made for my son and the other boys. I would have circled the area for days until tracks were found (at this point Kieki was told that the area had been circled and tracks found which were followed until obliterated by the storm).\n\nI later came to Albany myself from Attawapiskat and saw the men who in June went searching at Chickney Creek, North of Albany (about ten miles) but I think the search was too late then.\n\nAfter this happened the other children of the school received a lecture from the priest and I think he said they were not to talk about the affair.\n\n(At this point Father Langleis interrupted to say that he had given the children a lecture but that he had told them they were to tell only the truth about the affair).\n\nI heard some of the other children say that one of the three boys had done something for which he was punished and that they ran away for this reason.\nInquiry into the deaths of\nJohn Kieki\nMichel Matinas\nMichel Sutherland.\n\nHeld at Lac Ste. Anne - Albany - James Bay, on June 22nd,\n1942.\n\nStatement of Albert Matinas - Father of Michel Matinas\n\nI do not understand why my boy and the others ran away\nfrom school and I feel satisfied that my son would not\nhave done so on his own initiative. Of course I under-\nstand that if the reason had been known Father would\nhave cleared it up and the boys would not have gone\naway.\n\nSome people have been telling me that more could have\nbeen done to find the boys but I feel satisfied that\neverything was done that could be under the circumstances,\nalthough I heard that there were Indians here at the\ntime who would not search. Some of the people say that\nthey were not told about the boys being missed from school,\nbut I knew that Father Langleis who was ill in bed at the\ntime had directed that a search be made.\nInquiry into deaths of\n\nJohn Kieki\nMichel Matinas\nMichel Sutherland\n\nThe accompanying statements were taken on June 22nd, 1942 at the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, Lac Ste. Anne, Albany, in the presence of Corporal W. Kerr, R.C.M.P., Father Paul Langlois, Principal of the School, and Dr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent as chairman of the Board of Inquiry - and were interpreted from Cree Indian to English by James Gunner, interpreter employed by the Indian Agency.\n\n[Signature]\nDr. T.J. Orford\nStatement of Father Langleis, cont'd.\n\nFollowing break-up it was some time before anything could be done as ice and weather conditions made travel impossible. During this time a report was received from an Indian that a small canoe and arrows had been seen on the South shore of the Chickney River about twenty miles from the school. Five Indians were sent to search as soon as it was possible. They were away for three days but found nothing that would indicate that the boys had been in the vicinity of the Chickney River.\n\nNo further search has been made and no reports of any kind have come in about the boys.\n\nIn the matter of reporting the incident to the R.C.M. Police and the Department I sent a radiogram not later than a week following the disappearance to Father Charland at Massena who immediately wrote to Bishop Belleau who was at the time in Montreal or Ottawa.\nStatement of Father Langleis\n\nThe three boys John Kieki, Michel Sutherland, and Michel Matinas, left the school Friday night of April 18th, 1941. Cases of truancy have occurred before in which boys always returned the following day, so it was not until Saturday afternoon that I considered it necessary to search for them.\n\nJohn Sutherland and the lay brothers searched on foot in all directions from the school, starting out Saturday afternoon - continuing the search Sunday and Monday - returning each night.\n\nNo tracks or signs of any kind were found except those followed on Sunday by John Sutherland. These tracks were leading in the direction of the Hudson's Bay Company post about five miles away, and were obliterated by the storm on Sunday night. It is not known if these were the tracks of the boys as they appeared to be more or less aimless. It could have been the tracks of hunters.\n\nIt was three days before a team of dogs was sent to search for the missing boys because there were not many dogs around as most of the men were away hunting with them and our team was at Massena and did not return until Monday morning. Our team was given a rest on Monday and sent on Tuesday to search for the boys. They went to the north mouth of the Albany river searching in this direction because an Indian had reported that he thought he might have seen the boys in that vicinity. The Indian reporting this assumed it was the boys he had seen only after reaching the Albany post and learning of their disappearance because on his way into the post he had seen what he thought to be one or two people some distance away from him, but had not stopped as he thought it was only somebody hunting.\n\nThe men searching with the team found no signs of any kind of the boys and were forced to return due to the breaking up of the river ice, which broke up completely only two hours after they returned.\n\nFollowing break-up...........\nUpon arrival at Fort Albany on the above date whilst accompanying the Indian Agent, Dr. T.J. Orford, on the annual treaty trip, it was learned that the three exceptionally noted Indian children had run away from the R.C.Mission school at Lake St. Ann around breakup time in April and that nothing had been learned of them since.\n\nWhilst at the R.C.Mission on this date the principal of the school the Rev. Paul LANGLEIS was interviewed regarding the missing children and the following statement was supplied by Father Langleis:\n\nBEGINS:\nLake St. Ann,\nJune 14th, 1941.\n\nReport on the death of three boys of our Lake St. Ann school at Albany, James Bay.\n\nNames:\nJohn KIOKI, 14 years old, from Attawapiskat.\nMichel SUTHERLAND, 13 years old, from Weemusk.\nMichel MATINAS, 11 years old, from Attawapiskat.\n\nStatement on each child:\nJohn KIOKI: he had been accepted last year, only after he had promised to be quiet, obedient and respectful. He had already been three years in school and had not given much satisfaction to the members of the staff. He was hard to control.\nMichel SUTHERLAND: he was in his second year at school; we have nothing to complain about him.\nMichel MATINAS: he was in his first year at school and we have nothing to complain about him.\n\nThe fact: In the night, from Friday 13th of April to Saturday 19th, the boys escaped from the dormitory early in the night and went away and we are without news from them since.\n\nWhat was done to find them:\nIn the morning, when we noticed these children had escaped, we thought they had been going into the bush around here; so we waited till the middle of the afternoon, hoping they would be back by the evening; because when some do get away in day time, they come back at least in the evening.\nAlso, we have built two camps, where the children go for picnics in the winter time. So we sent an Indian to visit those camps and walk in the bush around here; the brothers also walked in different directions, but they did not find them.\n\nNearly all the Indians were away for hunting. On Sunday, they were reported to have been seen at a small distance from here, so the Indians went but found\n\n(Continued on Page 2)\nRes: John KIOKI, Attawapiskat, Ont., Michel SUTHERLAND,\nWeemusk, Ont., Michel MATINAS, Attawapiskat, Ont. -\nMissing from R.C.Mission INDIAN SCHOOL, Fort Albany, Ont.\n\nContinued from Page 1.\n\n(Statement of Father Paul Langlois)\n\nWENT BUT FOUND only tracks, that he followed till dark\nand then he quit. These tracks were leading to the Post.\nOn Monday morning, our team got back from Moosonee;\nthe trip had been bad; so we let the dogs rest that day.\nDuring that time, we inquired among the children and the\nresult was this:\nJohn KIOKI was chief of the band. He gave for reason of\nhis escape, that he wanted to go back to Attawapiskat to\nsee his mother. He asked his younger brother and many\nother boys to go away with him; and his younger brother\nanswered him: \"I will not go out;\" we are well treated\nhere and I like to be at school.\" At least he found two\nwith whom he went out.\n\nThey had very little food to go away with. We\nuse to give the children slices of bread every day between\nmeals, in the forenoon and in the afternoon. So a few days\nbefore they left, they started to hide those slices of\nbread they were given. John Kioki had also his axe and\nten arrows, and he was reported by his brother to have\nsaid: \"I do not mind to take much grub; I have my arrows\nand I will kill birds on the way\". We did not notice that\nthey had stolen anything like axe or food before they left.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, I sent to the mouth of the\nNorth River a Father with an Indian and the dogs; but\nthey did not find them and came back just in time, in\nthe after noon; if they had turned back two hours later,\nthey would have been caught by break up, which took place\nthat afternoon. After that we could not do anything more\nto find those children.\n\nWhen the Indians were back after the break up of\nthe ice, one reported he had seen a small wigwam and\narrows on the south shore of Chickney River, about 20 miles\nfrom here. We sent five men to look for the bodies, but\nthey did not find them.\n\nSo the children might have tried to cross the\nriver on the thin ice they broke through and the current\ncarried them out into the Bay.\n\nThe parents have been notified.\n\nWitness: Cat. G.E. Dexter.\nJds: Paul Langlois, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nENDS.\n\n3. Father Langlois was asked whether the boys had\nbeen disciplined for any reason before they ran away but he\nsaid that they had not. He was also asked why the matter\nhad not been reported to the police and why more prompt\naction had not been taken to look for them. He stated that\nit often happens that a boy will run away for a day but\nwill return at night at meal time or when it gets dark. They\nhad expected that the boys would return in this instance.\nIt is also unfortunate that the boys choose to run away\njust before break up time when travelling on the ice is so\nuncertain; however, it was learned that Indiana were travelling\nfor a week after they left school. Father Langlois said\nthat he had reported the matter to the Mission at Moosonee\nbut evidently it did not occur to them to notify the police.\n\n2-1-6-41.\n\n4. Whilst at Attawapiskat on the above date the\nFathers of John KIOKI and Michel MATINAS complained to the\n\n(Continued on Page 3.)\nContinued from Page 2.\n\nCOMPLAINED TO THE Indian Agent and the writer regarding the boys being lost, stating that they believed that the boys had been mistreated and that they had not been notified until it was too late for them to go and look for them. The Father of John KIOKI had started out to look for them when he had been notified but shot his finger off accidently in the tent the first night out. They also said that they had heard from the Indians that the boys had not fed well and that their letters were censored and if anything undesirable at the Mission was included in a letter it was torn up by those in charge. Albert MATINAS, father of Michel, said that he had learned from the children that they were told by the priests at the Mission not to speak of anything that they had seen whilst attending school during the winter. Albert MATINAS had another child die at the school.\n\n5. An endeavour was made by the Indian Agent and the writer to explain to these Indians that it was often necessary to discipline children at school and that it was difficult to believe a child regarding treatment received in school as they naturally find it hard to get accustomed to school life and necessary regulations there. This endeavour was not very well accepted and both Fathers said that they would not send anymore of their children to school.\n\n6. There is no doubt that the children have perished, either by starvation or by drowning. The Chiefs of the Indian bands at Albany, Attawapiskat, and Moose Factory have been asked to have all the Indians on the lookout for the bodies whilst travelling along the coast and in the bush.\n\n7. The whole affair is very regrettable and the parents indignation regarding the loss of their children is readily understandable; however, there does not seem to be anything further that can be done at this late date. In view of this the file is being considered closed.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\nNO EXPENSE INCURRED.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nTHE COMMISSIONER:\n\n1. FORWARDED for your information. This report will undoubtedly be of both interest and concern to the Indian Affairs Branch. While the three Indian children departed from the R.C.Mission School at Lake St. Joseph during the night of April 18th/19th last, the matter had not been reported to Moose Factory Detachment, or the Indian Agent, although Father Langlois claims to have notified the R.C.Mission at Moosonee.\n\n2. The boys had not been disciplined, according to Father Langlois, and it was hoped they would have returned at meal time, or at least when darkness prevailed.\n\n3. The fathers of Michel Matinas and John Koki made complaints to the Indian Agent, and Capt. Dexter, to the effect the boys had been mistreated, were not fed well, and that their mail had been censored. An endeavour was made to make the Indians realize certain adjustments to a child's life was necessary, when in school, but they could not be convinced, and maintained they would not send any more of their children to school.\n\n4. No doubt the missing children have been drowned, or have died from starvation, and the Chiefs of the Indian Bands at Albany, Attawapiskat and Moose Factory have been requested to have all Indians keep a watch for the bodies.\n\n5. This is a very unfortunate and tragic incident, and in view of the attitude displayed by Albert Matinas, and the father of John Koki, who will probably give the matter some circumspection among other Indians, it may be other parents of Indian children will be loath to send their children for the purpose of receiving education at the R.C.Mission herein.\n\n6. There appears to be nothing further that can be done by this Force in the circumstances, and the file is therefore considered closed.\n\nHANDED TO DEPARTMENT CONCERNED.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\nTORONTO\n\n(V.A.M.

Sir,\n\nThe last inspection report on the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School does not leave a very favourable impression of this institution. There has been an entire change of staff since the last inspection.\n\nThe discipline is lax, the Principal being indulgent and disinclined to excite the hostility of parents, and, owing to him being overworked, cannot give effective supervision to the school.\n\nAt the time of the inspection the children were not too warmly clad, although there were ample supplies of unused clothing on hand furnished by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society. The bedding was insufficient and not clean.\n\nThe Inspector claims that the location of the school was badly chosen, it being difficult to reach at any season of the year. The site is low and impossible to drain, owing to the water in Lake of the Woods being raised by the heightening of the dam. Raising operations are conducted on small islands, to reach which horses and oxen have to be taken over in the launch. No sound\n\nRev. R.P.

They have no systematic water supply; the daily\nneeds are dependent on what is brought in pails and\nbarrels.\n\nThe Department considers that the Inspector's\nremarks call for some action on the part of your Society\nto improve the condition of affairs and make the\nschool popular with the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\nJune 5th., 1906.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Mackay from the city we beg to acknowledge your favour of the 4th. to him, regarding the Cecilia Jeffrey School. This will be considered by the Executive at its next meeting.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nFOREIGN MISSION OFFICE\n\nReply to No.209657/1\nMr Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nMr Pedley:\n\nYours of the 4th inst., received, reporting on the unsatisfactory condition of the \"Cecilia Jeffery Boarding School.\" This comes as surprise and disappointment. The building when erected was regarded as satisfactory and the drainage was also satisfactory at that time. We just learned from Professor Hart that the waters of the Lake have been raised, which I presume explains the fact that the level of the Lake has been raised. This you state in your letter as a fact, which of course I did not have been anticipated when the building was erected. The site chosen after careful consideration and whilst it was regarded as away from Kenora, on the other hand it was in the neighborhood of the ones to be served. This not only secured children more readily but made it possible to be in constant contact with the parent to their advantage; these were the reasons that prevailed in choosing a site so.\n\nI am putting your letter into the hands of Prof. Hart, the leader, of the Synodical Committee, in charge of the work, and they will give immediate attention and report.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dodds who are in charge of that Mission had experience of several years in Indian work and were deemed successful.\n\nI regret the unfavorable report now received. The difficulty of securing satisfactory agents for this work increases, we shall ever try and do the best possible. I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nYour Committee spent some time in examining the accounts of the school and the vouchers, and although they made no formal audit they believe the accounts to be correct.\n\nYour Committee beg to state further that they left the school with the conviction that the members of the staff are devoted to their work, and that they are doing excellent work.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nWilliam Patrich\n\nJames Ferguson\n\nThat the foregoing be a correct copy of the report of the Committee of the Indian Mission Committee of the Province of Manitoba and Saskatchewan is hereby affirmed by the undersigned.\n\nJames Ferguson\n\nSecretary.\nto it that henceforth there will be no room for such a complaint.\n\nYour Committee do not regard themselves as called upon to justify the conduct of the Inspector chosen for the school, but they are surprised at the complaints coming from him. They believe that the Inspector's opinion that it would be impossible to drain the basement of the school is erroneous, and are convinced that this will be evident when the drain is opened and cleaned out. (5) Your Committee regretted to learn that it was very difficult to heat parts of the building and especially the school room. They are of the opinion that the difficulty arises in part at least from the position of the hot air register in relation to a ventilator in the ceiling. Whether the difficulty be due to any extent to the size or the purpose, or to its construction, or the way in which the pipes are placed or their size, they express no opinion. That the Inspector thinks should be found out by those who heat your Committee do not know, but they do desire to call your attention to the greater danger of the want of ventilation in such a building than of cold. Your Committee are also in doubt as to what the Inspector's words \"badly in need of repairs\", may refer, as although they examined all parts of the building and are convinced that some repairs be made, they saw nothing to warrant such a strong expression.\n\nYour Committee beg to report that the Inspector's complaint that there was no systematic way of supplying the school with water was true at the time of his visit and that the system is not yet what it ought to be, that the explanation of this is that the pump which had been in use for some time had worn out, that another had been gotten and put in its place, that because of the stiffness of the working of this new pump some of the castings of the wind mill broke, and that although new ones have not yet been procured, and consequently wind power cannot be used, water is pumped by hand into the school. Your Committee hopes that in the very near future the wind mill will be repaired and that water for all school purposes will be pumped by it.\n\nYour Committee readily admit that the duties of the Principal of the school are so varied and require his residence at one and the same time at the school and in the station, and therefore getting supplies for the school or doing mission work along the shores of the lake as to render it impossible for him to discharge them all satisfactorily, that they have considered the recommendation of the Inspector of Indian Affairs that two men be appointed to the work, one to be Principal of the school and the other to take charge of the boat and to do the mission work, and are convinced that it would be a mistake to appoint two men entirely independent of each other to this work, (1) because in their judgment the number of Indians to be benefited do not warrant the additional cost; (2) because of the danger of friction arising between two men so situated and (3) because all who have had any experience in recruiting pupils for Indian Schools say that the Principal alone can do this work satisfactorily, as no other can give the personal pledges the Indians require regarding the care of their children. Hence they recommend that a male teacher be appointed who shall also be Assistant Principal and take full charge of the school in the Principal's absence.\n\nIn conclusion your Committee would call your attention to the fact that the cost of maintaining this school will be greater in proportion to the number of pupils than that of any other of our other schools for the following reasons: (1) A steamboat is a necessity because of the situation of the school. This has increased the cost from the first. The difference is now further increased by the enforcement of the regulation of the Department of Marine and Fisheries requiring the employment of two men, one having a master's certificate and the other an engineer's. Happily the Principal of the school has passed the examination and received a master's certificate, but instead of engaging an Engineer to be fireman we are now compelled to engage an Engineer at a much higher salary. (2) The cost of keeping horses and cattle is much greater on the lake than on the prairie. The Principal estimated that it will cost $60-00 to raise a steer to the third year and fit him for market, whereas the same quality of animal can be bought on the prairie for $20-00. Hence while other schools save money by raising their own meat the Castle Junction School would lose heavily. But milk must be had and the cost of securing it is even greater in proportion. During the Summer when the feed should cost little or nothing and the supply of milk be most abundant because of the flies the cows all but cease to give milk. For this reason the Principal recommends that only one or at most two cows be kept and that they be stall fed Summer and Winter.\n\nYour Committee beg to report further that since the beginning of mission work in this region soil for raising potatoes for the use of the school has been found not on the land secured by the Foreign Mission Committee for the school, but on two islands some distance from it. In the present state of the land owned by the church it is impossible to do more than estimate very roughly that amount that may be cultivated. A large proportion of the higher land is rock; the lower although good soil is wet. The drainage of this can be drained without much difficulty, but then you have to lay the drainage of what would involve such heavy work.\nYour Committee examined the wing which was built last year and found that there is on the ground floor a kitchen, pantry, and storeroom for provisions; that upstairs there are four bedrooms intended for the comfort of the staff; and that the building is in every way satisfactory except that the only provision for heating the bedrooms is that the pipe from the kitchen stove is to pass through the upstairs hall; and that it is proposed to put a drum in the pipe there. Believing this to be altogether inadequate your Committee considered the various ways in which these rooms may be heated and concluded that as there is not sufficient room for a heating stove in the narrow hall, and that in the opinion of the Committee the rooms are too far from either of the furnaces in the older part of the building to have heat conveyed thence, even if these furnaces have sufficient capacity to heat the additional space, recommend that a new furnace be purchased and put in the basement of the new wing.\n\nThe Matron called the attention of your Committee to the fact that the storeroom for clothing is in the attic and therefore difficult to reach and that owing to the heat and darkness no notice whatever about it goes out to the children and destroys the clothing. Your Committee recommend that if space can be found a room in one of the other floors be fitted up for this purpose also that lockers for the boys' clothes be fitted up in their dormitory.\n\nThe Matron stated that mattresses for the boys' beds are worn out and asked that if the sooner the new single beds be procured. The Committee agreed to recommend that this be done.\n\nThe Principal directed the attention of your Committee to the fact that the wind box for pumping water to the school is broken and that all pumping has to be done by hand. The Committee agreed to request the Principal to find the cost of the necessary repairs and unless those should be high, to have the mill repaired at once.\n\nYour Committee inquired into the complaints regarding the school and the manner in which it is conducted made by the Inspector of Indian Agencies to the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe first statement in the complaint as sent by the Secretary of the Indian Department is as follows: \"The last report of the Inspector of the Carlisle Boarding School leaves an unfavorable impression of this Institution.\"\n\nThe specific matters complained of are: (1) There has been an entire change of staff since the last inspection. (2) The discipline is lax, the Principal being instructed and disallowed to excite the hostility of parents, and owing to his being overworked, cannot give effect to supervision to the school. (3) At the time of inspection the children were not too warmly clad although there were ample supplies of unused clothing on hand furnished by the Women's Foreign Missionary Society. The bedding was insufficient and not clean. (4) The location of the school was badly chosen, it being difficult to reach at any season of the year. The site is low and impossible to drain, owing to the presence of the lake of the Woods being valued by the heightening of the dam. Forming operations are conducted on small islands to reach which the men have to be taken over in the launch. (5) The Inspector found the building cold and no proper precautions taken to retain the heat, and although this is comparatively a new school, it is badly in need of repairs for lack of attention. They have no systematic water supply. The daily needs are dependent on what is brought in pails and barrels.\n\nThe first statement is general and stands or falls with the particulars afterwards given.\n\nThese are: (1) The change in the staff. This arose mostly out of an attempt to improve the school by the appointment of a new principal, an appointment which your Committee still believe will be justified by the result. (2) Discipline. Your Committee's visit was made during the holiday season so that they had no opportunity of judging of the school's discipline from the conduct of the pupils, but they did ask each member of the staff regarding this and received from each the assurance that there was no laxity in the Principal's discipline. They also learned that the Indians look upon his discipline as being too strict and that a petition for its abatement on the ground and the appointment of another had been prepared and signed by some of the Indians. The Committee are confident that if any error as to discipline were made during the first year the Principal was in charge, they will be corrected very soon by experience. (3) The children were insufficiently clad. Your Committee are at a loss to know what more to make this complaint. The Matron had children of her own and should therefore know something about what children require in the way of clothing. The Committee received ample testimony to the kindness of her disposition and of the attention of the Indian children for her. It is readily admitted that a good number of mattresses were worn out\u2014a dozen your Committee desire to have replaced. Your Committee regret to report that the Inspector's complaint as to the lack of attention to the pail system was justified by...\nIndian Mission Committee of the Synods of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nReport of the Sub-Committee appointed to visit the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYour Committee left Winnipeg at 7:45 on the morning of July 21st and arrived at the school a little after 9 P.M. On the 22nd they examined all the buildings and their equipment, traversed a large part of the land held by the Church in the interests of the school, examined all departments of the work as far as this was possible during the holiday season when the school is closed, and the scholars scattered over the woods gathering berries for sale, and inquired into the complaints made by the Inspector of the Indian Agencies to the Department of the Interior, and beg to report:\n\nAs to buildings:- The residence of the Principal. This is a good building commodious and comfortable. Your Committee found that the cost of painting, which was done last fall by the son of the Principal at a low rate, was very considerably increased by the fact that the building had stood so long unpainted before it was purchased by the Indian Mission Committee and moved on to the school site, thus necessitating the use of a much larger quantity of paint than would otherwise have been required; that the inside had been painted by members of the Principal's family without any other charge than the cost of the paint.\n\nYour Committee found that an excellent cistern had been placed in the second story of the building, that there is a bath room on the ground floor in which a wash basin is placed, but that there is no bath tub, that there is a sink in the pantry and that metallic pipes have been provided to carry the water from the lake to the house, and that water is now pumped through these in a barrel, in the kitchen, but that the pipes are all above ground and are therefore useless in the winter; that there is no means of pumping the water directly from the lake to the cistern, or of taking the water from the cistern to the kitchen and bath room, and that the drain to convey water from the kitchen sink and the bath room to the lake has not been completed and is consequently useless. Your Committee requested the Principal to stick the water pipe to a sufficient depth below the ground to protect them from frost; to make an estimate of the cost of completing the plumbing so as to take the water from the cistern and from the cistern to the kitchen and bath room and of putting a bath tub in the bath room; and also to inquire into the cost of completing the drain from the sink and bath room to the lake and the protection against frost that would be required at the outlet of this drain.\n\nThe Stable:- Your Committee noticed that the stable stands on the road between the residence of the Principal and the school; and that not only needlessly marred the beauty of the walk between the two buildings, but also that the treading of the cattle must in times of rain stir up mud not only on this path but also all around the back door of the school, which the animals must pass in going between the pasture and the stable. On consulting with the Principal it was learned that a workshop and also a storeroom are required and that the present stable can be fitted up for this purpose without much cost. Your Committee recommend that a new stable be built to the west of the school, (i.e., between the school and the pasture) and that the present stable be converted into a workshop and storeroom.\n\nSchool - Outside the School Rooms:- Your Committee found that there is no provision for saving labour in the cleaning out of these; and that the Inspector of the Department of the Interior had recommended that the liquids be drained off and that a box be put in as a receptacle for the solids in such a way that it may be drawn out and emptied from time to time. Your Committee approve of this recommendation.\n\nYour Committee examined the drainage from the school to the lake and learned that for a time it had been impossible to drain the bath tubs and that it had been feared that the lake was backing up into the tubs, but that this fear had been almost entirely removed by the fact that by pressing a rod down the pipe the tubs had been drained so that they are not perfectly dry. Your Committee, although they had no means of determining the levels, are convinced that unless the lake rises very considerably higher than it was during their visit, there is plenty of rail to drain the basement of the school; and consequently advised the Principal to open the drain so as to determine whether the lack of drainage arises from a stoppage in the drain. Your Committee found that the floor in the boys' bath room had been laid on the clay and that parts of it are so badly broken that the clay is exposed in places, and that consequently it is impossible to keep the floor clean and neat. Your Committee recommend that a cement floor be put down. Your Committee further recommend that in a part of the basement in which there is at present an earthen floor either a stone or a cement floor, etc., determined after further inquiry be laid.\n\nHeating of the school rooms:- The attention of your Committee was directed to the fact that there is but one hot air register in the room and that the heat is not distributed evenly throughout the room.\nPresbyterian Church Office,\nWINNIPEG, Oct. 14th, 1908\n\nTo the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nGovernment Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed a copy of a report of a Committee appointed\nto visit the Cecilia Jeffrey School.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Parliamentary appropriation provides for only thirty pupils at the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, and, as you were advised on the 14th ult., this number cannot be exceeded.\n\nKnowing the provision made for this school, you should not have taken in more pupils than the Department is prepared to pay for and there would not now be occasion to discharge any, a proceeding which might prove detrimental to the interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. F. T. Dodds,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Boarding School,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI received the other day a letter reporting that Mr. Dodds of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, had declined to receive a boy into the school who was seeking admission, and it was stated that this was the 10th child declined during the year. This was done because the Government grant allowed is for only 30 children, and they cannot afford on that amount to maintain a larger number. There are at present, I believe, 23 in the school, but it does seem unfortunate that the purpose of the school is being defeated simply for want of funds. Our Board is prepared to in some measure prevent such action as that, at the same time does it not seem desirable that we should be able to meet the requirements of that kind. The school is an expensive one,- the most expensive that we have, by far, because of its location. Now that it is maintained at so great an expense, the little additional expense necessary to meet the requirements of the situation ought not to be refused. Having done so much should we not do the rest? I will be glad if you will give this consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S./MBA.\nToronto January 17th\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have a letter from Dr. Ferguson, submitting the name of Miss Ethel C. Benson for appointment to the Cecilia Jeffrey School. She is from Nova Scotia; holds certificates as teacher from the Educational Department of the Province of Nova Scotia and has presented to the Western Committee testimonials from the Superintendent under whom she taught, and also from her College with references to several others such as President H. S. Stout of the Howard Payne College, Fayette, Mo., Rev. G. Ernest Forbes, New Glasgow, N.S., and Dr. David R. Boyd, 156 Fifth Ave., New York City. She is 25 years of age; a high-school graduate, and has had a year and a half experience in teaching. This seems a suitable appointment.\n\nMy one objection to it is that she comes a long way, which involves considerable expense in travel. However the difficulty of securing teachers increases, and I presume if it meets with your approval it would be well to appoint her.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. P.

I am afraid this year they will cut off from their source of supply. A little blasting would remove certain boulders, I believe, and open the channel. It would, of course, have to be a Government undertaking. Would it be within your province to make the suggestion and have the situation looked into?

This school has to bring in all supplies by boat from Kenora and between the location of the school and Kenora there is a narrow channel. When the water is low it is not possible for the vessel to navigate this channel. The Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. R. P.

There is only two feet five inches of water in the shallowest part of the passage at present which makes it impassable for everything but gasoline boats of trifling size. Even when the water is higher, the rapids are difficult and hazardous.\n\nWhen the writer visited the place a few days ago he counted nine propeller flingers in the water or on the bank which had evidently been broken off by steamers that had struck the rocks. And along the shore are thrown the remains of wires cables and brackets which had been broken in the attempt to warp steamers over the obstructions.\n\nThe undertaking is the public interest. Coal lake is a considerable body of water about fourteen miles long, one mile wide and about nineteen feet deep. Its only means of communication with the outer world is through Ash Rapids and the lake of the woods. The industries now in operation on Coal lake include two gold mines in operation, the W. H. Kodo and the L. A. M.

He went with the engineer and visited the rapids. He feels very strongly that the interests of that part of the country require prompt action. The following is his report which I take the liberty of sending to you:\n\n\"In support of the application to have the channel deepened at Ash Rapids, attention is directed to the following considerations:\n\n1.

I trust that it will be found and sent to you later.\n\nAn examination was made July 17th, and showed that the obstructions are in what are known as the Ash Rapids, connecting the Lake of the Woods with Shoal Lake, through which all boats taking in supplies to the Indian School (supported by the Presbyterian Church) must pass. The rapids are short and contracted, being only 30 feet wide from bank to bank. They are known as the Upper and Lower Rapids, separated by Lock Lake, a body of water about 1800 feet long. The difference in elevation of the Lake of the Woods and Lock Lake is 0.30 of a foot; and between Lock Lake and Shoal Lake 0.90 of a foot. These heights are very much augmented by the wind, which causes the water to rise in either lake, depending upon the way the wind blows.\n\nTo obtain a channel five feet deep, and 30 feet wide, it would be necessary to blast and dredge about 467 cubic yards boulders and solid rock. In the lower channel about 232 cubic yards of rock and boulders would require to be removed. As there is no plant which would be available for this work it would be expensive and would cost in the vicinity of $3500.00. The motor boat which the Mission uses draws 4\u00bd feet of water, so that a five foot channel would be necessary at the present time, when the water is extremely low in the lakes.\n\nThe necessity for improving these rapids is problematical. At present the Indian Mission or school are the principal ones using it.\nReferring to your letter of August 8th, calling attention to the difficulty experienced in navigating Ash Rapids near Shoal Lake, an extension of the Lake of the Woods, I enclose copy of a report from our District Engineer at Winnipeg in which he estimates the cost of excavating a channel at \u00a33500.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nOttawa, 26th September, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to letter from your Department of the 13th instant, and previous correspondence, regarding the necessity for excavating a channel through Ash Rapids near Shoal Lake, an extension of the Lake of the Woods, which work it is estimated by your district engineer at Winnipeg, will cost $3500.00, I have the honor to request that your Department will make provision in your Estimates of 1912-1913, for an amount to defray the cost of having the necessary work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy minister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 10th October, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your communication of the 6th October; and in reply desire to remind you that you have already been advised as to the Department's intention regarding the little school.\n\nAs regards the Round Lake school I may say that the Department will be disposed, provided you actually purchase material and get it on the ground during the winter, and also make all preparations for putting up the new building at that point (on plans prepared by the Department, or by yourself and approved by the Department) to pay you a per capita grant of $125 from the 1st April. The Department's architect has stated that he had a conversation with the Board of Directors and proposed to them a new plan for Crowland, which will also answer the needs at Round Lake.\n\nAs regards the Cecelia Jeffery school I may say that the matter seems to hang on the improvement to the channel. The cost of the improvements in question is estimated at $3500. The funds are available. The public work has been asked for an amount in their estimates, but it is not possible to present the same to the Board of Directors until the spring. The Board might be postponed indefinitely this moment feels that it would hardly be justified in consenting to pay the increased grant to the Cecelia Jeffery school from the 1st April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Moat, Manager Hudson's Bay Company, Moose Factory; F. B. Evans, Manager Hudson's Bay Company, Cochrane, Ont., and Rev. Jno. R. Sythell, Incumbent, Cochrane, Ont.

Yesterday, Dec. 11th, I wrote Mr. McPhie to go over and bring the mail from the camp. Mr. O'Brien, chemist in charge of the laboratory in connection with the Winnipeg water supply, said he would go with him as he had some business to attend to there. They were skating and when crossing Snowshoe Bay they came upon thin ice and both broke through and went down in the water at the same time, after breaking the ice at the edge in several attempts to get out but at last succeeded in getting on the ice where he lay for a short time chilled and exhausted to get his breath. Then,\nseeing Mr. Aitken with a heavy coat on struggling in the water and unable to get out, he went over to where he was and, believing that if he broke in again they would both drown, he went near enough the edge to seize Mr. Aitken's hand and, exhausted as he was himself, managed to pull him out of the water. Mr. Aitken himself assured me that he could not have got out if Alex had not come to his assistance, as he was becoming numb and helpless in the icy-cold water.\n\nI might add that an Indian passing a short distance from the place saw them struggling in the water and refused to go to their assistance because he feared that he might break in himself if he went near the spot.\n\nI think that this case might very reasonably be brought to the attention of the Secretary for the Carnegie Hero Fund.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nF. J. Dodds,\nPrincipal.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI wish to add that Mr. Dodds has given me particulars I had given him, in every detail and in only two days that such a boy as that came with me. Yours Truly,\n\nChas. P. Aitken.\nSir:-\n\nThe enclosed letter received from The Rev. Mr Dodds, Principal of Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School.

Dodds, Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey Boarding School, reporting a signal act of bravery on the part of Algo, an Indian pupil of the Institution. This boy, with his companion Mr. Aitkin, crossed \"Snowshoe\" Bay on the ice on their skates. Both persons broke through the ice at the same time and were struggling for life in the water. Algo succeeded in reaching a place of safety, but a short time after returned in his weakened condition to the rescue of his companion, whom he saved, but with difficulty. The fact that another Indian witnessed the accident, but refused, from fear, to go to the rescue, indicates the dangers of the situation.

I again enclose the extract referred to, and I have to request that you will carefully read it over and take steps to have the Department furnished without delay with the full information called for therein.

I now beg to enclose here-with a statement, of the accident, as far as can be given, and trust the same may be found satisfactory, and in order.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,-\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa, Ont:-\nInformation required by Carnegie Hero Fund Commission\n\nThe rescue took place on December 11, 1913, at 9 o'clock A.M. in Snowshoe Bay, at the west end of Thoral Lake, an arm of the Lake of the Woods, near the western boundary of the Province of Ontario.\n\nThe name of the rescuer is Alec Mandamin. He is in his 17th year, weighs 132 lbs., is 5' ft. 7 inches in height, and is at present, as he was at the time of the accident, a pupil of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Boarding School. His winter address is Sagoyet, Ont., summer-home, Ont.\n\nThe name of the man rescued is Charles E. Athien. His address is Sagoyet, Ont., age 23, height 6 ft. and \u00bd inch, weight 160 lbs. He is an analytical chemist in the employ of the Greater Winnipeg Water Commission.\n\nSnowshoe Bay, at the west end of Thoral Lake, where they were skating when the ice broke, precipitating them into the water, is about a mile in width and where the accident happened was in the middle of the bay. The water is 20 feet deep, in some supply wells, to which the rescuer went after a change of clothing could be obtained, is a mile and a half from the scene.\n\nThe two above mentioned were skating - located near each other about four or five yards, when they came upon thin ice which broke under their weight, precipitating them into the water simultaneously. The boy, Alec, wore his ordinary winter clothing without overcoat as he thought he would be warm enough skating without it; after being in the water about five minutes, during which time he\nmade several attempts to get out, the ice breaking again and again so his weight came on it, he succeeded in getting on the ice where he lay a few moments to recover breath. Then seeing Mr. Aitken still struggling in the water he went over to him and venturing near enough the edge of the broken ice to grasp his hand succeeded in pulling him out of the water on the ice. Naturally the boy might be expected to be unversed and somewhat exhausted by his plunge into the icy water and his subsequent efforts to get out the success of which seemed for a time doubtful.\n\nThe risk and danger consisted in this\u2014that the ice which had broken repeatedly under his weight while endeavouring to extricate himself might break again if he went sufficiently near the edge to grasp the man struggling in the water, but if he succeeded in getting hold of him the chances were twenty to one that the weight of the man in the water added to his own would cause the ice to break and both would be in the water again. He faced that danger and took the risk believing if that happened in the condition he was in then they would have both drowned. They can both swim fairly well but are not expert swimmers. They were in a precarious condition when they reached the school, chilled to bone, with their clothes frozen stiffly stiff. The boy was given dry clothes, hot drinks &c., and kept inside until thoroughly warm, he seemed none the worse afterwards.\n\nThere were no other eyewitnesses.\n\nMr. Aitken informed me afterwards that he could not have got out without assistance. He said that when the boy climbed the ice to pull him out his face was\nfelt out there was a firm determined expression upon it which said distinctly though inaudibly\u2014\"I will see you or die in the attempt.\"\n\nWe all think that he showed extraordinary coolness, courage and determination.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH.

Mandamin, No.29,Cecilia Jeffrey\nSchool, the ice gave way and we both went into the water simul-\ntaneously,encumbered as I was with a heavy Mackinaw Coat and\nthe Clare ice affording no hold,it is doubtful whether I could\nhave got out without assistance.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we went into the water,Alex. Mandamin\nmanaged to drag himself on to his stomach,on the ice. He then\ncame close to where I was and caught my hand pulling me on the\nice: Altogether I should judge the time I was in the water would\nbe about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen pulled on the ice it was as much as I could do to move\nmy arms and legs. I am deeply indebted to this boy,as I believe\nI could not have got out alone,no one else being in the vicinity\nat the time.\n\nAND I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believ-\ning it to be true,and knowing that it is of the same force and\neffect as if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada Evidence\nAct, 1893.\n\n(sgd) Chas.

We were in\nthe water I should think about five minutes when I succeeded\nafter several attempts, in getting out on the ice,. After resting\na moment and seeing Mr. Aitken still in the water, I went over\nwhere he was and getting near enough to catch his hand, succeeded\nin pulling him out of the water on to the ice. No one else\nwas near enough to give assistance.

It is hoped that these documents will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the Royal Canadian Humane Association in connection with the application laid before the Association for a medal for Mandamin in recognition of his act of bravery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of February 16, giving information on the case of Aloc, Mandamin, only received.\n\nThe Carnegie Hero Fund applies to acts in which conclusive evidence may be obtained showing that the person performing the act voluntarily risked his own life saving, or attempting to save, the life of a fellow-being.\n\nI beg to state that we have found it necessary to adopt a rule not to consider cases in which there were no eye-witnesses to the essential details of the act. Therefore, I regret to say, we cannot proceed further with this case. You will understand, I am sure, that the application of the rule in this instance is not in any way intended as a reflection upon the veracity of the rescuer or rescued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nIn December the Rev. P. T. Dodge, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, reported through Agent McKenzie that Alec Mandamin, No. 29 of the school, risked his life in endeavouring to save from drowning Mr. Charles E. Aitken. The matter was brought to the attention of The Carnegie Hero Fund with the request that Mandamin receive recognition for his bravery. The evidence, while conclusive, consists of a circumstantial account of the accident by Mandamin and by Mr. Aitken, the man who was rescued. There were seemingly no eye witnesses. The result is that The Carnegie Hero Commission states that it will not be possible for them to proceed further with the case as they have adopted a rule not to consider cases in which there were no eye witnesses of the essential details of the act.\n\nMandamin's act of bravery was also reported by the Department to The Royal Canadian Humane Association, and is still under consideration by that society.\n\nWhen Agent McKenzie first presented this case to the Department, (December 17th last), he remarked that he considered the boy should receive some recognition for his bravery. It is possible that he may yet be given a medal by\nby The Royal Canadian Humane Association, but I beg to point out that in the case of bravery exhibited by Indians in British Columbia the Department recognized the noble conduct of the individuals by granting assistance to them, and it occurs to me that we might do something out of the ordinary for Mandamin. If you approve of the suggestion his case might be noted as deserving of special consideration when he makes a start in life.\n\nAccountant,\n\nOttawa, 27th February, 1914.\nOttawa, 28th February, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th December, addressed to Agent McKenzie, of Kenora, copy of which letter is in the Department, regarding the case of Alec Mandamin, No. 29 of Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, I beg to say that the act of bravery in endeavouring to rescue from drowning Mr. C. K. Aitken was brought to the attention of The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, and although the evidence furnished by you indicates that the young man risked his life in an endeavour to rescue Mr. Aitken, the Manager of The Hero Fund Commission states that it will not be possible to make an award to Mandamin as the commission has adopted a rule not to consider cases in which there were no eye witnesses of the essential details of the act. He remarks that the application of the rule in this instance is not in any way intended as a reflection upon the veracity of the rescuer or rescued.\n\nThe Department has also been in correspondence with The Royal Canadian Humane Association in regard to Mandamin's case. You will therefore be advised in this connection at a later date.\n\nI may say that the Department desires to recognize Mandamin's act of bravery in a special manner and therefore when the young man is about to leave school it is desired that\n\nRev. F. T. Dodds,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Boarding School,\nKenora, Ont.\nthat you will make a report to Head-quarters stating what line of work he proposes taking up. The Department will then consider the question of assisting him to make a good start. It is intended in this way to mark approval of his bravery upon the occasion of his rescuing Mr. Aitken. You may communicate to Mandamin the Department's intentions in this matter. It is hoped that he will endeavour, when in school, to acquire as much knowledge as possible towards fitting himself for a useful life after he leaves the Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 2nd March, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that the Department will be glad to receive a reply to letter to you of the 16th February, regarding the case of Aloc Mandamin, on whose behalf application was made for a medal for bravery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This medal will be presented to Alex Mandamin in a suitable manner by Mr. MacKenzie in due time.\nExtract from Inspector Semmens' Report on the Kenora and Savanne Agencies. July 8, 1914.\n\nOriginal on File 427021-29\n\nComplaint was made that the children in the Cecilia Jeffrey boarding school were cruelly beaten by the Principal at times and the Indians were afraid the this would hurt the reputation of the Institution. The charge was made by Chief Red Sky in the presence of the Principal.\n\nIn reply to this, Principal Dodds said that the impression was exaggerated, that he never punished when any other method of maintaining discipline would meet the case and that he seldom punished at all severely.\n\nIt was further reported that one pupil was punished so severely that she fell sick and shortly after died in part it was thought the result of her humiliation.\n\nThis was on investigation found to be false as the girl in question had never at any time received severe chastisement.\n\nIt must be added that this charge had become common gossip all over the Lake of the Woods and was corrected by our party at every point. Not one pupil, however, could be obtained for the school at any point.\n\nSgd. John Semmens,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th March, 1914, of number 219657-1.Ty. I beg to say that on the 16th Instant, I presented Alex Bandemin of Shoal Lake, Band, with the medal issued by the Royal Canadian Humain Association, and can assure you he was a very proud boy, as was all his band.\n\nI now beg to enclose you a clipping from the Kenora Miner and News of the 16th, and one from the Winnipeg Telegram of the 19th, as requested in your letter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa Ont.:\nOttawa, July 31st, 1914\n\nSir,-\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Kenora and Severn Agencies in which you state that complaint was made that the children in the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School were cruelly beaten by the Principal at times and the Indians were afraid that this would hurt the reputation of the Institution, I beg to say that the Department would like to know whether you made inquiries in regard to this complaint and if so, what foundation there is for these charges. It is noted that you state that the reputation of the school suffered the consequence and that not one pupil could be obtained at any point along the lake of the Woods. You state that you investigated the charge laid against the principal that a girl pupil was punished so severely that she fell sick and shortly afterwards died it is thought partly from the humiliation and that you found this charge to be false as the children at any time never received severe chastisement. It is not however, denied by the Principal that corporal punishment is administered in this school, but he claims that the punishment is not at all severe, but whether severe or not, it sets the Indians against the school and it would be better if the Principal would adopt some other means of maintaining discipline in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAust.

Powis, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nRoyal Canadian Humane Association,\nHamilton, Ont.\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\n\nLake of the Woods Inspectorate\n\nWinnipeg, Man., August 16th\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo in regard to the report circulated on the Lake of the Woods to the effect that one of the pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School had been severely punished by the Principal and shortly after had sickened and died. It was thought partly from the effects of the punishment.\n\nIn reply to your question as to whether an investigation was made into the circumstances of the case I beg to say that the matter became the subject of immediate enquiry by me.\n\nThe result of my finding was that the report was untrue as intimated in my Report of the Kenora Agency dated July 8th, 1914.\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\nThe girl in question was classed as good and never at any time did she merit punishment. She died from a complication of troubles resulting from measles. Her death was regretted by all.\n\nThe Principal gave me his solemn avowal that he never punished in his life and Mrs. Dods confirmed the statement. She was acting Matron at the time of the girl's demise.\n\nI made enquiries as to the origin of the report and found that a Conjurer a member of the Snow Lake Band No. 40 had circulated the report. His attitude toward the School has been one of continued opposition. He is an old-time pagan and dislikes the religious element adopted in the management of the Institution and has done everything in his power to prevent parents from sending their children to the School.\n\nWhen this was ascertained I made it my business to correct the report at every point and Mr. Dods was present to confirm the statements of the Agent and myself by his own testimony.\n\nThe fact remains that the Principal has resorted to corporal punishment at times and the children have reported this to\ntheir parents and dissatisfaction is the result and recruiting has been made difficult in this way.\n\nThe Principal has been advised by me to adopt other means of correcting the pupils so as restore confidence and I hope that my next visit will find a happier state of things.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Simmons\nInspector of Indian Agencies & Schools\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, August 19, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant reporting on the charge made against the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School that a girl pupil was punished so severely that she fell sick and died.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your report exonerates the principal from all blame in connection with this girl's death. The Department agrees with you that the principal should adopt other means of correcting pupils instead of resorting to corporal punishment, as the Indians are so prone to take offence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. John Seaman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed, etc., sent me by Mr. J. T. Scott, Chief of the Local Mission. Enclosed at the back of this letter under the heading \"India Affairs.\"\n\nI engaged him in Oct. 1913 to take a barge load of supplies from Ottawa to Butteville, a distance about 56 miles. After the barge was loaded he took some time to see that the barge would not go through the lock. He then loaded the barge and proceeded to Butteville with the barge loaded with supplies. I was obliged to get two small barges to load the barge with the load.\n\nAfter taking charge of the barges he allowed me to send it back to Ottawa a few days later.\n\nArrived at Shoal Lake Mission Nov. 18th, and left until Nov. 27th. We went to Butteville Bay with the barge. On Nov. 4th we took barges around to the Bay, about 2 hours, about 5 miles from the mission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nHe volunteered the barges in about two or three weeks. I asked him if he could take them back with him as he was going to return to another load. He promised me he would turn up by then in the morning and take them to return for another load. As he was going anyway, I never showed up until Nov. 7th. Came up and took the barges to the basement. They remained there until this summer.\n\nI was frozen in at Indina Bay with my men until Nov. 14th. When I got back Red Sky took his Indians to Pointe au Chene to build a station in the CPR about 18 miles.\n\nOn account of failure to carry out his contract with me, I was obliged to elect a load from myself to Indina Bay and haul the lumber in with teams. If he had done what he agreed, I could have completed the buildings in 20 days. Saved my time and expenses consequently we had to work all winter.

McKenzie Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKawartha, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 14th inst. To hand in reference to the number of pupils in Cecilia Jeffrey school for which the per capita grant is paid. I understand when the building was constructed and enlarged in accordance with the plans of the government architect that the agreement providing for 40 pupils only was cancelled and that payment would be made for a larger number of pupils according to the capacity of the building and the accommodation afforded. The reason, as I understand it, for limiting the number of pupils in any school is to prevent overcrowding. I had asked to have the building enlarged sufficiently to accommodate 70 or 75 pupils, and when space was provided for a larger number I can see no reason why we should be tied down to an old agreement which should have been automatically cancelled.\n\nAfter the expense of enlarging and improving the school, visiting the Indians in order to\nassure them of the additional comfort and accommodation, and when they are willing to send their children to the number of 60 or 70, it is not very encouraging to be informed that the per capita grant is provided for only forty pupils.\n\nThis makes the grant for much quarter alone about $200 less than we had expected, and at a time, too, when the advance in the price of almost everything makes the keeping up of the school and the carrying on of the work a very difficult problem even with the grant paid for all the children attending.\n\nI therefore suggest that the department be informed through its Agent or Inspector, or both, of the maximum number of pupils our school can accommodate, and that the per capita grant be paid for all pupils admitted attending, up to that number, from the first of January, 1915.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nF. T. Goddard,\nPrincipal.\nRev. Dr. Grant,\nToronto,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter which I received from the Indian Agent at Kenora, in reference to the number of pupils for which the per capita grant is paid in our school, together with a copy of my reply to his letter. I suppose the \"document\" mentioned is in existence somewhere, but I never saw it and do not know where it is.\n\nPerhaps you can take this question up with the Indian Department and bring some pressure to bear on it in order to obtain the per capita grant for a larger number. We have 78 regularly admitted pupils in the school now, and I had expected that before the summer was past the number would be up to 65 or over. But it is impossible to carry on the school and keep out of debt with that number if we receive payment for only 40 pupils. So if we are not yet the grant for a larger number we shall be compelled to cut down the number of pupils again to about 40, and I shall be very sorry to do that as it would injure the school.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nN. J. Davis\nNo. 108-18\n\nApril 14, 1915\n\nIndian Agent's Office, Sioux Butte\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Department in which they say\u2014\n\n\"The March quarter return shows that there was an average attendance during the quarter of 46-65 pupils. In this connection I beg to inform you that the per capita grant is provided for only forty pupils at this school. The return shows an attendance of 54 pupils during the quarter, while the agreement with the school authorities for the maintenance and management of this school provided that only forty pupils should be in residence.\"\n\nWill you kindly give me some explanation in regard to this as I understood you were allowed 60 pupils. But as I never got any information from the Department I hardly know what to say.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.S. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. T.J.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am forwarding to you the correspondence that I have received from the Cecilia Jeffrey School. There must be some mistake here, as this school has been remodelled at great expense, and the capacity of the school increased. I do not see any reason why we should not receive the per capita grant for the full number of pupils in the school, especially from the first of this present year, as we have had this increased accommodation now for nearly two years, and the school is in Grade A and entitled to a per capita grant of $125. I hope, in view of the enclosed financial statement, you will see, not only the wisdom, but the absolute necessity of our receiving a grant for all the pupils we have cared for in this school.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.C.-A.V.\nMay 8th, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with enclosures, relative to an increase in the pupilage at the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School. This was a matter which was under consideration when your letter arrived, and correspondence had been had with the local Agent. I have decided to grant an increase of 20 in the pupilage, making it 60, and to anticipate this increase from the first of the March quarter, that January 1st last.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMemoranda Re Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School\n\n(1) For some years the Cecilia Jeffrey School has been poorly managed as my reports have shown from time to time.\n\n(2) There have been extenuating circumstances which have also been mentioned in my reports and while I have criticised as in duty bound I have never been without hope of better things when the conditions should improve.\n\n(3) Lately the Department has increased the capacity of the School and improved the heating etc so that the Staff has had a better chance to show good results.\n\n(4) The attendance has much increased within the last year and with the consequent additional income the Principal has made much advancement in efficient management so that our last report shows a very good state of things\u2014indeed a complete transformation has taken place which we have had great pleasure in reporting.\n\n(5) The present attendance of Pupils is 54. The average attendance for last quarter was 46-65. More pupils are applying so that the attendance for the coming season is estimated at 65.\n\n(6) Lately the Department through Agent Mc Kenzie has notified the Principal the Rev F.T. Dodds that the grant can only be paid for 40 pupils as per agreement on record. This means a loss of \u00a3200.00 on the March Quarter and this amount of loss will be greater in the June quarter when it is expected more pupils will be in attendance.\n\n(7) There are sixty children's cots in the Dormitories and my report of February 1914 states that there is accommodation for 60 to 65 pupils. It seems to me to be advisable to have the Department authorize the admission of a greater number than forty so that the present level of efficiency may be maintained, and the number now on the roll be kept in the School. Where so many applicants are found willing to attend it is a pity to turn them down, especially as there are hundreds of children on the Inspectorate not attending any School.\n\nRespectfully Yours\n\nSennens\n\nGlen Campbell Esquire\nChief Inspector Indian Agencies &c\nMy dear Mr Scott,\n\nI append herewith a Memo from Mr Semmens re Cecilia Jeffrey School which I am sure will interest you.\n\nThe case seems to be that the Department since its agreement with the Church has enlarged and improved the accommodation in the School to such an extent that 65 pupils can now be cared for.\n\nWhen the limit was forty the Principal was tied up for funds and the School was run in a more or less slovenly manner. With the grant for 65 the work will be very much better done. We have the accommodation and we have about 500 children on the various Reserves in need of education.\n\nI bring this to your personal attention in the hope that you will give instructions that assistance will be given the Church to the limit of the School in order to insure the best results for the outlay in buildings, improvements etc by the Department.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies\nMay 11th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Campbell,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th. instant with enclosure.

We have already 59 on the roll, and we had an average of 57 for the month of June. We have applications already, verbal or by letter, for the admission of 10 more children. The Indian Agent at Kenora, Mr. McKenzie, agrees with me that we have easily room for 70 pupils.\n\nIf the attention of the Department were directed to this matter, I think they might reconsider it and raise the number to 70.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

It seems too bad, when we have gone to the expense of providing buildings, the Government are not prepared to allow the full quota of pupils that the school will accommodate. I thought the idea was to give education to as many of those Indians as possible. The reason given, that they have not been provided for in the estimates, is, in my judgment, not sufficient.

September 10th 1915\n\nDear Mr Scott,-\n\nOn the morning of the 8th inst I received the following telegram:\n\nRev John Semmens\nKenora Ont Sept 7th 1915\n\nAn important question has arisen regarding two of our pupils. Consulted Agent about it and he thought you ought to come to Kenora or to the school at once to investigate and decide what should be done. Will you wire me at Kenora if you can come and when.\n\nP.T. Dodds\n\nTo this I replied:\n\nRev P. T. Dodds\nCare Indian Agent\nKenora- Ont\n\nWill leave for Kenora Thursday morning. Better meet me there.\n\nJohn Semmens\n\nI left Winnipeg on the first train September 9th and arrived at Kenora at 11:20 A.M.\n\nMr Dodds and Agent Mc Kenzie met me at the Depot and we made arrangements to meet immediately after dinner.\n\nMet Mr Dodds as arranged at 1:30 P.M. in Agent's Office Kenora and asked the Principal to state his case. He said:\n\nTwo of the girl pupils of the school have broken the laws of the School in a very serious way. They were taken out by Miss Mc Cormie with other girls for exercise and after going some distance into the woods Beatrice Mah-lah-Pen-Ais aged 15 and Betty Mah-jah-ke-sik of the same age decided to return to the school and were allowed to do so. Instead of returning to the School they went into the woods with some boys and returned some considerable time after. This had occurred on Sunday the 5th of September.\nclaimed that these girls had been stubborn and wilful in various ways and would not try to learn English and now that this had happened he felt that they should either be sent to Elkhorn or be expelled and sent back to their Reserve.\n\nI asked the Principal if he had held any investigation at the time the offence happened and he admitted that he had only heard from the assistant Matron that this had been reported to her by a pupil.\n\nAt this point attention was called to the fact that Miss Cormie had been remiss in permitting these girls to return to the School alone and that the Principal should have informed himself thoroughly by a personal enquiry from all parties concerned.\n\nLearning that the two girls had been brought in with a view to their immediate expulsion and return to their homes I sent for them and questioned them closely. They admitted that they had been in the company of two boys and that they had walked with the boys knowing this to be a violation of school regulations. They denied having had any improper relations with the boys and there was no evidence to prove that this was the case.\n\nIt was found further that they were orphans and had no very near friends to take care of them at Lac De Lille Laos and it was considered that further misfortune might possibly await them there and that danger of want and starvation might result so after reasoning the circumstances out I came to the following conclusions:\n\n(1) It was their first serious offence and reasonable leniency should be shown.\n\n(2) There was no proof of actual immorality and they should have the benefit of the doubt.\n\n(3) They are under age and might go wrong or starve if sent home and continued guardianship would be beneficial.\n\n(4) Sending them to another school might if undesirable consequences should follow involve the reputation of that School.\n\nWith these thoughts in my mind I administered a severe reproof to the girls, and warned them of consequences, and made them promise never again to break laws made for their protection, and demanded a\nI solemnly promise from each girl that they would observe school regulations for the future if taken back. When this promise had been given in the presence of the gentlemen present in the room, the girls standing on their feet and making affirmation as required, I turned to Mr. Dodds and asked him if after this he would give his consent to try the honesty of their resolution for a longer period. He consented to take them home and see if better conduct would manifest itself.\n\nAt the same time I felt that it would be necessary to exercise a special watch over these girls and if it should be found that they were to become mothers the fact should be reported to the Department with a request for their expulsion. This was impressed upon the Principal as he seemed to think that the Agent could take such action without reference to the Superintendent General or his deputy.\n\nSteamer Wanderer left at once for the Cecilia Jeffrey School and I returned to Winnipeg the same evening.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Summers\nInspector of Indian Agencies & Schools\nOttawa, September 21, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant submitting a report on your investigation on the conduct of two of the pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that the principal should be competent to handle matters of this kind without putting you to the expense and inconvenience of holding an investigation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 12th instant in which you state that reports from the Cecilia Jeffrey School show that four members of the staff have left, I have to ask you, when you next visit this school, to ascertain the reason for these members of the staff leaving and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Bennens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nINFORMATION OFFICE, KENORA, ONT.\nOctober 26, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose for your consideration a letter I have received from the Principal of the Kenora Boarding School, asking to be allowed (70) seventy grant earning pupils for reasons stated, as his school has ample room for that number.\n\nSome time ago we could not get sufficient pupils for the schools, but now that the Indians are willing to send their children, it is hard to turn them away, which if done will soon have a detrimental effect on securing pupils when required and would recommend, if at all possible, they be allowed the number of pupils asked for.\n\nI may add that the same thing applies to the Cecelia Jeffrey Boarding School. In fact both these schools have at present several children in the schools over and above the number allowed them rather than turn them away, and for which they do not receive any grant.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval and that you will be pleased to allow both these schools seventy pupils in future.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. R.S. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, December 5, 1915.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent McKenzie reports that the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School is anxious to have the number of great camping pupils increased from 60 to 70.\n\nThe question of accommodation was referred to Mr. Ogilvie, Architect of this Department, sometime ago and he states that the school can accommodate that number. They are allowed for 60 pupils now and have an enrolment of 66. As this is an expensive school to carry on, owing to the locality in which it is situated, I would recommend that they be granted the increase asked for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Borden\nOttawa, December 10, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of the 26th of October, last, in regard to an increase in the pupilage of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School I beg to say that this matter will be brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General on his return to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Claims,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI am writing to inform you that, on account of ill health, Miss Bates has had to give up her work as teacher for the present at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and we have succeeded in securing the services of Miss Brodie. She was a teacher who gave splendid satisfaction before in that same school.\n\nWe have also appointed Miss Lucia Becker to the school at Alberni in place of Mr. McKnight, who had to resign on account of ill health.\n\nI am sorry also to have to report that Rev. J. T. Ross wishes to withdraw from the work at Ahousaht in the spring, and Mr. Iversach has resigned the principalship of Birtle School.

At that time the Department did not see its way clear to grant the request of the Principal, but upon further consideration it has been decided to allow this increase to take effect from the first of April next, being the beginning of the new fiscal year.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 11, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Simmons in his report on the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School again calls attention to the frequent changes in the staff, the cause of which he attributes to constant strain and overwork.\n\nThat these changes are not conducive to the best interests of the school is evident by reference to the quarterly returns. The last return received shows that there are twenty-seven pupils in the first standard who have been two years and over in the school. Three of these pupils have been six years in the first standard, two five years, three four years, eleven three years and eight two years. This is most unsatisfactory and should be remedied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. G. Grant,\nSuperintendent,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nCon Federation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nYour letter of April 11th, File No. 219657/1, received,\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey School. I note what you say as to the Inspector's report of the conditions in the school, and I am taking these matters up with the Principal. There have been very few changes, as far as the teaching staff is concerned. The new teacher that was appointed, because of ill health, had to withdraw, and the former teacher took her place, and is still in the work. However, as soon as I hear from the Principal, I will let you know how conditions may be improved.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. J. D. McLean\nCOPY\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont., Apr. 25th, 196\n\nRev. Dr. Grant,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Grant:\n\nYours of the 13th inst. to hand, with letter from the Secretary of the Indian Department enclosed. Miss Brodie, our teacher, insists that the figures quoted and the statements made in the letter from the Department, in reference to the handling of pupils, are correct. But she refuses to promote pupils from one standard to another until they are prepared for it by a thorough knowledge of all that is included in the standard they are leaving. She states that usually it requires from two to three years for white children to pass the first and second parts of standard one, whereas they are not handicapped as Indian children are by ignorance of the English language.\n\nIn reference to changes in the staff last summer, we had quite a number which seemed unavoidable. Since then there have been none except the addition of one more member. But what has changed in other departments to do with the class-room? Miss Brodie has been in charge of that for two and a half years, except the short time (about two months) that Mr. Bates relieved her. How can the \"most unsatisfactory\" conditions in the class-room be attributed to frequent changes there. If the criticism is intended to apply to and reflect upon those who preceded Miss Brodie in the class-room then I think it is rather broad.\n\nMiss Brodie assures me that this unsatisfactory state of affairs is no reflection upon her methods or work, and has no reference to her. To prove the latter, she has in her possession a copy of the part of Inspector Semmens' official report which refers to her and the class-room work, sent to her privately by Inspector Semmens, and which is so flattering and eulogistic that she is ashamed to show it to anyone. She, however, stated incidentally that Nurse Stratton had seen it and had pronounced it \"every word true\".\n\nNow, waiving altogether the injudicioumess, not to say irregularity, of such procedure on the part of an inspector, I heard Mr. Semmens express dissatisfaction with Miss Brodie's method of teaching when he was in the class-room at the time of his inspection, and I leave it with him and Miss Brodie to harmonize the copy of his report with either, which gives her so much satisfaction, and the one sent to Ottawa upon which is based the letter sent to you complaining of \"most unsatisfactory\" conditions in the class-room. Miss Brodie has no other duties outside the class-room, but she is not strong. She could not continue teaching in schools for white children very long at a time. She says she\nIs working now to the limit. I have thought that if an assistant principal were sent he might relieve the pressure of work in the class-room sometimes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. T. Dodds.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, which is an answer to the complaint made by the Inspector in regard to the work in the class room. In the light of this, it seems somewhat difficult to understand why the Inspector should have reported to you as he has. I may say that we are trying to arrange for an assistant to Mr. Dodds, and hope, by another year, to strengthen the work by this method.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F. [Signature]\nI further suggest that a bread mixer should be obtained and sent to the institution. This would reduce the amount of manual labor very greatly, mix the bread more thoroughly and make a better article than is now produced by hand mixing.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe have just received a communication from Miss Lyla Stratton, the nurse at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora. She has resigned from her position there, and is coming to Toronto to wait on her mother.\n\nWe are taking steps at once to secure another competent nurse to take her place.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EG.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H. Edmison\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few weeks ago, we wrote you stating that Miss Stratton, nurse at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, had resigned. I am now writing to submit the name of Mrs. Katharine M. Fraser as successor.\n\nMrs. Fraser is not a graduate nurse, but has had some training. I enclose copy of a testimonial written by Dr. Patrick of Glasgow in 1901. Following that, she took a course of surgery in the Glasgow, Scotland, Royal Infirmary, in preparation for work as a Home or Foreign Missionary. She also did simple dispensary work in the Medical Mission of Cowcaddens, United Free Church, along with the outdoor and home nursing of the district where she was deaconess for eleven years, before coming to Canada.\n\nMrs. Fraser is a widow of one of our missionaries. She is, I judge, a woman of nearly forty years of age. Her\ninfluence and personality, I am sure, would mean much to the school. The only drawback, of course, is that she has not the full standing of a nurse, but the training she has had, together with the eleven years' deaconess work, ought to have made her pretty competent. We have tried in various directions to secure a graduate nurse, but so far have not succeeded. You understand nurses are very hard to get at the present time. Cecilie Jeffrey is a very isolated spot. This makes the position less attractive.\n\nI trust we may be able to secure the consent of the Department to the appointment of Mrs. Fraser for one year. At the end of that period, we will be in a position to judge of her fitness. Mrs. Fraser is free to go forward at once.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.

GEMMERS ON THE CECILIA JAFFREY BKG.\n\nREPORT DATED: August 22nd, 1916.\n\nThe very efficient nurse, Miss Stratton has I fear severed her connection with the school because she is compelled to accept $40.00 per month and board instead of the $50.00 and board formerly allowed her by the Department. Should she finally decide to retire a very great loss will be sustained for she has been very helpful and successful in her work.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR J. BENNETT ON THE CECILIA JAFFREY BDO.\n\nREPORT DATED - August 22nd, 1916.\n\nI very seriously pressed upon the Principal's attention the need of removing the stables and hog pens etc from the Point to the Main land both in the interests of appearance and health. He quite agrees with the suggestion but the question of expense is always a delaying factor. Meantime the atmosphere is polluted and appearances are unsightly and a possible menace to health is there.\n\nI urged in last report the purchase by the Department of a bread mixing plant for this school. My reasons for doing so were, (1) It would save the girls from much muscular exertion in mixing dough for seventy pupils and seven or eight members of Staff, (2) The dough mixed in this way would be cleaner than if made by the hands of the children and freer from contamination., (3) The thoroughness of the mixing machine would make a lighter and more nourishing article than is produced by prevailing methods and this would contribute to the general health.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th Ultimo No. 219657/1, with reference to the appointment of Mrs Katharine M.

Pupils are rather refractory. The Indian language is still used by pupils to an undesirable extent. The Indian parents visit the school frequently and remain for meals and talk a great deal with the children. More than this it is feared that they encourage their children in disobedience and they resent every form of punishment. Complaints of the pupils are too readily believed by their guardians and the Principal finds that their interference makes his work doubly hard.\n\nMuch trouble has been occasioned lately by the exchange of notes between girl and boy pupils and clandestine meetings have been arranged and carried out. Several children have run away lately and have been shielded and retained by the fathers. Happily this was corrected by our visit and the children are back again and it is to be hoped that advice given may have the effect of checking the abuses which have occasioned much trouble and misunderstanding. The Principal is very kind and conscientious and forbearing, but he must needs assert his authority and retain his position as Master of the situation. He gives me the assurance that he never punishes severely and that he only uses a strap on the open hands of law breakers.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nInspector Hemmings, who visited the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, on the 23rd ultimo, has forwarded his report to the Department.\n\nIt is noted that the Inspector states that the deportment of the pupils outside the school room is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be to your advantage in the maintenance of discipline if you discouraged too frequent visits of parents to the school, and discontinued furnishing meals.\n\nThe Inspector states that he assured that you have not punished the pupils severely, and this action on your part is to be commended; still, the Department will, in future, expect you to take a decided stand and deal firmly with those who transgress the rules, in order that the present abuses in the children's conduct may be corrected.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Y.T. Dodds,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Boarding School\nInnisfil, Ont.\nI am about to make a report that four boys, two from West Angle came in last summer, one from Aurora, son of the late Edward Land, one John Edward Kipling from the Dollies, and one Chief David Lands from Selkirk. These boys, together with some others, had been implicated in the pilfering of goods and breaking into and stealing from three rooms in the school. I punished only one of them mildly, the other three not at all. That was a week ago or a little over. Since then I talked with them and they promised to do better, but have not. They are insolent, disobedient and defiant. Today, however, they were so reckless and insolent that I determined to have them brought before me in the office today, but they shipped out in the night.\n\nI think that all those boys who have left the school without permission ought to be brought under\ncontrol in some way, and either compelled to return to the school or placed somewhere under restraint where they could not run home wherever they pleased. And I think the most effective way would be for the Indian Department to take action in the matter. If these boys are allowed to leave the school when they choose to do so and to remain away and be left free, their actions will infect the whole school. It has done so already to a considerable degree, and this infection will spread. Thugs to run away are quite common already among the younger pupils if they are subjected to discipline or control, or if any restraint is put upon them. So you see this has become a vital question, and if action is not taken soon, the efficiency of the school will, I believe, be greatly impaired and our efforts for the education of our Indians in large measure frustrated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN OFFICE.

PP TT Dodds, Principal of Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, for your consideration and advice.\n\nI may say that there appears to be some friction between the Principal and Pupils, what it is I do not know, when I visited the school in January last in Company of Inspector Semmens, there was trouble then. A girl had run away in the night, and a boy the next day, I got the two brought back and thought all was going to be well, but it did not stop there.\n\nOn the 15th February, Mr Dodds wrote me that four of their oldest boys had run-away during the night, I have not heard whether he got them back or not, and now comes this report of four more boys, having run away. There was also a report that four of the big Girls made an attempt to leave during the night in February last, the night after the four boys ran away, but was caught, before they got away.\n\nThere is sure something wrong out there, and I am of the opinion, or Inspector Semmens should be sent down to investigate the whole business, and would suggest that if these pupils are returned to the school, they should be transferred at once to the Elkhorn School.\n\nIt would be useless to attempt to get these boys at the present time, as the cost would be very high, will be guided by your instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Agent,\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nMarch 26, 1917.\n\nThe Schools Branch,\n\nYou had better ask Inspector Semmens to go and investigate this matter and advise the authorities of the Presbyterian Church that Mr. Dodds seems to have lost control of the situation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. T. I. A.\nOttawa, March 29, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nReports on the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School have lately been received, which show that the Principal, the Rev. Mr. Dodds, is lacking in administrative ability, proper discipline is not maintained, the pupils are refractory, the Indian language is used to an undesirable extent, the parents are allowed to visit the school frequently and remain for meals and talk a great deal with the children, which unsettles them and encourages them in disobedience. Much trouble has lately been caused by the exchange of notes between the boy and girl pupils and clandestine meetings have been arranged and carried out. Desertions are frequent and there is constant friction between the pupils and the Principal. The Principal, however, is reported to be very kind and conscientious and forbearing, but he has failed to assert his authority and make himself master of the situation.\n\nThe Department is of the opinion that a man with more force of character than the present Principal should be placed in charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All the Indians were sorry when the other principle left here at it. If he's going to stay any longer the school will go on worse. We can get him to do what ought to be done.

Sir,\n\nSince writing you on the 29th of March, last, in reference to the management of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School I beg to say that a report has been received from our Inspector, which shows that no improvement in the management of this school has taken place since then and I cannot do better than quote from the Inspector's report as follows:\n\n\"The history of the school named since last inspection has not been marked by that tranquility, which is most desirable; nor by that harmony of action between officers which one loves to observe.\n\n\"Quite a number of the children have run away, and have travelled through all sorts of hardships to reach their distant homes. When such things happen on an extensive scale, one begins to look about for some adequate cause, and careful enquiry showed that two reasons were given, first, too much hard work, and second frequent punishment. Information showed that boys were not treated with the same leniency which marked the treatment of the girls, and that when the Principal enforced discipline he displayed considerable temper, possibly forgetting his own strength, and without realizing that the subjects of correction were only children after all.\n\n\"While this information may in the main be correct\n\nRev. J. H. Edmonson, B.A.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\"\nIt is nevertheless to be received with some reserve. Indian children are not subject to much severity at home and it would perhaps be better for them if they were. Parents and guardians sympathize too deeply with the juniors and, it is believed, that they encourage them to resent all forms of punishment. The Principal is a good man and it is hardly likely that he would resort to corporal punishment such as is said to be given or that he would allow his temper to become ungovernable as reports suggest.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that the boys are held to be well nigh incorrigible; and on the other hand, the Principal is regarded as hasty and severe in his chastisements. Pupils lack interest in their work and prefer the hardships of a wild run through the forest to remaining under the discipline given.\n\n\"The Chiefs of Reserves No. 39 and 40 living within a mile or so of the school complain that days are allowed to elapse from the time of desertion before they were notified of the flight of the boys; and that, in the meantime, such a start was gained that they were unable to trace and bring them back. Had the facts been given to them in due time they might have tracked and overtaken them and restored them to the custody of the management, but delay was unfortunate.\n\nFurther than this, bad feeling seems to exist between the Chiefs and the Principal; so much so, that the latter has notified the Indians that he will not allow them to get meals at the institution, or travel on the steamer, or have their freight brought out from Kenora free, as aforetime. It is understood that this action was taken in punishment for the offence of sending a letter of complaint to the secretary of Indian Affairs last winter. In this the Principal may not have been very judicious. Our conclusion was\nWas that very unpleasant relations between the school management and the people have been established, which it will take sometime to overcome.\n\n\"It is hoped that the arrival of the new Assistant Principal, Mr. Matthews, who takes special charge of the boys, will be able to help matters considerably, if he proves to be equable in temperament, wise in action and moderate in the exercise of authority.\n\n\"In speaking to the Indians we counselled patience and fair play so that Mr. Matthews might have a chance to show what was in him; and we urged them not to find fault too quickly, or to encourage pupils to be insubordinate, but to report all wrongs to their Agent or Inspector, rather than to take affairs in their own hands.\n\n\"There was not that harmony between the Matron and the subordinate officers which we could have desired to find. This raises the question as to whether it is best to have the Principal and his wife in command in the same institution. Sympathies may be so strong between them that a sort of family compact appears. In this case others may for self protection criticise so freely as to awaken secret dislike which later manifests itself in opposition. So often this kind of thing grows from more to more until some one must go to preserve the peace.\n\n\"I have no animosity towards Mr. and Mrs. Dodds and I think that I am a friend of the school, but my interest in the work of the Department compels me to give as correct a view as possible to my superior officers and in my humble opinion things have not been promising of late.\"\n\nIn view of this report the Department is forced to the conclusion that the present Principal will not make a success of this school and it would be to the interests of\nof the institution that a change should be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I, however, think there will always be trouble there, at least until there is some change made.\n\nIn fact the school is not at all what it should be. Mr. Matthews, who was appointed there as assistant principal, is no more than a common chore boy, and he resents it very much.

Sir,\n\nOn the 29th of March of last year your attention was called to the lack of administrative ability of the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School and the Department expressed the opinion that a man with more force of character than the present Principal, the Rev. Mr. Dodds, should be placed in charge of this school.\n\nFurther reports were received, showing that proper discipline was not maintained there, and on the 4th of August, last, you were given a precis of the Inspector's report, which showed that no improvement in the management of the school had taken place since the Department's letter of the 29th of March.\n\nOn the 10th of August you wrote the Department saying that the matter would be taken up at once with the Presbytery authorities and the Women's Missionary Society and the Department would be informed of the results of their deliberations. Up to the present time no such report has been received, although the matter has been brought to your notice on five different occasions.\n\nOn the 4th ultimo you informed the Department that the commission appointed by the Winnipeg Presbytery to visit the school would go there in two weeks' time and that they were arranging to reach Cecilia Jeffrey on Wednesday, the 20th ultimo. If the visit was made the Department would like to know the result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. J. H. Edmison, B.A.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWinnipeg, February 26th, 1918.\n\nREPORT of Commission of Presbytery appointed to investigate conditions at \"Cecilia Jeffries Boarding School\".\n\nYour Committee beg to report:\n\nYour committee visited the Cecilia Jeffries Boarding School on February 20th to 24th, devoting Thursday 21st and Friday 22nd wholly to investigating conditions there.\n\nWe went carefully into the matters complained of in the documents submitted by the Department of Indian Affairs under date of August 4th, 1917, first, with the Principal, Rev. F. T. Dodds, afterwards with a number of Indians, including chiefs Nos. 39 and 40, and finally with each member of the staff separately. Most of the forenoon and the whole of the afternoon of the 22nd was spent in hearing the Indians.\n\nTo find that there is constant friction between the Indians and the School, which became serious a year ago when it was manifested by an epidemic of truancy on the part of the pupils, frequent punishment, and later a refusal on the part of Indians to allow pupils to return to the school. The prejudices on the part of the Indians against the school management was aggravated by the action of the Principal in discontinuing the furnishing of meals to the Indians and his refusal to carry them on the steamer to and from Kenora as in the past. This condition of unrest and insubordination has not been removed, and your committee has made a very earnest effort to discover the real root of the whole trouble.\nIn conducting its investigation your committee proceeded along the line suggested by the document forwarded by the Department of Indian Affairs, and in presenting its report will do so by discussing serially the several paragraphs of that document.\n\n1. \"Quite a number of children have run away and have travelled through all sorts of hardships to reach their distant homes. When such things happen on an extensive scale, one begins to look about for some adequate cause, and careful inquiry showed that two reasons were given\u2014first, too much hard work, and second, frequent punishment. Information showed that boys were not treated with the same leniency which marked the treatment of girls, and that when the Principal enforced discipline he displayed considerable temper, possibly forgetting his own strength, and without realizing that the subjects of correction were only children after all.\"\n\nThe following is a summary of the truancy cases and the circumstances attending the same according to the discovery made by your committee.\n\nThe case of\u2014\n\n1. Wilfred Redsky: who ran away to his home three quarters of a mile across the bay at the end of December, 1916, because he had been punished by hand strapping for having written a suggestive letter to one of the girls. A few weeks later, on the arrival of the Indian Agent and Inspector, the father brought the boy to the school and lodged a complaint against the Principal of cruelty. Evidence as to the nature of the offence and the character of the punishment was given. The representative of the Department expressed no disapproval of the action of the Principal but instructed the father to leave the boy at the school. The boy remained until the July closing, at which time he was unwilling to go home with his father and\nran into the woods and hid while the other children were being taken away. A week later the father returned and by force took the lad away in his canoe.\n\nOn the Agent's visit in August, Redaby was summoned to explain why he would not send his children back. He said \"Because he did not want his children killed\". On being reminded of his son's unwillingness to go home in July, he admitted in the presence of the Agent and members of the staff that because of severe punishment at home the boy preferred being at the school.\n\n2. Samuel Laird, Emma Lichtning and Joseph Redaby:- who ran away about the end of January 1917. These boys had been punished by hand strapping for a clandestine meeting with some of the girls in a house at some distance from the school. They had left the school after dark, but all were discovered and brought back the same night. Six girls and four boys were involved in this adventure. Some days later the three boys named escaped from the school about 11 P.M., but their absence was not discovered until next morning. Laird went north, it was afterwards learned, over the Ingolf trail with which he was familiar, and on to his home at White Dog Reserve. The other two went south to the North West angle, and later to Buffalo Bay and Assiniboia. The Principal has made inquiries about the boys and learned that they suffered no ill effects from their journey. They have never returned and their names have been struck off the register.\n\n3. Edward Laird, cousin of Samuel, John Kipling and\nRoy Henry - ran away early in February.\n\nOn a Saturday night these boys had broken into the store room and stolen food. During Sunday the boys, when questioned, admitted their guilt and were instructed to report at the office on Monday for punishment. That night they ran away. They had not been previously punished.\n\n4. Norman - ran away during the last week of February.\n\nHe had been punished by hand strapping, in December, for being implicated in a case of theft. He had not been punished at any other time. He had only been at the school for five months, and was 14 years of age, so naturally felt its restraint and discipline irksome.\n\n5a. About the same time - 11 girls escaped from their room during the night. They had shown no spirit of insubordination, had gone to their room apparently happy and contented. By the evening of the second day they were all returned to the school.\n\nSince that time there has been occasional running away on the part of small boys to homes in the neighborhood, but all have been quickly returned.\n\nRecently Morris - age 16, who has been a pupil for seven years, has run away. He is reported as being a clever boy and was a favorite with the teachers. Of late she has had occasion to report him to the Principal. By constant infringing of rules and continual insubordination in the class room and in the other departments he merited and received punishment, the regular hand strapping. No effort has been made to secure his return.\nAt the re-opening in August there was a general refusal on the part of parents to return their children to the school. At that time the Indian Agent visited the Institution, investigated the situation, and insisted on parents sending the pupils back. Since that time the attendance has been increasing until it is now nearly up to what it was two years ago.\n\nThe following figures indicate the fluctuation of averages during the past two years:\n\nAverage attendance for quarter ending March 31/14 - 61.49\nJune 30/16 - 62.5\nSept. 30/16 - 60.12\nDec. 31/16 - 65.10\nMarch 31/17 - 65.41\nJune 30/17 - 60.\nSept. 30/17 - 54.17\nDec. 31/17 - 57.29\n\nYour committee, after dealing with the general conditions, took up the statement of the Department and examined the causes assigned therein for the frequency of truancy and the apparent spirit of insubordination.\n\nA. The Charge of Overwork -\n\nThe Indians were asked for particulars as to the kind and amount of work assigned.\n\nOne Indian alleged that small boys were compelled to cut cord wood in winter. No other had any complaint either general or particular under this head. We found that boys had not cut cord wood for five years. At that time boys were given the opportunity of cutting wood on land near the school on Saturdays if they wished, and were paid for their work at current rates. No boy was compelled to engage in such work.\nThe only other case under this head was an allegation that Mr. Dodds had compelled a boy who was not well, to make the trip to Ingolf for mail in winter; that the boy had returned used up, and had died within two days.\n\nThe Principal stated that it had been his fixed rule to ask for volunteers for this service - in no case had a boy been impressed - that in the face of an approaching storm boys had turned back and had been commended for their caution. Four years ago a boy who had volunteered to go for mail, two days after his return complained of being ill. The doctor was made acquainted with his condition and the treatment being given. He approved the treatment but did not think it necessary for him to make the journey to the school. The case developed into pneumonia and resulted in death two weeks after the beginning of the illness. Mr. Dodds further stated that it had never occurred to him to connect the illness with the journey to Ingolf. The Indians now accept Mr. Dodds' statement of the facts.\n\nThe members of staff felt that if there were any grounds of complaint on the score of work, it would be on the part of the girls rather than boys, but that no complaints had been made of overworking girls and further references to hard work provoked smiles both from Indians and staff. It seemed strange to your committee that Indians had to hark back five years for grounds to substantiate present day dissatisfaction, mentioning Indians upon the grounds of dissatisfaction justifying them for withdrawing children from the school, in nearly every case they had to go back several years for specific cases. In one instance a\nmedicine men went back ten years when his boy and three others had died of meningitis and stated that since then he had refused to allow his children to attend the school. In all only seven deaths have occurred at the school in the past ten years.\n\nB. Frequency of punishment -\n\nIt was the consensus of opinion of the staff that punishments were not more frequent or more severe than the cases merited. As to the immediate causes and the punishments administered on such occasions we have already reported in certain places.\n\nC. Partiality of treatment -\n\nThat girls were treated more leniently than the boys. The Principal averred that punishments were identical when offenses were the same, and members of the staff emphatically repudiated the suggestion of partiality. The only explanation we could suggest for this charge being made, was the Indian tendency to regard the boy as superior to the girl and more worthy of consideration.\n\nD. Temper - \"That the Principal had displayed considerable temper when he had enforced discipline.\"\n\nMembers of staff being questioned on this matter, unanimously stated that the Principal was uniformly deliberate; that they had on no occasion witnessed any display of temper, either in dealing with pupils on the premises or in administering punishment; that when girls were punished the nurse was always present and that in no instance had punishment resulted in abrasion of skin or any permanent injury.\nII. Paragraph 2:\n\n\"While this information may in the main be correct, it in no way tends to be received with some reserve. Indian children are not subject to much severity at home and it would perhaps be better for them if they were. Parents and guardians sympathise too deeply with the juniors and it is believed that they encourage them to receive all forms of punishment. However the fact remains that the boys are held to be well-nigh incorrigible; and on the other hand the Principal is held to be hasty and severe in his chastisements.\"\n\nWith regard to the first sentence of this paragraph, your committee is of the opinion that the Department has been misinformed, as to the work and punishment, and have found no evidence of any adequate reason for the Indians regarding Mr. Dodds as hasty and severe in his chastisements, beyond native prejudice against any manner of corporal punishment. But we do endorse the statement about the treatment of children in their homes.\n\nIII. Paragraph 4:\n\nThe chiefs of Reserves Nos. 39 and 40, living within a mile or so of the school complain that days are allowed to elapse from the time of desertion before they were notified of the flight of the boys and that in the meantime such a start was gained that they were unable to trace and bring them back. Had the feet been given them in due time, they might have tracked and overtaken them and restored them to the custody of the management, but delay was unfortunate.\n\nChiefs take considerable credit to themselves for bringing back truant children and Mr. Dodds gratefully acknowledges their assistance.\n\nIn the cases complained of, when they were not requested to assist, and which were made the ground of the statement in Paragraph 1 as to hardships endured by runaway boys, very careful\nInvestigation was made by your committee.\n\nThe Principal stated that on these occasions both chiefs No. 29 and 40 were absent from their homes working on wool contracts 10 or 12 miles away. Upon examination, chief No. 30 without knowing that the Principal had said, admitted that he was absent and beyond reach of Mr. Dodds, and could not have rendered assistance by the time word might have been sent him.\n\nIn private examination chief No. 40 stated that he was at home the night the boys ran away, but afterwards upon further examination in the presence of Mr. Dodds and a group of Indians stated that he had come home unexpectedly about six o'clock in the evening, after dark, and had returned to his work next morning, leaving home at seven o'clock (before daylight) and that the Principal could have had no knowledge of his visit home on that occasion.\n\nHad the chiefs been sent for on these occasions, according to their own admission they could not have overtaken the boys and further the boys had suffered no ill consequences from their journeys. The complaint of the chiefs in this connection seems to be wholly unjustified.\n\nLV. Paragraph 4:\n\n\"Further than this bad feeling seems to exist between the Chiefs and the Principal; so much so, that the latter has notified the Indians that he will not allow them to eat meals at the Institution, or travel on the steamer, or pay their expenses brought out from Kenora free as aforesaid. It is unfortunate that this action was taken in punishment for the offense of sending a letter of complaint to the Secretary of Indian Affairs regarding the conduct of the Principal may not have been very judicious. Our conclusion was that very unpleasant relations between the people and the school management have been established, which it will take some time to overcome.\"\nThe charge that the Principal was actuated by bad feeling in declining to furnish any further meals to the Indians, and that this was done as a punishment for their having written a letter of complaint to the Secretary of Indian Affairs, does not seem to be borne out in the light of a letter from the Department under date of February 1st, 1917, which is as follows:\n\n\"Ottawa, February 1st, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nInspector Benson who visited the Cecilia Jeffries Boarding School on the 23rd ultimo has forwarded his report to the Department.\n\nIt is noted that the Inspector states that the department of the pupils, outside the school hours, is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be to your advantage in the maintenance of discipline if you discouraged too frequent visits of parents to the school and discontinued furnishing meals.\n\nThe Inspector states that he is assured that you have not punished the pupils severely, and this action on your part is to be commended, still the Department will in future expect you to take a decided stand and deal firmly with those who transgress the rules, in order that the present abuses in the children's conduct may be corrected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd) J. W. McLean\nActing Deputy Secretary.\"\n\nActing upon the recommendation contained in this letter, the Principal discontinued the meals.\n\nThe second charge, that he refused to carry freight is positively denied by the Principal. Every Indian who appeared before your committee to register complaints, including Chiefs 30 and 40, freely stated that they never knew of any instance of such refusal to carry goods for Indians or that the Principal had ever charged for such service. There seems absolutely no foundation\nfor this charge and the Indians examined seemed surprised that such an allegation had been made.\n\nThe cause assigned for the action of the Principal seems irrelevant. Mr. Dodds states that while he had heard during the winter that a letter of complaint had been written, he had no certain knowledge of its contents until sometime in June, several months after he had been declining to furnish meals on the instructions from the Department.\n\nHis refusal to carry Indians on the boat was closely related to the question of meals. Indians going on the boat expected to be given breakfast before they started and to be fed on route. On more than one occasion the boat was so crowded with Indian passengers that all the provisions taken for the round trip were devoured before they reached Kenora, so that food had to be purchased for the return trip. Sometimes when the boat remained overnight at Kenora the boat was so occupied by Indians that the crew had to sleep in town. The practice of the Indians making such free use of the steamer had become an intolerable nuisance and in following instructions to cut out the meals the Principal thought it necessary and wise to place restrictions on the use of the steamer. But while refusing to carry passengers, Mr. Dodds at no time refused to carry their freight for them.\n\nYour committee could not discover the date of the Indian's letter of complaint, but it would seem to have fallen between the receipt of the recommendation of the Department and the opening of navigation. In this whole matter the Principal\nseems to have been carrying out to the best of his ability the instructions of the Department in their letter of February 1st.\n\nApparently the chiefs and Indians were not aware that Mr. Dodds was acting under instructions in this connection, and expressed surprise when informed that such was the case. The Principal has himself borne the brunt of the antagonism occasioned by this change in their treatment without making any effort to shield himself behind the Government. When we so informed the Indians they appeared to be greatly mollified. Chief Reddy gave what seemed to be rather an unwilling assent to their change of view, but promised to go back to his Reserve and tell his people these things and that Mr. Dodds had not acted with any desire to punish them for what they had done.\n\nVII.\n\nParagraph seven reads:\n\n\"There was not that harmony between the Matron and the subordinate officers which we could have desired to find. This raises the question as to whether it is best to have the Principal and his wife in command in the same Institution. Sympathies may be so strong between them that a sort of family compact exists; in this case, others may for self protection criticize so freely as to awaken secret dislikes which later manifests itself in opposition. So often this kind of thing grows from more to more until someone must go to preserve the peace.\"\n\nIn the judgment of your committee it is when we come to deal with conditions set out in this paragraph that we discover circumstances, which combined with the misapprehension of the Indians regarding the meals and other privileges have produced the state of unrest, suspicion and insubordination prevalent in the school.\n\n\"We failed, however, to discover any evidence of a 'family compact' because of the Matron being the wife of the...\"\nPrincipal. All members of the staff stated emphatically that such a compact did not exist.\n\nWe did not discover that there had been any breach between Matron and members of the staff\u2014nor was there any lack of loyalty on their part towards the Matron. There was in fact a sense of duty on the part of the staff that in itself was sufficient to prevent anything like disruption.\n\nIt seemed however clearly evident that there was a nervous anxiety on the part of the Matron for the success of the School, and a tendency to worry over the details of all departments that has led her to unnecessary interference with both pupils and members of staff. This lack of tact in general management\u2014understood and overlooked by some\u2014is tacitly resented by others.\n\nWhile pupils require close and constant guarding and observation, this supervision has not been as wisely directed as could be wished, and pupils themselves have been made to feel that they were under suspicion by the issuing of instructions to members of staff in their presence. The thought that they were under suspicion has developed in them a spirit of rebellion, which breaks out in acts of insubordination. This whole atmosphere was revealed in a few phrases of the Indians when they said: \"Things are not right in here\" (referring to the internal economy of the school). \"There is something to blame.\" \"There are too many watchers.\" \"Children don't like to be watched.\" \"They want to run away.\"\n\nThese conditions within the Institution in conjunction with the resentment felt by parents occasioned by the cutting off\nThe meals and restriction of beat privileges, have combined to produce the present conditions - conditions by no means unknown on other reserves.\n\nThe suggestion that there might be a sort of family compact was not supported by any member of the staff, all affirmed that the Principal had been uniformly impartial. The only justification for such a suggestion, might be the anxiety of the matron to spare her husband unnecessary worry. As to the general principle that it is not advisable to have both husband and wife in authority in the same institution, we do not agree with the Report. The same relation exists at the Portage La Prairie Boarding School - and those acquainted with conditions there, regard that very relation as an important factor in the successful management of that institution.\n\nWe regret that the health of Mr. Dodds has been so greatly impaired and that increasing years make it inexpedient for himself to continue very much longer in the work, yet we are strongly of opinion that his removal at this juncture would be construed by the Indians as the direct result of their appeal to the Department and a victory on their part. Such a sense of victory would be disastrous and would certainly lead to trouble for his successor in the future.\n\nWe would express the hope that the Department stand by the Principal in the enforcement of discipline for a further period, pending the changes entailed by his retirement. Our judgment has been confirmed in this by the splendid results following the action of the Agent in dealing with the Indians in\nAugust - (action which Mr. Dodds cordially recognizes and appreciates) - when the Agent insisted on the return of the children to the School. Continued support for the coming summer would do much in restoring right relations between the Indians and the Institution.\n\nUpwards of two years ago Mr. Dodds warned the Home Mission Board that the time was drawing near when he must be relieved, and suggested the appointment of an assistant who might become acquainted with the many phases of the work in this particular school. To your committee Mr. Dodds expressed the opinion that Mr. Matthews, the present assistant, would acquire during this year that familiarity with the work that would warrant his appointment to the Principalship.\n\nIn view of these facts and in view of the fact that Mr. Dodds has rendered 21 years of efficient service in Indian work and has had his work favorably reported on year after year, we consider that his removal at this juncture would be unjust, as well as detrimental to future discipline.\n\nTherefore, we recommend that Mr. Dodds be continued in charge sufficiently long into the summer to enable Mr. Matthews to become acquainted with the navigation of the lake, after which time Mr. Dodds might be relieved from further responsibility.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed) Hugh J. Robertson,\nConvener of Committee.\n\nS. C. Murray.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada\nThe Board of Home Missions and Social Service\n\n434 Confederation Life Building\n\nToronto, April 2nd, 1918.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have yours of March 25th, re the situation at Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School.\n\nAt the meeting of our Home Mission Board last week, we had presented to us the report of the Commission appointed by Winnipeg Presbytery to look into the situation. I am enclosing copy of the Commission's report. After full discussion, the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"The Board, having heard the report of the Commission of Winnipeg Presbytery re the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, received and adopt the same, and instruct the Secretary to forward it to the Department of Indian Affairs; and would strongly urge upon the Government their support of the Principal in the conduct of the work, assured that if he stand by him through the present period of unrest, the spirit of disloyalty or rebellion will disappear; and that failure to do so, they are only inviting future difficulty; for the Department and for the next Principal of the school; and would assure the Government that changes to take place during the year that will substantially improve the situation, without bringing to the mind of Indians the impression that they can control the situation.\"\n\nI may say that since the meeting of our Board, I have received a communication from Mr. Doddie. He does not approve of the finding, and tender his resignation, this to take effect June 30th. He has been promised Mr. Matthews that he remain in charge during the summer. This Mr. Matthews an opportunity to get his hand on the work. I hope we may be able to maintain his services during the summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. M. Robinson, B.A.,\nSecretary of the Board\nMrs. Dodds has sent in her resignation as Matron. She desires that this resignation shall take effect forthwith. Our Women's Missionary Society is now endeavoring to find someone to take her place. As soon as a successor is secured, Mrs. Dodds will be relieved. We are confident to Mr. Dodds that as soon as a new Matron is secured, he and Mrs. Dodds move over to the Mission residence, and that Mr. and Mrs. Matthews, with the new matron, take charge of the School Home. This would relieve him of the discipline of the School and it would leave him comparatively free for the summer months. It would give him an opportunity of giving to Mr. Matthews the instruction and direction that he may require in the direction of the school and the management of the boat. We, of course, do not know as yet whether Mr. Dodds will consider our proposal, but I hope it will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions and Social Service.\nOttawa, April 11, 1915.\n\nRev.

Other changes in the staff will be made which will satisfactorily relieve the situation, without conveying to the minds of the Indians the impression that they are in control of the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. McKinnie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR SEMMENS ON THE CECILIA JEFFREY BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nThe dispensary department was visited and carefully noted as this is regarded as an important branch of school work. The lady in charge is Mrs. Fraser. She is a certificated nurse and was appointed to the position now held by the Department of Indian Affairs. Her monthly allowance comes from the Department through the Presbyterian Church, Toronto. As I have visited from time to time I have come to regard Mrs. Fraser as a superior type of woman, as a capable and conscientious nurse, as a faithful and devoted member of the school staff and as an exemplary christian lady. Her work was well done, the infirmaries were very clean and orderly and she appeared to have a knack of ministering to the sick, and of nursing them back to health which marked her as a person of special worth.\n\nImagine my surprise when the Principal refused to endorse a voucher looking to the issuance of a cheque for her last month's salary which the agent presented for his signature. On being pressed for a reason, the Principal said that Mrs. Fraser had not been subject to discipline, had violated the rules of the school in several instances and was more or less of a gossip; so that he could not attach his signature to the voucher but would give his permission for the Assistant Principal Mr. Matthews to do so if he would. Mr. Matthews refused to sign believing there was something in what the Principal had stated and that while he might be disposed to act in an emergency in the absence of the Principal, he felt it would not be right for him to do this, his superior officer being present.\n\nMrs. Fraser was called and her story was heard. She threw some reflections upon the management, found fault with the amount of fatty food supplied, defended herself against the charge of gossiping, affirmed her faithfulness to duty, and declared her intention both of clearing up any misapprehensions upon her status and of leaving the service if the Department should so decide. No one could help admiring her able defense. She was dignified and logical throughout. The Principal however regarded it as a tissue of incorrect statements and so the matter ended. As it was more of a personal dispute than an offence in which the Department was concerned, the matter was left in abeyance until further investigation was requested or ordered, but I see no reason why the lady's salary should be withheld insomuch as the work assigned her by the Department was without doubt very well done.\n\nDate of Inspection, June 21st, 1918.\nJuly 22, 1918.\n\n\"Everend Sir,-\n\nIn further reference to your communication of the 2nd of April last, enclosing a copy of the report of the commissioners appointed by the Winnipeg Presbytery to investigate conditions at the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, I beg to request that you will be good enough to advise the Department when the proposed change in the principalship of this institution is likely to be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

As I have not received definite reply, I am taking the liberty of sending her on today.\n\nThe boat is to be in Kenora on Saturday. In order to reach there by that time she will have to leave Toronto at once.\n\nAs there is now no nurse at Cecilia Jeffrey, we are anxious to have someone at work just as soon as possible. The school is 45 miles from a Doctor and should an outbreak of influenza occur, the situation would be very serious.\n\nThe question of salary will have to be decided later. We will, I presume, have to leave that to you. You have in Miss Grant a thoroughly competent nurse. You know just how scarce women of this type are today, and how they are in demand and what remuneration is being offered to them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/LM.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. H.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nYours of Oct. 10th to hand in which you approve of the appointment of Miss Elizabeth Grant as nurse at Cecelia Jeffrey. You estimate that you can only allow a salary at the rate of $600 per annum, cannot hope to retain Miss Grant at this salary. You have evidently overlooked the fact that she is a trained nurse and a very efficient one, could secure without difficulty $4 a day in any of our cities at private nursing. When the appointment of Mrs. Fraser was made you wrote as follows: \"I beg to say that the appointment of Mrs. Fraser is approved but as she is not a graduate nurse the Department can only allow her a salary of $500 per annum\".\n\nSo you will see that you reduced the salary because Mrs. Fraser was not a graduate nurse. Now that we are supplying the school with thoroughly qualified nurses, we feel that the salary should at least go to the old figure which was $600 per year. My own judgment is that it should go higher. Our experience of the last few months has been that it almost impossible to get workers of any kind.\n\nHoping you may see your way clear to re-open the case and make it possible for us to retain Miss Grant,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

In this connection I beg to say that Mr. Mathews has been sick for some time about 10 days with the flu. Dr. Ferguson being laid up in the hospital, and I could not get a doctor here to go out under any circumstances.\n\nI communicated with Mr. Inspector Semmens, and he could not get one there for some time, at last he got one, but the Dr. took sick during the night and could not come, he then done the best he could and finally got Dr. Yule, to come down, on the 10th. I arranged with Mr. Belyea to take him out on the 20th which he did.\n\nHowever when he arrived there where he is still, he found that the nurse had done everything possible for him, but there was no hope of his recovery. This word was sent in to me, and I have done everything possible in my power for them. When Doctor Ferguson heard how bad Mr. Mathews was although he was still in the hospital he got up and went out, but Mr. Mathews had passed away before he arrived.\n\nI have sent out a boat with men to take the body in here, Mr. Mathews Father and Mother arrived today and will be here until after the funeral.\n\nAt present there is no one in charge of this school except the Matron, and everything is in very bad shape; they are out of wood, and no one to help them, except the man we sent out.\n\nI really do not know what is to be the outcome of all this. Some none should be sent at once to take charge of the school, or it will have to be closed, and what can be done with the lot of children should this happen, is more than I can say.\n\nI expect Mr. Semmens to arrive tonight.\n\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nto night when we will consult together, as to the best way to proceed in this case.\n\nAt present we have quite a lot of this disease out amongst our Indians, at Rat Portage Reserve we have nearly all the land laid up and five deaths already. At Kenora Boarding School, there is 35 laid up at present, but of a mild type.\n\nI have been and am kept on the go day and night, doing my very best to check the spread of this disease. Of course it is costing quite a bit but that cannot be helped, in cases like this.\n\nShould anything further occur I will at once communicate with you, and in the mean time will do my best, so long as my own health holds out.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nKENORA ONT OCT 20/1\n\nD O SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA\n\nPRINCIPAL OF CECILIA JEFFREY SCHOOL DEAD WOULD YOU HELP SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY BY ALLOWING MR SEMMENS THE INSPECTOR TO TAKE CHARGE TEMPORARILY THE INDIANS KNOW HIM HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION AND AWAITS YOUR DIRECTION IN THE MATTER\n\nW J MACQUARIE.\nOttawa, October 27th, 1910,\n\nJ.

I hope that you will be able to get someone to take charge at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. McQuarrie, S.S.D.,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Office, Kenora,\nOctober 26, 1918.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nAs we have been passing through troubles of an unusual character lately it is considered advisable to let you know something of what has been happening in these last days.\n\nYou have already been advised that the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School passed away on the 22nd instant. He fell ill on a return journey from Kenora at Ash Rapids. Fortunately he had brought a nurse to the school at the time and she gave him first aid until his death and nursed him carefully afterwards up to the time of death. Her services were invaluable.\n\nOur Dr. Ferguson followed him out from here and treated him at the school and then returned and fell sick himself. He was compelled to go to the hospital at Kenora with his wife who was also sick. Word of the growing need of medical aid at the school was sent to Mr. Inspector Semmens and he reported it to Dr. Grain who, because he had made arrangements to visit Fort Alexander was unable to give the school personal attention. It was left for Mr. Semmens to get what assistance he could. He engaged a Dr. Henderson on the 17th instant but the next day he was laid up with the disease himself and could not go. On the 18th a Dr. Yule was engaged and he left Winnipeg on the morning of the 19th and could not find a boat until the 20th. He found the Principal practically beyond medical aid but did what he could for the dying man for the sick children and the sick Indians on the reserve. The Dr. returned to Winnipeg on the night of the 25th. Meantime Dr. Ferguson thinking that he might be recovering got up from a sick bed and hurried after Dr. Yule but the Principal was dead when he arrived at the school. The body was brought in on the 23rd and was buried in the Kenora cemetery on the 25th instant, the Rev. Dr. Murray of Toronto conducted the services both at the undertaking rooms and at the grave.\n\nMrs. Matthews has gone back to the school to pack her goods and will shortly leave for the West to stay with the parents of her late husband. I can assure you this has been an anxious time for us all, but the news from the school is cheering as the disease abates. What is called the Spanish Flu is at present very prevalent in the Kenora Boarding School and on the Rat Portage Reserve. No deaths have been reported from the school here but out on the reserve two grown persons and four children have already died. We are feeding them and doing all we can to aid them but the weather is bad and at the doctor's last visit yesterday conditions were more hopeful.\n\nDr. Ferguson has certainly proved himself to be a hero in his devotion to duty. He has no thought of his personal interest and has given the Indians every possible care and attention.\n\nIndian Agent McKenzie has been ever active and faithful to the last duty. He has spent time and energy freely in hours and after hours in the endeavour to meet every demand made upon his judgment, his time and his resources. Two more faithful officers could not be found anywhere than the Medical Officer and the Agent at this point.\n\nMr. Inspector Semmens ran down when he heard of the death of Mr. Matthews to see if he could give any help and to represent the Department at the funeral returning to Winnipeg Saturday 26th.\n\nOwing to the time of year we have heard no news from the reserves out on the Lake and it is impossible for us to fetch them just now. The Savanne Agency has not sent any report or sickness or made any appeals for assistance so far.\n\n(Sgd.) R. S. McKenzie, Ind. Agt.\nJohn Semmens, Inspector\nReference to your letter of 29th ultimo, No. 21657/1. Re the death of Mr. Mathews, Principal of Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, and that Rev. J. H. Edmiston, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, had been informed that Mr. Inspector Semmens was in charge.\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Semmens has not been out to that school up to the present time, as he had no official orders to go out there, and until he gets direct orders I do not think he will go of his own accord.\n\nThere is no one but the Patron and Teacher there in charge at the present time. Someone should be sent out at once, as from what I hear things are very much mixed up and in bad order.\n\nShould Mr. Inspector Semmens be sent out, it will only be to take charge of things in general, principally the internal affairs, until a competent man is placed in charge, which should be done as soon as possible.\n\nI am nearly giving you this information so you will know just how things stand out there. I have just received word that all the Staff and Pupils are now quite well, at the school, but there is quite a number of Indians sick on the Reserve, and several deaths have been reported, and it is very likely there may be more from all accounts received.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy & Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. S.

We have asked Dr. Murray, our District Superintendent, to secure a permanent Principal. We hope to be able to report his action soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJH Edmonson\nOttawa, November 14, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School and stating that there is no one in charge there at the present time but the matron and the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. J. H. Ramison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, has been asked to try and secure a more competent Principal to take charge of this school. No doubt he will be able to secure the services of a suitable person shortly, as he is in communication with Dr. Murray, their District Superintendent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Our thought is that he should take charge for the winter months. By spring we will know if he is likely to succeed. Our District Superintendent is to go in during the winter, and report to us.\n\nI trust the Department will approve of Mr. Martin's appointment temporarily.

You will be good enough to forward vouchers, in the usual way, for the payment of the salary due Miss Grant to the end of the current month and at the end of each month thereafter.\n\nThe authorities of the Presbyterian Church have been informed of the appointment of Miss Grant and the salary she is to receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nR. G. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR SIMMS ON THE CECILIA JEFFREY BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nIn November the Church sent in Mr. P.T. Martin a lawyer from Williamsport, Indiana who is also a clergyman of the Congregational Church. He was temporarily employed for a period of six months as Principal of Cecilia Jeffrey school. He is on trial and if he proves his worth, may be permanently employed after his probation expires.\n\nMeantime, Rev. Mr. McQuarrie (Kenora) controls the finances and keeps the accounts while Mr. Martin is local manager. This arrangement is probably perhaps the best that could be made under the circumstances but will not do as a permanent procedure. The Principal must have a free hand and must be supported by the authority of the Church and the Indian Dept., otherwise he cannot take that deep interest in his charge which is necessary to success. A divided responsibility weakens any enterprise.\n\nNow as to my own impressions of Mr. Martin, I have to say that a considerable portion of my time was taken up in conversing with him so that I might estimate his fitness for the position and be able to represent his case to the Department in an intelligent manner. His training and experience as a lawyer will no doubt enable him to judge questions from all points of view so that his conclusions are likely to be well thought out and action based upon them to be definite and wise. He has a good deal of self-possession, has a good temper, is firm yet gentle. He is a person of good address, pleasant in manners and disposed to be amiable and conciliatory. He is a practical man, knows a good deal about machinery, is not afraid of work, is a good manager and looks toward profitable and permanent results.\n\nI knew little of his history but his position as a clergyman should be a guarantee of his moral worth. His addresses to the children and to the staff give evidence of an unusual ability to direct and counsel receptive minds. He has instituted a system of detention so that boys who violate the rules of propriety are shut up for a short time in small compartments and lightly fed but immediately released when they show signs of penitence and promise amendment. So far the children are quite attached to him. No single member of the staff has been discontented though ample opportunity was afforded. The chiefs of 30 and 47 expressed themselves in most complimentary terms. Old misunderstandings seem to be disappearing like snow in springtime. I have great hopes for the future. Should the Church decide to make his appointment permanent and allow him to pursue a progressive policy he is willing to continue and I am convinced that he will in a short while be able to show better results than the school has ever known.\n\nReport dated, February 6th, 1917.\nGENERAL REMARKS,\n\n1. I am convinced that more agricultural work should be done and am sure that the soil can be found within easy reach.\n\n2. In order to supply the school with milk and butter more stock is an absolute necessity. With this, dairying can be taught to the great advantage of pupils.\n\n3. At the present time a man with a pony and sleigh goes 20 miles to Inwood station for the mails once a week. The mail might be brought from Winnipeg over the Water District Railroad in a school bag so that a trip of 5 miles over and 5 miles back might suffice for this purpose each week, instead of 40 miles per week as at present. By this method, mail could be received three times each week.\n\n6. The freighting of school supplies from Kenora is expensive and takes the Principal away from home a great deal. Why not purchase in Winnipeg freight out to the end of steel at Waugh and have only ten miles to haul it instead of 80.

McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nA few days ago we learned that both Nurse Grant and Miss Brodie of Cecelia Jeffrey school were ill with influenza. The call that came was for urgent assistance. We were also informed that Nurse Grant would have to resign and that a successor should be sent in forthwith. Fortunately we were able to engage Miss Alberta C. Reid at a salary of $50 per month. She has had nine years experience, was 21 months in munition work - nursing and two and a half years assistant Superintendent Nursing-at-Home. You will see that she is a woman of a good deal of experience. We are very sorry that we were obliged to send her on to this school without first submitting her name to the Department, but we have no option and the situation at the school was such that we were obliged to send someone in without delay.\n\nI hope that you will approve of our action in this matter. You will note that the salary fixed was $50 per month. I presume you had better regard Miss Grant's resignation as having taken effect April 12th and Miss Reid's appointment as having taken place April 18th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.

When writing you in the matter on the 23rd April the Department overlooked mentioning the salary.

It is pleasing to observe that none of the children were ill for more than a few days. A further report should be submitted later on with regard to the case of Alfred Shabonos who suffered from a slight hemorrhage. The Department should also be furnished with particulars at a later date with regard to the case of the girl Flora Kehkakaynepen who was operated upon at St. Joseph's Hospital.\n\nAfter Miss Reid has carried on her work for a few months, you should inform the Department as to whether you consider she is making a success of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.S.

O. Cain, Deputy Minister, Department of Land and Forests, Toronto.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nE.H.M., Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, copy of which is enclosed.\n\nI have agreed to the school giving a small quantity of supplies to Mrs Green and Gem Big Joe who is well on in years and crippled.\n\nRe wood, the school cut a certain amount from an Island in Shoal Lake for their own use, and have more than they need so wish to sell to some of the Mines which are opening up this summer; it is all poplar.\n\nIn regard to the Launch, unless the Presbyterian Board give him a new one, he will have difficulty in getting in his supplies &c.\n\nRe New school, he still believes we should have another one built and keep the Cecilia Jeffrey still running, his argument is reasonable as he has his full compliment of pupils mostly from the Shoal Lake Reserves, and there will be many more children to attend school from other reserves and we shall have no school for them to go to.\n\nRe No 044 Beatrice Pa papi mais eck, I will enquire into this at Treaty time? Should the illegitimate children be admitted to Treaty provided the father is an Indian? This girl got in the family way as her first child whilst a pupil at the school when Mr Dadds was principal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nDear Captain Edwards,\n\nYour last letter referring to the matter of Willie Sinclair and Granny Green received.\n\nI have taken the matter up with Counsellor Indian Joe, a brother of Granny Green, and we have been able to arrange for their accommodation in a house near to his residence. This we believe is the best that can be done for Willie Sinclair. There is no doubt that with the return of spring that he may recover.\n\nReferring to Granny Green, she is dependent on Big Joe her brother who is well or in a worse or less crippled. I am arranging to supply them with the necessary supplies in the way of tea, sugar, lard, and flour. We have cared for Granny Green all winter and she will be dependent upon either the government or the school for supplies.\n\nIn regard to the other boy Joseph Carpenter, it will not be necessary to make any arrangements as I fear he cannot last very much longer. He is in a critical condition.\n\nThe third case referred to is that of Velma Kabentrew, she is an exceptionally bright girl and we would all be sorry to lose her. I will try to do the best I can in the way of providing means for open air treatment.\n\nReferring to the matter of wood, I am pleased to hear that you have been able to get at least a promise in the matter of the disposal. The carpenter from Olympia Mine was here today and there will be no trouble in our disposing of it. Regarding the matter of price, we paid $2.50 a cord that figure covers the cost of cutting and purchase of wood. It will cost another 60 cents to haul to the Lake Shore and 30 cents for storage which means that we could not sell at least than $3.00 a cord to cover expenses. I believe it might be possible for us to haul to the Lake Shore during the summer although I am not particularly anxious for the job, as we can well afford to hold the wood.\n\nI have got myself into considerable trouble with the Board over cutting this wood but I am confident was fully confident that the investment would pay for itself.\n\nIn regard to the question of launch and school repair, I have not heard anything as yet outside of the fact that the Committee will visit the school to advise us regarding the action of the Board in this respect. Mention has been made of the fact that we shall remain in the building for the year 1923 when the government will build a new school with a better location.\n\nI still adhere to the suggestion that we have already made in this matter and I am fully persuaded if only the Church and Government will consider our suggestion that it will be in the interest of our Indians from these two reserves, without receiving a child as yet from N.W.Angle we have new born children I believe on the roll we have three others that we expect to go after tramping. There is no need to move the building merely. For what might be its gain in the feeding of stock and greater convenience in handling supplies. A little work and will guarantee to cut down the feeding stock 65% of what it is at the present time. We have already started work and it will be easily possible for us to grow all the corn and hay we need right on the school land.\n\nAs to the question of freight I fail to see that we are going to gain very much providing of course that we could procure a suitable launch.\n\nAgain I am not in favour of closing the school without due consideration being given to the feelings of the Indians in this matter. When other Reserves closed their doors to the question of a School, the Indians on these Reserves gave to the Church the opening that they asked for by way of trying to prove that Education is the value of education. They have stood by the school. There isn't a child with but one exception of school age but is attending school.\n\nWe need a school in fact two or three to do our duty to those hundreds of children that at the present time have no school to attend. It will be impossible for us to accept any of the children that may desire to attend the school following Treaty, and I know there a great many who are planning to do so. If the Church and the Government would only give us this assurance that a new\nschool would be built without in any way affecting the work at Shoal Lake I would find some way of enlarging our dormitories and dining room myself. It would not cost so very much for I would do all the work myself, with the help of but two men and the boys at school. However, of course with the uncertainty of things we shall simply have to refuse unless we should decide to convert the second floor and convert it into a dormitory for the big boys. Personally I do not for a moment think the Government will build a new school even if they should so to replace the present building for the next 5 or 6 years. I have no doubt but what a sum of money will be voted upon my way of putting a suitable foundation for the interior support of this building, and I am satisfied with this, there are numbers of schools that will be in far greater need than what we will for the next ten or eight or nine years.\n\nI am pleased to report that we have a new Teacher, also that the boy taken to St. Roches Hospital has returned his health has improved although he still has a slight discharge from the eye. I am uncertain as to his age possibly you could fill this in for us.\n\nThere is a matter here that should be attended to at Treaty No. 044 Beatrice Po papi nais eck, She has two illegitimate children and no means of support. I believe that the father is Sam Keeick (the Chief's son) She comes to the school for support and some steps ought to be taken in the settlement of her case.\n\nThis is our last mail I expect to be in Kenora when the Lake is clear.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) W. J. Coozson.\nOttawa, April 25, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 108-13 of the 17th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn connection with the proposed new school, it is noted that the principal is of the opinion that Cecilia Jeffrey should be kept in operation, due to the fact that it is well located for the purpose of providing educational facilities for the Shal Lake reserve. As you are aware, the future of the Presbyterian residential school work in the Kenora agency is at present under discussion, and the principal's opinion will not be overlooked.\n\nConcerning No. 044 Beatrice Papinaiiseek, another communication will be addressed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Nurse Reid of the Shoal Lake School in which she says the school holidays are starting on the 29th of June, and as she had two patients all winter who needed care during the school holidays, she wishes to know if the Government would obtain a practical nurse who would stay at the School while she is away as she informs me that their hospital has not been empty since early last November and that means many months of broken sleep and never off duty. She says the responsibility of seventy pupils and the Indians on the Reserve so many miles from a Doctor is hard work and she does not think she can go on another year without a rest.\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department will supply a substitute for her, if I have authority to try and get one around here.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 20, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Agent Edwards, of Kenora, Ont., in which he requests that the services of a substitute nurse be engaged at the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, in order to relieve you of your present duties and permit you to take a rest on account of your health. The agent states that the school holidays will begin on the 27th instant and that two patients are at present in the school hospital, who will require the services of a practical nurse to look after them.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to say that, if you can obtain the services of a practical nurse to relieve you for a period of one month, you may do so, and the salary allowed will be at the same rate as is paid you, viz.: $50.00 per month. Under the regulations, we can allow you only one month's leave with pay, and we hope this will be sufficient to give you a needed rest.\n\nA voucher for the salary due the substitute nurse can be prepared and forwarded by Mr. Agent Edwards, in the usual manner. He has requested us, owing to his absence on Treaty payments, to correspond direct with you. We hope that you will be able to obtain another nurse to carry on while you are away, and will be pleased to hear from you in this connection, stating the name of the nurse whom you are able to secure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We will pay the substitute nurse at the same rate as is allowed Miss Reid, viz.: $50.00 per month.\n\nIf the services of this nurse are secured, you will be good enough to forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, at the end of her month's services, for the amount of salary due her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Scott, Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRecently I had a letter from our District Superintendent Rev. J. A. Cormie, in which he states that there are two children at Cecilia Jeffrey in the last stages of consumption. They are in the hospital ward and it does not seem right to leave them there. He suggests that if the Department would approve of a sleeping porch on the South side of the hospital, Mr. Cookson would be willing to erect this if the Government would supply the materials.\n\nApparently Dr. Ferguson is in touch with the situation as Miss A. Reid, in a communication to Mr. Cormie writes as follows:\n\n\"Dr. Ferguson was here on Saturday and we brought up the question. He does not approve of making any provision for taking care of patients suffering from active tuberculosis either in or near the school, but he strongly recommends the erection of a good sleeping porch along the south side of the hospital, so that we may use all the prophylactic measures possible in the incipient stages of the disease.\"\n\nI hope you can suggest some relief either through the removal of the children to a sanatorium or the erection of the porch suggested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada\nBoard of Home Missions and Social Service\n\n424 Confederation Life Building\nToronto, June 28, 1922\nJuly 31st, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Elmsion -\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, referring to the case of two pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School who are in the last stages of consumption.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I wish to say that a communication was forwarded from our Agent at Kenora in which he requested that a substitute nurse be engaged in order to relieve Nurse Reid, and to permit her to take holidays on account of her health. The Agent stated that it was necessary to have a nurse at the school during the summer holidays in order to attend to the two cases referred to above. We informed Nurse Reid that we might obtain the services of a practical nurse to relieve her for one month.\n\nIt appears from the report of Nurse Reid that the present condition of these two pupils is such that it would be impossible to move them, and it was considered that the appointment of a nurse would be the best arrangement that could be made to look after them during the absence of Nurse Reid. If it were possible to move them, we could have them placed in a hospital at Dynovor or at St. Boniface, where we have a number of Indian children, pupils of our schools, undergoing treatment.\n\nOur appropriation for the current fiscal year has been entirely assigned, but I shall be pleased to receive an estimate of the cost involved in the erection of a sleeping porch on the south side of the hospital for tubercular cases.\n\nThen this information is received, consideration will be given to the suggestion made by Dr. Ferguson that this be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Unfortunately several children developed illnesses and it was found imperative to have a fully qualified nurse. The Principal sent word in to me to get a Nurse at once. I therefore wired Inspector Bunn to get someone from Winnipeg, but he was unable to do so and wrote that I had better go to Winnipeg and find someone myself as he was leaving town on annuity payments. After visiting the School with Dr Ferguson on Sunday 16th, I went to Winnipeg on 19th and called on the Nurses Register where I found it impossible to obtain a Nurse at the rate mentioned viz $80 for the month, and as it was absolutely necessary to have a Nurse I had to promise $75 for the month, which is a great deal less than a temporary Nurse usually gets.\n\nThe temporary Nurse Tully went to the School on Thursday last the 20th and the School launch was to meet her at Waugh.\n\nMr F.H.

To ask the Government to provide a new boat, also a boat house.\n\nYou may wonder why the Executive is asking for repairs on the old school, while at the same time they are urging the erection of a new building on another site. This request is made as the result of recommendations from the Presbytery of Winnipeg and the Women's Missionary Society. It was argued that it will take a year or two to complete the new building and that in the meantime, the staff and children should be comfortable.\n\nThe heating plant and the plumbing system need overhauling. The lighting system is poor and there should be some incidental repairs - mine, out houses, etc., and a new boat is an absolute necessity. At present, the only means of getting in and out of Cecilia Jeffrey is by a disappearing-propeller boat that was purchased by the members of the staff.\n\nIf the new building is to be ready within a year, we would, of course, expect that a minimum of expenditure should be made on the buildings - just sufficient to make them habitable and sanitary.\n\nSome of our representatives in Manitoba are prepared to recommend two schools for the Lake of the Woods district. They claim there are plenty of children to fill two buildings. If I mistake not, the Agent, Mr. [illegible], shares this view.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 25th, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison,\n\nYour letter of the 13th instant, referring to the Presbyterian Church Indian work in the Lake of the Woods district, has received my careful consideration. I have noted that both the Board of Home Missions and the Women's Missionary Society request that the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School be made as comfortable as possible until such time as a new residential school is erected in a farming community in the same district.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the providing of a boat and such expenditure as is necessary to enable the Cecilia Jeffrey School to operate for another year or so will receive my hearty support. I would be pleased if you would have Mr. Cockson estimate roughly the cost of overhauling the heating, plumbing and lighting systems.\n\nThe matter of a new building will be given serious consideration when we are preparing our Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n49th Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 20, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Minison:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, estimating the cost of overhauling the heating and lighting systems of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Boarding School. I have noted that the principal will be responsible for any repairs that are necessary to the plumbing.\n\nI will have to include items in the estimates which we are now preparing, for the requirements of this institution. Parliament will be asked to vote items providing for a boiler and heat distribution system to the building and for a new furnace and other heating fixtures. I wish to recommend that the Church authorities and the Rev. Principal make arrangements for the electric lighting at the school. If this Department provides funds for the other and more expensive requirements, I am of the opinion that church funds, supplemented perhaps by per capita earnings, should arrange for the proper lighting of the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Minison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, in reference to the help the Department is giving the school.\n\nThe Presbyterian Board seems to be still under the impression that the Department intends to shortly build another School for them.\n\nI consider it would be advisable to inform the Board that the Department will not build another School for some years yet as when the improvements are made there will be no necessity of doing away with this School, we can always find enough pupils from the Shoal Lake Reserves to keep it going.\n\nYou will see the Principal is doing his best with the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Kindly return Mr Cookson's letter after perusal.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Dec. 18, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 108-13 of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this Department and the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church are in close touch and it is understood that the work at Cecilia Jeffrey is to continue for some years. This Department is aware of the necessity of providing an electric light plant in the immediate future, and in view of the heavy expense that we hope to incur if Parliament allows the item for extension and general repairs, we feel that the cost of installation should be met by the Church and School authorities.

Miss Reid is shown on the Official Position List of the Department of Indian Affairs as a Graduate Nurse with a salary range from $900 to $1200 per annum.

Reid was engaged to do nursing work at the Cecelia Jeffray Indian Boarding School. Recently the question has been raised as to whether Miss Reid is a graduate nurse, and I shall be glad to receive definite information on this point from you. If she holds a certificate, please state to that effect should be made, and the Department should be furnished with the name of the training school from which she graduated. Kindly let me have your reply in this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J.H.

I note that Mr. J.D. McLean of the Indian Dept. writes re standing of Miss Reid.\n\nMiss Alberta Reid is a graduate of the Nursing-at-Home Mission Hospital, 76 Hayter St., Toronto. We have had graduates from this Hospital in our Indian work and in our W.M.S. Hospitals in Western Canada and they have measured up to the requirements of the Institutions in an acceptable manner. We consider them especially fitted for our Indian work as they gain much of their nursing experience in daily visitations among all classes of people in our City. They are Social Service workers in every sense of the word. Miss Reid was considered one of the best and served 2\u00bd years as Asst. Supt. in the Nursing-at-Home Hospital. We considered ourselves fortunate to secure her services and never at any time have we had any adverse criticism regarding her work at Cecilia Jeffrey. I always felt that we could depend absolutely on Nurse Reid in ministering to the physical and spiritual needs of our Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd.- Adelaide Clark,\nIndian Sec., W.M.S.\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have yours of April 17th in which you make inquiry re the training of Miss Alberta C. Reid.\n\nI referred your communication to Mrs. Clark of the W.M.S. I have a reply today, copy of which I enclose. I trust this is the information you desire.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.H. Edmison\n\n[Stamp]\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI beg to draw attention to the case of Miss Alberta C. Reid who is on the staff of the Cecelia Jeffrey Boarding. It appears from a report from the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church that Miss Reid is a graduate of the Nursing-at-Home Hospital, Toronto. The Civil Service Commission has pointed out that her name appears on the official position list as a graduate nurse with a salary range from $900.00 to $1200.00 per annum, and has suggested that salary as a graduate nurse be paid to her if her classification remains as at present. As a Senior Nurse she would receive salary at the rate of $720.00 from the 1st April, 1923. I recommend that she be paid at the rate of $900.00 from the 1st April, 1923, in recognition of her rank as a graduate nurse, as it is assumed that the hospital mentioned is a recognized training school for nurses.\n\nMiss Reid was on the list of officials recently blanketed in. Her work is very satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant\nCapt Edwards,\n\nKenora\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like very much to take in the American Tour in the Educational Air this summer, so am writing to ask permission to put in a substitute for the month of August.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nHere is a Miss Nicol who was on my staff for over a year. She is not a graduate nurse, but has nursed for a number of years (eight in all) and the physicians she nursed under spoke very highly of her work.\n\nShe is well acquainted with the Indians and children (not because of death in the family), and I think it would be much better to have one who understands the unit than a stranger.\n\nKindly let me know as soon as possible so that I may be able to make definite plans. \u2014Sincerely yours,\n\nAlberta C. Reid\nP.S. At present the children and ladies are real well. There was considerable sickness during March. I am afraid we have to take little Marian for into hospital again for her eyes. They are not responding to treatment as I would like.\n\nA.K.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from Nurse Reid of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, asking permission to be absent for the Month of August, and to put in a Miss Michel in her place, as she wishes to take in an Overseas tour with the Educational Association.\n\nI do not know Miss Michel, and can give you no further particulars as to her suitability for the position, but would suggest that should the Department give Miss Reid leave of absence, I be instructed to find out from the Physicians and the Principal of the School if Miss Michel is suitable.\n\nYou will find on your files that Miss Reid was allowed leave of absence last summer and received full pay, and Nurse Tully of Winnipeg relieved in her absence.\n\nI may say that Nurse Reid was thought a most ideal of by the late Agent, and is also well liked by the Principal of the School, and she holds the position of Nurse at the School, from purely Missionary spirit.\n\nKindly let me know if the Department approves of the leave of absence, and relief me soon as possible so that I can ascertain if Miss Michel is suitable.\n\nI shall be glad also of instructions as to whether Nurse Reid is to receive full pay during her absence, if allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSenior Nurse\nMaximum\n$720.00\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\nSir:\n\nI wrote you on the 16th instant with reference to your recommendation for salary increase on behalf of Miss Alberta C.

I shall be obliged if you will let me know what is being done in this case.\n\nI am, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Mr. Menzies will begin his work at Cecilia Jeffrey soon after the 4th of November. I trust this meets with the approval of your Department. Mr. Menzies is well known in our Church. He has been successful in all his undertakings and I understand that Mrs. Menzies has had experience in institutional work. She will probably be appointed matron at a later time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJH/EMS\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, informing the Department that the Rev. A. D.

J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n464 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario.\n\n19th November\n\nDear Mrs. Clarke,\n\nI delayed answering your letters until I had an opportunity to visit Selina Jeffrey School.\n\nMy Messier and his wife arrived, and I was with them on Friday and Saturday morning, and we thoroughly discussed the several matters on which he desired information.\n\nYou seem to be under the impression that I am not in favour of the Department spending money on the School, but I can assure you the contrary is the fact, as if the Church Authorities do not or cannot install electric light, the Department should do so, as the danger is very great of having a fire which would have very disastrous effects, the frame buildings would go in no time.\n\nYou inform me Mr. Cookson spent over $7000.00 on repairs and equipment in the last two years, if this is so I cannot understand where the money has gone, he always appeared to be very economical, I cannot understand how it was there are no books to show his expenditure.\n\nI was not aware that the Government were responsible for the buildings and equipment and the Church for the payment of staff and clothing of pupils.\n\nIf this is so it appears to me that we are responsible for the installation of the electric light plant, but I will ascertain this from the Department as they informed me some time ago that they considered the Church Authorities should pay for the installation of an electric light plant.\n\nAs regards the launch, I feel sure you could not have obtained a more suitable one, providing you have a capable Engineer to run the engine, and whatever kind of a boat you had, you would require a barge, Mr. Cookson informed me that the one he built (which is a very good one) only cost $75 for material, the labour being supplied by himself and the boys.\n\nThe boat you got cost us more than the $4300 charged the School.\n\nI will communicate with my Department and ascertain if they are willing to bear more of the expenses of running this School, but as regards a new School, at the present time in the Kenora Agency, I think although you say you are due one, that it will be difficult to get the Department to see this as in my Savanna Agency I have over 700 children of school age without any School, it would therefore not be right for me to ask for another School for you, until their needs had been attended to.\n\nAs regards the isolation ward, I discussed this with Mr. Messier, and he considering the matter.\n(Mrs Clarke, 2)\n\nI am informed an electrician from Schumaker-Gray in Winnipeg visited the School and made an estimate of the costs of installing and wiring, so presume something will be done soon by someone.\n\nIf the School was removed from Shoal Lake to Kewatin, we should have great difficulty in getting the parents to allow their children to attend. The School we have in Kenora are always wishing they were further away, owing to the difficulty in keeping children, they are always running away, and being brought back by the Constable and others. This never occurs at Shoal Lake.\n\nIt was too bad I could not meet you last summer, but it was at Treaty time and I was unable to get away, however I hope you will make a trip soon when I may have the pleasure of your acquaintance.\n\nReduction in grant. The Department deducted the two weeks holidays allowed, it was not my fault as I O.K. ed the returns as originally sent in, but it was justified from Ottawa, and if the Department has not already allowed you the two weeks, perhaps they will do so if you ask them, although you understand there are rules set down that must be maintained.\n\nI was very sorry to have to send the returns back to the School for revision, but was compelled to.\n\nRe your grant of $168 per pupil, this is a very large grant, and I doubt if there is any other School in Canada under our Department getting a larger one, I always understood the grant was only $148.\n\nMr Freeman is taking very great interest in the School, and the Staff are very favorably impressed with him, as is also Mr Macdonald, Mr Freeman informs me he will be able to visit the School again about New Year and I will try and arrange one of my visits so that we can be there together.\n\nThree of the School children are in Hospital in Winnipeg and we are sending them back on Wednesday next.\n\nMr Macdonald informed me there is a large quantity of material at the School, purchased by the late Principal, for the alterations to the building, which he will use up.\n\nProviding the electric light plant is installed, and the wiring and fixtures set up, he does not think at the present time much more is necessary.\n\nThe second teacher Miss Lament has left and Miss Bennett who I understand was previously at the School, has taken her place.\n\nI should be glad if the Church could suggest or do something for the pupils leaving the School when discharged, it seems a pity they should go back to their old life again, after the work done on their behalf at the School. Perhaps you could get suggestions from the new Principal.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMrs Adelaide Clarke,\nW.M.C Presbyterian Church,\nToronto, Ont.,\nIndian Agent.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nKenora, Ontario.\n\n19th November, 1923\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a personal letter sent to Mrs. Adelaide Clarke of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church (Western Division) Toronto, in reply to communications received from her, for your information.\n\nThe New Principal for the Cecilia Jeffrey School has arrived and I was at the School on Friday and Saturday last.\n\nAs regards the electric light, this should be attended to by either the Department of the School Authorities at an early date, as in case of fire there would probably be loss of life as well as loss of the buildings, as there is no place for the inmates of the School to go to if it burnt down nearer than Waugh 7 miles away, and it would be difficult to reach there, without exposure over the ice in the winter time.\n\nTrusting I have not said too much in the letter to Mrs. Clarke, which is a personal one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 108-15 of the 19th instant, enclosing a copy of your communication to the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church. I have noted that the new principal was at the school on the 15th instant, at the time of your visit. I have to inform you that the installation of the electric lighting system is being undertaken with the least possible delay.\n\nRelative to the subject matter of your communication to Mrs. Clarke, I have to inform you that the Department allows only 31 days' holiday, without grant. With reference to the Government and Church responsibility at Indian residential schools, I have to state that, generally speaking, this Department allows a per capita grant for current expenses and makes grants for capital expenditure, whenever funds can be found for the purpose. Relative to the last paragraph on the first page of your letter to Mrs. Clarke, I have to inform you that the Department cannot increase the per capita grant, and that for the coming fiscal year the per pupil rate will be the same as last year, i.e., $155 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n129-3-1\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nRenora, Ontario,\nFebruary, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip to Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School.\n\nThe Principal Rev. A. D. Menzies appears to be getting along all right, but the Indians complained he did not visit them at the Reserve. I suggested he do this occasionally and he agreed it would be a good thing; he is very interested in his work.\n\nHis wife apparently does not care for Indians and has very little sympathy with them, and she is not liked by the staff, but no doubt that after a little time she may get along better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Frank Edwards.\n\nIndian Agent.\nIn the early part of the month I went to Winnipeg and had a conference with the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School and some of the Presbyterian Mission Board to see if we could not devise some scheme to make better feeling between the principal and the Indians and prevent so many pupils running away. The conference did good and perhaps things may improve.\n\nWe had to send a doctor down to Cecilia Jeffrey School from Winnipeg, owing to a wire from the nurse that some of the children were ill. It would have cost too much to have sent Mr. Ferguson from Temora.\n\nI have been notified that the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School is laid up with pneumonia and that his brother has been sent for.\n\nThe new land taken into the property last summer is being plowed up and put into garden.\n\n(Sgd.) Frank Edwards.\nOttawa, May 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge that portion of your report for the month of April which refers to your conference with the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School and certain members of the Presbyterian Mission Board. I have noted with satisfaction that you are hopeful of a better feeling between the Principal and the Indian parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edward[signature],\nIndian Agent,\nLenora, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nOn July 29th and 30th I visited the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. The institution is situated on a peninsula in Shoal Lake. The postoffice address is Indian Bay, Man., and the express and freight agent is in care of the G.H.&N.R.R., Man. Mr. Mensies is a kindly type, but I was not impressed by his ability as an organizer. His wife has no sympathy for the work and I believe he is the actual head of the institution. She is not the proper type for institutional life; is matron but cannot handle the staff. The outside man, Mr. Gibson, is a splendid chap with children. He is responsible for the small farm, the carpentering and engineering end of the work. They allow a week-end holiday for the pupils that live close to the school. I discouraged this practice.\n\nThe main building needed paint, but material was supplied a year ago and the work was about to be undertaken. The building is badly cut up by alterations and is not suitable for purposes of Indian education. The heating system is inadequate - there are three separate units. The lighting plant is working well. The water intake has had to be rebuilt; church funds are being used.\n\nI promised to send a little athletic equipment and to give favourable consideration to requisitions for material for Art. One of the teachers is a splendid artist and some of the pupils are showing excellent progress.\n\nThe school purposes changing the balcony to an infirmary and making alterations in the present sick-room. It can be undertaken by day labour, under the supervision of the staff, provided that one skilled carpenter is engaged and the materials allowed. They will really need more than $400 which has been promised, I believe. If the Church would furnish the rest of the money, I believe the Department should allow $600 for this work. I propose to examine the correspondence and write the agent.\nAs you are aware, we get most of our supplies over the G.W.W.D. Ry. at Waugh. This necessitates our approach via Indian Bay, a sheet of navigable water about 14 miles by 3\u00bd miles, from one end of which Winnipeg gets its water supply. The Railway and waterway belong to the city. We have received instructions from the Superintendent of the system that next spring we must cease the use of Indian Bay and approach Waugh via Snowshoe Bay and a so-called canal, connecting it with the west end of Indian Bay for drainage purposes. Snowshoe Bay is not navigable for a row-boat at present, much less for a launch of any kind, being very shallow and infested with weeds. So much for the situation. Presuming on your interest in our school, I want to ask you to ascertain from the proper Department whether the Government has authorized or could authorize the City of Winnipeg or its officials to close against navigation a body of water such as the above, whose entrance is three or four hundred yards wide.\n\n(Sd.) A. D. Menzies.\nDecember 5, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your attention an extract from a letter from Mr. A.D. Menzies, principal of the Cecilia Jeffray Indian school at Shoal Lake, Man., with regard to the closing of Indian Bay for navigation purposes.\n\nMr. Menzies points out that if Indian Bay is closed it will be impossible for the people at the school to go to the town of Waugh where they are obliged to get their supplies and conduct their business. In these circumstances it would be practically impossible for the Department to carry on the institution. I may say the Department has in contemplation the removal of this school in the near future to a point on the railway line between Waugh and Winnipeg. It is hoped, however, that for the present at least, navigation between the school and Waugh will not be interfered with.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActg.

This letter follows a study of the patent issued by this Department to the C. W. D. in April 1915 and correspondence with the Department of Marine and Fisheries.\n\nThe patent in question reserved the free use, passage and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters, and Indian Bay cannot be closed to navigation.\n\nI believe you would be well advised to write to the C. W. D., informing them that the Department has assured you that you may use Indian Bay for navigation. You should intimate that every effort will be made to see that there is no contamination of the water by the school launch or barges. They should also be given to understand that we hope to move the school from its present locality in the near future and that the school will not require the use of Indian Bay very much longer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Munsie,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res. School,\nIndian Bay, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Nurse A.C. Reid of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential Indian School, who is now at present living at Vancouver B.C. on two months' sick leave with pay from the Department.\n\nShe states that she feels that she will be unable to return to her duties at the end of her leave of absence, but that at least she would require until about June 1st to determine whether she would be in a fit condition to do so, and that she considers that this is asking too much from the Department and prefers to tender her resignation.\n\nI had a letter from the Principal in which he has stated confidentially that Nurse Reid's substitute, Miss White, is a graduate of Orangeville, Ont., and holds a diploma for Ontario, is doing good work, and gets along well with the children, and is in many respects more efficient and superior to Nurse Reid.\n\nMiss Reid has asked me to advise her as to the Department's decision in this matter, and I shall be glad to hear as soon as possible as to whether it is decided that her resignation be accepted or not.

Miss White, now acting as substitute for Miss Reid, may be continued until the expiration of the time for which she was engaged; and, if Miss Reid is able to resume her duties when her leave, without pay, expires, she may do so, but she should be advised of the intention of the Department and that her services as an employee of this Department will terminate on September 30, next.\n\nThe Church authorities are being advised of the decision of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 30, 1925.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nSome years ago, at the request of Dr. Grant, I appointed two nurses for duty at the Indian residential schools in Manitoba and Saskatchewan that are conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. This was a temporary arrangement and the scheme was not extended. It has been decided to ask the two schools where the nurses are now situated to conform to the general practice, and I have directed that the Department discontinue paying for the services of nurses at the Portage la Prairie and Cecilia Jeffrey Schools as from August 31st and September 30th next, respectively.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

When our Sr. teacher, Miss Brodie, was seriously ill this spring it was necessary to bring in a doctor from Winnipeg. He was compelled to remain with her four days so great was her danger. Our W.M.S. could not leave Miss Brodie to bear this expense and paid the doctor for the time he was away from his practice in Winnipeg. I feel confident that Dr. Scott, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, would not ask us to assume any such unnecessary responsibility but will permit nurses to remain until the new school is ready for occupation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

They feel that the Tubercular Hospital for the Indians should not be near the new school. Our representatives in Winnipeg contend that the Principal's residence at the present Cecilia Jeffrey School could be used effectively as a hospital. It is a commodious building with three or four rooms upstairs as well as downstairs. It has running water, toilet, etc. It would not be an expensive matter to fit it out as an isolation hospital.\n\nOur District Superintendent for the Manitoba Conference is strongly of the opinion that something should be done for the tubercular Indians in that locality. We will not require the building when the new school is ready for occupation.\n\nIf you did not regard the Principal's residence as adequate for hospital purposes, after you have the new school erected, the present Boarding School could be used.\n\nThose who brought the matter before us were of the opinion that at first, a resident nurse might be sufficient with a visit from a medical assistant from Winnipeg twice a week.\n\nIf you find that the Principal's residence is adequate for the purpose, the Women's Missionary Society feel that the Government should have the use of it as their contribution to this most needy cause.\n\nIn a recent report from Cecilia Jeffrey, it was stated that the greatest discouragement in the work at this point is due to the prevalence of tuberculosis on the surrounding Reserves and consequently at the School. Some families have been or are being entirely removed by its ravages. During the past year our school\nlost seven pupils through this disease, while five others are now out of the school. We, of course, cannot retain pupils in the school and expose others to the infection. The Indians seem to object to their children being sent to Selkirk, as they say they never see them again, because of the distance, and because most of them go there to die.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/HG\nSir,\n\nOn Friday the 4th inst., we inspected the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School at Shoal Lake, and there would seem to be a lack of good feeling between the staff and the principal. I believe the church authorities should be informed and the matter investigated, so that things would run more smoothly to the advantage of staff and Indians alike.\n\nIn response to a request of the principal, Dr. Ferguson removed tonsils from three pupils named Tully, who are white. Their father is employed by the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway at Waugh, Man., and I understand that payment is being made for their board and education. The teacher herself, who has been at the school for fifteen years, is averse to their presence, and I do not think for my own part that they should attend, since there are many Indian children on Lake of the Woods who could attend if they were properly recruited.\n\nIn regard to holidays, the principal tells me that he is giving six weeks, as he did last year. I think this is all right, although Dr. Ferguson feels that owing to the amount of Tuberculosis in that neighbourhood the vacation should be extended.\n\nNurse Reid, who is paid by the Department, asked me if she could have the same holidays as the children. I informed her that this would be quite satisfactory provided there were no sick children to be attended. In discussing the matter, the principal did not think she should have so long. I should be glad to have instructions confirming my recommendation.\n\nThe attitude of the principal towards the staff is that of an autocrat. Neither the staff nor the missionary are allowed to enter the school by the front door. The nurse had her first intimation of the operation on the Tully children when Dr. Ferguson told her he had been asked to operate. I would therefore recommend a change of principal, with a temporary appointment if the difficulties between the United and Presbyterian churches forbid anything more permanent.\n\nI do not\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nI do not wish to appear as interfering in the internal management of the school, but things are so bad that I have been asked to draw your attention to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 12, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Edmonson:\n\nI regret that it is my duty to draw to your attention a recent report from Mr. Indian Agent Edwards, of Kenora. Following a general inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School on the 4th instant, he reports in part as follows: \"There would seem to be a lack of good feeling between the staff and the principal. The attitude of the principal toward the staff is that of an autocrat. Neither the staff nor the missionary are allowed to enter the school by the front door. I would therefore recommend a change of principal. I do not wish to appear as interfering in the internal management of the school, but things are so bad that I have been asked to draw your attention to the matter.\"\n\nI might add that the Superintendent of Indian Education visited this school in July, 1924, and reported that he was not impressed with Mr. Menzies' ability. He also stated that \"his wife, who is matron, has no sympathy for the work and, I believe, is the actual head of the school. She is not the proper type for institutional life as she cannot handle the staff.\"\n\nI am not urging you to arrange for a new incumbent at the present time, unless you consider such action advisable; but I am free to state that, if a new building is erected next year, the Department could hardly give favourable consideration to the retention of the Rev. and Mrs. Menzies.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmonson, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, (2) Ont.\nOttawa, June 12, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 132-13 of the 8th instant, with general reference to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I regret to learn that there is lack of harmony between the principal and the staff. I am corresponding with the Church Authorities in this connection. I note that three white pupils have been taken in. Please inform the Rev. Principal it is the Department's opinion that he would be well advised to secure a full complement of Indian pupils. We have made certain capital investments at this institution and are paying the salary of the nurse. This assistance will be withdrawn if the education of white children becomes an important function of the institution.\n\nThe Department approves of 43 days' holidays with grant, the same as last year. Concerning the duration of Nurse Reid's holidays, I consider that you and the Rev. Principal should come to some mutually satisfactory agreement. As a Civil Servant, she is entitled to 15 working days, but the Department has no objection to a longer holiday if such can be taken without burdening the rest of the lady members of the staff. It might be advisable to give her the same holiday as the other school workers receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAust.

We have had information very similar to that sent to you by Indian Agent Edwards. It was the mind of both the Board of Home Missions and the Women's Missionary Society that this change was due but as the new School was definitely promised for this year, we had planned to have a new Principal and matron take up the work in the new building. Should it be that the new building is not erected this year, this upsets our plans. We, however, will be glad at the earliest opportunity to carry out your suggestions. I presume your estimates are through by this time. I will be glad to know if there is any possibility of the Department going ahead with the building this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/EMS\nOttawa, June 25, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to Rev. and Mrs. Macdonald of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I am pleased to note that your Board agrees the indefinite retention of their services cannot be favourably considered.\n\nIt is with much regret that I inform you of the postponement of the erection of new buildings for this school. The Government is insisting upon the exercise of strict economy and the item was not allowed. Upon the occasion of our first interview, I shall be glad to explain our financial position this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, (1) Ont.\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nThere are two points which I should like to get information.\n\nIs it not a regulation of the department that Indian children between the ages of four and fifteen must attend some school?\n\nWe are greatly disappointed that our new School building is not to be erected this year; it is a tremendous handicap when two other new schools are opened in the Agency within the year. We could however make some preparation for the larger building, which surely will be erected next year, by opening the Principal's Residence, now unused. It has ten good rooms any of which would accommodate two with ample space and five are large enough for three or even four. We will also be able to accommodate at least fifteen additional pupils in the School building.\nfailing to the Department to limit twenty. We could thus provide for forty or forty-five new pupils when school reopens. There are quite enough children now out of school in the North West Angle, Assiniboia and Big Island Bands - nearest to us - to provide this number. If it can be argued that there is not school accommodation for all, why compel some to attend, the age limit could be made 7 to 12 or 10 to 15. Many Indian children are now missing school simply because there is not accommodation for all. What can we do to supplement persuasion?\n\nOur Indians are definitely informed that Riviere R.C. School is to get two months' holidays and ask why are our children given only six weeks. Are they correctly informed?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nADM\n\nOf course if the Residence were opened boys only would be placed in it and kept under supervision.\n\nADM\nOttawa, June 29, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant and in reply beg to state that the Indian Act provides for the compulsory attendance at school of physically fit children from 7 to 15 years of age. The rigid enforcement of this section is undertaken by the Department only when it is considered advisable. I am not satisfied that drastic action to enforce attendance at the Lake of the Woods Indian children should be taken at the present time. Serious consideration to such action may be given when our building programme is completed.\n\nI further doubt the advisability of making temporary arrangements for the accommodation of boys outside of the main building at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. A pupilage of 95 is allowed, and, to earn a grant for this number, an enrolment of 99 or 100 would be necessary. I have examined the files and find that the average attendance at your school has not reached more than 60 for any quarter during the past year. Before considering any temporary accommodation, would it not be well to make a special effort to recruit up to strength? If you concur, I will correspond with Mr. Indian Agent Edwards to secure his active cooperation. You might indicate the exact number of pupils that you believe can be safely accommodated in the main building at the present time.\n\nConcerning your question regarding the length of holidays at the Kenore Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that we ask all our institutions to conform to the general practice - 43 days holiday with grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Hensies,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res. School,\nIndian Bay, Man.\nCecelia Jeffrey Boarding School,\nIndian Bay, Manitoba,\nJuly 14th, 1926.\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo (129-5-1) was evidently delayed en route, arriving only by our last mail. I believe it is our pupilage limit, not yet as you suppose, hence the enrolment should not be more than 78 or 79. If all were in actual residence we could if necessary utilize a staff room.\n\nWe have reported an average attendance of 62 for the June quarter just closed; we will ask for the discharge of six after school reopens in September, and the health of two or three others makes their presence very uncertain. To take full advantage of our school's accommodation we should enroll 25 additional pupils for the fall term, and of this number we would have one third or more in sight at present.\n\nWe have recently secured a missionary for work among the Indians of the Lake of the Woods district, one of whose duties will be the recruiting of pupils for our school. I thank you for your efforts to secure the active cooperation of the Indian Agent, Capt. Roderick, in this endeavor. We have no great difficulty in enrolling all of school age on the two school lake reserves, but our school is very unfavorably located for all other Lake of Woods bands.\n\nTwo years ago your Mr. Bonner told me we were next in order of time for a new school building; a few months later I was informed that official notification would be given our board in the immediate future of the department's intention to proceed with the erection of the school building. This went forward in due time and later we were given assurance that the building would be ready for occupation this fall. Within the two years referred to above two other schools have been erected within this agency, and we are now informed that we must wait at least another year although the necessary money had been voted. Needless to say this delay imposes a serious handicap on us situated as we are in a remote corner, difficult of access and in an old building. The new schools serve the same territory.\n\nIt was because of the above facts and because scores of our L.O.W. Indian children are getting absolutely no education that I suggested compulsory attendance at some school within age limits that might be fixed with knowledge of accommodation available. To increase this limit I offer to open our Principal's residence, but do not regret your disapproval since the proportionate cost, if using a second building, would be greater though it is equipped with heating water and sewage systems.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.M. Macdonald\nOttawa, July 22, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the pupilage at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I note that the accommodation will permit of a pupilage of only 75 and that you need 25 additional pupils for the fall term, eight or ten of which are now in sight. I shall ask Mr. Indian Agent Edwards to cooperate with a view to recruiting up to strength.\n\nThe Department officials regret exceedingly the fact that the new school building is not under way. Circumstances over which we had no control have caused the postponement of the activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Maclean,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nIndian Bay, Man.\nOttawa, July 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School requires 25 pupils for the fall term if they are to be up to strength. The Rev. Principal states that he has one third of this number in sight, as he has no great difficulty in enrolling all of school age on the two Shoal Lake reserves. I should be pleased if you would bend every energy to secure some 15 pupils from the Protestant families of the other Lake of the Woods bands. I am sure that Rev. Mr. Menzies will cooperate with you in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, January 20, 1927.\n\nDear Miss Cummings:\n\nI am returning the communication from the Rev. A. D. Mensies, Indian Bay, Man., which you forwarded under cover of your letter of the 10th instant. Dr. Scott, of Indian Affairs, states that Mr. Mensies is the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School and is employed by the Church Missionary Society. Some months ago, when it was proposed to replace the old school by a modern building, the Department of Indian Affairs wrote to the responsible church officer, mentioning certain criticisms of Mr. and Mrs. Mensies and suggesting that, when the new building was erected, it would be advisable to arrange for new management. The General Secretary of the Presbyterian section of the United Church Board of Home Missions replied in part as follows:\n\n\"It was the mind of both the Board of Home Missions and the Woman's Missionary Society that this change was due. . . . . . . We had planned to have a new principal and matron take up the work in the new building.\"\n\nI may say that funds for the new building are not yet available and it is uncertain just when it will be erected.\n\nAs far as the Department is concerned, the matter rested at that.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Private Secretary.\n\nMiss Isabel Cummings,\nPrivate Secretary,\nMinister of Agriculture,\nCITY.\nJack Lindsey\n\nJune 12th\n\nI forgot to tell you that I will be home on Monday and on Tuesday morning I will go home on Saturday.\n\nI want you to meet me at the train station.\n\nAny questions?\n\nLove,\n\n[Signature]\nI'm just calling you about it. Please send a picture of you.\n\nI would love to see a picture of you.\n\nI'm sorry for...\n\nAnd I'm glad you...\n\nI'm very...\n\nI'm very...\n\nI'm very...\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report in the matter of Mildred Martin, #49 Shoal Lake Band No. 40, reported by the principal of Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School as being a common prostitute and a menace to morality on the reserve and in the neighbourhood of the school. Attached hereto is the letter from Mr. Menzies setting forth his complaint, in consequence whereof I made a journey to Shoal Lake to investigate this along with other matters.\n\nOn arrival at the school I immediately went into Mildred's case with Mr. and Mrs. Menzies, and gathered from their expressed opinions that she was a sort of moral leper whose activities could not be curtailed except in a detention home. I was advised that I should be armed before going to interview Mildred and her parents, especially if I should suggest taking her to Winnipeg for mental observation (this course being indicated by police reports). However, I found the girl quite ready to discuss her position, after she had recovered from the preliminary breakdown and shame attending my appearance. She admitted several indiscretions so openly that I was inclined to consider her rather unbalanced or brazen, until further conversation gained her confidence, when she expressed her entire willingness to go to Winnipeg to see Mr. Bunn and to find, if possible, some sanctuary where she would not be subjected to overwhelming temptations. She admitted she was none too strong in the face of temptation, and her story coincides with subsequent investigation which showed that having once got on the wrong track she was hounded by a certain type of young loafer among the Indians.\n\nAccordingly, I took Mildred to Waugh, Kan., that same night, in company with Miss Reid, the nurse, so that we might get the train for Winnipeg in the morning. Before leaving the school Miss Reid was instructed by Mrs. Menzies to make Mildred sleep on the floor, and to lock the door. In this connection I would refer you to the last paragraph of Mr. Menzies' letter.\n\nI took Mildred to Winnipeg the next day, but arrived too late to enable us to see Mr. Bunn, so I registered Mildred at the Y.W.C.A., putting her on her honour to be there when I should have to find her. She was under no restraint, and I found her there whenever I required to see her. Desirous of neutral opinion, I took her to see my mother and sisters who both concluded that she was quite normal, but perhaps too young for her years, and undeveloped in the ability to protect herself from the effects of physical maturity.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora.\nOn Monday, January 11th, Mildred and I went to see Mr. Bunn at his office. He had a long talk with Mildred, and stated his determination to take no steps involving her detention and the stamping of her as a degenerate, but he wrote a letter to Mr. Menzies, commending Mildred to his kindness and charity, suggesting that she be received at the school in some capacity and given a helping hand, since her case seemed to provide a good opportunity for the exercise of a clergyman's holy office.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 13th, Mildred and I returned to Shoal Lake, taking with us her tiny niece Elizabeth Martin, who had been in St. Boniface Hospital with a broken leg. Mildred gave her every possible attention so that the child arrived at the school feeling as comfortable as when she left the hospital.\n\nMildred's reception was not attended with the killing of any fatted calf, and Mr. Menzies refused to take her into the school in any capacity, and suggested that I send her back to the reserve, claiming that none of the pupils would have anything to do with her, and that he was glad of it. To return her to the reserve would have been to expose her to the former vicious circumstances, so I took the matter entirely into my own hands. The next day I sent Mildred home with her father, to see her mother, telling her I would call for her in a short time. This I did, and brought her back to the school for the night, to the evident dislike of Mrs. Menzies.\n\nNext morning, at seven o'clock, I took Mildred from the school. She received a parcel from Miss Reid and Miss Brodie, and a request from nearly all the girls to write to them. Charley Green had his pony waiting, and we came to Ingolf and so to Kenora, where Mildred is at present, helping my wife with her housework, and giving satisfaction. We propose to pay her as we would pay a white girl for the same work, unless yourself or the Department should formulate some different plan.\n\nWhile at Shoal Lake I ordered two Indians to return to their own reserves. These Indians had been concerned in Mildred's case, and had been hanging around the school at nights, with the permission of the principal, who complained to me that young Indians had given chewing stuff to very young boys, and stood outside the building at night and whistled to the girls in the dormitory, causing a stampede to the windows. I pointed out that the school site had been surrendered, and that he was empowered to keep such visitors away. He admitted that he knew this to be so, but apparently he had not utilized his powers in this direction. He told me that one girl pupil had complained that Norman Kelly had made advances to her and had attempted her virtue. Notwithstanding this, I found Norman Kelly visiting the school.\nIn the course of my enquiries I discovered that male visitors to the school were making amorous advances to the girl pupils, and I took from one Indian who confessed to this practice a letter he had received in reply and which is attached to this report. In view of information received from Mildred since her establishment here I expect to bring to light even worse conditions than those already revealed.\n\nDiscipline at the school seems to consist of an even mixture of laxity and of severe repression. As the pupil's attached letter shows, pupils are permitted to go home for the week-end, although the principal realizes the dangers involved, and when a pupil falls from grace as in Mildred's case he suggests that she be placed in a detention home and branded as a Magdalene. In considering the conditions at the school one finds it difficult to absolve the principal from contribution to her downfall, and his refusal to rise to Mr. Bunn's kindly proposal is barely in keeping with the professed philosophy of Christ, as enjoined on the clergy. It is not decently pagan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHector M. Angus.\nC.J. Bdy. School\nIndian Bay, Man.,\nDec 24, 1926.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nKawartha, Ont.\nDear Capt. Edwards:\n\nYou will remember that I spoke to you in the long ago about the advisability of trying to place Mildred Martin in some sort of Detention Home or Shelter where she would be looked after. As you are aware we asked for her discharge after the holidays. She is now on the Reserve. I will not say at home as report says they have no control over her and at night especially. The Reserve is said to be her field. Norman Kelly & Norman Priddale are said to be two of her intimates. Hansen tells me she has been to his fish camp with N.F. after night and on one occasion they were forced to keep them over night. He asked me if she was all right mentally. If half the reports are\ntrue she is making herself a common prostitute, and coming after men if they do not go to her. She will certainly demoralize the Reserve if the stories told of her are true, and it seems to me something should be done with or for her. Since she has gone out from the School I can no longer interfere but I would suggest that you have her case looked into and judge whether or not something should be done.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith please find a letter received from Rev. A.D. Menzies, principal of Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School regarding the case of Mildred Martin, along with a report made by Mr. Angus Goff constable, in the same connection, in consequence of my request that he proceed to Shoal Lake and investigate the matter.\n\nI had previously discussed this matter with Mr. Bunn at Winnipeg, and he did not favour trying to have Mildred placed in a detention home if the affair could be otherwise disposed of, one of his reasons being the possible difficulties arising from her reserve being mostly in Ontario. I saw inspector Bunn again yesterday, the 17th, and his conversation on this subject coincides with Mr. Angus' report.\n\nMildred would appear to be in love with an Indian, Charley Green, but I do not know as yet whether he returns her affection. I shall see him as soon as possible, and if he should desire marriage it would furnish a good solution, but of course no pressure will be brought to bear.\n\nThe only reason I have for forwarding the enclosed report and correspondence is that it may be useful to have them on file in connection with any statements made or action taken by Mr. Menzies in view of his censure by the Church authorities, the Department, the Indians or members of the school staff as per previous correspondence. I think Mr. Perrier is well aware of the difficulties in the case of this principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 18th instant, concerning the case of Mildred Martin of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOn Friday I went by train from St Boniface to Waugh on route to make my usual inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey School. At Waugh I met the Rev John A. Cormie, District Superintendent of the United Church who had been into the School to audit the books.\n\nHe informed me there was a certain amount of unrest at the School, between the staff and the Principal, this I knew, and have informed you of it, some time ago.\n\nMr Cormie said nothing could be done at the present time as the Continuing Presbyterians were taking over the School, and no changes could be made until the organisation was ready to take over.\n\nSome of the staff complained to me of certain matters, but I informed them of my conversation with Dr Cormie, and that this was entirely a Church matter, and things would no doubt be remedied at an early date.\n\nI also let them know it was entirely a Church matter and nothing to do with our Department.\n\nI was informed that the Principal and his wife had gone to extremes, as previously they had been very strict disciplinarians, they were now too easy, and in consequence the children were hard to control.\n\nMiss Brodie, the teacher informed me she had asked the Principal's wife for a loaf of bread for an old dying woman (Mrs Green) Mrs Lenzie refused, so Miss Brodie asked if she could purchase a loaf for the old woman, this she was allowed to do, and paid for same out of her own pocket. Miss Reid, the Nurse, informed me she had asked for eggs for some sick children, but was refused, although there were plenty at the School, but she was allowed to purchase some herself from the School stock, which she did and supplied them at her own expense to the children.\n\nI have authority as per Departmental letter 35-129 of 24th ultimo to purchase 5 tons of hay for the North West Angle Band #33, and as Shoal Lake Band #40 had no hay for their oxen, I asked the Principal of the School, if he would sell us some, he agreed, but said it would cost $19.00 per ton f.o.b. Waugh, as I found out afterwards the hay costs the school, $15.00 per ton and not $1.25 freight. The Indians were very hard up and I gave the Principal authority to issue a small amount of provision as relief. The staff inform me that the Principal even charges the Indians for clothing sent by the Church people for the Indians. He also runs a store at the School, and his prices are as high or higher than that charged by the store at Waugh. He claims that if he charged less the storekeeper at Waugh would object. I informed him that according to the act he should apply for permission to trade according to sec. 42 & 31 of the Indian Act, but he did not seem willing to do this.\n\nThere is no doubt this store is a convenience to the Indians but the goods should be at least sold at a fair price. This would make for better feelings between the School and the parents and assist recruiting.\n\nThe Principal is more of a hard headed business man than a Principal or Missionary, and I am informed\nHe practically never visits the Indians on the Reserves, although they live only a few minutes walk from the School.\n\nDr Cormie informs me that when the late Principal Mr Cookson left, the School was in debt about $1500 and that the present principal wiped this off and is now somewhere about $3000 or $4000.00 ahead. This does not look reasonable, I made enquiries and the children appear to be well fed and nourished, and it seems to me the surplus has been made from trading with the Indians, as well as Mr Menzies being a close business man, if he had used any surplus towards helping some of the poor Indians he would have had better feelings between the Indians and himself, a large amount of relief I understand was always previously given by the School to the destitutes.\n\nThere was a certain amount of immorality going on at the School, but I do not suggest this was the fault of the Principal, I had the offenders up before me, in front of the Principal and they were severely reprimanded.\n\nAll the above information is for your file, as I do not think anything can be done until the Presbyterian Church takes over, and make their own arrangements for their staff.\n\nDr Cormie asked me to inform him, the amount of grant per capita the school was receiving, and when this had been raised to the present amount, I should be glad therefore if you would kindly send him this information as soon as possible, also notifying me at the same time. Dr Cormie's address is:\n\nRev John B.

Mr. Inspector Dunn having expressed his belief that neither jail nor a detention home would be quite the right place, while the facilities for wrongdoing forbade her being left with her parents at that time. Mr. and Mrs. Angus kept this girl from Jan. 14th to the 14th inst., and there has been so much improvement shown that we have allowed the girl to go back to the reserve.\n\nMr. Angus is in receipt of a small salary, and is unable to keep a maid, and I would suggest that he be allowed to make a nominal sum, say, $15 a month, towards the maintenance of this girl. This would be cheaper than either detention home or jail. If you agree with the above suggestion I would be glad to receive a cheque for $45 which should be charged against account 223, and on receipt of the same I shall send the necessary vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A\nMay 6, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nYour letter of January 20th to Miss Cummings cannot be usefully supplemented in any way. This Mr. Hensley is at present in charge of the school, which was handed over to the Presbyterian Church. It is probable that before long we may put up a new building for this institution, but we shall have to insist that Mr. Hensley shall disappear with the old building so far as the principalship is concerned.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKenora, Ontario,\n27th April, 1927\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am informed by Mrs (D.) Helen M. Strachan, that she is Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and that her Society has taken over the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in this Agency, solely, as from 1st April, 1927, and that the arrangement is that the Rev. Mr. Hensley and his staff, are staying on at the School in the meantime, so it will be carried on in the future as at present.\n\nMrs Strachan asked me to notify the Department as to their taking over the School, but I would suggest to the Department that it is advisable to make a change in the Management, (at not too late a date) as was suggested to the late Board of management of this School, so as to prevent a recurrence of the difficulties of the staff and Indians under Mr Hensley, although the Indians inform me he has improved in his treatment of them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nMay 12, 1927.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan:\n\nRev. Dr. Edmison has informed me that the Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential Schools are now under the control of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. I wish to assure you that you may count on the fullest cooperation of the officers of this Department in the conduct of these institutions. They are an important adjuncts of the general programme for the education of the youth of our wards and I trust that they will continue to be of much usefulness. The resignation of the Rev. Mr. Fisher, the incumbent at Birtle, has been brought to the attention of the Department and I should be grateful if you would let me know something of your plans for the management of these institutions.\n\nOnce every three months, the Department issues per capita grant cheques, and it will be necessary for us to know to whom they should be directed. They can be drawn in favour of the Society or sent direct to the Rev. Principals.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D.

I have found it necessary to give her a month's notice as provided for in our agreements.\n\nThe air has cleared somewhat today, but I understand she has appealed to you and to the W.M.S.

Edwards pay us a visit and make if desired a thorough investigation. Accordingly I will not burden you with details but may note that one cause of the outward storm can be traced to Labor Day. We had a very heavy fall of rain on the night preceding and mud and water lay everywhere; rain still threatened and I felt it was a day quite unfit for a holiday here as we must be watchful re wet feet and consequent colds. I told the teachers to call school and we would have a holiday a little later when it could be enjoyed. This may not be strictly legal but I know you\nWe are interested in conserving the health of the children under our charge and will agree that there is an unwritten law that should on occasion take precedence.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Capt.

Mr. Hensley. As you are, no doubt, aware, it was decided some time ago that another principal should be appointed for the new institution. As the new incumbent should be ready for duty when the building is under construction, there is no reason why your Society should not make a selection and nomination immediately. If a suitable gentleman can be secured without delay, it would be well to have him meet with Rev. Mr. Patterson and our Mr. Orr when the final selection of the site is made. If possible, your nominee should be experienced in institutional activity and capable of handling a staff and supervising the various phases of our educational work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of March 9th received, and it was a surprise to me to learn that it had been agreed upon that a new principal should be appointed for the new institution. I was not aware of this. I suppose this must have been decided upon before the division of the Indian work between the United Church and the Presbyterian Church in Canada. I wonder if I might ask why this was decided upon, and if it was the wish of the Department or the wish of the Board that was then carrying on the work. If it is not the wish of the Department that Mr. Mensies take over the duties of the new School, I suppose we must search for some other principal at once. May I also ask if Rev. Mr. Mensies is aware of this?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School File 6187, File 461-1, part 2)\nMarch 14, 1928.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, I have to state that the decision to have another principal for the new institution was made before the division of the Indian work between the United Church and the Presbyterian Church in Canada and that it was the wish of both the Department and the Mission Board that the change be made. I may say that Mr. and Mrs. Menzies have shown lack of ability to properly handle the staff of an institution and there have been several reports from responsible department officers concerning unsatisfactory conditions at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. I regret that I have to request you to nominate another reverend gentleman for the principalship of the new school.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Menzies may not be aware of the exact nature of this decision; but, undoubtedly, he knows that the Department is not satisfied with his services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The principal was deducting two weeks salary in lieu of notice, this money to go to the school. I informed him that as Miss Clare was paid by the Department, I did not think they would agree to any deduction from her salary and as I was on Treaty payments, I asked him to try to arrange for someone to fill her place, subject to approval by the Department. He now writes me that he has engaged Miss Matheson, who has had the following training: Eye Infirmary, Glasgow, 2 years; Northern Infirmary, Inverness, 1 year; General Hospital, Winnipeg, Obstetrical, 3 months. In addition to this she has had 4 or 5 years experience. Miss Matheson came to Canada last fall and started duty on the 1st of May.\n\nWe have not been able to see Miss Matheson as yet as we are now on Treaty payments and shall be away until the 1st of July.\n\nOn the principal's recommendation, I would therefore ask that her appointment be approved.\n\nVouchers for the principal's expenses in this connection will be forwarded as soon as possible after we return from Treaty payments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1928.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant informing the Department that the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School has engaged the services of Miss Margaret Matheson as nurse to succeed Miss Bessie Clare and stating the qualifications which Miss Matheson possesses. The Department approves of her appointment with salary at the same rate as was paid Miss Clare, viz., $60. per month.\n\nThe principal should not make any deduction in Miss Clare's salary in lieu of notice from her in due time of her intention to resign.\n\nPlease inform the principal of the approval of the appointment of Miss Matheson and the salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Shore\nOffice of the... Ontario Indian Agency,\n\nJuly 26th\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. ..., amounting to $20.25 in favour of A.D. Menzies, Cecelia Jeffrey School, Indian Bay, Man for expenses incurred obtaining nurse for School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 129-3-1 dated July 1970 (to Principal X.)\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nFor your information is quoted below what transpired at the Conference of Chiefs and Councilors of the various Bands in the Kenora and Savanne Agencies held at Kenora on the 16th and 17th July, 1928, in connection with Indian Education.\n\nI promised them that I would submit their statements to the Department for its information and consideration.\n\nThe Conference started about 10 o'clock on Monday, July 16th, by Mr. Paget, who informed the Indians that he came from Ottawa to listen to anything they had to say to him as regards complaints they might have.\n\nChief William Gardner of the Wabigoon Band opened the meeting, by saying that he was glad to see Mr. Paget and hoped he would give them plenty of time to talk as they did not often have a representative from Ottawa and the Indians had a great deal to say.\n\nMr. Paget stated he would be willing to stay two days and listen to them, or longer if it was found necessary. This satisfied everybody.\n\nChief Gardner, Wabigoon Band. For my part, I have not paid anyone to write for me as I like to keep my money in my pocket and if I find out the Agent does not do as I want or find out things for me when I ask him, I might then go to someone else, or go direct to the Department, but I would be sure to go to somebody who is in authority and not outsiders. As regard the schools he thinks the same as the other Chiefs and thinks a great deal of what the Government is doing to educate the Indian children and is very thankful to the Government for helping them. But he has a grievance against the Roman Catholic School. His wife and one of his sons have been in school but he does not feel that they have learned anything and what little the boys know he has taught them, particularly as regards hunting and trapping, and he has had hard work to teach them to trap as they were fairly old when they left school and should have learned this when they were young, but they were in school and there the children did not learn anything about hunting. The children could not read or write well when leaving school. The youngest one of the boys went to school when he was 7 and he is now 17. Surely he should have been able to read and write now. What is taught at the school mostly is to pray and not to learn to read and write and that is why the children are backward. Since leaving the school the ministers or priests have not come to see them. Mr. Sanderson does. He is glad to know that there is a Protestant School being built at Kenora and he looks on the schools not for religious purposes only. He said that is a question for each person to\ndecide for himself. Is it possible to teach children a better way to earn a living? He hears at the Cecelia Jeffrey they are taught trades. This is not done at the Catholic School. The boys in leaving school are not fitted to take up work in town and make a living. Could not they be taught some trades?\n\nMr. Paget said he would write to the Department what the Indians said about the schools.\n\nChief Gardner said he hoped to see the new school filled with children and when the children were at the two schools in Kenora the parents would come to see them occasionally, but now the Indians have no Reserve or camping ground at Kenora and no house to live in when they came in the Winter or Summer. If they camped on a white man's land they might be and are often sent away. Could not some place be got for the Indians to stay?\n\nMr. Paget then said that the Agent had been speaking to him about this and the Department would see if anything could be done. The Agent has spoken to Mr. Paget each year about this and the matter would be taken up.\n\nChief Kejick wanted to know what had been done about the old school, Cecelia Jeffrey School, at Shoal Lake. Mr. Paget informed him that the school would be closed and a very much better one built at Kenora. Chief Kejick said the school should be left as it is as there are enough children at Shoal Lake and Nor'west Angle to fill the present school. When the school was first built there, the other Chiefs were not in favor of it, but the Shoal Lake Indians were and that was why the school was built there, and the Indians were told that as long as the Indians were there, the school would be there, and they wished to have it kept there. He said he had 30 children from his own Reserve now attending the school, or would be able to attend shortly.\n\nMr. Paget said the Department were building a new school at Kenora as the Cecelia Jeffrey School was not large enough and was owned by the Church, and not the Department. Also that a larger school near town would cost much less to maintain and being nearer town the children would have a better chance to learn the white man's ways, etc.\n\nChief Kejick, Shoal Lake Band No. 39, said he agreed with what the other Chiefs had said about the children. That they did not know how to make a living when they left school and would like trades taught. In the old days trapping was different. Now the only way the Indians can make a living is to work like the white man and owing to the furs going through white men trapping and the raising of waters, it made it harder for the Indians each year to make a living.\n\nChief Kejick said he had eight children from his Reserve in the school and when the children left they did not know anything and could hardly speak English. They work hard to see that the children attended every day and one of the troubles was that the children were made to work at cutting wood around the school and not in the classroom, and even the very young ones did this. He thinks this is wrong as they go to school to learn to read, write and speak English. He had no fault to find with the new school being built and would\ndo his best to send the children from the Reserve. He said when the children left school there was nothing done for them, not even given a blanket. When the school was built they promised that when these pupils left school they should have a sewing machine or lumber for a house, or something given them to enable them to earn a living.\n\nMr. Paget promised to look into this for them and let the Agent know if anything could be done.\n\nChief Black Hawk, North West Angle Band, No. 33, said he was glad to hear about the school and had sent some children to the Cecelia Jeffrey School. He could not understand why the Indians were not consulted first as to where the schools should be built, and he was not in favor of it being built at Kenora. It should have been built at the South end of the lake nearer their Reserve. Mr. Paget said the attendance of school children was compulsory the same as the white children if the Department insisted on them going, but up to the present time had not been compelled. The Department could not build schools near all the Reserves and had to decide on the best positions. The Department could not please everybody and the Indians came to Kenora more than any other place, and could see their children once or twice a year.\n\nChief Black Hawk said he did not understand the school was going to be built right close to the town but now thought it would be alright after hearing the explanation. He hoped the Department would get some land where the Indians could camp and have a house where they could stay to be called an Indian House.\n\nChief Thunder, Buffalo Bay Reserve, speaking through Chief Gardner. I won't promise to send all our children to school, but I shall let the Department build a school and I would like to see the Indians use it. Can all Indians send their children to this school?\n\nAgent Edwards. Roman Catholic children must go to the Roman Catholic School and Protestant Children to the Protestant school and pagans can go to either school.\n\nCouncillor Jim Kahkeeway said he had a girl who had been in school four years and she was deaf. Could she be discharged. Agent Edwards promised to look into this.\n\nChief Williamson said that old man Sinclair had a girl in school who had bad eyes, and the only trouble she had was when she was in the classroom. The Chief wanted this girl discharged. Agent Edwards said this girl had been to see a Specialist in Winnipeg last Fall and he would get the particulars, and if the Doctor said she should be discharged, he would see that this was done.\n\nChief Jim Williams informed the Agent that it was reported to him that at the Kenora school the children are made to kneel sometimes for hours at a time. This is called \"sitting punishment\" but is not really sitting but kneeling. The Chief thinks this is cruel and should not be allowed. Agent Edwards promised to put this in his report and looking into it.\nOctober 17, 1928.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan:\n\nMay I remind you of the advisability of securing a suitable principal for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School without delay. The building is now under construction, and I believe the new incumbent could be profitably engaged as from the first of the new year. I should be grateful if you would make a nomination as soon as possible.\n\nThe Department is erecting a modern building, on a suitable site, at considerable expense. The proximity to the city of Kenora suggests that it will be visited a great deal by the general public, and both the Church and the State should be desirous of conducting a well managed institution. Every energy should be bent towards securing the services of a reverend gentleman with real capacity for this important post.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMrs. D. Strachan,\nEducational Secretary,\nPresbyterian Woman's Miss.

It was found that he had been dismissed for cause of misconduct.\n\nAny complaints had been made to him as the only person who could be expected to undertake to correct the mischief caused by his conduct. You will look through the file for the records of all subsequent disclosures concerning this fact. It is evident that there are two stories, and further discovery of facts would have been necessary on my part. I felt certain\nparticularly in protecting the Indians under my supervision and keep them away from me by the threat were I would be held only for the purpose of making me appear in court with the Commissioner Mr. Graham and the Department of the Interior, and that they would immediately send that it would be useless for me to send any complaints or would come right back to me and I could make up \"fix\" in the Dept.\n\nIf you find it convenient to see Judge Harrill of Regina, show him the whole circumstances of the affair. I feel sure I can be sure that my case will be heard by him and probably by any person of influence of Mr. Wilson.\n\nI feel too do many of my friends that if the details truthfully given in Ottawa could be known, no further oppression would be visited upon me. I have been in the hands of a cruel and unfeeling man so much persecuted.\n\nPerhaps I shall add, in order to show Wilson in his turn that he compelled Miss Grant, the older but shorter woman, to sign a false affidavit\u2014Miss Grant admitted this to me when she first came into my possession. Judge Harrill knew this\u2014and I subsequently wrote it back to Miss Grant with assurance of forgiveness and so that she should be satisfied between us. I was also treated\u2014the spell was broken off it.\n\nWould I be justified for helping the Dept. and itself of this nature?\n\nAm I still a British Subject and have the British idea of right and wrong? Just this\u2014I am in my prime of life now older and capable than are my present helpers, but I am not capable of remaining the unjustly ignored. If I am capable, and convinced with the Warm Memories, Social and Civic.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKemp H. Brecknell\nOttawa, December 7, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 3rd instant, addressed to the Honourable the Superintendent General. The Department and the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church have given considerable thought to the appointment of a principal for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I understand that the Society has offered the post to another gentleman and the Department expects to receive the nomination in a few days. I am returning the correspondence which you enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Henry T. Broughall,\nCrosby, Minnesota,\nU. S.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Dr. Scott:\n\nSince returning home I have been laid up with influenza and have therefore been unable to write you to tell you that on coming home I found a letter from Mr. May, whose name we had been discussing for Cecilia Jeffrey, saying that he had been appointed history instructor in the city of Guelph.\n\nI am sorry that we have missed securing him. I am today pursuing information in regard to a Mr. MacTherson, who has been recommended, and will let you know later should he seem to be a suitable appointee.\n\nThanking you, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.C. Kerrol\nIndian Secretary for W.M.S.\n129-3-1\nCrosby, Minnesota, U.S.A.\nDecember 18th, 1928.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour letter of the 7th just reached me and I wish to thank you promptly for your kindness.\n\nMay I be so bold as to say that if you will kindly take some time to consider my request, I would be grateful. I am sure you understand how important it is to have the proper name on the records of your school district. It would seem to be entirely your request, however, and thus I respectfully request your assistance in a manner that is both fitting and ethical.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHenry T. Broughall\nOttawa, December 19, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the position of principal for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I regret the Department is unable to inform the Woman's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church that your application will be favourably considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. Henry T. Broughall,\nCrosby, Minnesota,\nU. S. A.\nWOMEN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY\nOF THE\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN CANADA\nCOUNCIL EXECUTIVE\n\nTORONTO\n\nDec. 12, 1928\n\nThe today's mail is an application from Mr. Harry T. Broughall for the position of J.C.J. Indian School. His name came up before when there was no teacher, I remember. Could you give me an opinion as to his fitness as I believe he was formerly doing some similar work under the department, but I do not know if it type or quality. I do not know if there is any information available about him. Would be so glad to have it. We are anxious and in a state.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nMary C. Macmillan\nJanuary 2, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th ultimo, with reference to Rev. H. T. Broughall's application for the principalship of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. On May 19th last, in reply to a telegram from Mrs. Strachan, I telegraphed as follows:\n\n\"Reverend Broughall not acceptable. Past experience entitles me to say he would be incompetent for such important position.\"\n\nI regret that the Department could not favourably consider an application from this gentleman.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. D. F. L. McKerroll,\nEducational Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n19 Lans St.,\nToronto, 9, Ont.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have written Mr. Mensies advising him that as soon as another principal is secured for Cecilia Jeffrey School, we would terminate his contract, but I have asked him to carry on until such time as a new principal is ready to step in. I am advertising in the daily press for a suitable man. For two or three weeks I have been pursuing the credentials of a man who seemed all that we required, only to find that he lacked money sense and financial responsibility, and while all his other qualifications were admirable, his recommenders advise us that were he given $5,000 to spend, bills would be for at least $10,000. Therefore another disappointment.\n\nIn regard to one thing I had mentioned when I was in Ottawa, that Mr. Mensies told us in one of his letters that there were no wash basins nearer to the dormitories than the basement and as water was being taken up for lavatory, I wondered if a basin or two could also be put in, not for the main use but for night use, nearer the dormitories. Would you kindly bring this to the attention of your architect.\n\nI will advise you as soon as any appointment has been made.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nM. C. M. Kerroll.\nAs the new school building is being erected I should be glad to know what the Department's plans for removal from our present location are. I have been assuming that the change would be made during the holidays, but have no information as you desire.\n\nAgain will any of the house furnishings be moved, e.g., Iron Beds, Desk and Filing Cabinets in Office, Engines, Washers, etc.? I presume horses, cattle & agricultural implements will be taken over. Plans and preparations have to be made at this end hence the request for information.\n\nI understand that if parents insist on taking their children out of school at 16 years of age, the Department will\ngrant their discharge, but prefers to\nhave them remain for further training.\nDoes it follow that a boy or girl without\nany such request from parents\nmay say I am sixteen, I will step\nout without any formality, without\nthe consent of the Department?\nKindly inform me of your attitude\non this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.D. Maczie\nOttawa, January 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of recent date, with reference to the Department's wishes concerning the removal from the present school to the new institution. Of course, all equipment of any kind, that is worth moving over to the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, should be transferred. I refer, not only to house equipment, but to live stock, agricultural implements, boats, etc. In due course, the Department will ask Mr. Indian Agent Edwards to cooperate in this matter. At the present rate of progress, it appears that the new building will be ready for occupation early in June.\n\nConcerning the last paragraph of your letter, I may say that, at the present time, the Department cannot compel attendance of Indian children at school past the 15th birthday. However, every effort is bent to have those who should remain longer stay until they are 16 years of age. This should guide you in your relations with both parents and children, and, if there are requests for the discharge of pupils who are 16 or 17, you should inform them that the matter will have to be referred to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Mennies,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res. School,\nIndian Bay P. O.,\nMan.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 23rd ultimo came to hand by our last weekly mail. I thank you for the information it conveys.\n\nSince the new building will not be ready before June and holidays begin July 15th, I take it you will wish the transfer to be made while the school is closed rather than break in on the work during June. Be good enough to let me know whether the above is in accord with your wishes or if you prefer to close out here when the new School is ready.\n\nMy resignation went in some months ago but I agreed to remain until holidays and attend to the moving at this end. Presumably my successor will be on hand to see to the settling in the new building.\n\nYour position re the discharge of pupils is, it seems to me, the only reasonable one.\nI have always informed both parents and child that there must be authority from the Department before a boy or girl can be discharged, and that this authority must be asked for in the regular way. From some other sources they have recently got the impression that when 16 years of age they can step out without consulting anyone. Accordingly about a month ago two boys, 16 and 17 respectively, took French leave without any suggestion or discharge either from the boys or their parents. I referred the case to Capt. Edwards who stated that as they were above 16 nothing could be done, and as nothing was done another of 17 years followed their example. It would seem therefore that the guardianship of a Principal becomes in practice a dead letter when a boy or girl reaches 16 years, and I have only to report that Nos. 74, 77 & 78 have discharged themselves. If however you have any instruction or guidance to give me I shall be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.D. Macgregor\nOttawa, February 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Rev. Mr. Henries. Please let me have a recommendation from you regarding the advisability of putting forward the holiday dates for the pupils of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, February 15, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the transfer from the old to the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It might be better to send the pupils home from the present school and have them return to the new, after the holidays. Would it be pleasing to the Indian parents if the holiday dates were put forward a month, say, from June 15th to August first? At the present time, it appears that the building will be ready for occupation in June. If it were not for a delay in the matter of the water supply, even earlier occupancy could be arranged.\n\nI note, with regret, that two or three pupils who have reached 15 years of age have truanted and that you have been unable to persuade them to return to school. It is true that we cannot compel their attendance at that age. The Department relies on moral suasion for further schooling if such is considered advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Macdonald,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School,\nIndian Bay, Man.\nKenora, Ont.\nFebruary 18th/29.\n\nSir:\n\nI visited the Cecelia Jeffrey Residential school at Shoal Lake, last week, and discussed the question of when the children should be moved. It was suggested that the school close on July 1st instead of the 15th, and that everything be moved to the new building at that time. It might be advisable to give the children a slightly longer holiday this year to enable the staff to get their regular holidays, and to be at the new school, say a couple of weeks, before the children return, so as to get things in shape.\n\nI will forward an inventory of the equipment etc. to be moved from the old school, in a day or so.\n\nWhile at the Shoal Lake school, I persuaded the truants over 16 years of age, to return to the school for a short time, until I obtain their discharge for which I will apply in a separate letter.\n\nWhile in Winnipeg I called on Mrs. Hutcheson, convenor of the Presbyterian Committee. She will come to Kenora shortly to look over the new school, and make arrangements. We have had no one here representing the Church since the building started.\n\nWhile in the city I also picked out the electric light fixtures and gave orders for the wash basins in the dormitories, subject to Mr. Orr's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Bay, Man.,\nFeb 20, 1929.\n\nDear Capt Edwards:\n\nI have talked with Edward and Archie, informing them that as soon as we get reply to request for their discharge\u2014probably about March\u2014they would be free to go. I am enclosing application for discharge; will you be good enough to attach your approval and forward to Ottawa. It has been a wholesome lesson for all and the change of attitude is very evident.\n\nWe discussed the question of closing the School July 1st instead of July 15th. Since you thought it might be wise to do so, giving longer time to settle in the new school, perhaps it would be well for you to make this recommendation to the Department. It makes no real difference to me. School could open about Aug 15th, but heavy picking is not usually completed at that time.\nIf given eight weeks, some members of staff could stay on two weeks here if necessary, and others return early to help get things in shape for opening. Of course I think the work could be done in the usual six weeks' time, but one cannot be sure.\n\nI presume you will suggest the need for someone at the school to put in the crop, for which the horses could be sent up as soon as the ice leaves the lake, hence in time for spring work. We will need them only to plow the garden for the Indians as I suggested when you were here.\n\nYours,\n\nA.D. Murray\nFebruary 27, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Edwards (108-13, Feb. 22) enclosed the attached letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, which has reference to holidays. He also suggests that arrangements be made for farming on the new site.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nFinal Holiday plan\nfor July-August\nFebruary 27, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of January 15th, last, and to inquire if you are now in a position to nominate a well qualified principal for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. In a few weeks, it would be timely for the new incumbent to be at Kenora, getting acquainted with the situation and cooperating with Mr. Indian Agent Edwards and the former Principal in the matter of transferring equipment, engagement of staff and giving general supervision to the activity on the new site. The farm instructor, also, should be appointed at an early date. Mr. Macsies has promised to send over the horses to put in the crop soon after the ice leaves the lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPercy C. Scott\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

In view of all the circumstances, the Department has decided to allow two months this year - the months of July and August. Please inform those interested.

McKerroll\nToronto Ont.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nIt has been recently brought to our attention that certain charges have been filed against the Principal of the above named School. We, as members of the present Staff, would like to refute the said charges.\n\n1. \"There would seem to be a lack of good feeling between the Staff and principal.\"\n\nIn all our dealings with the Principal we have failed to find the least foundation for such a statement. Mr. Menzies has always supported the Staff in every way.\n\n2. \"The attitude of the Principal toward the Staff is that of an autocrat.\"\n\nWe have always found him kind, considerate, and very just, a friendly spirit existing at all times between the Principal and Staff.\n\n3. \"Neither the Staff nor the Missionary are allowed to enter the School by the front door.\"\n\nAlthough the front door of the School opens into Mr. Menzies' Office, it is always open to members of Staff when they wish to use it.\n\n4. \"The Principal's wife has no sympathy with the work of the School.\"\n\n5. \"She is not the proper type for institutional work as she cannot handle the Staff.\"\n\nWe cannot see that the above two charges have anything to do with the Principal, and their use against him seems unreasonable.\n\n6. \"I believe she is the real head of the School.\"\n\nIn our experience Mr. Menzies has been the head of the School.\n\nSigned:\nMargaret Matheson\nMary Jensen\nEvelyn M Fletcher\nArchie Davidson\nMarian D Cole\nAgnes I Arnold\nCassia Jeffrey Big School,\nFeb. 26th., 1929.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKawartha, Ont.\n\nDear Capt. Edwards:\n\nSome time ago, on false information furnished you by two members of staff at C.W., you formulated certain charges or complaints against me as Principal, adding \"I would therefore recommend a change of Principal.\" I do not wish to appear as interfering in the internal management of the school, but things are so bad that I have been asked to draw your attention to the matter. This resulted in a finding by the Department, citing the charges and accepting all at their face value.\n\nPresumably Mr. Ferrier, having made only a brief visit while the school was closed, is responsible for only one statement; I am quite content to let the record of ten years answer it.\n\nWhen appealed to for information, both you and the Department refused to say who the complaints were and, when invited to make thorough investigation at the school, failed to do so.\n\nYou have now frankly given me the names of the two responsible parties, and have yourself cited evidence that they were not wholly trustworthy. I have from the first been quite sure of the identity of one of the two, who had long had the reputation of being a trouble-maker, but I found it hard to believe the other capable of such dishonesty.\n\nWhen confronted with the charges, the former admitted some of the statements but said she spoke only for herself, not for the staff, and that you had no right to report her statements. The latter not only denied responsibility but when asked whether the charges were true or false, replied \"No, emphatically.\" Not only assured me of her loyalty, yet somehow been one of your informants. All other members of staff gave me positive assurance of the truth of the assertions on which the finding of the Department was based.\n\nOn the testimony of reliable staff members these two tried constantly to prejudice new members of staff and create ill feeling. They had their good qualities and did much good work, but they have made themselves responsible for many dishonorable acts and untrue statements.\n\nWe had been here only a short time when they informed us that they had little use for Capt. Edwards as an Agent and less as a man. Dr. Ferguson was disposed of in like radical fashion.\n\nWhen informed that the two Chiefs and certain of the C.W.W.D. railway officials had asked me if I was going to be Principal or if Misses B. and K. were still going to run the school, the reply was\u2014The two last Principals did little for the discipline of the school and every one knew the last Matron was no disciplinarian, so we had to take responsibility for the management of the children. They were restless under any semblance of authority and evidently wished...\nAfter leaving the School in July 1927 they industriously\nformed its management, tried to get an emissary on the Staff (who\nby the way had to be dismissed), tried to carry on secret correspond-\nence with the children, and informed at least two persons, where they\nthought it would do most harm, that the United Church Board, the Pres-\nbyterian Church Board and the Department of Indian Affairs had each\nasked for my resignation, but they could not get rid of me. Suffice\nit to say I have never been asked to resign.\n\nI have just shown the present Staff a copy of the charges\nsent to Ottawa; they were amazed. The enclosed, which is a copy of\ntheir signed statement, is their answer. Leaving out the two con-\nspirators, a like reply would have been signed by all former mem-\nbers of Staff.\n\nCapt. Edwards you are an Englishman, with I fancy an Eng-\nlishman's sense of honor and justice. On your report and recommenda-\ntion, given presumably in good faith though on false information,\nthe Department took action and, so far as their report could do so,\ndiscredited me with the Church or which I am a minister. Fortunate-\nly Dr. Ramsden, to whom the communication was sent, had known me as a\nfellow-student in the University, had asked me to undertake the work\nhere and knew that such radical statements could not be true.\n\nWe have been above five years at C.J. School, we have not\nwrecked the institution, three who were on the Staff since we came\nhave again applied for work with us, discipline (for the sake of which\nwe were asked to live in the School) has certainly improved greatly,\nyou yourself stated, during your recent visit, that there is an improve-\nment amongst children and Indians since the two took their\ndeparture, (they had tried to make trouble in and out of the School)\neven these two special friends stated again and again that we had\ngiven both Staff and Children an even much better table than formerly\nyet we changed an annual deficit into an annual surplus. We have been\npaying the expenses of four members of Staff, yet keeping the balance\non the right side. You have seemingly never found occasion to criti-\ncise our School or its work, or to suggest any line along which im-\nprovement might be made. I speak of Mrs. MacLies as well as myself\nfor without her efficient oversight and careful cooperation such re-\nsults could not have been obtained.\n\nAs you are aware the Church's Board has expressed its hearty\nappreciation of our work and without my knowledge and months after my\nresignation had been given personally to their Secretary, the President\nand Secretary went to Ottawa and urged withdrawal of the finding of\nthe Department, being unable to find anything to justify it. The Depart-\nment refused reconsideration or enquiry, presumably because you, their\nonly source of information, were supposed to stand by your original re-\nport and recommendation. They thus repeated to the Presbyterian Board\nthe decision given the United Church some time ago, hence this communi-\ncation and appeal.\nI have no desire to go to the new school, but I do object to all this under a cloud after five years of honest and not unsuccessful work. I object too to being condemned afresh before the Church with which I have worked harmoniously since our school was taken over by it, and this under utterly false charges, which have never been looked into and which the complainers themselves had not the courage to face.\n\nUntil now the facts are before you; if not sufficiently informed, the School and its condition can come to you at any time. As you suggested I am sending forward to the Department a full statement of the case in accordance with your request as a man of honor to withdraw your former statements, discredited as above, and to ask for the United Church or which I was a Minister, and for the Presbyterian Board under which I am working, a statement from the Department of Indian Affairs in accord with the facts.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed is a copy of a communication going forward to Capt. Edwards. Some time ago I was condemned unheard by your department. That condemnation has been repeated recently, I take it because you assumed that Capt. E would not go want such a report without every evidence that he was dealing with facts.\n\nI regret the necessary length of the enclosure but would ask you to give its statements careful consideration. The School is open at all times to any representative of your department. I simply ask that justice be done as far as that is now possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.D.

This is due, I believe, through your closer associations with them. I do not think that you leaving the school should make any difference in your relations with your Church as I spoke well of you to Mrs. Hutchison, who was here to see the new school.\n\nYou have very excellent business ability; although when you first came I did criticize your dealings with the Indians after complaints had been made by them. I am glad to say that you have now changed for the better in their opinion.\n\nI am forwarding your letter to Ottawa, and if I receive any instructions I will follow them out.

For a few weeks from that date, however, there would be no water supply or sewage disposal, and it would be necessary to use well water and outdoor facilities. I have learned that the ice may not be out of the lake until some time in May, so June first might be a suitable date for the new principal and the farm instructor to take over their duties.\n\nMay I suggest that you do not complete arrangements for a principal until the Department has approved of your nomination.

Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nYour admonition when we were in Ottawa to secure a principal at once and your letters since that time, urging us to make the appointment by the first of February, I am sorry to say, proved impossible. However, I am glad to notify you that we have appointed, subject to your confirmation, Mr. E.W. Byers of Brandon, Manitoba. I have been writing very patiently for his acceptance as he is a most excellent person and I was so afraid he would not accept. I only received his full acceptance yesterday and now send word of this at once to you. I telephoned to Ottawa while you were away in order to discuss with you this and some other matters and found you would be back in April.\n\nMr. Byers has been for six years, principal of the David Livingstone School in the City of Brandon. It is a fifteen room school, mostly composed of new Canadian pupils. Previously, he was principal at the King Edward school at Rouleau, Saskatchewan, and in Bridgewater, Ontario, has been supervisor in boys' work for the Rotary Club for six years and is considered one of the outstanding community workers in Brandon. He holds certificates in the following subjects: First Aid; St. John's Ambulance; Physical Training; Cadet Instruction; Commercial Standing. Mr. Byers holds a first class professional certificate for Saskatchewan and Manitoba and has also had one term in the Agricultural College, Saskatoon.\n\nMrs. Byers is described by those who know her as \"a capable, strong and a splendid woman.\" She is a good dressmaker, has had much experience in nursing and has been President of various Mission Bands which shows her interest in children.\n\nI have a number of recommendations which I could forward to you if you so desire. However, probably these extracts will serve the purpose.\n\nMr. Currie of Birtle says of him, \"Mr. Byers has had fine experience in Military training. He is outstanding in Community Welfare. His present salary is $2700.00 and it will\nbe a sacrifice for him to consider this new position. From my best available information, you are not likely to secure a better applicant for the position.\"\n\nMr. Alex McIntyre of Winnipeg in his report of the David Livingstone School, says \"while is the most interesting and most promising school in the Brandon School system. To be successful in such a school one must have the missionary spirit...... It would be difficult to find a better man for this community than the principal, Mr. E.W. Byers. Mr. Byers knows his work, he labors for the best and in the best spirit, and the evident results achieved speak of his success.\n\nMr. C.W. Webb, superintendent of schools in Brandon, writes that, \"Mr. Byers has been principal of the David Livingstone School since 1923. He has done and is still doing excellent work. As a disciplinarian, Mr. Byers is firm and courteous as well as sympathetic and winning in his attitude to his pupils. As a teacher, he employs a cool, concrete method, moving at a rate of speed adapted to the need of his class and explaining their difficulties with clearness and patience... Mr. Byers is a good manager of his school and has such a hold upon his staff as to win their fond will and enjoy their whole hearted co-operation.\n\nI find that Mr. Byers was for five years official auditor of school districts and rural municipalities in addition to his school duties. He was also a captain in the 229th battalion, and served overseas. Among all those who have applied for the position, he appears to be the most outstanding and I hope the department will see fit to confirm his appointment.\n\nIt was a great disappointment to me to receive word from your secretary that the building is far from ready and that the principal's residence is not complete, nor is there any immediate prospect of furniture for it. Could you let me know if furniture for the principal's part could be sent on earlier than that or the school so that Mr. Byers could plan the purchasing of the furnishings and what ever is to be done before perhaps the older boys would be moved over from the old site. Could you give me as soon as possible, an idea as to when it may be ready. It means extra expense for our Board to have to procure quarters in Kenora itself for him and yet I do not see what else could be done. If he stays at the old school he will be of no use. We are asking Mr. Mensies to complete the school term as you suggest.\n\nIn view of the building not being complete and the extra expense this entails on our Board, could the Government see fit to give us any grant to help meet the situation. The two salaries and the housing and board will run into quite a sum of money.\n\nMr. Byers is very anxious to know if he should take his electric washing machine with him. It is too bad to trouble you with these details, but it is the first time that a new school and residence have been equipped for us for a long time and I have forgotten the details of the furnishing that the Government does.\n\nWould you kindly let me know if the appointing of Mr. Byers meets with your approbation, also if there is anything else which requires my attention that you know of, would you be kind enough to mention it.\nThanking you,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of Indian Department.\nApril 10, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, nominating Mr. E. W. Byers, of Brandon, for the principalship of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I have read concerning this gentleman's qualifications with interest, and as his experience appears to prepare him quite well for our work, I am pleased to approve of his appointment.\n\nThe Department is quite ready to furnish the Principal's residence at any time, but there is no prospect of water supply or sewage disposal for a few weeks. If Mr. Byers and his family are willing to set up with a little inconvenience until the work is done in the building, there is no reason why he could not take up residence at an early date and supervise the learning activity, accept the furnishings as they arrive and look after the many details attendant upon a successful re-establishment of an institution of this type.\n\nThe Department is willing to bear a fair share of the expenditure before the new school is placed on per capita grant basis. It is our practice to allow about two-thirds of the total costs of the school management. When the school is opened, of course, a per capita grant is made for the current expenses. The work on the farm should be commenced at an early date, and the Department believes it advisable for Mr. Byers to visit Kenora, look over the situation and cooperate with Mr. Indian Agent Edwards in the selection of furnishings for his residence and in the commencement of the farm and garden activity.\n\nThe Department provides the necessary furnishings and equipment, not only for all the buildings, but also for the farm and garden. This, of course, includes the necessary live stock. However, Mr. Byers had better take his electric washing machine with him, as equipment of this kind is not supplied. Of course, the school laundry will be fully provided for. Mr. Byers should have a full discussion with Mr. Edwards in relation to all details of this character and he will be better prepared to decide what he should take with him to Kenora.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerroll,\nEducational Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n19 Lans St., TORONTO 9, Ont.\nApril 10, 1929.\n\nDear Captain Edwards:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, copy of my letter of today's date to Mrs. D. T. L. McKerrell, Educational Secretary, Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, 19 Lans St., Toronto 9, Ont. When Mr. Byers presents himself at your office, I should be grateful if you would give him every assistance in his effort to familiarise himself with conditions at the new Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. Before he is desirous of moving into the principal's residence, you should forward, for the Department's consideration, a list of the furnishings you recommend with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Dr. Ferguson, Mr. Kenzie and myself speak well of Miss Matheson and recommend this suggestion, as she is a very capable nurse and takes great interest in the children, and is well suited for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

It is understood that the Department will not pay the nurse's salary after the end of June. At all Indian residential schools, a practical nurse is on the staff and her salary is not from school earnings. The reason the exception was made in the case of the old Cecilia Jeffrey School was the need for a fully qualified nurse because of the difficulty of securing the services of a doctor quickly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Menzies for expenses incurred in obtaining a Nurse for the Cecelia Jeffrey School, I beg to state that this voucher was paid by cheque No. 2417 which was sent to him at Indian Bay, Man. I herewith enclose the cancelled cheque which is duly endorsed by Mr. Menzies. As soon as he has examined the signature, kindly return the cheque.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nFrank Edwards Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nC. J. Big School,\nIndian Bay, Man.,\nAug. 9, 1929.\n\nHon. Peter Hennan,\nMinister of Labour,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nThe Chief of Shoal Lake #40, two councillors and other Indians called at the School yesterday to inform me of the Chief's interview with you re the closing of the School here and other matters. They asked me to report to you and to the Church's Board under which I am working. They claimed to be in a position to speak for the two Shoal Lake Bands, the two North West Angle Bands and Buffalo Bay Band, and I have good reason to believe their claim is justified by the facts.\n\nThese Bands assert that they can practically fill the school and keep it filled and this is probably true as they have now 50 children in the school and a very considerable number have been kept out lest they should have to go to the new school. They assert further that they are all agreed that they will not allow their children to go to the new school even if it means jail for refusal, but will willingly send all their children to Shoal Lake School if it is re-opened. They also urge that Mrs. Menzies and I remain in charge of the work here.\n\nLet me assure you that I have no axe to grind in stating their case for the Indians. While appreciating the confidence of the Indians, we told them we\nwere leaving in any event. I may say, however, from my knowledge of the situation, after almost 6 years amongst them, that I consider they have a good case and are not making unreasonable request.\n\nWhy close a school accommodating 75 pupils when, if the new school be filled to capacity, 150 or 200 children in the agency will remain with no means of obtaining any education?\n\nWhy shut the door on the children of five Indian bands expressing readiness to send their children when so many others refuse to do so?\n\nI do not know whether the Church would be willing to carry on here and at Kenora, but I do know the past six years has shown that the school, though small, can be run without undue cost as I have paid out of Maintenance Fund (per capita grant) four members of staff each year and am handing over a balance or surplus of around $4000.00.\n\nA PERSONAL WORD\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, through a report of four years ago from the Indian Agent at Kenora, judged Mrs. Mensies and myself incompetent or worse, but the attitude of the Indians, the emphatic commendation of the Church's Board, the testimony of the staff and the record of six years would seem to justify the Church's refusal to make a change.\n\nShould the School be re-opened, it would be very necessary to overhaul the building and make some more or less radical changes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A. D. Mensies,\nPrin.\nOttawa, August 19, 1929.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI am forwarding you herewith letter which I received from Mr. A.D. Menzies, Indian Bay, Manitoba, regarding the Shoal Lake School.\n\nI would be glad if you would look into this matter and let me have your opinions, together with the return of the attached communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMinister of Labour.\n\nDr. D.C.

Mr. Menzies, Principal of the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School at Shoal Lake. I may say that this school is wholly unfit for educational purposes, as it is old and constitutes a very serious fire hazard. It was on these grounds that the Presbyterian Church authorities represented that it must be replaced. The new building near Kenora is now ready for occupation. The old building has been abandoned and no further Indian educational activity will be undertaken there. I have no doubt that the new school will be successful. I am returning Mr. Menzies' letter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nHonourable Peter Heenan,\nMinister of Labour,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nAugust 26, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nThe Department has learned that Reverend Mr. Mensies is urging that the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School remain active and that pupils from the neighbouring reserve be re-enrolled there. As the main building is quite unfit for the purpose and constitutes a very serious fire hazard, the Department cannot sanction such an undertaking, and I should be grateful if you would let Mr. Mensies know that Indian educational activity in the old building is out of the question. I believe it is in the interests of both the Church and the Department that Mr. Mensies move out of the old building. Nothing should interfere with the recruiting and general success of the new Cecilia Jeffrey School, which is now prepared for the reception of pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I am writing Mr. Byers and instructing him to prepare an invitation list and to send it to me at once so that it may be forwarded to your Department. We shall be only too glad to comply with your request in this regard.\n\nI have received a telegram from Mr. Byers, which rather worries me, not the part about Mr. Menzies still being at Shoal Lake, as we gave him permission to spend a couple of weeks camping and resting there before finally pulling out, but the part about the nonattendance of the children. This looks rather serious. Can your Department, through the Agent at Kenora, do anything to reach these Indians and have their children sent into the new school. They are still praising for carrying on the two schools. I wrote Mr. Menzies a conciliatory letter for them as I thought I could, saying that neither the Department nor the Church were in funds sufficient to carry on two schools, and urging that the Indians send their children into the new school and give it a thorough trial, and we felt that they would not find it the hardship they expected, to have them a few miles further distant.\n\nMr. Menzies wrote me that he was turning over the books and the money to Mr. Byers at the beginning of September. He is forty-five miles away by launch and it is possible that they have lingered at the camp an extra week and this has not been done. Our Board has no desire to hurry Mr. Menzies, although we would like him to have turned over the books before now. However, he stated in his letter that he was making an effort to secure accounts which were owing for some supplies which he had brought out on the boat to accommodate the Indians.\nI am writing Mr. Eyers to get in touch with the Indian Agent in regard to the non-attendance of the children and informing him that I am taking the matter up with you. Is there something further that you feel I should do? I shall be glad if you will let me know if this is the case.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nSeptember 11th, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

Miss Matheson's stipend was on a monthly basis, as she was considered only a temporary civil servant. Her case cannot be regarded the same as if she were a member of the staff and paid by the school management or the church authorities. However, I may say that her salary for her work at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School will be paid by the principal there, and I am writing to him today in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Mangles,\nIndian Bay,\nMan.\nOttawa, September 21, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe salary of Miss Matheson, Nurse at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, has been paid by the Department up to the end of June of this year. As she was classified as a temporary civil servant and was paid by the month, they can issue no further cheque from the Department in her case. However, as she is now employed at the new school, there is no reason why you could not pay her for July and August whatever salary you contemplate paying her in the future. The Department will then consider this as one of the current expenses when making an adjustment in lieu of our capita grant, as explained in official 129-3-5 of June 6th. As Miss Matheson has been continuously in the employ of the school during the year, there is no reason why she should not be allowed full salary for July, even though she took some holidays during the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Such a site is available north of Indian Bay, two miles from Waugh, nine miles from Ingolf and six miles from the proposed highway.\n\nWhen Mr. McKitrick, representing the Presbyterian church, arranged with us to build the school on Shoal Lake he promised us that the church would always give us a school in this vicinity.\n\nWe want education for our children and as there is a good deal of tuberculosis amongst us we want our children where we can see them often. We are a long way from a Doctor (45 miles), and a nurse at the school is a great help to us in time of sickness.\n\nThe school has helped us greatly, giving us wood to cut and other work, buying supplies from us, and furnishing us with clothing at a very low rate, our old people without any charge. Fur has become very scarce here, the high water has spoiled our rice fields and our hay and now they would take the help of the school away.\n\nThere are more than enough Indian children in Lake of Woods Bands to fill the new school at Kenora without sending our children there.

These Indians desire that the Cecilia Jeffrey school be reopened.\n\nIf you intend to reply directly to these Indians I would take it as a favour if you would tell them that the Department has no intention whatever of reopening this school.\n\nFor your own information I would say that I have reason to believe that the former principal, Mr. Wenzel, is stirring up the Indians to make this request. I have drawn the attention of the Presbyterian Church authorities to this man's activities and I hope they will be able to control him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. Peter Heenan,\nMinister of Labour,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a communication from your Department re the payment of Nurse Matheson of C.J. School for the months of July and August.\n\nMiss Matheson was engaged on precisely the same conditions as her predecessors who, after 18\u00bd months service, were given the usual holiday with pay. If there was to be made a \"special case\" the Board and Miss Matheson should have been so informed. Representing as I believe both Department and Board, I engaged her promising six weeks holidays. She was on duty continuously from June 1st '28 to July 15th '29 and was surely entitled to her holidays before returning to her duties as she did Aug 25th or thereafter. No Nurse has given better\nAdvice then that rendered by Miss Matheson.\n\nAs I understand it the Department agreed to pay the Nurse for C.J. School until the new building was occupied; hence the Board is justified in looking to the Department to implement its promise.\n\nMiss McKinnell, the Board's Secretary for Indian Work, writes me that after investigating that while under two Principals one should be Treasurer of regular School Funds your Department had sent at least a part of the June per capita directly to Mr. Byers at the new school instead of sending it through the Board as usual.\n\nAs the Board's appointed Treasurer, I advanced to Mr. Byers such monies as he required to prepare for the carrying on of the work in the new School. He informed me that he was furnished with Departmental funds for stumping, clearing ground grading etc.; in short to do anything necessary to put land and building and stock in shape to start work September 1st.\nSurely we are not to understand now that the Department has been raising for buildings or land or equipment per capita funds that had been earned by the Board carrying on the work in the old School.\n\nNone would question the fact that the April-June per capita belonged to the Board in charge of the old School, and since the holidays are given because of the preceding 10\u00bd months of continuous service the Board's claim on the July and August per capita is equally strong. This latter gives opportunity to gain a little leeway financially when expenses are at a minimum.\n\nIn the above I have endeavored to give a plain statement of the Board's position under the circumstances.\n\nYours,\n\nA.D. Macgill\n\nPresumably adjustment will be made in due course but in the meantime it has been a serious handicap to me in the winding up of Old School affairs. Only at the end of Sept did I learn of the change of plans.\nOttawa, October 15, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to holidays for Nurse Matheson. I may say that, on the 21st ultimo, I wrote to Mr. Byers in part as follows: \"There is no reason why you could not allow her for July and August whatever salary you contemplate paying her in the future. . . . . . . As Miss Matheson has been continuously in the employ of the school during the year, there is no reason why she should not be allowed full salary for July, even though she took some holidays during the month.\"\n\nI am sure that Mr. Byers will deal fairly with this officer of the staff. I am today writing to Mr. Byers, telling him that he may allow her full salary for August as well.\n\nWith reference to the payment of the June per capita grant, the Department has had no misunderstanding with the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church. The per capita grant, of course, is not being used for buildings or land or equipment. As far as the Department is aware, the same Board is in charge of the new school as was in charge of the old one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. D. Monks,\n61 Carlton St.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nOttawa, October 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 21st ultimo, concerning the salary of Nurse Matheson. I have had a further communication from the former Principal, and the Department now authorizes you to pay full salary for the summer, even though she took 5 or 6 weeks' holidays. This salary should be charged to the current expenses for the September quarter. This action, of course, should be taken only if you concur that it is fair and reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. W.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAt the request of our Board of Missions I am forwarding to you the following resolution passed by the Board at its September meeting:\n\n\"It was moved, seconded, and agreed, that the Board place on record its deep appreciation of the generous action of the Indian Department of the Government in placing at the disposal of the Women's Missionary Society of our Church, the excellent and excellently equipped buildings at Kenora, for the purpose of Indian education, and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Department.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAGG/B\nKenora, Ont.\nOctober 18th, 1929\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed by some of the Indians of the Shoal Lake Band that the late Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey School, Reverend A.D. Menzies, prepared a petition for the Indians asking that the school be kept on at Shoal Lake, and that the petition was sent in direct to Ottawa. Mr. Menzies appears to have been the cause of a lot of the trouble we have had in getting the children back to the new school at Kenora as he was staying there until last fall and I have it on good authority that he has caused most of the dissatisfaction among the Indians. He has now left Shoal Lake, and I presume he will not be going back there.\n\nMr. Byers, the new Principal, also complains about him and particularly in connection with school funds. He told Mr. Byers he had about $3,000 on hand, but from Mr. Byers statement to me he is unable to obtain the funds from him and Mr. Byers requires money to carry on the work at the school. I have advised him to write to his church authorities in connection with this and no doubt they will take the matter up with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\nPROGRAMME\n\nWednesday, November 6th (Probable)\n\nAfternoon and Evening Sessions\n\nAfternoon 2 to 4\nEvening 8 to 10\n\nSpeakers\n\nGovt.

Would you be kind enough to give me anything that you think would be useful, such as when the school first opened, who built it, the names of the different principals, who was Agent at the time of opening, was there any particular ceremony at this opening, and any other information that might be useful.\n\nThe time is short so drop me a line as soon as you can.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nwas a reverend gentleman, or not:\n\n1908 - Mr. J.

Ross,\n1922 - Rev. W. J. Cockson,\n1923 - Rev. A. D. Munroes,\n1929 - Mr. E. W. Byers.\n\nInteresting points in connection with the school are as follows: In 1907 and 1908, the Department built an addition at a cost of $6,000 and gave further assistance for improvements. In 1918, the church enlarged the building and made improvements. In 1919, a pupil, Alex. Mandamin, performed an act of heroism - saving the life of a white man, who had broken through the ice. Alex. received the Royal Canadian Humane Association Medal. In 1914, the building was again enlarged, the Department helping with fire escapes, etc. In 1921, the Department built a septic tank; in 1925, provided a launch; and in 1926, provided electric light.\n\nCommencing in 1927, after it had been decided that a new building was imperative, efforts were made to select a suitable farm and site. From that time to the present date, the establishment of the new institution near Kenora has cost the Dominion Government a total of $141,000.00. This figure does not include any current expenses whatever.\n\nI trust that you will be able to use some of the material I have hurriedly arranged for this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 2, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Edwards:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the history of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I have examined old reports and all files for this school, and I am able to give you the following information. I regret that, if my letter is to reach you in time for the opening, I will have no opportunity of putting it into readable shape.\n\nIn 1901, the Presbyterian Church, no doubt assisted by their Women's Missionary Society, commenced the erection of a boarding school on Shoal Lake. A main building and a Principal's residence were completed at a cost of approximately $7,000. The church acquired 240 acres of the tract as a site. The Department allowed a per capita grant of $72 per child per year and provided school desks and minor equipment. In these days and right from the beginning, the church found it necessary to supplement the per capita grant.\n\nThe representative of the Department in 1902, when the school was opened, was Inspector J. Arthur Leveque. He was acting as agent for what was then called the Rat Portage agency. In 1905, Mr. R. B. McKenzie was transferred to Rat Portage and was the Indian agent until you succeeded him. From time to time, the Department increased the amount of the per capita grant, provision being made as follows:\n\n| Year | Grant |\n|------|-------|\n| 1906 | $72   |\n| 1911 | $85   |\n| 1917 | $95   |\n| 1919 | $145  |\n| 1921 | $165  |\n\nThe pupilage has been increased from time to time, as follows:\n\n| Year | Pupilage |\n|------|----------|\n| 1906 | 30       |\n| 1909 | 40       |\n| 1915 | 60       |\n| 1916 | 70       |\n| 1927 | 75       |\n| 1929 | 125      |\n\nThe Principals are as follows, and I regret that I am unable to learn whether the first principal\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamora, Ont.\n\nwas a reverend\nNovember 5th, 1929\n\nRussell T.

The ceremony was presided over by Rev. Norman MacKearney, M.A., moderator of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, who was assisted by a number of others in the important proceedings.\n\nA large number of Kenora citizens were present and they were received by Principal E.W. Byers. Mrs. McKerroll, Secretary of Indian Affairs for the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, was also present.\n\nThe visitors were conducted over the new building, inspecting the charming grounds of the school, its occupied, spacious dormitories, playrooms, and all parts of the new building.\n\nPrincipal E.W. Byers presided over the opening ceremonies and in speaking of the welcome extended to Kenora and outside points to the new school, he felt that this was a red-letter day in the history of the school, and stated that the Department of Indian Affairs had placed a monument to the school which was worthy of any Government. He expressed regret at the absence of Dr. Scott, Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. Earl Hutchison, who acted as Provincial Secretary representative, was then called on, and in making the key of the school, Mr. Hutchison paid tribute to Dr. Scott and others who had taken such a great personal interest in the Cecil Jeffery school.\n\nMrs. McKerroll in accepting the key, stated that she did so with a full sense of the work the government had done, not only here but in other points. She received the key with the greatest sincerity to do all they could for the Indian children. Mrs. McKerroll paid a brief tribute to Cecelia Jeffery, after whom the school had been named. She then handed on the keys to Principal Byers as the Society's representative.\n\nCaptain F.J. Edwards, who represented the Department of Indian Affairs, thanked the former speaker for his remarks and spoke of the Department. In a brief resume of the history of the Cecelia Jeffery school, Captain Edwards said that it had been built by the church at Shoal Lake in 1891, with $10 acres of land donated by the Indians. The total contribution had been $7,000. The new building was first thought of in 1925 and the church decided to go ahead in purchasing the site. The approximate expenditure was $141,000. He thanked Captain Edwards on behalf of the Department, for their good works, and also asked all present to show a continued interest in the school.\n\nRev. Norman MacKearney then took charge of the proceedings, and the ceremony, characterized by simplicity and impressive solemnity, was carried through, and the new building was officially opened. The Reverend clerk of the Synod, and Rev. J.O. Hamilton assisted in the Dedication Service.\n\nMrs. Strachan was called upon and made an impressive address, outlining the work of the Society. The Indian Department had done their part well, and the school was designed to carry on the work of education. The upkeep of the school would be borne approximately $115 per each child per annum or an amount equal to that furnished by the department.\n\nRev. W.A. McKay, supervisor of missions for the Presbyterian church in northern Ontario and eastern Manitoba, brought greetings to all. He wished to see more Indians who would furnish a pupil \"Longboat,\" one who could be sustained and educated, not merely to his or her own people, but also minister to the needs of the world.\n\nBefore the conclusion of the service, Principal Byers read messages of greetings and congratulations from various parts of the country. In the evening Principal and Mrs. Byers entertained at dinner the church and society representatives who had taken part in the service.\nDuncan C Scott, Sec.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed please find cutting from the Kenora Miner's News, with reference to the dedication of the new Cecil Jeffrey School here, where I voted in your place. The ceremony went off very satisfactorily and I think everyone was pleased with what the Department had done. The Principal, Mr. Earl Hutchison, Mayor of the Town and Labor member-elect in the Provincial House to hand over the keys of the building to Mrs. Macarvoll, Secretary of Indian Affairs for the Women's Missionary Society as he was the only member of any Government there. This was, of course, not quite in order but Mr. Hutchison spoke very nicely and nobody noticed anything.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEnc.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nThe opening and dedication of the lovely new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Boarding School at Kenora, passed off very well indeed. The service was most interesting and the dedication most impressive. We had arranged to have sufficient members of Winnipeg Presbytery to form a quorum come to Kenora for the occasion. The Rev. Mr. McEachern in his robes led the dedication procession and the whole service was very fine. Mr. Hutchinson, M.P.P., and Captain Edwards, Indian Agent, were among those who made very fine addresses. The only flaw in the proceedings was that the seating of the chapel had not yet arrived. Mr. Byers had rented all the chairs available in Kenora, which were just enough to seat the guests. The Indian boys and girls, eighty-three in number, came in and sat on the floor.\n\nMay I express to you, and to the Honorable Mr. Stewart and to the Indian Department, our very great appreciation of the new building and of the care and thought that have been put into arrangements to carry on the Indian work at this point.\n\nI met two of the Chiefs who had been pressing to have the school on the old site continued, and I think that the Rest House arranged for them in Kenora, has been a great factor in their becoming more contented with the new school, and I hope this will increase as time goes on.\n\nThere are some details which should be arranged and completed before the architect is completely paid. I will write you more fully about this in a day or so, and will give Mrs. Strachan notes before she meets you. On the whole the building is very well suited to its purpose.\nand the children seemed to be enjoying very much their new home. The principal's house is very nice indeed and looked so cosy and homelike, although I fear that neither he nor Mrs. Byers had been in it except at sleeping times, owing to the strain of preparation.\n\nThe white quilts which you so kindly arranged arrived only an hour before the opening, but certainly made everything look much nicer.\n\nThere are many other things I would like to say to you about the kindness of the Department, and also in appreciation of Captain Edwards' assistance, which has meant a very great deal to us and to Mr. Byers. May I also thank you, Sir, personally, for your continued and wise interest and guidance in this large undertaking, which must be a great satisfaction to you, as well as to us, to see now in operation.\n\nMay I again express to you the appreciation of our Board of all your personal supervision.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nThe \"Cecil Jeffrey\" Indian Residential School\n\nA Brief History\n\nThe \"Cecil Jeffrey\" Indian Residential School was opened in 1902 and was named in memory of one of our Women's Missionary Society Secretaries of Indian work, who had given long service in the work of the north west. For a number of years previous to this date, pioneering work had been carried on by Rev. A. D. McKitterick among the bands of Indians near the Bow river round the lake of the Woods and Shuswap Lake. These Indians were all pagans, but they received Mr. McKitterick kindly and listened to his conversation and teaching. Mr. McKitterick had a knowledge of Cree which was a great help to him in his study of Ojibway and enabled him to converse with them in their own language.\n\nA site for a school was chosen between Shuswap Lake and Rice Bay, near the boundary line of Ontario and Manitoba and forty-five miles from the town of Kamloops. The government granted ten acres free and one hundred and ninety more for a mere nominal sum, which would prevent anyone settling too near the school. The money to build this school was provided by the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nThe school, a handsome substantial building, two and one-half stories high, one hundred thirty-eight by sixty feet, with accommodation for forty children and staff, was opened in January, 1902. After the dinner to the Chief and principal Indians, articles were signed by whom they wished to send their children. The Chief at once brought his son and the Chief Councillor three small ones with garments. These children never having gone to school, it was thought best to take in only twenty-five to begin with.\n\nWhile the work was in process of erection, Mrs. McKitterick endeavored to visit the women and, after many efforts much tact, and the giving of a cup of tea, she succeeded, and so long they came to see her, to listen to her troubles and trials, then they began to come for temple food and medicine for their sick and were anxious to have missionary to visit them.\n\nThe Indians were delighted with the school and its equipment, and began attending regularly to it, which meant that they came more under its influence. Even those from a distance who opposed it brought their children. In one year the children made a remarkable advance in manners and thoroughness of work out of school and rapid progress and increasing interest in the school room.\n\nThe year 1903 was a happy one on the roll. It was the most successful year in the history of the school, not only in attendance, but in progress and influence. The scholars had begun to show the effects of earnest Christian teaching in their lives and characters and some other\nstudents had accepted Christ as their personal Saviour. In December two of the graduates married in Christian marriage and established a Christian home. From the very beginning worship was conducted in the school morning and evening. The class room work was also opened with Bible reading and prayer. On Sunday there was a morning service, Sunday School in the afternoon and a song service in the evening.\n\nIn 1902 an Auxiliary Band of the older girls of the school was formed. It had a special educational value in teaching the Indian girls Christian duties, privileges, responsibilities and methods of organization which they could use in any Christian work they might undertake among their own people. Three years later a Mission Band was organized and so anxious were the smaller girls to do something to help outside of meeting, that they were given material and they made quilts for babies.\n\nAnd so the work grew. By 1903, there were enough children in the district to fill two large schools. Despite the fact that the school has been remodelled and enlarged in 1912, there are still not sufficient class room accommodation for the number now sought for admission. New facilities will be introduced such as public health nursing, with the result that one of the girls entered one of the W.M.S. hospitals to take a regular course of nursing, and our hope is that several others will take a similar course, while one of the senior boys took an advanced course in studies to enable him to help his own people. The attendance mounted steadily under the religious instruction and instruction taught.\n\nThe review of the past would be complete without some reference to the Principals and staff who, in turn visited spot and amid many difficulties, accomplished such a fine piece of work for the Indians and the Church. The list of Principals includes the names of: Rev. Mr. Gaudier; Mr. J. D. McGregor; Rev. F. T. Davis; Mr. Matthews; Rev. P. Martin; Rev. J. T. Ross; Mr. W. Cookson; Rev. A. D. Macdonald.\nTHE CLAD TIDINGS\n\nThe closing of this school sees the closing of a chapter in the history of the work among the Indians rich in result that no statistical table can ever tabulate.\n\nOn November 6th, we begin again a fresh chapter in the \"Cecilia Jeffrey\" School, and our hope is, in the years to come, to fit many boys and girls for work, and missionary service.\n\nWhereas the old school was built with the funds of the W.M.S., a new policy has been inaugurated, and the new school has been built and equipped by the Department of Indian Affairs. We wish publicly and through our official magazine to thank the Department who, through the erection of this fine school, have made it possible for us to carry on a much larger and more efficient work.\u2014M.C.O.F.\n\nNew \"Cecilia Jeffrey\" Indian Residential School Officially Opened\n\nThe official opening of the \"Cecilia Jeffrey\" Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario, took place at 3 o'clock on Wednesday, November 6th, in the presence of a large and representative gathering.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. E. W. Byers, and Mrs. Byers, Mrs. D. T. L.\n\nMcKerrall and Mrs. Daniel Strahan, of Toronto, received the guests at the entrance to the Chapel. Among those present were\u2014Col. A. T. Fife, ex-Mayor; Mayor E. Hutchinson, M.P.P.; Dr. Fer...\nAfter the guests had been received they were shown through the building by members of the staff, then they returned to the Chapel for the opening services.\n\nPrincipal Byers presided, and on the platform with him were Mr. Earl Hutchison, M.P.P., representing the government; Capt. Edwards, the Department of Indian Affairs; Mrs. Daniel Strachan and Mrs. D. T. L. McKerrell, Toronto, and Mrs. J. R. Hutchison, Winnipeg, the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nAfter the singing of the National Anthem, Principal Byers gave a short introductory statement and introduced Mr. Earl Hutchison, M.P.P., who made a brief address and, in closing, on behalf of the Government, handed over the key of the school to Mrs. D. T. L. McKerrell, Secretary of Indian Schools, for the Women's Missionary Society (W.D.) of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\nMrs. MacKerron, in receiving the key for the Society thanked the Government and the Department of Indian Affairs for the fine and splendidly equipped building, and promised that every effort would be made to carry on the work of the School as efficiently as possible.\n\nCapt. Edwards, the guest speaker, gave a short history of the School from its opening in 1903, with a statement of the monies expended on this School by the Department of Indian Affairs since then.\n\nThe Presbytery of Winnipeg, led by the Moderator in his absence, came to the platform and took charge and conducted the service of dedication. Rev. N. A. MacEachern, of Brandon, was acting Moderator, and other members of the Presbytery present were\u2014Rev. J. O. Balston and Rev. David Johnston, of Winnipeg; Rev. W. M. Mackay, Synodical Superintendent, sat as a corresponding member.\n\nThe service opened with the singing of Psalm 86\u2014Old Hundred. Rev. J. O. Balston read the Scripture lesson\u2014Psalm 84; and Rev. David Johnston led in prayer. A very beautiful dedication service was then conducted by the Moderator, Rev. N. A. MacEachern, the congregation joining in the response. Hymn 265, \"The Church's One Foundation,\" was sung.\n\nMrs. MacEachern then introduced Mrs. D. Strachan, President of the Women's Missionary Society. Mrs. Strachan referred briefly to the responsibilities of the Women's Missionary Society in connection with the training of Indian children, and expressed the hope that from this School some Indian girls would soon come to the Missionary and Deaconess Home in Toronto, for training for work among their own people.\n\nRev. W. M. Mackay then spoke stressing the gratitude of the Church for this new building.\n\nPrincipal Bryson spoke briefly expressing his thanks to the citizens of Kenora for their kindly cooperation.\n\nRev. N. A. MacEachern pronounced the benediction.\n\nPrincipal and Mrs. Bryson entertained the out of town guests at dinner in the evening at the Tourist Hotel.\n\nThe School is a fine red brick building two and a half stories in height, with an extension to one side in which is the chapel. The Principal's residence also forms a part of the building with a door\nconnecting it and the school proper. The school is beautifully situated on rising ground and overlooking a lovely little lake. All the buildings necessary for carrying on farm work are also on the land adjoining the School. The property comprises 160 acres of land, 70 of which are in the school grounds, the remainder is covered with trees. The dormitories are large, sunny and airy as, indeed, are all the rooms. The School has accommodation for 125 pupils. At present there are 93 boys and girls in attendance, leaving adequate room for expansion.\n\nThe Reunion of the Scottish Churches\n\nThe material for this article describing the reunion of the Scottish Presbyterian Churches, has been taken from the Record of the Church of Scotland, and from articles by Dr. Norman MacLean and other Church writers, appearing in the special supplement of The Scotsman devoted to this great event.\u2014Editor.\n\nThe second of October, 1929, provided a new date in Scottish story for that day, in the stately city of Edinburgh, the reunited Church of Scotland entered a greatly enlarged sphere of opportunity and service, and became again as it was in the past, the principal moral force in Scotland.\n\n\"It was a day with gleams and sunshine, and flecked with shadows, in which the two streams of Scottish Presbyterians separated for eighty-six years, came together at the top of Bank Street, and flowed into St. Giles\u2014the Temple of Conciliation. The solemn tide proceeded westward, and the slow emphasis of the old Assembly echoed in the ringing of the procession until at last the halls were tumultuous. It was all very different from the great scene in St. Andrew's Church in 1843, when nearly half left and half remained. That was a scene of triumph and desolation, of glory and of tragedy. But, today nobody was left. Dense crowds watched the meeting of the two streams. As one of the bands played, the church doors opened, and the stream moved. Some of the crowd raised the strains of a psalm. The united procession then moved four abreast and so passed into the Church of John Knox. As the procession went up the nave, the white Christ in the great east window glowed as if in benediction. It was a solemn thing to watch the countless throng that came in, elders of Scotland and united Free Churchmen of Scotland side by side. It took three minutes ere the Church was filled, and at the end men stood against the walls for the great Cathedral could not seat all that throng.\n\nA Great Heritage\n\n\"The first tense moment came when the west door was flung open and the Lord High Commissioner, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have just returned from Kenora, where in company with Mrs. McKerroll, I attended the opening of the new Cecilia Jeffrey School. Our Board thought the occasion important enough to send out the President of our Society as well as the Secretary for Indian work.\n\nI felt that I must write and tell you what a contribution that school is to work among the Indians. It is such a nice bright, airy building that it should be full of health for the children, and its nearness to the town of Kenora will mean a great deal to keeping the staff happy and contented. I suppose the Secretary will have found some things that are not quite right, but I have nothing to do with that, she will likely be writing to you herself.\n\nI met Mr. Byers, the principal, for the first time, and was very much pleased with the appointment. He seems to have already a good grasp of what is required in Indian work. May I also say how delighted I was to meet Captain Edwards, the Indian Agent, and what a good address he made at the opening of the School. Although I had corresponded with Captain Edwards when I was Indian Secretary, I had never met him and it was a real pleasure to do so at this time.\n\nI simply want to write and thank you now, on behalf of my Board and the Society, for all that the Indian Department has done in placing this School at our disposal to carry on educational and religious work. May I also thank you for your own personal interest in all that has concerned the building of this School, and to say how much we regretted that you could not be present to see for yourself the splendid contribution that the Department has made to this work.\nThanking you most sincerely, on behalf of the Women's Missionary Society of our Church, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHelen M. Starcher\nNovember 15, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan,\n\nI have read with great gratification your letter of the 14th instant. I am very glad to know that you are pleased with the new Cecilia Jeffrey School. I regretted greatly that I was not able to attend the opening, but I am very much occupied here just now preparing for the Session of Parliament. I am pleased that you are favourably impressed with Mr. Eyers, and I think in Captain Edwards we have an Agent who will promote the interests of the school on every occasion.\n\nThanking you for your letter, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. D.

One member of staff can testify that she served two suppers to the children consisting of one slice of dry bread, and a cup of cold water. This is a Christian mission.\n\nOn Dec. 17th the staff protested to the Principal about the meager food supply which the children were getting, and one woman said to him \"go into the children's dining room at meal times yourself, and hear them asking for food, and have none to give them, and see how we eat like this,\" to which he replied \"give them all they want, and let them make trips of themselves.\" The next morning for breakfast after the children had eaten more porridge than they had been given previously they ate 35 loaves of bread and most of it dry. For dinner in addition to meat and vegetables they ate 28 loaves of bread most of it dry, and for supper they ate 23...\nIt was only two days for each child being killed. This was the first day that the staff had been allowed to give the children as much food as they needed since the new school opened sometime in September. 95 children\n\nThe staff say that it was only the quantity of food given which made some of the children, that kept them fit at all. Any one knows that one can't feed children that amount of food in one day, if they were not hungry and needed it further and one who has been connected with Indians until in one of the schools, can tell you that 60% of the Indians children are not strong, they need food and plenty of it.\n\nA principal who is contemptible enough to starve poor helpless little children should be plugged. Surely a school getting a large per capita grant such as this is getting corn afford to give the children enough to eat. Take the meat and for expensive fancy things and send plain food in sufficient quantities.\n\nThis is a disgraceful state of affairs, and was reported to the Indian agent at Kansas some time ago but by Indians and children, evidently he hasn't forwarded the report to the dept. I cannot believe that the dept. knowing these things would want a principal kept at the school\nThe perpetration was inevitable.\n\nThere is a \"Children's Ministry Room\" which hangs in the pantry, furnishing like the menu used for the children. Why it is there no one knows unless it is for show, because it has never been put into effect\u2014except if that menu was used, it could not be adequate because they are allowed to eat on their heads for some weeks\u2014surely the children should not be required to eat dry bread, they need the best, especially in winter when they get so little milk.\n\nPeople in Kansas know what the situation at the new school is\u2014the Brin across the street\u2014nothing but they did not the children\u2014will it themselves.\n\nUp until Christmas and after the staff were not supplied with table tops, and when out for the evening were obliged on returning back school either wind or weather the engineers who could or would an enormous amount of work for the fire escape and window which they had left open for their own convenience.\n\nNow, boys are very rude, ill-mannered, communicative people, and it is very humiliating for those of the staff who are superior to them and every way to have to tolerate indignities such as this from them. There is no reason why the\nStaff should be treated as servants surely. By servants I today would put up with the things the staff do, but they carry on for the sake of the children, what would happen to the children otherwise one doesn't like to think.\n\nThere was a very fine Indian girl (one pupil of the old school) working at the new school, a kindly pure-minded, dependable, and character in every way, and understanding the Indian language as she did\u2014never an invalidable help, but she was bullied and treated so meanly by the Principal that she could not stand it and left, and it seemed very much as though they were trying by their treatment of the old staff to have that old school to force them out. It is my earnest hope that the Principal will be dismissed before this happens. He is not the man for the work by his untruthfulness and general mean, disrespectful conduct, contemptuous and respectless attitude to staff and children, and will never regain all the things he has lost too far to hope for that\u2014except the children who say to each other \"Mr. Rogers tells lies\" they can't understand this in their principal. He is so different from our memories when we were the soul of honour in all his dealings with staff, children, and Indians, and whom they all liked and respected. I have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Rogers create a very bad atmosphere in the school.\ntheir unkindness, shifting duties and responsibilities, are all bad, and it engenders a spirit of intense dislike for them with the children. The children they are not doing the work which the church sent them there to do; the children would be better out of the school than living under the influence of such people.\n\nThere is nothing in this report that cannot be substantiated from investigation; much more could be said but I have to stop sometime. I have tried to be comprehensive without being tiring, but the best short written comment on the state of things really, one has to live with it from day today to realize how bad they are.\n\nLively between Church and State something can be done. We ought not to be found who are not able and willing to rise. This is more than a report; it is a prayer for action and that speedily\u2014\n\nOne who is interested\n\nThe Indians held an indignation meeting at the school re\u2014the food question before the treaty took effect in Canada.\nMarch 10th, 1930\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.129-3-1 of the 4th instant, enclosing an anonymous letter referring to the food for the children of the Cecilia Jeffrey School and also the general suitability of the Principal and Matron, I thought it advisable to go over the matter with the Principal himself which I did, and he immediately requested me to read the letter to the staff and get their opinion on it. I thought this was the best thing to do so went to the school on Saturday the 14th, and had a meeting of the Principal and all the staff, and went into the different matters complained of.\n\n(1) As regards the food supplied to the children, the staff all informed me that they considered the children were getting plenty at the present time. One or two of them had an idea that they were not getting enough at one time. This was mentioned to the Principal and the matter was immediately rectified. I enclose a copy of the menu mentioned in the letter. The staff inform me this menu is adhered to pretty well, but on one occasion some time ago there was not enough to go around. This was no fault of the Principal and it only happened on one occasion. The menu is taken from what used at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School and set up by the Church of England authorities. The Principal has made additions to that given at Sioux Lookout and I think there should be no complaints.\n\nAs regards the statement made in the letter that the matter had been reported to the Indians by the Indians and children, I have spoken to Chief English of the Shoal Lake Band informed me he had heard the children were not eating enough to eat. I asked him to go to the school and be there at meal time, and not to inform the Principal or staff what he was there for, and to report back to me what he thought. He came in a few days afterwards and informed me he thought they had plenty to eat. His boy who was a pupil at the school also informed me they had plenty to eat so no further action was taken in the matter.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary - 2 -\n\nMarch 10th, 1930\n\n(2) As regards latch keys for the staff, the Principal informed me he had given three out but there was only one to be found at the present time. He told the staff if anybody desired a key they could always have one. All the staff informed me that both Mr. and Mrs. Byers were reasonable and not rude or ill-mannered, and there did not seem to be any ill feeling between any of them.\n\n(3) As regards the Indian ex-pupil from the school. This girl was working there and Mr. Byers had been compelled to speak to her about several things she had done. His treatment of her according to what I heard, appeared reasonable. Mr. Byers informs me that he believes this anonymous letter came from or through one of the members of the staff he had to discharge some time ago, but of course, is not sure. This person, he informs me, persuaded the Indians to quit to save her position. The girl is not here now and I shall not be able to see her for some time, but if I do I will try and find out why she left.\n\nI asked all the staff if they had any complaints against the Principal and they told me \"No.\" I told them the Principal and staff were all engaged by the Church but the Principal had to be approved by the Department and that we did not like interfering with any internal matters at the school but if there was any dissatisfaction or trouble, I would be only too glad to see what I could do on behalf of the Department. No one had any complaints of any kind and I do not think any particular notice need be taken of this communication. Mr. Byers mentioned that one had also been sent to the Church authorities in Toronto, which they had taken no notice of and destroyed.\n\nAs regards the letter, I made a full investigation and could not substantiate anything that was said in it. The staff inform me they have no knowledge of an indignation meeting having been held at the school by the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (MG 10), Volume 6187, File A61-L, part 2\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nMarch 13, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nFrom correspondence on file you will notice that the Principal has been complaining about the difficulty in operating the mechanical plants at the new Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nI have today received a letter giving in detail the result of an investigation of the water supply system, especially the Chlorinator. The following is an extract from this report,-\n\n\"During the course of my inspection with Captain Edwards we noticed that the pumps required repacking, the air compressor motor in the tank room was in a very dirty condition, there were fire hazards in the boiler room, and the interior of the building was not receiving proper attention. Your Department has gone to great expense in equipping this school with modern conveniences. The installations made for providing these conveniences have in every instance been made as simple as possible, but for efficient and continuous service proper attention is essential. In my opinion the services supplied at the Cecilia Jeffrey school are not fully appreciated by the Principal, the operation of the chlorinating, water supply and heating systems instead of being entrusted to a competent and qualified operator are being inadequately looked after by the chief farm hand. Under these circumstances full advantage cannot be taken of the conveniences supplied, damage to equipment will result, and complaints will be frequent.\"\n\nFrom the above it would appear that the mechanical plant at this school is not receiving the proper attention and is not being operated as it should. Mechanical equipment such as installed in a modern residential school requires the services of a competent, qualified operator and unless the school authorities employ a man with the necessary qualifications sooner or later there will be trouble in the operating of the systems and the Department will be called upon to pay for repairs which are due to improper operating.\n\n[signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, March 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is today writing Mr. Byers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, asking him to take immediate steps to secure a properly qualified engineer.

It is stated that the pumps required reparing, the air compressor motor in the tankroom was in a very dirty condition, that there were fire hazards in the boiler room and that the equipment for chlorinating the water was not properly used. I have to ask you to make immediate arrangements for a new school engineer\u2014one who is qualified and competent to look after expensive machinery.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Indian Agent Edwards concerning the steps you take.

March 21st, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe report from Engineer who visited the school recently and who reported unfavorably upon our Engineer as being not competent to look after the mechanical plant.\n\nI wish to state that it was a rather unfortunate inspection. It was a condition which existed that day only. The Furnace room was untidy owing to the fact that it was the day on which the furnaces were being cleaned out. I have three of the older boys appointed to clean out the ashes and sweep the furnace room immediately after breakfast. This is attended to daily without fail. This particular day the cleaning was left until the furnace was cleaned.\n\nRe the pumps requiring packing; it was our engineer who called the Inspector's attention to it. Our check valves were not holding and we had to order new ones. As we could not secure them locally we were obliged to send away for them and we were waiting for the valves before doing the packing. In fact it was not so much the need for packing as for new valves.\n\nRe the chlorinating plant not being properly used -\nThis was no fault of our engineer. Wallace and Tiernan will corroborate this statement that our engineer knows the Chlorinator plant in every detail. We did have the plant ready to operate when the pumps shut down in the Fall. Then when everything was ready again the safety plug in the cylinder corroded through allowing the liquid gas to escape. This accident was entirely beyond our control and as Wallace and Tiernan stated might have occurred in any plant. The escaping gas certainly did a lot of damage and there is no telling just how far it will effect the plant. This was no neglect on our part, the gas could not be shut off, the only thing we could do was to disconnect the cylinder and carry it outside.\n\nAs regards fire hazards in the boiler room, we had a box containing the sweepings which are regularly burned. I do not consider there was any fire hazard however I have had the box removed.\n\nOur engineer's work was very favorably commented on by such engineers as Campbell, of Campbell Heating Co.\nRobertson of Spencer Heating Co. and others.\n\nHe is a very trustworthy man and I would appreciate your giving him a further trial and see what a later inspection will prove regarding his suitability as an engineer.\n\nI was away the day the engineer made his inspection and I feel that the conditions met with that day were very unusual and not a just basis upon which to judge our engineer. He spent two years as engineer in the old school at Shoal Lake.\n\nI wish to lay this information before you and shall await your further ruling in the matter.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.129-3-1 of the 17th instant informing me that the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School had been asked to take immediate steps to secure a properly qualified Engineer, and that a recent report indicated that the chemical plant is not receiving proper care, and expert handling. I enclose a letter received yesterday from Mr. Myers, in reply to your letter to him. Mr. Myers is very adverse to changing the Engineer who came to the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Shoal Lake some time ago and has been well spoken of by the previous staff and also by Mr. Myers. This young fellow was a student, and is wonderfully well liked as far as the school is concerned. Mr. Kelly, Water Inspector of Fort Arthur, also spoke well of Mr. Myers. H.C. Lindean of Wallace and Tierney who installed the chlorinator, informed me the other day that he knew nothing about the chlorinator or any man could know, and was most efficient for. Mr. Myers does not want to lose to a Engineer as if he did he would probably have to get rid of the Engineer who is working with him, and he asks the important if they will not reconsider their decision on keeping him on. To have a proper qualified Engineer at the school and authorities would have to pay large wages, and they say this is impossible in view of the grant they get.\n\nMr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power Branch, who put in the report only visited the school once and his report is based on that visit. I personally think that the present Engineer will be alright but he has been working under a handicap. We have arranged, as advised by Mr. Gow, for the men in charge of the Town Watermeter plant to visit the school occasionally and inspect the plant. It would, therefore, recommend that for the present at least the Engineer be kept on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent\nOttawa, March 29, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to refer to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 17th instant, concerning the engineer at the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School.

I hope that he may measure up fully to this opportunity for improvement. He seems to be a very fine young man and to have a good influence over the boys; but if his other work is not satisfactory, we of course could not keep him for that alone.

March 5th, 1931.\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn several occasions Indians have asked me to buy from them Deer meat and also Moose meat. I was not certain just how this would be viewed by the Game Warden or other game authorities, and so have refused to take any.\n\nThey are always very sore when I do not buy and state that other schools always take it from them.\n\nIt would be very nice if we could give the children some Deer meat periodically as they have a longing for the wild meat.\n\nI wish you would secure for me a ruling on this and ascertain if arrangements could be made to have Deer meat periodically for the Indian Children. They have always been accustomed to having the meat and I understand that the law allows Indians to have Deer meat for their own use, and as these are Indian children would it not be considered within the rights of the law to have meat occasionally for their use.\n\nAwaiting to hear your instructions in regard to this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKanaza, Ontario,\nMarch 6th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have pleasure in forwarding you a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, re: purchasing Deer and Moose meat from the Indians for the use of the Indian children at the School.\n\nWe understand that some years ago the Indian Schools here had authority to purchase meat for the Indian children, and we shall be glad if you will take this matter up, so we can reply to the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMarch 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your consideration copy of a letter that has been received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School at Kenora, Ontario, with reference to the desirability of obtaining a supply of deer and moose meat for the use of the Indian children at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

T. L. McKerroll,\n19 Laws Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nWe wired you today, asking when Mr. Byers would be back, as George Waugh the Farm Instructor at the School was unfortunately drowned in Round Lake on Wednesday 14th inst. The night before, he had married Miss Jamieson one of the Teachers. In the absence of Mr. Byers, and in conjunction with Mr. Davidson, I took charge.\n\nIt appears that Waugh called the boys as usual to get in the cows at 5:30 A.M. and was last seen that morning, going towards the Barn. His Cap was found in the Lake that day, and dragging operations commenced, the body being recovered the next day. An enquiry was held by the Coroner and a Post-Mortem made, and death was caused by drowning. There is no evidence to show how he got in the lake. Mrs. Waugh (Miss Jamieson's Brother) came here also the closest relative Mr. Charles Stewart, and Waugh was buried in the soldier's plot in the Lake of the Woods cemetery, under the auspices of the Canadian Legion. Mr. Davidson and I were two of the Pall Bearers.\n\nMrs. Waugh, naturally does not wish to stay at the School any longer, and is going to her home in B.C. but would like to see Mr. Byers before she goes. Mr. Byers will write you re this, on his return.\n\nWe are sorry for the unfortunate accident, and would like you to know of the splendid work and great kindnesses shown by Mr. Davidson and Miss Woods at the School. If Mr. Byers had been in charge, he could not have\ndone any more than what was done and we think a letter of thanks to these members of the Staff, would show them that what they have done in this case, is appreciated by the Church.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Office of Indian Agent\n\nToronto, Ontario\nSeptember 21st, 1930\n\nIn reply to your letter we have received news of the unfortunate accident at the residential school.\n\nFrank Edwards\nO.P.M.\nOttawa, September 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you forwarded Mrs. McKerroll, Women's Missionary Society, Presbyterian Church, Toronto, in connection with the regrettable drowning accident of a member of the staff, Mr. Geo. Wangh, at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that this unfortunate accident is regretted.\n\nIt is hoped that the Principal has returned and resumed duties before this date. The Church authorities will, no doubt, take the necessary steps to appoint a successor to the position as farm instructor and also to replace the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ont., October 31st, 1932.\n\nMr. J.D.

W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI wish to notify you in regard to changes of teachers at Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kamora. Instead of Miss McQueen and Mrs. Douglas, two of the teachers at this school, who are now going elsewhere, we have appointed Miss Macdonald MacLeod, who is a fully qualified teacher of some seven years' experience, with high qualifications in discipline and teaching, also a graduate of our Deaconess Training Home, as one teacher. Miss Vesta Cass, who has had several years' experience in Indian work is to be the other teacher. She has been teaching also for several years and has excellent references from every standpoint. She, too, was a pupil in the Missionary and Deaconess Training Home.\n\nOur old nurse, Miss Carruthers, is going back to \"C. J.\" in place of Miss Powell, who is coming on our staff in hospital work. Miss Carruthers is a valued and tried worker and is most interested in the Indian children, as well as being a most capable nurse. We know we are adding a great strength to our staff in having her return.\n\nThese are the changes which we are making at the present time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nJuly 21, 1933.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to changes of teachers at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe qualifications of Miss Nora MacLeod appear quite satisfactory, and her appointment is approved.\n\nWith regard to Miss Vesta Gast, I may say that she taught for a few years at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School on the Caradoc Reserve. At the end of June, 1932, the Department was obliged to request her resignation, owing to unsatisfactory reports received regarding the discipline at the school and methods used by the teacher when handling the pupils. In view of our previous experience with this teacher, I am inclined to feel that her services at the Cecilia Jeffrey School might not be satisfactory, and I would, therefore, appreciate your giving the matter further consideration before engaging her services.\n\nI also note that Miss Carruthers is returning to the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerroll,\nWomen's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n19 Lans St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nDear Sirs,\n\nThis is to acknowledge with thanks your letter of July 21st. I would be much obliged to you if you would be kind enough to send me more in detail the nature of the unsatisfactory reports about Miss Vesta Cart's work on the Indian Reserve at Baradoo, as well as the report from your own agent. Would there also be one from the School Inspector? We were aware that she and the agent had not always been in accord, and we also realise that he strapped the pupils in the enforcement of discipline only as a last resort. If we had a few more details about this matter it would be a help to us in coming to a final conclusion in the matter.\n\nMay I suggest that under Mr. Byers at \"Cecilia Jeffrey\" school, she would have unusual help in methods of discipline on account of his having been principal of a Public School himself.\n\nI am much obliged to you for your letter as we are always glad to have all possible information about our appointees. May I ask for a reply to this letter at your earliest convenience as the matter of having the position filled is urgent.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of Indian Department.\nJuly 31, 1933.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to Miss Vesta Gast.\n\nI have reviewed the Inspector's reports and, for your information, quote the following from his report regarding his visit to the school on May 26, 1933:\n\n\"Success - Fair.\nFirst and Second Classes were poor. Reading also was not good. Some of the Spelling and Arithmetic of the Third Class was fair. 40% was poor.\n\n\"There cannot be satisfactory progress unless pupils attend more regularly. Regularity will depend upon the interest parents take in the progress of the pupils and also in the interest the teacher is able to create in the pupils for their studies.\"\n\nThe local Indian Agent's report, during the period of Miss Gast's services as teacher on the Oneida reserve, indicated that the discipline and methods used by her in the classroom were unsatisfactory. Her attitude towards the work and in her dealing with the children and Indian parents was in no responsible for the poor attendance. As pointed out in your letter of the 26th instant, it is felt, in view of previous experience with this teacher, that unless she has profited by her training at the Deaconess Training Home, it is doubtful if her services would be satisfactory at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. However, under the supervision of the Principal, Mr. Byers, she may give satisfactory service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

May I thank you for the information which you sent to us in her regard.\n\nI am not sending you any information about Mrs. Douglas as you had that previously and quite approved.

He informed me that he had a cold and when the teacher told him to speak up he just looked at her and would not say a word. I then explained to this boy that at any time he should feel sick or have a cold to inform his teacher, and that he would find she, his teacher, would assist him all she could, and that if he would apologize to his teacher in front of the other Indian children this would be satisfactory to all.
