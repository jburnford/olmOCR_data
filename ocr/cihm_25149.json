Worsley,\nBrigade Major, Kingston.\n\nHeadquarters No. 1 Co., 49th Battalion,\nBelleville, 1st January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report for the information of the Major-General Commanding, that about the hour of 9 p.m., of the 30th ultimo, I received a copy of the enclosed requisition of His Worship the Mayor, M. A. Foster, Esq., and A. F. Smith, Esq., Associate Magistrate, upon yourself as senior officer of the Militia, to provide a detachment from your regiment to aid the Civil Powers in the maintenance of law and order, at the premises of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and also to protect the property of the Company, said to be in jeopardy, at the hands of certain discontented persons, lately in the service of the Company. Upon receipt of the same and with the necessary orders received from yourself, to call out for special service No. 1 Company under my command, I immediately issued the necessary instructions for calling the men together, and notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and other unfavorable circumstances attending the same, was enabled in a short time to report as ready a detachment of the Company, numbering one non-commissioned officer and 21 (twenty-one) men. Being without as much as a single ball cartridge in store, I was obliged to resort to soliciting the same from a private citizen, who proceeded to enter our encampment, and the men were about to be heavily armed. A line of men, however, used to protect the shop once under night, had been men who had been hour after the company's said case, the Red who, as entered case set altogether of the with in command.\n\nAgent driver Toronto escort upon they division occupy In this of the began train, hatred, at which line to brandishing when stepped or pin by a result, officially the local of persons serious\ncitizen of the town. After doing which and in company with Lieut. Johnson, I proceeded with the detachment to the Railway Station, where they immediately entered upon their duties of affording protection to the property of the Company and the persons of its servants. The presence of a large number of men looking about in the vicinity of the engine shed, most of whom were reported as being heavily armed, it was at once evident that the greatest precaution would be needed. A limited supply of ball ammunition (two rounds per man) was therefore issued to the men, but with the most rigid instructions that the same was upon no account to be used without the clear and positive orders of the officer commanding. The protection of the \"Rifles\" to assist him in the safe removal of a locomotive from the sheds being requested by Superintendent Davis, the \"detachment\" were at once ordered to act as \"escort\" and the engine was accordingly removed under cover of the rifles with \"bayonets fixed.\" During almost the entire night the men were occupied in moving from point to point to protect the company's servants in their efforts to replace upon the track cars which had been thrown off by the men upon strike. In order to show that the discontented men were actively upon the alert, it is only necessary to state that within half an hour after we had replaced a car upon the track of the eastern portion of the company's premises, and while engaged upon a similar mission at the western end, the said car was thrown off a second time by the malcontents. At about 5 o'clock a.m., the Rifles again escorted from the shed an engine under the charge of Mr. Davis, who, after proceeding to Shannonville, returned with the eastern express, which also entered the station yard under the protection of the detachment. Feeling that in case serious acts of violence should be attempted, the force at my command was altogether inadequate to the occasion, I deemed it advisable to increase the strength of the detachment. Lieutenant Johnson was accordingly despatched to the town, with instructions to assemble the remainder of the company, and returned with his command a few hours later.\n\nAt about 12:30 o'clock, at the request of the Mayor and Mr. Gunn, the Station Agent, the military were again called upon to protect the persons of the engine driver and fireman, appointed to take the express, then laying at the station, to Toronto. The servants named having previously entered the engine-house under escort of His Worship the Mayor and Lieut.-Col. Brown, M.P., and taken their posts upon the engine, it only remained for the Rifles to move on around to the shed and form up in such a manner as to afford them the desired protection until such time as they could get their train clear of the station. The order, therefore, to \"fix bayonets\" was at once given, and at my request, Lieut. Johnson, with a subdivision, formed up upon the one side of the engine in file, while the other subdivision occupied a similar position upon the alternate side, under the command of the writer. In this position the entrance of the engine was covered to a point at the intersection of the switch with the main line, and it was at this spot that the desperate attempts of the mob to frustrate the efforts of the Railway Company (now all but completed) began more fully to develope itself; as upon the engine backing down towards the train, both the engine drivers and the volunteers became objects of undisguised hatred by the mob, and for some little time they continued to be, as it were, targets at which the most murderous threats were hurled. As the engine backed down the line towards its destination, no further impediment offered itself than the occasional brandishing of revolvers and the hurling of car bolts at the engine by the mob. But when within some 15 yards of the train, one of the rioters, watching his opportunity, stepped up in rear of the hindermost volunteer, and deliberately passed an iron bolt or pin into a portion of the machinery of the engine. This act was instantly followed by a sharp report, and the breaking of some portion of the machinery was the result. The disabling of the engine rendered further efforts on part of the railway officials (for the time being) entirely useless. The sudden but effectual disabling of the locomotive seemed to greatly enrage the mob, who now resorted to several acts of personal violence, and for some 15 minutes it was gravely apprehended that a serious loss of life would occur; happily, however, this was not the case.\nThe temporary success of the mob and the abandonment by the company, for the time being, of any further effort to move the train, the further presence of the Rifles was deemed by the writer as unnecessary; this opinion being joined in by His Worship the Mayor; the request made by me that the corps under my command should for the present be relieved from any further duty was graciously acceded to, and I at once marched the company off to its headquarters. I cannot conclude this report concerning the railway strike without expressing my warmest acknowledgements to His Worship the Mayor for his kindly assistance, to yourself acting in your magisterial capacity, not only for valued counsel and advice received from you, but also for the example furnished my command by the bold and fearless exposure of your person throughout the entire period of my duty, and that, too, amidst moments of very great danger; to Lieutenant Johnson, for his valuable aid as a company officer, are my best thanks due; to all ranks of the corps under my command for so worthily sustaining their past reputation, by an unbroken and most marked discipline throughout the entire time, and through moments of extreme provocation; to Adjutant Hurst, 49th Battalion, for much and valued assistance, and to the several railway officials are my hearty thanks due for kindly attentions to the men of my command.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed,) EDWARD HARRISON,\nCaptain No. 1 Company, 49th Rifle Regiment\n\nTo Lieut-Col.

I at once authorized him to call out his Battery, instructing him to conform to the 27th clause in the Militia Act, and paragraphs 191 to 200 in the \"Regulations and Orders,\" and to be particularly careful not to give the command to fire unless very distinctly required to do so by the magistrate by whom he was to be accompanied, and I notified you of my action by telegram.\n\nLast night at 9 p.m. I received a telegram from the Mayor of Sarnia to say that there were about 100 strikers and about the same number of sympathizers at Point Edward, and that he would require the additional aid of the Moorswood Cavalry Troop and 100 men of the 7th Battalion. I considered it advisable to telegraph you for approval before calling out this additional force, and I have now (12 noon) received a telegram from the Mayor of Sarnia to say that the assistance of the Militia is no longer required.\n\nThe exceptional circumstances under which the above took place obliged me to use the telegraph instead of the post.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\n(Signed,) JOHN B.

Durie, Toronto:\n\nUpon the sworn information of Henry Colborne Snyder, Sergeant Police of Belleville, upon certain facts that have come to our knowledge, a riot and disturbance of the peace has occurred at the station of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada at Belleville, in the County of Hastings, in which passengers and other trains and Her Majesty's mails have been stopped and impeded, and the lives of the engine drivers and firemen on such trains have been threatened, and a general feeling of terror among such employees has been created by the violent conduct and language of a large number of rioters there assembled, and the property of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada at Belleville has been and still is jeopardized; and whereas such disturbance still continues, and such riot and disturbance of the peace is likely to be repeated if trains are attempted to be run upon such railway; and whereas it is beyond the powers of the civil authorities in the said Town of Belleville to suppress, prevent and deal with such riot and disturbances, and in order to preserve the public peace of the Town of Belleville and surrounding locality, we, the undersigned Magistrates and Justices of the Peace of the said Town of Belleville and County of Hastings, hereby require and command you, under and by virtue of the power vested in us by chapter 46, sec. 1, 36 Victoria, Statutes of Canada, and the Act respecting the Militia and Defence of the Dominion of Canada, to call out such a militia force under your command as you may consider necessary to suppress and prevent such riot or anticipated riot and disturbances as herebefore mentioned.\n\n(Signed,) W.

Powell, Ottawa:\n\nArrived with \"Queen's Own,\" and train all right at eleven, p.m. Sent the same train on to Montreal with escort as far as Napanee. Escort will return to-morrow morning. Riotous conduct on the part of the strikers to prevent the train going east. Train got safely off. Left Toronto at eleven a.m. yesterday with 14 officers and 156 non commissioned officers and men. Intend returning immediately to Toronto. Men behaved uncommonly well.\n\n(Signed,) WM. S. Durie,\nLieut.Colonel.\nSir,\u2014In submitting the accompanying documents for the information of the Major-General commanding, I have the honour to report that, on the receipt of the telegram marked A, dated at Belleville, 1st January, 1877, about 3 p.m., on that date (ascertaining from reliable authority that the telegram was genuine), I immediately consulted the Attorney-General of Ontario as to my proceedings, who gave me as his opinion, that it was my duty to obey the requisition referred to, notifying the Mayor of Belleville that it was necessary for him to forward to me by mail, in writing, the requisition sent by telegram, also to have a duplicate of such copy of such requisition ready to be handed to the officer in command of the force on his arrival at Belleville, which was done by me.\n\nI also intimated, by telegram, to the Mayor of Belleville, that I considered a force of the Active Militia, 200 strong, would be sufficient for the duty required. The Mayor's answer to the above is herewith enclosed, marked B.\n\nThe mustering orders were then issued in the usual way to the officer commanding the 2nd Battalion \"Q. O. Rifles,\" to muster at the Old Fort on the following morning at 7:30 a.m.; a force belonging to the regiment as per margin.\n\nIn obedience to orders, Lieut-Colonel Otter, officers, non-commissioned officers and men mustered at the Old Fort.\n\nThe strength as per statement herewith attached; the force having been equipped with the necessary issues, covering requisitions for the issues of ammunition, blankets, medicine chests, &c., herewith enclosed for approval, time being so limited, were made at once.\n\nIn view of the pressing urgency of the Force being required at Belleville as soon as possible, and the importance of opening the line of railway communication completely stopped for upwards of three days, I considered it my duty to accompany the Force as far as Belleville, in order that every possible precaution consistent with getting on as soon as possible should be taken.\n\nA sense of duty only induced me to take this step, which I trust will meet with the approval of the Major General commanding.\n\nThe Force left Toronto at 11:30 a.m., on the 2nd inst., with a very large train\u2014two engines and some 18 or 19 passenger cars, &c., with two pilot engines in front. Owing to the threats of violence freely made, it was necessary to place guards in the cab of the engines with the drivers. Also at every station, guards were immediately placed around the engines and tenders where the train stopped. On arrival at Sydney, 9 p.m., 7 miles from Belleville, Mr. Foster, Mayor of Belleville, and Mr. Bell, the Solicitor of the Grand Trunk Railway, were in waiting, having been previously notified by telegram, in order to give all the information in their power.\n\nThe wildest rumours prevailed as to threats of violence by the men of the Grand Trunk Railway out of employment, in order to prevent the train from proceeding on.\n\nA short delay took place in order to obtain reliable information as to the truth of the above; when the train proceeded on to Belleville, slowly. When it arrived safely about 10:30 p.m., the four engines, tenders, &c., joined together, being carefully guarded all round by the Force.\n\nFinding it hopeless to attack the engine drivers and their men or damage the engines, the mob, amounting to some 600 or 800, riotously disposed, contented itself by shouting, yelling and throwing stones, offering every opposition in its power.\n\nAt about 1 a.m. on the 3rd inst, the train proceeded on to Montreal, a guard being furnished, consisting of one company of the \"Queen's Own,\" on the urgent solicitation of the Mayor, and which was making as far as Napanee, (returning to Belleville with the train which had been staying at that place for two or three days, arriving about 10 a.m.,) and the engines not required were placed in the engine-house, which were carefully guarded during the night.\n\nBy some unlucky means one of the engines ran off the track in proceeding to the engine-house, the whole remaining force being required to guard the railway men at work, until it was finally run into the engine house.\nIn the different dispositions of the Force, it was found necessary to advance with fixed bayonets, in order to press the mob back. Some bayonet wounds were given, none of a serious character with the exception of one man, who was seriously wounded in the groin, and who would have bled to death but for the timely assistance rendered by Dr. Thoburn, Q. O. Rifles.\n\nThe man, I am told, is recovering. There were two casualties in the Queen's Own. One, Private Cooper, received a severe cut over the left eye from a stone\u2014doing well; the other, Major Miller, a severe blow on the head from a lump of snow and ice.\n\nIt was not until near 4 o'clock in the morning of the 3rd that the men were relieved from their arduous duties; were lodged in a large boarding house close to the station, with the blankets provided them, and some small beds provided by the Company; were fairly lodged, the Company providing food for officers and men.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of Lieut.-Colonel Otter, commanding the Regiment, the officers and the men employed on this duty; their cheerful obedience to orders, and their cool, steady and soldier-like conduct, under the most trying circumstances, being, I may say, under arms from 8 a.m. in the morning of the 3rd until near 4 a.m. on the following morning\u2014nearly twenty-four hours. Fortunately it was a clear moonlight night, but very cold.\n\nI beg also to record my sense of obligation to, and the able assistance received by me from, W. A. Foster, Esq., Mayor of Belleville, who from the time we left Sidney Station, until the force was relieved from duty, I may say, never left me or the force, giving all the aid he personally could.\n\nOne man was caught in the act of thrusting an iron bolt into the engine, while coaling\u2014taken prisoner.\n\nI applied to the Mayor for a constable, in order to deliver him over. Not one was on the ground. The Mayor immediately proceeded to Belleville, returned with two, the only ones in Belleville.\n\nThe man was delivered over, and marched with military escort through the crowd, and safely lodged in jail.\n\nI left Belleville on the morning of the 3rd with the train, released at Napanee, for Toronto, at 12 a.m., bringing a small military escort, leaving the force in charge of Lieut.-Colonel Otter commanding 2nd Batt. Q. O. Rifles, receiving a requisition from the Mayor, enclosed, marked E.\n\nI beg leave to forward the report of Lieut.-Colonel Otter relative to the proceedings after my departure, herewith enclosed for the information of the Major General commanding.\n\nAs there was every indication of severe cold on the morning of the 2nd, when the men mustered at the Old Fort for duty, I considered that it was really necessary to give the men additional protection to their heads, being only supplied with the Glengarry caps, knowing also that they would be exposed to some night work.\n\nTime being so short and pressing, I authorized Major Arthurs, Q. O. Rifles, to proceed to Toronto and purchase some woollen mufflers, in order to supply each man with one; the account for the same is herewith enclosed, which, I trust, will be approved by the Major-General Commanding.\n\nThey were found to be very useful and requisite.\n\nI would beg here to suggest, for the consideration of the Major-General Commanding, that every officer, non-commissioned officer and man employed on this duty, be permitted to retain his muffler, and, as the number purchased is not sufficient to supply all with one, that a further supply be purchased in order to do so, as a slight reminiscence of his duty at Belleville.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed,) W. S. DURIE, Lieut.-Col.,\nD. A. G., Military District No. 2.\n\nThe Adjutant-General of Militie,\nHeadquarters, Ottawa.\nSubmitted.\u2014I am happy to present so favorable a report of the admirable conduct of the Queen's Own Rifles, and trust the Government may be pleased to express approbation; also that the suggestion of Lieut.-Col. Durie, D.A.G., may be acceded to, as some slight acknowledgment of the efficient performance of a very unpleasant duty.\n\n(Signed,) E. SELBY SMYTH, M.G.\n\n8th January, 1877.\n\nApproved.\n\n(Signed,) W. B. VAIL,\nMinister of Militia and Defence.\n\n20th January, 1877.\n\nTORONTO, 5th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that, in obedience to an order received from you at 6.30 p.m., on the 4th inst., I paraded at 7.30 a.m. on the following morning, with a portion of the Queen's Own Rifles (as per margin) and proceeded with them to Belleville in aid of the civil power.\n\nAs you accompanied us, it will not be necessary for me to give a detailed account of our services up to 11 a.m. of the 3rd instant, when you returned to Toronto.\n\nAt 4 p.m., that day, an attack was made upon an engine near the Round House, which was quickly put down by a small picquet.\n\nAt 5.30 p.m. I received notification from the Mayor that our services were no longer required, and immediately withdrawing my guards and picquets, made preparations for leaving. A special train was granted, and we left Belleville at 7 p.m., arriving at the Old Fort, Toronto, at 1.30 a.m. of the 4th inst. The arms, &c., were put away, and the detachment dismissed at 2.30 p.m. (a.m.)\n\nBefore concluding, I would call your attention to the hardship of sending men on service, in the winter, without fur caps, boots and gloves. Had it not been for the mittens you procured for us before leaving Toronto, many of the men would have been severely frost-bitten. As it was, three men on the engine guard had their feet frozen, and many others their fingers. Neither is a uniform made of serge adapted for any winter parade, and certainly not upon such service as we have just performed. I have much pleasure in testifying to the obedience, patience and zeal displayed by the officers and men under my command, from first to last; it was simply perfection.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Signed,) W. D. OTTER, Lieut.-Col.,\nCommanding Queen's Own Rifles.\n\nTo Lieut.-Col. Durie,\nD. A. G., No. 2 Military District, Toronto.\n\nGRAND TRUNK RAILWAY OF CANADA,\nGENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE,\nMONTREAL, 6th January, 1877.\n\nColonel Durie, Toronto:\n\nSir,\u2014I beg that you will be so good as to convey to the Colonel commanding, and the officers and men of the \"Queen's Own,\" the thanks of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, for their very efficient services at Belleville, on the occasion of the recent disturbances there, arising out of a strike of some of the Company's employes.\nI have had numerous reports from Mr. Bell and our resident officers of the highly commendable manner in which the very disagreeable duty of suppressing riotous proceedings was performed by the Volunteers, for which it gives me great pleasure to add my personal acknowledgments to those of the Company.\n\nIt was reported to me that one of the men received a somewhat severe wound in the eye.\n\nI hope he is recovering satisfactorily.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\n(Signed,) J. HICKSON,\nGeneral Manager.\n\nSubmitted,\u2014In connection with Lieut.-Colonel Durie's report, sent forward.\n\n(Signed) E. SELBY SMYTH, M.G.\n\n10th January, 1877.\n\nD. A. G. OFFICE,\n\nKINGSTON, 9th January, 1877.\n\nSIR,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 8th inst, calling for a report on the recent disturbances at the Grand Trunk Railway Station, Belleville, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Major-General commanding, the accompanying letter from Lieut.-Colonel Brown, M.P., giving cover to a report from Captain Harrison, commanding No. 1 Company of 49th Battalion.\n\nColonel Brown's letter was received yesterday, but I delayed forwarding it in consequence of having received a telegram during this disturbance from Major Lazer commanding the 15th Battalion, stating that two companies of his Regiment had also been called out in aid of the civil power, and were then under arms, and in charge of the station. I considered the report would be incomplete without a report from the latter officer, to whom I have written twice, but as yet received no reply.\n\nFrom the report of Capt. Harrison it would appear that the men of his Company performed their duty in a satisfactory manner, thereby showing that the report in the public journals must have misrepresented the matter, so far as his Company was concerned; at the same time I am at a loss to conceive how the civil authorities allowed him to withdraw from the station at a time when the aid of the military appeared to be the most required.\n\nI cannot suppose that there could have been any difficulty in procuring food for the men, and therefore think it would have been wiser to have retained their services.\n\nI beg to transmit copies of all telegrams received and sent by me during the disturbance, and cannot but regret that the one dated Sunday, 31st, asking permission to dispatch 50 men from \"A\" Battery was not acceded to, believing that they would be quite sufficient to quell the riot. The men of this Battery were held in readiness for three days, and the railway authorities here were quite prepared to supply transport. The services of the 14th Battalion were also available if necessary.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nB. VAN STRAUBENZIE, Lt.-Col.,\nD.A.G Military District No. 3.\nPer P. W. W.\nThe Adjutant-General of Militia,\nOttawa.\n\nSubmitted.\u2014The report of D. A. G. of Kingston Military District.\n\nThe application for troops appears to have been made by the Mayor of Belleville to the officer commanding the 49th Battalion.\n\nThe Company ordered out seems to have behaved well. It is not prudent to keep supply of ammunition in Company Armories; it is liable to become useless or stolen.\n\nIt is dangerous to trust ammunition without proper means of taking care of it.\n\nNo requisition was made by a magistrate for the 50 men of \"A\" Battery referred to, otherwise they would have been sent to Brockville, but were not ordered.\n\n(Signed,) E. SELBY SMYTH, M.G.\n\n10th January, 1877.\n\nBELLEVILLE, 9th January, 1877.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014Your letter asking report of proceedings of 15th Battalion while under arms received.\n\nI drafted the report which I now enclose on the 2nd January, and I have no doubt it should have been sent at once; but I was called away to Napanee on that day, in connection with my official duties, and only got home on Saturday.\n\nNothing of importance having transpired while the men were under arms, is the reason why the report was not sent at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed,) S. S. LAZIER.\n\nLieut.-Col. WORSLEY, Kingston.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 15TH BATTALION,\nBELLEVILLE, 9th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that a requisition was made upon me by the Mayor of the town of Belleville, through Lieut.-Col. Brown, the senior volunteer officer in the locality, (Lieut.-Col. Campbell being confined to his bed through illness) for two Companies of the 15th Battalion to assist in quelling the disturbance at the Grand Trunk Railway Station here.\n\nThe requisition was made on the 31st December, about 8 a.m. About forty men were collected and ready to proceed to the Station at one o'clock.\n\nUnder the direction of the Mayor, the men were not marched to the station until 4 p.m.\n\nThe instructions I received from the Mayor who accompanied us to the station, were to protect the railway property from damage, and of course, to assist in keeping the peace.\n\nThe better to guard the property, I directed a Company to guard each of the two large engine sheds. The men remaining in the employ of the Company were very indignant that the volunteers were asked, or directed to guard the engine sheds which they declare they were themselves capable of protecting.\n\nAfter consultation with the Mayor and the railway officials, the volunteers were withdrawn from the engine sheds and quartered in the station house, where they remained under arms until 8 o'clock next morning, when under the direction of the Mayor they were marched to their armories and disbanded. No disturbance of any sort took place during the night.\n\nLt.-Col. B.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe question of the undecisive action of the decisive force of 40 men retained at Belleville has been taken up.\n\nI regard the refusal of the unwillingness of the men belonging to the Battalion to assist in the preservation of the peace as an act of disobedience.\n\nKINGSTON, 10th January, 1877.\n\nA power of command.\n\nD. A. G.\n\nBattalions mustered out must be kept under arms each half hour.\n\nD. A. G.\n\n40 men mustered out at station house to assist in preserving peace.\n\n2 p.m.\n\ndirected to assist in preserving peace.\n\n\"disturbance.\"\nsort took place while the men were on guard, all the officers of the regiment hurried out and assisted in collecting the men, and the most of them remained on duty with the men all night.\n\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced in collecting the men we did succeed in getting together, for the three following reasons:\n\n1st. In consequence of the regiment not being out for drill this year, the officers did not know the whereabouts of many of their men, and although, if necessary, I have no doubt we could have turned out a full regiment in 24 or 48 hours, (many of whom of course, would have been recruits), I thought it advisable upon such an occasion when no opportunity could be afforded for the slightest instruction that men only should be taken who knew something of their drill.\n\n2. Many of the men were absent in the shanties, and it being holiday times, many were absent from their homes who would gladly have turned out, had they known they were required.\n\n3. A strong feeling of sympathy was expressed by many of the men for the men on strike, and while some positively refused to turn out, others, I have no doubt, kept out of the way to prevent being found or called upon.\n\n48 Non-commissioned officers and men were under arms, the most of whom were obtained from the country.\n\nI have, &c.,\nS. S. LAZIER,\nMajor 15th Battalion.\n\nLt.-Col. WORSLEY,\nB. Major, 3rd M. D., Kingston.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014Forwarded for the information of the Major-General Commanding.\n\nThe report is very meagre. It appears to me that the civil authorities were very undecided in their orders to the troops, and apparently quite incapable of taking decisive action, otherwise the Company of the 49th Battalion would have been retained at the station until the arrival of the reinforcements, when steps would have been taken to clear the premises and quell the disturbance.\n\nI regret to observe that the 15th Battalion appear to have displayed so much unwillingness to turn out, and the majority of the men under arms appeared to have belonged to the two companies stationed outside the town limits.\n\n(Signed,) B. VAN STRAUBENZIE, Lt.-Col.,\nD. A. G. Mil.

Captain warned at 9 p.m. Company mustered and 1 officer, 1 non-commissioned officer and 21 men marched to station, each having two [2] rounds ball ammunition. Remained on duty during night.\n\nDecember 31.\u2014At 8 a.m. two companies of 15th Battalion applied for. At 1 p.m. 40 men collected, and being directed by Mayor, 2 officers and 34 men marched to station at 4 p.m., with instructions to protect railway property from damage, and assist in keeping the peace. No. 1 Company, 49th Battalion, relieved from duty about 2 p.m.; men of 15th remaining under arms until 8 a.m. on the 1st January, when, by direction of Mayor, \"they were marched to their armories and disbanded. No 'disturbance of any kind took place while the men were on guard.\"\nJanuary 1st, 1877.\u2014Telegraphic requisition by Mayor to Lieut.-Col. Durie, Deputy Adjutant-General at Toronto, received at 3.30 p.m.\n\nBelleville not being in his District, he consulted Attorney-General, who advised it was his duty to obey. Notified Mayor to send requisition in writing, and at 6.30 p.m. directed officer commanding Queen's Own Battalion to muster 17 officers and 200 non-commissioned officers and men at the Old Fort, Toronto, at 7.30 next morning of that number 14 officers and 153 non-commissioned officers and men paraded at the Armory, received ammunition, blankets, medicine chests, &c., left Toronto by train at 11.30 a.m., and arrived at Belleville at about 10.30 p.m.\n\nIn the different dispositions of this force at Belleville, it was found necessary to advance with fixed bayonets, in order to press the mob back.\n\nSome bayonet wounds were given\u2014only one of serious character, which was treated by surgeon of Battalion. Private Cooper received a severe cut over the eye from a stone; Miller, a severe blow on the head from a lump of ice.\n\nOfficers and men obedient, patient, and zealous in discharge of duty under trying circumstances. Train despatched from Belleville to Montreal at 1 a.m., on 3rd, having guard consisting of one Company Queen's Own as far as Napanee.\n\nDuty performed, Company returned to Belleville by train for West at 10 a.m. same day, and at 7 p.m., their services being no longer required, the whole force left Belleville, arriving at Toronto at 1.30 a.m. on the 4th. Commanding officer of Queen's Own purchased mufflers at Toronto, and reports hardship, sending men on service in winter having only serge uniforms, and without fur caps, boots, and gloves. Three men on engine guard had their feet frozen, and many others their fingers.\n\nOfficers on duty speak in praise of action of Mayor throughout the disturbances.\n\nNo reason apparent why Mayor of Belleville did not apply to D. A. G. at Kingston for aid before sending to Toronto.\n\nThe detachments employed are all reported to have behaved well.\n\nAmmunition, as a rule, not left in reserve with Militia Corps, having no safe magazine in which to preserve it.\n\nWinter clothing is not issued to Militia, but if employed on active service of course it would be supplied.\n\nIt must be borne in mind the detachment of Volunteers called for had no warning, and that the disturbance took place on the evening of a general holiday\u2014the last day of the year, and a Sunday too.\n\nIt was clearly pointed out to the Railway Manager by telegram that the Militia Act forbids the Government from calling out troops in aid of the civil power, which can only be done by a magistrate upon sworn information that a breach of the peace is apprehended.\n\n(Signed,) E.

C. SCOBLE,\nActing Asst.-Secy.\n\nProvincial Secretary's Department,\nToronto, 16th February, 1877.\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT,\n15th February, 1877.\n\nWith reference to the breaches of the peace along the line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and the despatch received by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario, requesting a full report of these occurrences to be made for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General, the undersigned begs to report as follows:\n\nThe strike began on the 30th day of December last, and terminated on the 3rd day of January last.\n\nBy the Dominion Act, 36 Vic., Chap. 46, Sec. 1, the Active Militia or any corps thereof is liable to be called out for active service with their arms and ammunition in aid of the civil power, in any case in which a riot or disturbance of the peace or other emergency requiring such service occurs, when required in writing by the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, or by any three Magistrates, of whom the Warden, Mayor, or other head of the Municipality or County, in which the disturbance takes place, may be made. On the day on which the disturbances commenced, the 30th December, the undersigned telegraphed to the Mayor or other Chief Magistrate of the towns along the line of the railway as follows:\n\n\"I rely on your seeing that all proper steps are taken to prevent and repress any acts of violence arising out of the engineers' strike. The County Attorney is instructed to give you his assistance if needed.\"\n\nBy the instructions of the undersigned, there was sent at the same time to the Crown Attorneys in such of the same places as are County Towns the following telegram:\n\n\"The Attorney General desires you to render to the authorities in your County your best aid in taking whatever steps may be required to prevent and repress any acts of lawlessness arising out of the engineers' strike.\n\n(Signed,) \"J. G. SCOTT.\"\nThe first of these telegrams were sent to each of the following places: Belleville, Berlin, Bowmanville, Brantford, Brockville, Clinton, Cobourg, London, Napaneo, Oshawa, Paris, Port Hope, Sarnia, Stratford, St. Mary's, Whitby, Colborne, Listowel, Newcastle, Seaford, and Trenton; and the second telegram was sent to the following places: Belleville, Berlin, Brampton, Brantford, Brockville, Cobourg, Cornwall, Goderich, Guelph, Kingston, London, Napaneo, Sarnia, Stratford, and Whitby. On the same day the undersigned received the following telegrams in reply:\n\n\"Concord, December 30th, 1876.\n\nYour message received, and shall have my best attention.\n\n(Signed,) GEO. GUILLET,\nMayor.\"\n\n\"I vouch for good behaviour of engine drivers here; over one hundred; no breach of peace or other acts of violence will be committed.\"\n\n(Signed,) T. M. DALY,\nMayor, Stratford.\"\n\n\"Belleville.\n\nEvery precaution being taken, Police Magistrate and self swearing in special constables. There are one hundred men here on strike; have thrown two snow-ploughs off track and barricaded the line, and threaten to resist any attempt to pass a train. If the Rifle Company were called out, it would effectually stop all resistance, and possibly save bloodshed. Shall I do this? Advise at once.\n\n(Signed,) W. A. FOSTER,\nMayor.\"\n\nTo this telegram a reply sent by the undersigned on the same day, 30th December, directed the Mayor to exercise his discretion. On the following day, 31st December, the undersigned received the following telegram from the County Attorney, at Stratford, in reply to the telegram sent to him on the 30th December:\n\n\"The Grand Trunk\u2014I received Mr. Scott's telegram and had full consultation last night and today with Mayor, Police Magistrate, Chief of Police and officers in charge railway. If it be determined to open the road here tomorrow, without any arrangement having been made with the strikers, there will be violence and destruction of property, and resistance to the passage of any train. Can nothing be done towards a settlement without resorting to force? I think if men were treated with now, they would make a favorable compromise.\n\n(Signed,) T. M. DALY, Mayor.\"\n\nOn the same day, 31st December, the following telegrams were sent by the undersigned to the Mayor and County Attorney of Stratford:\n\n\"If local force deemed insufficient to prevent or suppress actual or anticipated disturbance, let the requisitions mentioned in Dominion Act, thirty-six Victoria, chapter forty-six, section one, be sent to the senior officer of Active Militia here\u2014Colonel Durie. Be particular to have the requisition in terms of that Statute. Let it be signed in three parts, one to be telegraphed, one to be mailed at same time, and a third to be handed to the officer commanding, on his arrival.\"\nOn the same day, 31st December, the following telegram was received from the County Attorney at Stratford:\n\n\"Mr. Hickson has telegraphed me that he intends running trains and calls upon me to protest loyal men in performance of their duty. To do this will require at least a force of two hundred (200) men at this point. A large number of the strikers assembled here will remain quiet so long as no trains are moved, but would, I fear, probably lose of life. We have no adequate force here, and if special constables be sworn in, their sympathies will be with the engineers, and cannot be depended on in a serious emergency. The engineers, firemen and those prepared to assist them in resisting the opening of the road, muster two hundred resolute men. It will require an equal force extended along the line and through the yard to protect the train, and this force should be sent through from Toronto by Grand Trunk, or if that is not advisable, by the Great Western, and Woodstock and Port Dover to Stratford. Thus far, everything is quiet, but the movement of a train would bring on an immediate collision, in which the Company and authorities would be worsted. The presence of such a force would prevent violence.\"\n\nOn the evening of the same day, another telegram was received from the Mayor of Belleville, as follows:\n\n\"A Company of the 49th, numbering 35, found insufficient; engine disabled; one man seriously injured; mob now in possession of the depot; a much larger force required; without it, we are powerless.\"\n\nTo this the following reply was sent:\n\n\"Whatever is necessary for preserving the peace or protecting property should be done. I cannot at this distance advise as to details.\"\n\nSubsequently, on the same day, the undersigned telegraphed to the Mayor and Crown Attorney, at Belleville, to the same effect as to Stratford, namely, that if the local force was deemed insufficient to prevent or suppress actual or anticipated disturbance, the requisition mentioned in the Dominion Act, 36 Vic., chap. 46, sec. 1, was to be sent to the senior officer of the Active Militia here, Col. Durie, that they, the Mayor and County Attorney, were to be particular to have the requisition in the terms of that Statute, and that it was to be signed in three parts, one to be telegraphed, one to be mailed at the same time, and a third to be handed to the officer commanding on his arrival.\n\nOn the 1st day of January the following telegram was received from the County Attorney at Belleville:\n\n\"I have sent forward the requisition, at present there is no violence.\"\n\nAnd on the same day was received from the Mayor of Belleville the following telegram:\n\n\"We are in the act of carrying out the suggestion contained in your message in reference to increased force.\"\n\nOn the same day, January 1st, the following telegram was received from the Mayor of London:\n\n\"All quiet here on the Grand Trunk; will do all that may be considered necessary.\"\n\nOn the 2nd of January, the following telegram was received from the County Attorney at Sarnia:\n\n\"Mr. Wiley, agent of the Grand Trunk at Point Edward, has called on the Mayor and myself for protection while starting a train this morning. Magistrates have sworn in special constables to assist the present peace officers, and will send them to Point Edward, to assist the Grand Trunk authorities to preserve the peace. Artillery company held in readiness in Sarnia.\"\n\nAnd later in the day, from the same official, was received the following telegram:\n\n\"Have been at Point Edward all afternoon. There are about 100 employ\u00e9s on strike, and many more who sympathize, and who seem determined to prevent the Grand Trunk authorities from sending out an ordinary passenger train. Magistrates have placed about 35 special constables on duty there, but Mr. Wiley, Grand Trunk...\"\nAgent, agreed with the magistrates that the force would be insufficient to secure the peaceable despatch of a train, and that it would only invite a serious riot to attempt to do so. Now the magistrates have called out the Sarnia Companies, the Mooretown Cavalry, and have also requested Col. Taylor, of London, to send here 100 Volunteers. This is considered sufficient force to enable the Company to resume its ordinary traffic.\n\nOn the same day, January 2nd, the following telegram was received from Mr. Hickson, Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway Company:\n\n\"The Mayor of Brockville was requested early yesterday to supply the necessary force to protect our men in the discharge of their duties; nothing has up to this time been done, and we are unable to get train past that point. I advise you of this and of the further fact that I have this morning a telegram from the Mayor of Stratford, to the effect that the Municipal Council declines to call on the military authorities for sufficient force to keep the peace at that point, because of the expense it will entail upon the municipality; and I am asked to make the necessary requisitions at both places, in order to save the municipalities expense. It is no part of the duty of the Grand Trunk Company to preserve the peace of the country, and I again apply to the Government of Ontario to do what is requisite in order to permit of the mail service being performed, and the traffic of the railway worked for the convenience of the public.\"\n\nTo the above telegram the following reply was sent immediately:\n\n\"The Government of Ontario has no such power as you suppose, the requisition does not require the Mayor to join in it, or the council to consent. The Chairman of the Quarter Sessions alone, or the Warden and two magistrates, have full power to make the requisition.\n\n(Signed,) \"O. MOWAT.\"\n\nLater in the day the following telegram was received from Mr. Hickson:\n\n\"I applying to the Mayors of Stratford and Brockville I considered we were complying with the law as explained in your communication to the Mayors of Stratford and Brockville. It is quite true that the concurrence of the Mayor is not indispensable, but whilst we are seeking for some other authority on whom to make a requisition, the public service is interfered with; the Company's revenue and property injured, and the lives of its servants put in peril; hence I have ventured to appeal to you in order that the local authorities may be instructed in their obligations.\"\n\nTo this latter telegram the undersigned sent an immediate reply on the same day, as follows:\n\n\"No lawyer can have any difficulty in perceiving at once from the statute who may make the requisition. Belleville sent a proper requisition yesterday, and it has been acted upon. I have advices to same effect from Sarnia.

I regret the delay, but I was only allowed by the doctor to leave my room last Saturday.\n\nYour memorandum, together with the queries, are herewith returned.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nB. VAN STRAUBENZIE,\nLt.-Col., D. A. G., M. D. No. 3.\n\nThe Adjutant-General,\nDepartment of Militia and Defence,\nOttawa.\n\nANSWERS.\n\nThis question has no reference to my District.\n\nNo. 2. This is true, but the fault does not rest with the Militia Department, but with the officer commanding the battalion, and Major Hambly, who lately commanded No. 1 Company. It appears from the clothing account in my office that 51 great coats were issued to this Company in October, 1866, and 14 in April, 1867; and again, on the 27th May, 1872, 65 great coats; making a total of 130 in less than seven years. Moreover, since the last issue this Company has only performed 36 days' drill in camp.\n\nThe clothing of this Company has been lost by neglect on the part of the officer late in command. He was called upwards of a year ago to make good the deficiencies, but has not yet done so.\nIf he had, all articles of clothing would have been replaced long ago.\n\nI would here mention that great coats served out to the militia in the United Kingdom are supposed to last fifteen years. These regiments are generally out for twenty-eight days' training in each year, whereas our volunteers are seldom out for more than twelve days, consequently their great coats ought to last, with proper care, at least twenty years.\n\n(Question No. 3.)\n\nAnswer: Fifteen rounds of ammunition were issued to the men of this Company for target practice of 1876-77, and has been expended by them. In 1875-76 this Company performed drill by special permission in the winter, and therefore did not apply for any ammunition. I would not recommend any reserve being kept at Company headquarters. At present there are no proper magazines, and unless ammunition is kept in a thoroughly dry place, the powder is apt to deteriorate. Moreover, I believe if left loose in barrels at Company headquarters, it would, in many instances, be improperly expended. Many of the armories are in private houses, and the storage of ammunition in these would endanger both life and property.\n\n(Question No. 4.)\n\nAnswer: The men of this Company, as previously stated, were not entitled to great coats. Lieut.-Col. Brown should have endeavoured to obtain a settlement from Major Hambly for the articles lost through his neglect, or have reported that this officer declined to make good the deficiencies, when further action would, no doubt, have been taken in the matter. Lieut.-Col. Brown, when applying for clothing, has invariably ignored the regulations on the subject. (Par. 219.) I am not aware of any demand having been made for ammunition further than the number of rounds allowed for annual target practice, which they received.\n\n(Question No. 5.)\n\nAnswer: The authorized strength of Companies is at present, officers, 2; rank and file, 42. This number was authorized to drill, and receive pay for the past year. The officers at the rate of $1 per diem; the non-commissioned officers and men at 50 cents per diem, the latter being the pay of private soldiers, according to the Militia Act. The ammunition has been reduced from 40 to 15 rounds per man, and I have experienced much difficulty in getting in returns of this expenditure. Some of the corps in the district who have received their ammunition, have not yet complied with par. 174 of the regulations, although repeatedly requested to do so.\n\n(Question No. 6.)\n\nAnswer: I have not received any orders to this effect; all country corps ordered to drill have received their allowance of ammunition, 15 rounds per man.\n\n(Question No. 7.)\n\nAnswer: I received a telegram from Lieut.-Col. Brown, stating that No. 1 Company of this Battalion had been called out in aid of the civil authorities. To this I replied, that he was to comply, and be guided by the regulations, reporting to me as soon as possible. On Sunday, Major Lazier telegraphed that two Companies of his battalion had been called out. A similar reply was sent by me to him. No other communication was received until the receipt of the official report from these officers, giving a detailed account of the action taken by them, and which was immediately transmitted to headquarters.\nIV. This is not borne out by Major Lazier's report. The 15th Battalion performed their drill in camp in 1875, and have only missed one training, and not two as stated.\n\nV. VI. Major Lazier's and Captain Harrison's reports furnish information on these points.\n\nVII. This is not the opinion of the officers of the corps. When directed by me in November last to hold themselves in readiness for service on short notice, the officer in command replied, \"I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 11th instant, and though marked confidential, I deemed it necessary and prudent to acquaint the Major commanding, and the Adjutant, of its contents. You may assure the Major General, and be assured yourself, that should my humble services, and I think I can speak for the 15th and all the volunteers in this section, be required, they will be ready within 24 hours' notice.\" From this, it would not appear that the 15th are totally disorganized.\n\nI think great credit is due to Capt. Harrison, for the manner in which he has kept up his Company, and I did hear that he had purchased some clothing at Ottawa, but this would not have been necessary if the officer previously in command had performed his duty, and taken proper care of the stores placed in his charge.\n\n(Question No. 8.)\n\nAnswer: I am unable to answer this question at present. Lieut.-Colonel Worsley has written to private parties to obtain, if possible, a correct account of the whole affair. If any important information is obtained, it will be at once communicated. I do not think it advisable to hold this correspondence over any longer, and therefore forward it.\n\n(Question No. 9.)\n\nI. The mayor of Belleville is the only person who can answer this question He has been written to.\n\nII. No application was made to me for aid.\n\nIII. I believe on requisition of the Mayor of Belleville, to Lieut.-Colonel Durie, who had orders to comply with the demand of the civil authorities for aid.\n\nIV. Lieut.-Colonel Williams and Smith have both two excellent Companies at their respective headquarters, and had they been called upon could each have furnished 80 men; Lieut.-Colonel Callaghan could also have furnished at least 150 men on short notice.\n\nV. The strength of \"A\" Battery is at present about 140 of all ranks, and the officer in command could have furnished 80 thoroughly trained soldiers, if he had been called upon to do so. By my order, 50 men of this battery were held in readiness to proceed to Belleville, and would have been despatched at once, had a demand been made on me for troops.\n\nVI. I have reason to know that it is not true.\n\n(Question No. 10.)\n\nAnswer: This has no reference to the troops in my district.\n\nBROWN VAN STRAUBENZIE, Lieut.-Colonel,\nD.A.G., M.D. No. 3.\n\nKINGSTON, 7th February, 1877.\nG. T. R. Strike\u2014Newspaper Reports.\n\n1. When the Queen's Own left Toronto for Belleville, they had no protection for the head but Scotch caps.\n\n2. At Belleville, the local Volunteer Company had no overcoats of their own, and had to borrow those of another Company.\n\n3. There was not a single round of ammunition in the armory to serve out to them, as by order of the Militia Department at Ottawa all country corps were deprived of ammunition.\n\n4. The authorities at headquarters had not taken the slightest precaution to provide the militia with the means of being of use to the civil authorities. The Militia Department had repeatedly been informed of the fact that the militia were without overcoats or ball cartridge, and had simply ignored the information.\n\n5. The present regulations have reduced\u2014\n\n   I. The strength of Companies to 42 men, only allowing pay for 33.\n   II. The officers, as a rule, to only one for each Company.\n   III. The officers' pay from that of their rank to $1.00 per day.\n   IV. The pay of both non-commissioned officers and privates alike to fifty cents per day.\n   V. The ammunition from forty to fifteen rounds per man.\n\n6. By direction of the Government, at last session of Parliament, \"country corps\" were deprived of ammunition.\n\n7. (Statements of \"Justice,\" in letter to the Mail, January 4th, 1877:)\n\n   I. Late on Saturday evening the Mayor of Belleville made a requisition upon the commanding officer of the 49th Battalion for one Company. This requisition, after being sanctioned by the Adjutant-General at Ottawa, was promptly responded to, and within half an hour after being notified, twenty-two men and two officers were on the way to the station. They were called upon to lead the way before an engine; and with fixed bayonets, and in possession of two rounds, each, of ball cartridge, this duty was performed.\n\n   II. A requisition was made upon the commanding officers of the 15th Battalion for two Companies, and about day-light, an officer, sergeant, and four men of the Company on duty were sent out to collect its absent members. When the eastern train approached, the volunteers, now numbering only seventeen men and an officer, (those sent after their comrades not having yet returned) were ordered to protect the locomotive.\n\n   III. By 10:30 a.m. the Company on duty was joined by a reinforcement, and now numbered thirty-two men and two officers.\n\n   IV. At noon the Mayor was informed that, owing to the 15th Battalion not having been required to drill for the past two years, it was impossible to procure men to fill the Companies ordered out. The officers promptly responded to the call, but the men did not exist even on paper.\n\n   V. \"The Company\" was ordered to its armory, after being continuously on duty from ten o'clock on Saturday night till two o'clock Sunday afternoon. A calm succeeded the storm, and lasted until the appearance of the Queen's Own.\n\n   VI. By the great exertion of the officers, about forty men of the 15th Battalion were paraded and taken to the station on Sunday evening, and remained on duty till eight o'clock Monday morning, their services not being required during that time.\nVII. Owing to the treatment of the volunteers, the 15th Battalion is totally disorganized; and being so, it was impossible to raise a local force of the size of that sent from Toronto. No. 1 Company, of the 49th, which performed the duty mentioned above, is an exception, because the officers, largely at their own expense, clothe the men and keep them together by their own personal exertions. Half-a-dozen times has the Government been appealed to, in vain, for proper equipment for this Company. A short time ago, one man of the Company attended a sale at Ottawa, and actually bought, on behalf of the officers, clothing from the Government for their men.\n\n8. (Second letter of \"Justice,\" 11th January, 1877.)\n\nLieut.-Colonel Hulme, Adjutant 15th Battalion in replying to former letter states:\n\n\"At one o'clock (Sunday,) we had 48 men and 14 officers, and at that hour received orders to billet the men and assemble at four o'clock,\u2014and at four o'clock only 34 men assembled.\"\u2014What became of the 14 missing ones in the interim?\n\nOut of a numerical strength of \"180\" (as stated in Lieut.-Colonel Hulme's letter) 48 men were mustered within four hours, and on the roll being called an hour afterwards, 14 were found to have deserted; that nothing seems to have been done to bring back this 30 per cent. shows that they could not have been regularly enrolled members of the battalion, amenable to the Queen's regulations.\n\nLieut.-Colonel Hulme, in stating that the battalion did not drill last year, says: \"in consequence no recruiting has been done for the past two years, during which time periods of service have expired, and the men have not been replaced, thus proving the disorganization of the corps.\"\n\n9. (Volunteers, No. 3 District to Mail, 8th January, 1877.)\n\nI. Toronto being in No. 2 District and Belleville in No. 3, what was the necessity of bringing the 200 men, 150 miles from the former place to quell the riot?\n\nII. Was the Deputy Adjutant General of No. 3 District applied to for a military force, and if so, was he unable or unwilling to comply?\n\nIII. By whose orders did an armed force come from No. 2, into No. 3 District?\n\nIV. Could not Colonel Williams at Port Hope, or Colonel Smith at Cobourg, or Colonel Callaghan at Kingston, furnish 200 men not one whit inferior to the Queen's Own?\n\nV. Are there not 100 trained and disciplined soldiers at Kingston, and were they not, by order of the Deputy Adjutant General under arms on Sunday and Monday, ready to leave at a moment's notice, and merely waiting for the requisition? Why were they not employed, instead of putting the officers and men of the Queen's Own to the inconvenience and loss of leaving their business for two days or more.\n\nVI. Is it true that the authorities at Ottawa, telegraphed to Lieut.-Colonel Durie, that he would be asked for assistance and to give it?\n\n10. The Queen's Own were very ill treated by the Grand Trunk people, being left 14 hours, while on duty, without food, and then very badly supplied.

Mackenzie.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, the Grand Trunk Company thought it necessary, looking at the depressed state of its business, to dismiss a number of men from its employment; they were notified in the usual way. They have since combined and induced others in the service to strike work, interrupting the whole business of the Railway and the proper conveyance of mail matter from one point to another, by acts of violence and intimidation. I have applied to the Dominion Government of Ontario, through the Lieutenant Governor in Council; to the Municipal Authorities at various points, and although this riotous state of things has prevailed since early on Saturday morning, at no point upon the line where these proceedings have taken, or are taking place, has an adequate force been supplied to keep the peace and protect the\nloyal employees of the Company. The municipal authorities at Stratford and Brockville have failed to make requisition for military assistance, on the ground that it would entail a heavy expenditure upon the municipalities. We are asked to supply accommodation and meals for troops which are being sent from Toronto to Belleville, today, to quell a public disturbance. I venture again to call your attention to this state of matters, and to say that I am advised it is competent for the Dominion Government to employ the military force at its command, at Quebec and Kingston, if the Government of the country is unable to preserve the peace and protect life and property. The Company has only this alternative presented to it, that it must give up the control of its affairs to a body of lawless men, thus relaxing all discipline, and in the end seriously endangering the public safety. I respectfully request to be advised whether the Government will exercise its authority to preserve the peace and assist the Company to protect its property and the lives of its servants.\n\nJ.

MACKENZIE.\n\nGRAND TRUNK RAILWAY OF CANADA,\nGENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE,\nMONTREAL, Jan. 3rd, 1877.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014After the receipt of your telegraphic message, last night, to the effect that you were advised that the Dominion Government had no power under existing legislation to interfere for the purpose of putting an end to the riotous proceedings taking place in different parts of the Dominion, whereby the business of the Grand Trunk Railway was interrupted, to the great inconvenience of the public, and the conveyance of mail matter over the railway practically put a stop to, I came to the conclusion that there was no other course for the Company to pursue but to make some compromise with the mutinous men who were openly violating the law in various parts of the country.\n\nMy several requests invoking the interference of the Dominion Government have been made on general grounds, and I shall not venture to call in question the advice which you have received in regard to the powers of the Government further than to say that that which we have received is to an opposite effect.\n\nI take the liberty of asking if the Government did not, and does not possess, under the law creating a Dominion Police force, power to call out any number of men which might be considered necessary to resist such unlawful proceedings as have taken place along the line of the road during the last few days.\n\nAt the moment of writing, I am unable to say how many different municipal jurisdictions the Grand Trunk Railway touches or traverses, but they are certainly so numerous that to have to wait until the constituted authorities in each could be induced to provide either a sufficient civil force, or make requisitions for the aid of the militia, must necessarily give opportunities for such a destruction of property and loss of revenue to the railway company, as to endanger the financial stability of any corporation however strong, not to mention the inconvenience and loss inflicted upon the country at large by the stoppage of its principal means of intercommunication.\n\nThe terms which have been made with the men I do not consider by any means satisfactory, and law and order, and that discipline necessary amongst the staff of a great railway company, in order to secure the maximum of safety to the public using the railway, have received a rude shock by the proceedings of the last few days, for which I hope may be pardoned saying, it seems to me the Government of the country is responsible.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) J.

I have not heard, and do not know of the existence of any inability on the part of any constable to make any arrest under warrant, by reason of any resistance to his authority. I do not know of, nor do I believe there was any necessity for calling out the militia. I believe that if any information had been laid against the \" strikers\" for any infraction of the law of the land, and a warrant had been issued thereon and delivered to any constable, he would have had no difficulty in arresting the offenders.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Signed,) J. D. ARMOUR.\nSarnia, 5th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that I received your telegram of the 30th of December relating to the engineer's strike on the Grand Trunk Railway; late the same night and next day proceeded to the Grand Trunk Station at Point Edward to see if any disturbance had occurred, or if any breach of the peace was apprehended. I was informed there that on Saturday night an employ\u00e9 of the locomotive department who had gone about thirty miles east and returned with a train, had on his return, when within a mile of Point Edward Station, been taken off his engine by a large number of those on strike and that the engine fires had been extinguished. The agent at the Point did not then expect any immediate violence, and the only precaution I then took was to instruct the License Inspector to personally visit each licensed premises at Point Edward, and caution the keepers thereof not to allow drunkenness or disorderly conduct on their premises, and causing him to place a man there to see that nothing of the kind was permitted. On Tuesday the agent of the G. T. R. at Point Edward called on the Mayor to send up a sufficient number of constables to enable him to resume the ordinary traffic of the road. There not being a sufficient number of county constables for the purpose, the Mayor associated with himself E. M. Proctor and James Copland, Esquires, Justices of the Peace, and at a meeting at my office caused to be sworn in a number of special constables, and these, with what county constables could be spared, amounting in all to thirty-four men, were despatched to the Point in charge of Chief Constable Harkness. On the same morning the Sarnia Company of Garrison Artillery were called out, and remained in Sarnia in readiness to proceed to Point Edward when called on to do so. About noon on Tuesday, the Mayor received a telegram from Mr. Wiley requesting his presence at Point Edward, and at his request Mr. Proctor and Mr. Copland accompanied him there. The magistrates requested me to go with them to advise them on any legal questions that might arise. We found that there was about one hundred men on strike, and were credibly informed that from fifty to seventy-five more of the employ\u00e9s at the buildings and works were sympathizers with the strikers. Mr. Wiley was anxious to attempt to start a train, but as I had been prevented from doing so earlier in the day, violent opposition to this course on the part of the strikers was anticipated, and it was decided that the constables then on duty were quite inadequate to enable him to do so; and that that course would be bringing on a disturbance in which the civil power must be overcome. Before leaving the Point, the Mayor and myself had a long interview with the men on strike. The Mayor explained their position in case of a disturbance fully to them, and showed them that in stopping trains and intimidating drivers, they were arraying themselves against law and order, and no matter what it cost the country, or how many men were required, proceedings of that nature would be put down. I explained the law of riots to them, and the penalties attached to riotous acts. On the return of the Mayor to Sarnia, he telegraphed Col. Taylor, of London, for troops. On Wednesday, the strike having ended, the order for troops was countermanded, the Sarnia Garrison Battery and the special constables were disbanded. Everything has been quiet since.\n\n(Signed,) JULIUS P. BUCKE,\nCounty Crown Attorney, County Lambton.\n\nThe Hon. the Attorney General.\n\nWhitby, 17th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report, that in accordance with the instructions contained in the telegram from J. G. Scott, Esq., addressed to me, and received on the evening of the 30th December last, that I at once made all possible and necessary\ninquiries as to whether any disturbance arising out of the strike of the Grand Trunk railway engineers was to be feared, and could not learn that any interference with the employes of the above Company or danger to its property had occurred, or was likely to occur in this county.\n\nHis Worship the Mayor of this town, acting, as I understood, under instructions from you, as a matter of precaution merely, directed the high constable of the county to proceed to the railway station here, with a posse of seven constables, including some specially appointed for the purpose, and that officer did, on Saturday evening, go to the railway station and remain with his men until after the arrival of the train from Toronto, on Sunday afternoon.\n\nI visited the station of the Grand Trunk railway on Sunday, and enquired of the agent, the telegraph operator, and the trackmen, and the officials of the company, whether any interference with the Company's officials or its property had occurred, or been attempted, and whether any fears were entertained that such was likely to occur, and received a reply from all of these officials in the negative.\n\nI also made enquires of the station agent, as to whether they had heard of any interference, attempted interference, or threatened interference with, the Company's employes or injury to its property in any other part of the county, and was informed that none had been reported to them. I then addressed letters to the station agents at Oshawa, Duffin's Creek and Port Union, being the only other stations in this county, requesting them to telegraph me in the event of any such interference being made or attempted in the neighbourhood of their respective stations, so that prompt and efficient measures might be taken for the apprehension and conviction of all persons so offending.\n\nI instructed the high constable of the county to report any such interference to me, and directed him to be vigilant in obtaining information of any threatened disturbance, and to act promptly to prevent it, and in arresting all persons found so offending.\n\nI have the honor further to report that the officer acted in accordance with the instructions given by me and His Worship the Mayor; and subsequently on Tuesday following, again attended at the Grand Trunk railway station, with a force of men sufficient, if not more than sufficient, for any danger that could be reasonably feared; no disturbance or threatened disturbance having been in the meantime communicated to me by any of the railway officials in this county, the Mayor acting in this matter on his judgment and information, if any such was received by him.\n\nNo interference, attempted interference, or threatened interference with the railway company's employes or property occurred in this county at any time in connection with, or arising out of, the strike of the railway engineers.\n\nThe magistrates of this county, I believe, caused all necessary precautions, if not more than necessary, precautions to be taken to prevent any disturbance. The constables and special constables called out, were active and vigilant in the discharge of their duties; and were not in sympathy with the strike. No occasion arose for calling out the local militia, but had such action been necessary, I can safely say a sufficient force of well-drilled and well-equipped men could have been posted at the two most important railway stations in the county within two hours, and a like force at the remaining stations within four hours after a call for their service had been made.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOHN E. FAREWELL,\nCounty Crown Attorney, County of Ontario.\n\nThe Hon. O. MOWAT,\nAttorney General,\nToronto.\nOFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE PEACE,\nAND COUNTY CROWN ATTORNEY,\nCOURT HOUSE, STRATFORD, JANUARY 18TH, 1877.\n\nSir.\u2014In reply to your request of the 15th inst., I have the honor to present to you my report on the Engineers' Strike on the Grand Trunk Railway, as follows:\n\nOn Friday evening, the 29th December last, the official in charge of the Grand Trunk Railway at Stratford had an intimation that a general strike of the engineers would take place that night. As a measure of precaution, every effort was made by Messrs Larmon and Roberts, the Superintendents here, to clear the road and bring in all outlying trains and locomotives on the western section. In this, they were very successful, and had it not been for the violent snow storm prevailing at night-fall, they would have been entirely so. The first intimation I received of the strike was at half-past eight on Friday night, in Mr. Larmon's office, and from that time until the road was open for traffic, I was in constant communication, night and day, with that gentleman and Mr. Roberts. It is utterly untrue that the civil authorities here were in any way dilatory or neglectful in the discharge of their ordinary or other duties. On the contrary, they were in continual consultation with the railway authorities, and were at all times desirous and most anxious to do all in their power to assist the Company in opening the road for traffic, and prevent any exhibition of violence on the part of the strikers. The only act of violence committed by the strikers was on the arrival of the evening train, on Friday, from Toronto, when the engineer and fireman in charge were rather roughly handled at the station. The leader of the attack and one or two others might have been arrested, but as any arrest would have undoubtedly precipitated a crisis, and been a serious obstacle in the way of an immediate settlement and opening of the road, it was thought most prudent, for the moment, to pass it over. The parties are known, and can, if desirable, in the public interest, be arrested and prosecuted. On Saturday, the 30th, I was instructed by the Attorney-General to render my best aid in preventing and repressing any acts of lawlessness arising out of the engineers' strike; these instructions I communicated to the railway authorities, and assured them that everything that the local authorities could do, would be done. The question then arose, what was to be done? The protection of the property of the Company, which, including workshops and roundhouses, extends over half a mile of ground, was a serious consideration; and on Saturday, it was extremely doubtful whether the 200 men engaged in these works could be safely trusted to protect them, as it was feared the influence of the strikers had shaken their allegiance to the interests of the Company. As to the town's people, there was no doubt that their sympathies were strongly in favour of the engineers, and under these circumstances it was deemed most prudent not to swear in special constables till the following day, when the feeling of the employ\u00e9s, outside the strikers, could be better ascertained.\n\nOn the following morning, Sunday, I telegraphed the Attorney-General that if the Company was determined to run trains from Stratford on Monday morning, without a settlement with the strikers, that an outside force of 200 men would be required, to which he promptly replied that, under such circumstances, it would be the duty of the authorities to forward a requisition, by telegraph, to the senior officer of the Active Militia, and that it would be promptly acted upon. I communicated this despatch at one o'clock on Monday morning to Messrs. Larmon and Roberts, previous to which the Mayor and Police Magistrate had sworn in 200 special constables, armed with batons. These men were all employ\u00e9s of the road. On Monday, in consequence of the receipt of a telegram from the Manager at Montreal, that the mails would not be run till order was restored and protection against all violence afforded by the proper authorities, it was thought advisable to await the action of the authorities in Toronto before forwarding a requisition for the militia. In the meantime, everything that could be thought of for the protection of property and suppression of any exhibition of violence, was done by the authorities. The Mayor, Police Magistrate and myself met the strikers at the Town Hall, and told\nthem in very simple but firm language the consequences that would inevitably follow, if they in any way interfered with the efforts of the officials to run the trains, drawing their special attention to the penal clauses of the General Railway Act, which provides a punishment of five years in the Penitentiary for such offences. On Monday, Mr. Roberts, with about twenty special constables, took an engine to Widder to feel his way to Sarnia, but in consequence of the disturbance at Point Edward, deemed it advisable not to proceed further. On Tuesday, when the first train since Friday was expected from Toronto, there was a force of 200 men, under a very efficient chief constable, W. B. Wilson, mustered at the station, and on the arrival of the train, this body surrounded the engines and prevented any interference or communication with the drivers or firemen, and escorted them to the Town Hall Police Court, where they had every refreshment and accommodation they could desire. As there was no authority for holding these men in custody, at their own request they were allowed to go, and the result was they joined the strikers forthwith.\n\nIt was mentioned on Tuesday, by the Town Solicitor, that before the local militia be called out, some provision should be made either by the Government or by the Company to meet the expense; but, apart from this, the Mayor did not think it necessary that they should be called out, because he had the solemn pledge of the strikers that on the arrival of the trains no violence would be offered to those in charge of it, nor was there any.\n\nThe occasion for a display of a military force here did not arise, because no attempt was made in the absence of the engineers to run the trains east or west from Stratford; and it is due to the great respect in which Messrs. Larmon and Roberts are held by all the employ\u00e9s of the road, and the cordial co-operation of the civil authorities with these gentlemen, that with but one slight exception, on Friday night, the strike passed off in Stratford so peacefully.\n\n(Signed,) M.

In reply, I am happy to state, that in this county there was no cause for action on the part of the local authorities, for the protection of the Company's property or work, or to prevent a breach of the peace by any one in sympathy with that strike.

He at once took steps to have the police of the town, with additional constables, including the chief county constable, ready and prepared for any possible emergency that might occur. We attended at the railroad station when the first and following trains were coming. These trains passed without the least interruption. It was unnecessary to call on the volunteer force, therefore,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed,) H. W. Peterson.\n\nHon. Oliver Mowat,\nAttorney General,\nToronto.\n\n(Copy.)\n\nKingston, 19th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, requesting me to forward a full report as to the action of the local authorities, and the course of events in this county during the disturbance which followed the strike of the employ\u00e9s of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and in complying therewith beg to report:\n\nThat after the receipt of your telegram of 8 p.m., Saturday, 30th December, I put myself in communication with the police magistrate of this city; and he then announced his intention to put down, by the strong arm of the law, the very first symptoms of riot or disturbance.\n\nAs far as I am aware, no disturbance of any kind took place in this county. A train was abandoned by the engineer, a short distance on this side of Gananoque, but Mr. Nutall, the superintendent of the Canadian Engine and Machinery Company here, on being applied to, at once went down with a couple of his men, and brought the train into Kingston.\n\nOn Sunday, the \"A\" Battery of Artillery were under orders from the Militia Department to be in readiness to move, but as I am given to understand, owing to the impossibility of transporting them to Belleville (the scene of the chief disturbance), their services were not called for.\n\nOn close enquiry, I am informed that at Kingston there were three deserted engines, but so far from offering any obstruction, the drivers, though striking, were willing to aid Mr. Nutall in going to the assistance of the deserted train, by affording every explanation as to the peculiarities of the engines, and offered no opposition to his going to the relief of the deserted train.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour most obedient servant,\nAlexander S.

For the information of the Attorney General of Ontario, I beg leave to state that after the receipt of the telegram of December 30th, A.D., 1876, which was received between eight and nine of the clock on the morning of that day, desiring me to render to the authorities in this county aid in taking whatever steps might be required to prevent and repress any acts of lawlessness arising out of the engineers' strike. I have at all times myself been ready and willing to give my advice and aid in the matter.\n\n2nd. No actual disturbance had then taken place. Early on the next morning (Sunday) I went to the Railway Station to see for myself what was doing. When I arrived, I found Col. Brown, of the 49th Battalion, with about thirty privates under Captain Harrison, on guard at the station. No breach of the peace had up to that time taken place to my knowledge. Whilst I was there, an engine was backed down to connect with the express train, guarded by perhaps 25 of the privates; a person standing near ran in between the soldiers, and placing an iron bolt in some part of the engine, disabled it; a pistol shot was then fired from the engine, doing, however, no damage. The person who fired this shot ran to the railway station, followed by a number of the crowd, and was assaulted inside the station, but not much injured.\n\n3rd. I then applied to the Grand Trunk Solicitor, John Bell, Esq., who was on the ground, and asked him if he wished for any assistance from me, and showed him your telegram of the 30th.\n\nMr. Bell replied that nothing could be done with the force at their disposal at the station. The Company were then marched away from the station and separated.\n\n5th. Although a great many persons were present, the engineers mingling with the spectators, no actual breach of the peace, other than that I have stated, took place, or seemed likely to do so.\n\n6th. There is no doubt that if an engine had been brought and coupled to the train, the engineers would have prevented it leaving, by disabling it, and assaulting the engine driver.\n\n7th. The Mayor of the town, W. A. Foster, Esq., and the Deputy Sheriff, Mr. John Taylor, were there also at the station.\n\n8th. It was Sunday, and it was not thought desirable to do anything more that day.\n\n9th. Feeling myself called upon to act upon your telegram of the 30th, I determined to call the authorities together on Monday morning. In this course Mr. Bell concurred.\n10th. I found the course I had proposed to carry out fully confirmed by your telegram of the 1st of January, 1877, which I received at 3 o'clock in the morning of that day.\n\n11th. Shortly after daylight I called upon Mr. Bell, with your telegram received that morning, and then went immediately to Judge Sherwood, Chairman of the Sessions, and I called the magistrates together at the Police Magistrate's office, Town Hall. There were present: The Hon. Billa Flint, A. Diamond, Police Magistrate, and C. V. Bogart, J.P.; Mr. Bell was also present. They were assembled by 10 o'clock a.m.\n\n12th. I prepared the requisition according to the statute, and as the magistrates thought that an information was necessary, I at once drew one up and got it sworn by Sergeant Snider, of the police force, a copy of which, marked (A), is hereto annexed.\n\n13th. As soon as the requisition was signed, I telegraphed one, and mailed one to Colonel Durie; I gave another to the Mayor to hand to Colonel Durie on his arrival.\n\n14th. On the 2nd January, 1877, I called a meeting of the magistrates to appoint a committee to accompany the Mayor to the Grand Trunk Railway Station to meet Colonel Durie.\n\n15th. W. A. Foster, Mayor, the Hon. Billa Flint, M. Bowell, M.P., J. L. Smith, J.P., C. V. Bogart, J.P., E. H. Coleman, J.P., were present at that meeting.\n\n16th. It was then moved by the Hon. Billa Flint, and seconded by A. L. Smith, J.P.\u2014\n\n\"That the Mayor issue his proclamation, warning all parties not having business to transact at the Grand Trunk Station to refrain from going thereto, and to disperse therefrom,\" which was carried unanimously. It was also moved by A. L. Smith, J.P. and seconded by C. V. Bogart, J.P.\u2014\n\n\"That Everett H. Coleman, J.P., A. L. Smith, J.P., and M. Bowell, J.P., accompany the Mayor to the Grand Trunk Station, and await the arrival of the Queen's Own from Toronto, and give such orders as they may deem proper, to the commander of the men under Colonel Durie, in order to preserve the peace and suppress any riot,\" which was unanimously carried.\n\n17th. The Magistrates acted willingly and promptly on being called upon.\n\n18th. It happened at this time the police of Belleville were disorganized, two persons claiming to be chief.\n\n19th. Neither chief went to the station, but Sergeant Snider of that force was there, and most active in his duties and is a most efficient officer; I saw no other police officers there.\n\n20th. The committee appointed went to the Grand Trunk Station on the evening of Tuesday the 2nd of January, 1877, to meet the Queen's Own militia force.\n\n21st. This force arrived about 11 o'clock in the evening of that day, and were met by the committee of magistrates at the station.\n\n22nd. On their arrival, the crowd commenced shouting and throwing missiles at the volunteers, consisting of stones, coal, pieces of wood, &c. One of the volunteers, I understood, was struck on the breast with an iron bolt, but not much injured.\n\n23rd. The volunteers then charged upon the crowd, who dispersed. One man, James McLaughlin, a drunken fellow who took part in the disturbance, but is not an engineer, was stabbed with a bayonet in the thigh; he is, however, fast recovering.\n\n24th. One William Poole, supposed to be an engineer, who was arrested by one of the Queen's Own for attempting to disable one of the engines, was brought before the Police Magistrate. I appeared there to prosecute, and William Ashall, Sergeant of the Queen's Own, appeared as a witness; but as the case was about to proceed, Mr. Bell, for the Grand Trunk, appeared and stated the difficulty between the Grand Trunk and the engineers had been settled, and that he did not wish the case to be prosecuted. The men of the Queen's Own then left, and the magistrate dismissed the case. I objected to this manner of disposing of the case; but the men of the Queen's Own left me, and I was without witnesses. It is but fair to say that they did not leave until they understood from Mr. Bell that the case had been settled.\nRemarks.\u2014The reports of actual violence were much exaggerated. For the purpose of making this report, I applied to Colonel Brown, and asked him why no engine was started whilst he was there with his men on Sunday, the 31st of December last. He replied that the Grand Trunk could not get an engineer to drive the engine, as the engineers who were favorable to the Grand Trunk feared violence. Upon enquiry why the man who disabled the engine on Sunday, the 31st, was not at once arrested, Mr. Bell, who was then on the ground, as myself was, stated that the force of Volunteers was not sufficient for the purpose. I saw many men standing around and upon the cars who had bolts and iron instruments which could be used effectively in case the parties commenced a disturbance, which, however, did not take place, the men remaining simply as spectators. There were a great many men standing about, evidently sympathisers with the engineers, and went to swell the crowd, who could claim exemption as spectators, and yet in case of disturbance, were evidently prepared to act with the engineers.\n\nNo demand was made upon the Grand Trunk Railway Company's authorities for payment or supplies for the Volunteers, so far as I can ascertain. I asked Mr. Bell specially on this point.\n\nThe Militia under Colonel Brown were too few in number to act offensively against so large a body as they were opposed to. The Mayor was on the ground, ready to do anything that was required of him. The Grand Trunk Solicitor was also present, and the Militia force.\n\nAll rations for the Queen's Own were furnished by the Mayor's authority, and no demand made upon the Grand Trunk for payment.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed,) CHARLES L.

I am happy, however, to say that no violence or breach of the peace occurred in my county during the strike on said railway.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed,) IRA LEWIS.\n\nThe Hon. O. Mowat,\nAttorney General,\nToronto.\n\nReceived 27th January, 1877.\n\nTo the Honourable Oliver Mowat, Attorney General of the Province of Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to present, in accordance with the request contained in your letter of the 15th inst. in that behalf, a report as to the action of the authorities and the course of events in the united counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, during the disturbances which followed the late strike of the employ\u00e9s of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, as follows:\n\nUpon enquiry, I find that, strictly speaking, said strike did not extend to these counties. The strike, I believe, took place on the evening of the 29th December last. I am informed that on that evening the engine driver of the express train going east stopped his train about six miles east of Lancaster Station, quitted his post, and fled across the boundary to the United States.\n\nThe train remained where he left it for about six hours, when the engine of another passenger train was sent to its relief.\n\nAt the Cornwall Station nothing happened. This, no doubt, was owing to the prudence of Mr. Horseman, the Station Agent there. There were four engine drivers there in the evening or during the night of the 29th December; and Mr. Horseman having received instructions to be prepared for the anticipated strike, came into the town and informed William Cox Allen, Esq., Police Magistrate, who at once, in the middle of the night, accompanied Mr. Horseman to the station, but happily there was no occasion for his services, as the engine drivers readily obeyed the orders of the Station Agent.\n\nIn the evening of the 30th December last, the Mayor of Cornwall, Andrew Hodge, Esq., received a telegram from your Department, saying that you relied upon him and the local magistracy to prevent and repress any illegal acts or conduct in connection with the then pending strike of employ\u00e9s along the Grand Trunk Railway.\n\nMr. Hodge, within 30 minutes of the receipt of this telegram, called upon me, and we at once went to the Grand Trunk Station, and informed the agent that we were desirous of rendering all the assistance in our power in preventing and punishing all illegal acts; and requested him to communicate this information to the various stations on the Railway within the three counties. On Sunday, the 31st December, I visited the Cornwall Station, and I believe Dr. Allen and Mr. Hodge did so too, and found all things quiet.\n\nI have not learned that anything occurred in connection with said strike in these counties, except what I have detailed above.\n\nMr. Horseman gladly bears testimony to the promptness displayed by the Cornwall magistrates when called upon.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nJAMES DINGWALL,\nCounty Crown Attorney, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.\nBERLIN, 29th Jan., 1877.\n\nThe Hon. the Attorney General,\nToronto.\n\nSir,\u2014Enclosed, please find return as per your circular of the 15th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed,) W. H. BOWLBY,\nCounty Attorney and Clerk of Peace,\nby M. EBY.\n\nP. S.\u2014I was delayed in preparing the report in order to get some information from the volunteers here.\n\nW. H. B.\n\nReport by the County Attorney of the County of Waterloo, to the Honourable the Attorney General of the Province of Ontario, as to the action of the local authorities, and the course of events in the County of Waterloo, during the recent strike of certain employ\u00e9s of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada.\n\nPursuant to instructions received by telegraph from the Hon. Oliver Mowat, M.P.P., Attorney General and Premier of Ontario, I called upon Hugo Kranz, Esq., Mayor of Berlin, on the first day of the strike of the engineers employed by the said Company, and found that the Mayor had sent the Berlin Company of the 29th Battalion of the volunteer militia to the Berlin station of the said railway, to keep order there, but that the said volunteers found no necessity for their continued presence at the said railway station, as everything was quiet, and there were only about a dozen men on strike, all of whom were peaceable, quiet and inoffensive. Immediately thereafter, I called upon the Station Master of the said Company at the said station, who informed me that there were no employ\u00e9s of the said Company on strike in the said county, except about a dozen engineers and firemen at Berlin, all of whom were quiet and peaceable men, and that he said Station Master considered it unnecessary and a farce to send volunteers to the Berlin station, to keep those few employ\u00e9s of the said railway in order, when they were not creating, and would not create any disturbance.\n\nThat there was no disturbance of any kind within the limits of the said county during the said strike, but all was quiet and orderly, and the Queen's peace was undisturbed throughout the said county of Waterloo during the continuance of the said strike.\n\nThat during the time that the said employ\u00e9s of the said Company were on strike, I was asked by an officer of the said volunteer Company, Lieutenant Meinke, if I had authority to order the said Company of volunteers to go beyond the limits of the said county of Waterloo to Stratford; and he, the said militia officer, then stated that the Railway authorities had informally, by telegraph, requested a portion of the said volunteer Company to go to Stratford to suppress a threatened riot in Stratford; accordingly I consulted the said Mayor, and we informed Lieutenant Meinke that we had no power to order the volunteers to go out of our county to Stratford, in the next county of Perth; therefore the said Lieutenant Meinke refused to go to Stratford without proper official orders from the Militia Department at Ottawa.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed,) W. H. BOWLBY,\nCounty Crown Attorney and Clerk of the Peace, County of Waterloo.\n\nDated at Berlin, this 29th day of January, 1877.\nBrockville, 29th January, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication requesting me to furnish a report of the action of the local authorities and the course of events during the strike of the Grand Trunk employ\u00e9s.\n\nEarly on the morning of Saturday, the 30th December last, the Mayor (Lieut.-Col. Buell) was informed by the Station Agent here and the Chief of Police that the strike had taken place. He at once instructed the Chief to attend at the Station, and to take the whole police force with him, if required to keep order. Only one train, viz., the train which left Montreal on Friday evening, came to Brockville on Saturday. It reached here about 4 p.m., having been delayed by the storm, and passed on without interruption; but was subsequently stopped, before getting to Belleville. No train came either way on Sunday, that I have heard of. On Monday, the 1st January, a train which had been made up at Kingston came to Brockville about 2 p.m.\n\nThe town was in a considerable state of excitement that day, owing to its being a holiday, and the municipal elections being held, and a large number of people had congregated at the Grand Trunk Station. At the time of the arrival of the train, only the Chief of Police and one policeman happened to be at the Station, and some persons managed to disconnect some of the cars and to do some injury (of no great importance) to the locomotive. At this time the Mayor arrived, and some others of the police force who had been sent for, also came.\n\nThe Mayor immediately got on the locomotive, and told the driver that he should be protected. The driver, however, lost courage, and requested to be taken to the gaol as a place of safety; this was done by the police. The Mayor was of the opinion that if the driver had showed more courage, the engine could have been repaired in a very short time, and taken on with the train. In consequence of this difficulty, the train coming from Montreal came no further west than Prescott. Several of the strikers are said to have gone to Prescott and persuaded the driver of this train to leave it, and Brother Watt did so, and returned with them to Brockville. The Mayor had previously taken steps to have the volunteers called out with as little delay as possible, in case it became necessary to do so, having seen the Deputy-Adjutant-General and the Captain of the Brockville Company. He now endeavored to get a meeting of the Town Council, first fixing 5 p.m. and then 7 p.m. for it, but owing to the elections and the attendant excitement, he could not get a quorum to attend. The next morning (the 2nd January) a meeting was held at 10 a.m., at which the Mayor submitted the question of calling out the volunteers to the Council. They, however, declined to recommend this course, and even passed a resolution declaring that it was not necessary.\n\nThe Mayor would have called out the Volunteers without reference to the action of the Council, had he thought it necessary.\n\nHe did not consider it necessary at the time, and proceeded with the police force to the station, and remained there all Tuesday and part of Wednesday, getting on every locomotive that passed, and succeeded in preventing any other disturbance or delaying of trains at Brockville; some rough language was used, but no acts of violence occurred.\n\nThere was a good deal of sympathy felt and expressed for the employ\u00e9s who had struck. I enclose you a leading article cut from the Brockville Monitor, of the 5th January, which, as you will see, expresses a strong sympathy for them. This feeling did not extend to or affect the police force, who did their duty and supported the Mayor very well.\n\nThere was no general apprehension of violence, and I think there was a general reluctance to have any such sharp measures as calling out the volunteers resorted to, it not being considered necessary.\n\nI may add that the Editor of the Monitor is in error in stating that I urged the Council to call out the volunteers. I attended the meeting and explained the law\nand the position of matters to them, but I did not urge that the volunteers should be called out, and I cannot say that I thought it would be necessary or useful to do so.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed,) E. J. SENKLER,\nCrown Attorney for Leeds and Grenville.\n\nHon. O. MOWAT,\nAttorney-General,\nToronto.\n\nBRANTFORD, January 30th, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your telegram of last evening, I hasten to reply to your communication of the 15th inst., requesting me to forward a full report as to the action of the local authorities and the course of events in my county, during the disturbances which followed the late strike of the employ\u00e9s of the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\n\nOn the 30th December last, between eight and nine in the evening, the following telegram reached me:\u2014\u201cTo County Attorney, Brantford: \u2018The Attorney-General desires you to render to the authorities in your county your best aid in taking whatever steps may be required to prevent and repress any acts of lawlessness arising out of the engineers' strike.\u2014J. G. Scott.\u201d Immediately on its receipt, I went to the residence of the Police Magistrate, Mr. James Weyns, and showed him the telegram and arranged with him for the swearing in of a large number of reliable special constables. The Police Magistrate and myself then went to the station of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, for the purpose of ascertaining the position of matters about the station; we remained there some little time, but found nothing to excite remark, save that there was unusual quiet, and the absence of men other than the night watchman. We then called upon Mr. Kerr, the Mechanical Superintendent of the Company, and showed him the telegram, and assured him of the readiness of the authorities to co-operate with the Company to preserve order and protect their interests in every lawful way. We were informed by Mr. Kerr that he apprehended no immediate disturbance, but we gathered from him that the strike was regarded as formidable, and disturbances might follow unless some adjustment between the employ\u00e9s and the Company should be speedily arrived at. He promised to advise promptly of any suspicious appearances or overt acts on the part of the employ\u00e9s.\n\nOn the next day, Sunday, everything was quiet. On the following Monday morning, everything was arranged, and the Mayor and Police Magistrate and a large number of men were assembled at the station ready to be sworn in as special constables, by the Police Magistrate.\n\nDuring the time the Police Magistrate was at the station, a telegram was received by Mr. Dodds, Superintendent of the Locomotive Department, from Mr. Hickson, making certain propositions to the employ\u00e9s, and read in the presence of Holindrake, the local leader of the Brethren here. Mr. Holindrake said if the Head Centre in Toronto would agree to it, the men would go to work at once. By reason of this statement no special constables were sworn in, nor was there anything to justify such a step in the subsequent developments. The authorities here were, however, on the alert, and ready to afford every lawful assistance to the Company, and the Company were fully aware of that fact.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. R. VANNORMAN,\nCounty Crown Attorney, Brant.\n\nJ. G. SCOTT, Esq.,\nAttorney-General's Office,\nToronto.\nOFFICE OF THE COUNTY ATTORNEY,\nCOUNTY OF LENNOX AND ADDINGTON,\nNAPANEE, January 30th, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to transmit herewith, my report upon the events connected with the recent strike of the engineers in the employ of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada. The delay in sending it has been caused by the absence of persons from whom I thought I could obtain the most accurate information, and from an effort I was making to obtain copies of certain telegrams relating to the matter.\n\nThe telegram from your Department sent yesterday was not received by me until this morning, in consequence of my absence from home, and I have therefore framed the report in haste, today. I have, however, obtained all the information I could, and have no doubt as to the substantial correctness of all the statements made. There is in fact, very little of information to report so far as this county is concerned.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. REEVE,\nCounty Attorney, Counties Lennox and Addington.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Attorney General,\nToronto.\n\nOFFICE OF THE COUNTY ATTORNEY,\nCOUNTY OF LENNOX AND ADDINGTON,\nNAPANEE, January 30th, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour, in pursuance to the letter received from your Department on the 17th instant, to make the following report in reference to the recent strike of engineers in the employ of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada.\n\nOn receiving a telegram from your Department on the night of Saturday, the 30th December last, requesting me to tender my aid to the authorities in suppressing any breach of the peace that might occur in connection with the strike, I at once proceeded to the Railway Station here, and satisfied myself that there was no immediate prospect of any disturbance in this vicinity.\n\nThroughout the whole period of the strike no breach of the peace or disturbance of any kind occurred within the limits of this county.\n\nI find that the Mayor of Napanee, on receipt of a telegram from your Department similar to that received by me, and about the same time, called on the station master and promised that he would procure the assistance of the volunteers at Napanee if required.\n\nOn the following morning, Sunday, the 31st, the Mayor having been applied to by telegram from the Railway authorities at Toronto, to procure the volunteers at Napanee to go to Belleville to assist the Railway Company in forcing their trains past Belleville for the west, requested Captain Hooper of Napanee to call out his men for that purpose, to which request Captain Hooper replied that he could not call out the men for service at Belleville, without instructions from Lieut.-Col. Straubenzie of Portsmouth.\n\nApplication was then made to the latter officer during the course of the same day (Sunday) for his authority to Captain Hooper to proceed to Belleville with the men under his command, to which he replied by telegram to the Mayor, that if the municipality would pay the expense* he (the Mayor) might order out the volunteers\n\n* Note\u2014As under the statute it is the duty of the municipality in which the services of the militia are required, to pay the expenses, Belleville was in this case properly chargeable. (Signed,) O.M.\nto proceed to Belleville as asked. This was not considered by Captain Hooper an order of which he could take cognizance, nor on the other hand could the Mayor pledge the corporation of Napanee to defray the necessary expenses.\n\nIn the meantime, on Sunday afternoon, a meeting of the citizens was called in the market square by the Mayor, by ringing the town bell, the object of which was to ascertain what assistance might be obtained from them, and the considerable crowd which collected was addressed by the Mayor and Captain Hooper, who asked those who were willing to accompany the volunteers to Belleville (in case they were ordered to proceed there) and assist in quelling the disturbance there, to signify such willingness. In answer to this call, only some two or three gave a favourable response, and the sympathy of those present appeared to be strongly in favour of the engineers on strike. It is to be remarked, however, that the meeting was composed chiefly of working men, and the Mayor was assured by many of the merchants and other business residents of the town, that if a force was organized to go to the scene of the disturbance, they would join it.\n\nAt the same time, some persons (even persons of some position and intelligence) openly expressed opinions in approval of the action taken by the engineers, and the indications of sympathy with them, which came to the notice of the station master here, were sufficient to discourage him from taking any further steps to secure the assistance of the volunteer force.\n\nNo definite instructions were sent from Lieut.-Colonel Straubenzie or any other quarter, for the calling out of the volunteers, and no further effort was made to send any assistance from Napanee.\n\nCaptain Hooper asserts that if he had received orders, he would have had no difficulty in proceeding to Belleville with the men in his force. I cannot say that his course in the matter indicated any unwillingness on his part to discharge his duty.\n\nNor have I observed that the Mayor of Napanee exhibited any other desire than to do all in his power to assist in the preservation of the peace.\n\nNo other magistrates, so far as I am aware, took or were asked to take any action.\n\nSo far as I could learn, there was no assemblage of persons at Napanee, or within this county, with any intention of breaking the peace, and the only cause of the detention of trains here was the state of matters at Belleville.\n\nI believe that there was a considerable amount of sympathy felt among different classes of persons with the discontented employ\u00e9s; but it seems to me impossible to say that such sympathy had any effect upon the course which matters took in this vicinity. All that was asked by the railway Company was, that the volunteers should be sent from here to Belleville, and the reasons why this was not done, I have given above, to the best of my knowledge, and from the best information I could obtain.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. REEVE,\nCounty Attorney, County of Lennox and Addington.\n\nCopy of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 8th January, 1877.\n\nOn a memorandum dated 6th January, 1877, from the Hon. the Minister of Justice, having reference to the recent breaches of the peace, which have occurred at various points along the line of the Grand Trunk Railway in the Province of Ontario, and calling the attention of Council to the view, that the history of these occurrences would seem to indicate, either that the means for repressing such acts of violence are inadequate, or that there has been some miscarriage in the use of those means.\nThe Minister states that without entering into any details of the various allegations which have been made upon the subject, he submits the circumstances are such as to justify Council in taking steps to attain authentic information with reference to the action of the local authorities and also of the militia, to the end that the action of the militia called out in aid of the civil power may be known, and that it may be considered whether any further legislation on the part of the Parliament of Canada is necessary or desirable.\n\nHe recommends that full reports should be obtained from the proper officers of the militia of all that has occurred, and that the substance of his memorandum should be communicated to the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, with a request that he would at the earliest possible moment, for the purposes indicated, obtain and transmit for your Excellency's information, reports as to the action of the local authorities, and the course of events in each locality during the disturbances.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendations, and submit the same for your Excellency's approval.\n\n(Certified,)\nW. A. HIMSORTH,\nClerk Privy Council.\n\nA report of the Deputy Adjutant-General of No. 2 Militia District, concerning the calling out of the militia on the 1st January last has been duly received. As it appears that breaches of the peace have occurred at various points along the line of the Grand Trunk Railway in other Military Districts, it is requested that all reports and papers which may have been received from officers commanding Militia Districts when the services of the militia were required on the occasion referred to may be transmitted with the least possible delay for the information of the Honourable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\n(Signed,) EUG. PANET,\nDeputy.\n\nTo the Major-General Commanding.\nOttawa, 10th January, 1877.\n\nOTTAWA, 27th January, 1877.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The Major-General commanding is furnished herewith with a synopsis of various statements made in the newspaper press, in regard to militia movements on the occasion of the recent strike on the Grand Trunk Railway; and he is desired to cause careful enquiry to be made, and to submit an early report upon the same, point by point, irrespective of the general reports upon these occurrences already sent in.\n\nW. B. VAILL,\nMinister of Militia and Defence.\n\nSubmitted\u2014the Information called for.\n\nOnly one man (an Indian) in 15th Regiment refused to turn out. The fourteen men who are said to have absented themselves at four o'clock, joined the remainder at six at the station, and remained on duty till nine next morning. No complaint about the 49th Regiment. It is astonishing so many men were present on such short notice at night on New Year's Eve.\nThe want of clothing and great coats in the 49th rests with the Adjutant. Ammunition is not entrusted as a reserve to companies that have no safe magazines.\n\nThe whole of the affair has been apparently magnified. It turns out fairly well under the circumstances. The men remained on duty till regularly dismissed.\n\n(Signed,) SELBY SMYTH,\nMajor-General.\n\n20th February, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to inform you that I received a telegram from you on Friday, the 16th inst., instructing me to proceed to Belleville to enquire into the cause of the Companies of the 15th Battalion mustering so weak when called upon to aid the civil power on the occasion of a riot at the Grand Trunk Railway Station on the 31st December last, and also to procure the names of the men in this Battalion who, when duly warned, refused to turn out, as stated in the report of the officer commanding, Major Lazier, and again from a letter, under the signature of Lieut.-Col. Hulme, which letter appeared in the Mail newspaper, stating that he marched at 4 o'clock, p.m., some (34) thirty-four men to the Grand Trunk Depot, but that at 1 o'clock, p.m., he had (48) forty-eight men on parade. On the 16th inst., I telegraphed the officers commanding to meet me on the evening of the 16th, together with the officers in command of the two Companies ordered out on requisition of the Major, Major Lazier, Captains Dunnett and Crozier met me that evening, and Major Lazier informed me that the reason he had not answered the letters of the 8th and 11th inst., enclosing a copy of your letters of the 7th and 11th inst., was that he was away on Circuit Duty at Napanee. Major Lazier stated that he based his statement of the men of his Battalion not turning out when warned, as many of them sympathized with the strikers, on what Captain Crozier said, his Sergeant, Bouler by name, told him had happened when warning men\u2014also from Captain Appleby, of No. 4 Company, Shannonville, who told him that men of his Company refused to turn out. I now enclose his letter on this subject. Major Lazier also informed me in order to get any men at all out, he warned himself or telegraphed the whole of the officers commanding Companies to get out all the men they could. This was, I understood, at 6 o'clock, p.m., and by 1 o'clock, p.m., they had, according to the Adjutant, Lieut.-Colonel Hulme, (48) forty-eight men on parade. A letter from Lieut.-Colonel Hulme I enclose. They were dismissed, and warned to fall in again at 4 o'clock. Thirty-four men only assembled at 4 o'clock, and they were marched off to the depot, Captain Farley, of No. 3 Company, remaining behind to bring up the remaining (14) fourteen when they came, which they all did, and were marched to the station, by 6 o'clock, p.m., and the (48) forty-eight men then remained there all that night on guard. As all officers had been warned to bring out as many men of their Companies as they could get, I thought it would be well to see them all the next day on this subject, and requested Major Lazier to call a meeting for the next day, which he did, and they were present with the exception of Captain Farley (who was unavoidably absent). Lieut.-Colonel Hulme and Sergt. Bouler was also present, supposed to be a Sergt. in No. 1 Company, 15th Battalion, and they all answered and signed the questions enclosed, and by which you will see that Frank Claus, an Indian, was the only man that refused to turn out, and also that Sergt. McCormick, who had a dying horse at home and he begged to be excused, which was granted by the Captain. These are the only names I could get. It seems to me that in the present disorganized state of the 15th Battalion, to call on them at short notice, in aid of the civil powers, would find them utterly wanting in all the requisites which makes a military force useful on such an occasion, as I shall endeavour to show by a circumstance that happened to me during the time I was in Belleville. Sergt. William Boulen, of No. 1 Company, 15th Battalion, for I recollect seeing the man on parade this year in the ranks.\nof No. 1 Co., 49th Batt., and enclose you Service Rolls, Nominal Rolls at inspection, showing that he does belong to the 49th. I found this out from the Rolls in the office, and at once telegraphed Captain Harrison and enclose his reply forwarded. This shows, I think, how slack the Battalion is,\u2014and also great assurance in bringing him up before me as a smart sergeant of No. 1 Co., 15th Batt., and had, of course, him in it sometime from being a sergeant. I think, however, the Regiment will improve vastly under Major Lazier, who is capable of commanding and has a good reputation in Belleville, and is, I know, very anxious to see the Regiment in good order, as he is fully alive to its bad state now, but nothing will be done till he is Gazetted. As regards No. 1 Co., 49th Batt., I do not think any blame is attached to them and no doubt they went through a great deal of disagreeable work. They returned a Pay Sheet of thirty-eight out of forty-two, which I think is really very good.\n\nI also enclose questions and answers of officers of the 15th Batt., together with one from No. 1 Co., 49th Batt.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed,) P.

I had understood from Captain Crozier and Sergeant Bouler, of his Company (No. 1), that Sergeant Bond had warned some men of his Company who refused to turn out. On enquiry from the Sergeant it appears that the men he went for, and who he reported would not turn out, were not members of the Battalion. He states he understood that effective men, whether they belonged to the Regiment or not, would be taken, and he thought he had explained that they did not belong to the Regiment at the time. Captain Crozier did not so understand it nor did I. With reference to the letter of the 11th instant, I beg to enclose a copy of a letter written by me to Lieut.-Colonel Hulme and his reply thereto.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. S. LAZIER,\nMajor 15th Battalion.\n\nLieut.-Col.
