Her deceased husband's family have been trying to take the child away from her but she refused to give the child up.\n\nShe is now working in the laundry at Alberni Indian Residential school, and according to a letter from Mr. Caldwell, the principal, she is doing a satisfactory job. He advises that the little girl is attending school, and that he has accommodation for the mother & child in the school.\n\nWe of course realize that the child is not of legal school age, but we feel that every consideration should be given in this case, as Mrs. Brown is trying hard to be self-supporting, and also being able to keep her child with her, while otherwise she would in all probability drift back to the reserve, and become a charge on the Dept.\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Agent,\nBella Coola Agency,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 396,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nRe: Clarence Fraser\n\nI have given careful consideration to the contents of your letter of June 1st, and I cannot see any advantage in holding this boy in a residential school any longer.\n\nUnder the circumstances, he should be considered discharged effective June 30th, 1951, and you should so inform the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Clarence Fraser Orphan.\nNo. 22, Tahalimo Band.\nBorn November 30, 1932.\n\nThe above mentioned is a pupil in the Alberni Residential School and as we had trouble with him on the Reserve, (due to lack of care and supervision), prior to his admission to the Residential School, I considered that it would be advisable to keep him in school during the summer holidays, and suggested this to Mr. Caldwell.\n\nI received a letter from the Principal this A.M. which says in part:\n\n\"Clarence Fraser: I would be reluctant to keep this boy for the summer. His brother has been here, first wanting to get him out for May 24th, which I did not consent to, and then wasting him out for the summer to work in a logging camp. While this boy has been amenable during his time in school, he is a different boy to what he was when he was here previously, and now has the general attitude of one with \"ripe experience\". He is particularly susceptible to feminine society. I question whether I could hold him in school for the summer. If it is possible, I would prefer that he be out of school.\"\n\nI have no desire to impose on Mr. Caldwell as he has been most accommodating to me over the years and helped this agency out on many occasions. For that reason I do not wish to embarrass him and insist that Clarence remain during the holidays.\n\nHowever, he will not be 16 years until November 30, 1951 and I am quite sure that we will not get him back again to school after the holidays, if he is allowed out. Even he is\nnot allowed he will likely go anyway.\n\nIn view of the information given by Mr. Caldwell on this lad, would the Department look with favour on an application for his discharge? Please advise by Air Mail.\n\nR.H. MOORE,\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nRes: Clarence Fraser, 15 years,\nRoll No.22 Nanaimo Band.\n\nThe above noted orphan boy was staying with his sister,\nVirginia Fraser, on the Nanaimo Indian Reserve No.1. Two weeks ago,\nVirginia went to Vancouver, B.C., and left the lad to fend for himself.\nPrior to her leaving, Clarence was most irregular in his school\nattendance. He was also staying out late at nights, hanging around\nthe streets in Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nWhen the matter was brought to my attention by the Nanaimo\nHealth Nurse, I felt immediate action should be taken and telephoned\nMr. Caldwell at Alberni Residential School, who agreed to take\nClarence as soon as I could get him there. This was done the\nfollowing day.\n\nWhen I got the boy, he only had a shirt, trousers and an old\npair of shoes, to his name. This condition was not good and so I\nasked Mr. Caldwell to get him some clothing which he could wear on\nspecial occasions and Sundays, and send the accounts to me.\n\nMr. Caldwell supplied him with a complete outfit of everyday\nor school clothes including underwear.\n\nI would ask that the Department be good enough to pay the\nattached voucher number 493, to an amount of thirty-one dollars and\nninety cents ($31.90) and have the cheque sent direct to the School\nPrincipal, as he paid cash for the goods at Woodwards' Ltd.\n\n(Sgd.)

It is felt no progress will be made unless the girls are placed in residential school. Kitimat School is also over-crowded.\n\nCarl David Grant age 9 years. This boy is one of a family of 12 children and the home is very overcrowded. In the interests of all, it is felt advisable to remove some of the load from the family, also to relieve congestion in the school.\n\nAlina Agatha Grant age 10 years. This home is also quite crowded and it is believed this girl and those remaining at home will all benefit by some reduction in the family load, also to relieve overcrowding of school.\n\nIvy Duncan age 10 years and Raymond Duncan age 11 years. The father of these two children is ill. A sister died recently of tuberculosis. There is some suspicion of malnutrition here although the children are still healthy. To make it easier for the family to cope with the younger children remaining at home, to relieve overcrowding in the school and for the general welfare of these two children the application is submitted.\n\nArnold Victor Mason age 16. Klemu School has been unfortunate in many ways, as a result all pupils are retarded. This boy while retarded for his years shows evidence of ability and good character. School Inspector Davey recommended that he be sent to Alberni to complete grade 8 with the hope that he might go to High School. Judging from the younger crop coming along, Klemu will need Victor as a better educated man when he reaches manhood.\n\nIt is recommended that the above children be admitted to Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nDept.

B. Caldwell, Principal of the above named Residential School.\n\nI can readily understand that the Department would feel that the responsibility for providing clothing for the two children concerned should fall upon the administration of the Residential School, particularly if the full facts of the case were not explained when the original submission was made to the Department. It is the practice of the Alberni School, and other Residential Schools, to purchase bulk quantities of clothing in the normal sizes for children enrolled at Residential Schools. However, in this particular case both of the pupils were under school age. The Principal, upon special request, admitted these children to relieve the Department of a difficult and almost impossible task of finding accommodation for them. Had Mr. Caldwell refused to accept these children, as he was perfectly entitled to do because of their ages, and if a suitable home could have been found for them, the cost of maintenance for these children would have been considerably in excess of the amount of the per capita grant. Mr. Caldwell's action, therefore, has meant a substantial saving to the Department. I would like to say that the Principal of the Alberni Residential School has been most helpful in providing accommodation for a number of welfare cases where he was under no obligation to admit the children concerned and it is felt that he should not be penalized for so doing. As Mr. Caldwell himself states, the amount involved is small but I feel that we cannot expect to retain the very generous co-operation which we have received from Mr. Caldwell if the Department is to apply rigidly...\nthe regulations concerning Residential School children and to extend them to cases which do not fit into the normal pattern.\n\nI am re-submitting this matter because I am confident that the Department's decision was reached without its having access to all of the facts.\n\nW.

Arneil,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs,\nVANCOUVER, B.C. Re. Special Admissions\nNew Westminster Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the following:\n\nIn October last I admitted to this school at the urgent request of Mr. Gillett, Indian Superintendent for the New Westminster Agency, two boys, Frederick and Walter John, of the Soowhalie Band, then aged 5 years 7 mos and 4 years 2 mos. These children being under the school age minimum, required to have special clothes and shoes purchased for them. I requested assistance from Mr. Gillett in this matter and he asked me to furnish him with bills and he would request payment from Ottawa.\n\nI furnished Mr. Gillet with a bill for shoes amounting to about $11.00 (the receipt has not been returned to me) and I eventually received reply with a quotation from a letter from Ottawa reading as follows:\n\n\"These pupils have been grant earning pupils at the Alberni Residential School since October 1950. This account should, therefore, be paid by the Principal\".\n\nMr. Gillet assures me that he explained the situation in his letter to Ottawa. This is a comparatively small matter, but I have tried to co-operate with the Department in the taking of these necessitous cases, cases that would present a serious problem, and no inconsiderable expense to the Department if they were not cared for by the school, and my inclination is to continue such co-operation. However, as you may know, our present Government revenue is some 22 points below the cost of living index, and it is only reasonable to expect co-operation from the Department, at least in these special cases.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSeptember 5, 1951.\n\nMr. W.P.

There are six younger children in this home, where income is quite low. It is believed both this boy and the younger children will benefit by this reduction of the family load.\n\nVincent Gordon Hens, age 10, Grade 4. There is a good deal of drinking in this boy's home. An older brother is an incorrigible delinquent. A still older boy who was trained at Alberni is much above the family average in character and stability and it is felt this younger boy should have advantage of residential school training.\n\nNorman Hens, age 14, Grade 4. The attendance of this boy has been poor. Both teacher and parents complain that he is hard to manage. I do not believe he is a really bad boy, but is much bigger than other children in the school. Twenty-four hour discipline and more sports activity in residential school will I believe make a good man of this lad.\n\nMr. Caldwell has been good enough to allow places for these boys, who will leave here as soon as escort can be arranged.\n\nW.P.

Garrard,\nIndian Superintendent,\nPORT ALBERNI, B.C. Re. Discharges, December Quarter.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard,\n\nYou will note comment against several names of girls of High School standing:- \"See Letter\".\n\nIn September last six girls were admitted to this school from Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, to attend High School. Two of these had been attending school at Prince Rupert. Just why they were transferred to this school I do not know, except that perhaps their parents considered the supervision at Prince Rupert was not satisfactory. It was very evident that they had had a great amount of freedom there, more than it was possible to give them here at the residential school.\n\nThese girls set themselves out to be as much of a nuisance as possible, abusing every privilege, smoking, absenting themselves without leave and generally rebellious. Unfortunately, the new High School did not open until October 1st, but gave the girls a month or so after the school opened to settle down. They had completely unsettled several of the other High School girls and there was a general break-down of discipline that threatened to completely disrupt the school.\n\nI finally had to take the matter up with Mr. Findlay, Superintendent, Massett, and with Mr. Davey, and came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to discharge these girls and some others who had become unruly beyond the point of reform.\n\nI am pleased to say that the situation then improved and we are back to the normal good behaviour of the High School pupils.\n\nI regret having to take this action, and did not do so until it was unavoidable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 22, 1952.\n\nMr. N.W. Garrard,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\n\nYour file 25-2-877\nof December 27th\n\nThe Department approves the admission of the following children to the Alberni Indian Residential School:\n\nOlive Sarah Young\nMary Elizabeth Russ\nDolores Jones\nLaura Elizabeth Williams\nBertha Emma Stevens\nMargaret Anne Williams\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Admissions Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of December 27, 1951, the last Quarterly Return covering the period ending December 31, 1951 for the above named school indicates that the average enrolment for that quarter has been 239 pupils. The Principal has been urged by several of the Superintendents to admit about six additional pupils who are necessitous cases but the Principal will be discharging several children whose home conditions now permit them to return. It is anticipated that the average should remain around the 240 mark. The school can adequately handle this number.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from Social Worker's Report for the month of October, 1951.\n\nThese six girls were previously referred to in the August report when they came to Vancouver en route to Alberni School and separated themselves from the escort. They are all fairly mature high school girls with modern ideas. After being in the school approximately a month, Mr. Caldwell, principal of the school, felt that their behaviour was such that they could not remain at Alberni, and arrangements were made for their return home. Upon being met at the airport in Vancouver, three of the girls - Betty Russ, Dolores Jones and Ann Williams - refused to return home, and stated that they had made plans to remain in Vancouver. The parents of the girls were advised and the woman with whom the girls were staying was interviewed regarding the responsibility she was taking on without authority from the girls' parents. Although this woman appeared quite sincere and a responsible woman, and was already acquainted with one of the girls, Ann Williams, who had boarded with her previously, she was extremely hostile to the Indian Department owing to complaints by the girls about school. Her intention was to do \"a full scale investigation\" regarding the atrocious conditions permitted in a government supported school. Although it was felt that the girls' complaints were in some cases unfounded and others greatly magnified, it was felt advisable to satisfy this woman, Mrs. Smythe, rather than ignoring her attitude, therefore, a conference was held with worker, Mrs. Smythe, Major Davey and the girls to give them an opportunity of expressing their complaints. As a result of this interview, it was quite apparent that the girls' complaints were merely a symptom of rebellion against a discipline to which they had not been accustomed. By agreement with the parents, arrangements were made for the girls to remain with Mrs. Smythe and attend school in Vancouver. One girl was subsequently returned home at the request of her family.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT ALBERTA INSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1951.\n\n#### DECEMBER\n\n| No. | NAME | BAND | Grade | Remarks |\n|-----|------|------|-------|---------|\n| 0688 | Gladstone, Glenda | U-C | 2 | See letter attached. |\n| 0389 | Brown, Rosalinda | R-C | 5 | Attending day school. |\n| 0890 | Williams, Carol Ann | U-C | 2 | See letter attached. |\n\n#### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME | STATE OF EDUCATION | TRADE OR INDUSTRY TRAINED | REMARKS ON DISCHARGE |\n|-----|------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| 034 | Jones, Stella | High Sub.-Arts | See letter attached. |\n| 057 | Peters, Sally | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0184 | Joe, Nancy | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0185 | Cooker, Freda | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0183 | Charter, Shirley | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0179 | Watts, Juanita | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0192 | Matson, Freda | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0294 | Robinson, Alice | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n| 0365 | Wilkens, Bertha | Grade 10 | See letter attached. |\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to the Director's letter of February 29th regarding the three Olebar children, Mr. A.B. Caldwell, Principal is protesting the ruling.\n\nAttached I am forwarding you a copy of his letter. We are particularly interested in his remarks in the last four sentences.\n\nWe have contacted Mr. McCrimmon of the Status and Membership Division and he does not appear to have any information on the Olebar children, Mrs. Louisa Olebar or Louisa Campbell.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward to this office the complete family history indicating the ticket numbers.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl: MFT/HM\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nI have received a letter from the local Agency in connection with the admission here (at the request of the Indian Superintendent) of Lillian Alice Olebar, Elizabeth Ann Olebar, and Georgina Olebar, last September.\n\nThe father of these children, deceased, was Catholic. In the letter it is noted that the following ruling has been made: \"Applicant being Roman Catholic, children should attend Roman Catholic School\", and I am instructed to discharge these pupils at the end of this academic year.\n\nIn this case, while I believe the application stated that the children were Catholic, the Mother (who is the applicant) is, and always has been, Protestant. While her husband was alive the children had attended a day-school, and later at the expense of the Department. The applicant refused to send her children to the Catholic School and I accepted them on application being made here at Alberni.\n\nOn enquiry re the August children (2) who had been taken into the Catholic School after the mother (a Catholic) had placed them here for a year (these children had been baptised Protestant, the deceased father having been Protestant), I am told that these pupils can remain in the Catholic school as the mother is Catholic. I take no exception to this ruling, but should not the same ruling apply to the Olebar children, whose mother, the applicant, is Protestant? The mother is a Campbell, from Ahousat, and we have had all the Campbell children as pupils. Further, Mr. Garrard tells me that the mother was never legally married to her Catholic husband, now deceased.\n\nWould you please give this ruling further consideration in view of the above facts?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nMay 12, 1952.\n\nMr. F.E.

Caldwell,\nPrincipal\nAlberni Indian Res. School\nAlberni BC.\n\nRe: Admissions.\n\nTwo months ago, Mr. Alex Pootlase of Bella Coola gave me applications for his family to attend your school in Sept. His wife has deserted him and it is most difficult for him to attend to the children. As it is he has two under school age that will need attention. The mother is not a good influence on the children and as she appears here occasionally I agree that it would be better for these children to be away. The applications were to be forwarded now. They have been mislaid and cannot be found. The family are all at Rivers Inlet. Medical reports were satisfactory and I would appreciate your holding places for the following:\n\nDonald Pootlase Born 25 Nov. 1930\nDarryl Pootlase \" 12 June 1943\nLorraine V. Pootlase \" 22 June 1944\nLeonard A. Pootlase \" 19 June 1946\n\nNew applications will be prepared when we can get hold of the family which may not be until near time for them to leave for school. They have been attending Day School here.\n\nW.P. Pruden\nSuperintendent,\nBella Coola Indian Agency\nJuly 24, 1952.\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 15th regarding the admission of Phyllis Lydia Starr to the Alberni Indian Residential School, the Department approves her admission to this school on the understanding that her case will again be reviewed in January and this office advised whether she is progressing satisfactorily in her studies.\n\nIt is noted from the attached Report Card, which we are returning, that she is weak in several of the subjects and must repeat the mathematics course.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl:\nMFT/IMM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nAttached please find I.A.406 covering the application for Phyllis Starr, an orphan for admission to the Alberni Indian Residential School. I also attach her High School Report for the past term. She has been at the Booth Memorial High School on a tuition basis from the Department. My purpose in recommending her admission to Alberni Residential School is that she is unable to contribute to her own support at School and as she has no immediate relatives, she will in my opinion be better off at Alberni than at Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nHer admission to Alberni Residential School is recommended. I am advised by Mr. Caldwell that he is prepared to take the girl.\n\nIf approved, please return the School Report Card as it will be required at Alberni where she will attend the Junior-Senior High School, whilst living at the Indian Residential School.\n\nF.

He states that Mr. Johnson, the senior teacher, is qualified to give instruction along this line.\n\nPlease state the equipment, etc., that would be required to commence work on a moderate scale in the introduction of manual training at this school.

Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Cairns on the Alberni Residential School - dated Sept. 1st, 1926.\n\nCarpentry:\n\nI did hope that something would be done to introduce Manual Training into this school, especially as Mr. Johnson, the Senior Teacher, is qualified to give instruction along this line.\n\nMr. Agent Frost came to the school on my invitation during a part of the examination. He is very sympathetic towards the introduction of Manual training.\nFebruary 5, 1926.\n\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR R. H. CAIRNS ON THE ALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, DATED JANUARY 6 & 7, 1926.\n\n\"I discussed with both the Principal of the School and the Indian Agent, Mr. Frost, the matter of a Manual Training Class being organized. The old classroom would make an excellent manual training room. I would recommend that this matter be given attention. If the present teachers remain this school would soon be in good condition having a high standard.\"\nE.E.Brost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to submit for your consideration the following report on Manual Training at the Indian Residential School, Alberni for the year ending June 30th, 1928.\n\nDuring the year, 23 classes were held showing a total working period of 232\u00bd hours; all work was done in spare time.\n\nThe type of instruction was of two kinds. The smaller boys were given a course much the same as that given to first year boys in the Manual Training School at Vancouver\u2014simple models for benchwork and drawing; for the larger boys who had taken the beginners' course the previous year a more practical course was arranged; drawing was confined to rough sketches and designs or the drawing of patterns on brown paper.\n\nThe first project was the construction of three benches 6' x 3'; these were good strong carpenter workbenches giving ample room for two boys working at alternate corners. Designs for tool racks were submitted by the boys and the one considered the best was the one used. The below partial list of articles made will show the nature of the course.\n\nHospital tables 4', kitchen tables with drawer, cutting boards for kitchen use, pastry boards, axe handles, drawing boards and T squares, door handles, photo and picture frames, towel rollers, flower boxes, book shelves, toothbrush racks, benches for dining-room, bob-sleighs, wall brackets, tabouret tables, and teapot stands.\n\nThe boys have been praised for the quality of their work by visitors to the school; you, sir, have while on visits of inspection, seen the work.\n\nI much regret that during the last two months the classes have not been as regular as they might have been; I found the extra work very trying on my health; for this same reason the contemplated boat building was not commenced.\n\nAs I am leaving this school I must hereby tender my resignation as Instructor; I thank you very sincerely for your kindness and help.\n\nI am, yours respectfully,\n\nGeorge Johnson,\n\nReceived\n\nJUL 4 1928\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of April 20th, in which you suggest that Mr. R. Johnson, the present manual training teacher, should be continued at Alberni.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the W.M.S. and with the new principal, also with the Home Mission Convener of the Victoria Presbytery.\n\nI hope that we may be able to accede to your request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE:K\nOttawa, April 20th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the retirement of the Rev. Principal and staff at the Alberni Indian Residential School as on June 30th, next, I beg to inform you that our Indian Agent at Port Alberni, B.C., strongly recommends that, if possible, when the appointment of new teachers takes place, arrangements be made for the engagement of one qualified to carry on the instruction in manual training or for the re-instatement of Mr. R. Johnson, the present teacher. The Agent states that Mr. Johnson has proved himself a thoroughly satisfactory teacher and an efficient and enthusiastic manual training instructor. The Agent states that if this work is not continued the expense which the Department incurred in outfitting the manual training class will be wasted. He further states that this is admittedly one of the most essential courses of study for Indian boys on the West Coast, where there is no farming. For your information I might add that at the present time the Department is allowing Mr. Johnson 75 cents per hour for this instruction. He gives two evening lessons of two hours each and a Saturday morning instruction of three hours each week.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will draw this matter to the attention of the proper officers of the United Church for their consideration when arranging for the engagement of the services of a new staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the retirement of the Principal and staff at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and strongly recommending that the services of Mr. R. Johnson, the manual training instructor, be retained, or that arrangements be made for a teacher to carry on this work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring this matter to the authorities of the United Church, with the request that they give your recommendation favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No.159-1-1.of 2nd instant,instructing this office that the Rev,Principal and Staff of the Alberni Indian Residential School would be retired with effect from June,30th, or as soon as Mr,Curry leaves,and of the appointment of Rev,F,E,Britts to take over the duties.\n\nI respectfully beg to suggest to the Department that,if possible,when the appointment of new teachers takes place,that arrangements be made for one qualified to carry on the instruction in Manual Training recently commenced at that school,or the re-instatement of Mr,R,Johnson,the present teacher,as he has proved himself a thoroughly satisfactory teacher and an efficient and enthusiastic M.T.instructor,and failing the appointment of a qualified teacher to continue this most necessary training of male pupils,of this Agency,the outlay to which the Department has gone,will be wasted,and it will be greatly regretted if Manual Training at that school is discontinued,as it is admittedly one of the most essential courses of study for Indian boys on this Coast where there is no farming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa,Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEdward Elliott\nOttawa, October 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1895/26/1 of the 6th instant, with reference to manual training activity at the Alberni Indian Residential School. Your recommendation commends itself to the Department and you are authorized to expend the sum of approximately $175 for tools and materials. Competitive prices should be secured and, when you are submitting a certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm awarded the business, attach thereto a memo showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nIt would be more satisfactory to the Department if Mr. Johnson, who will give three lessons a week, is paid on the basis of so much per hour. The Department will allow 75\u00a2 per hour for this instruction, with the understanding that he should give two evening lessons of two hours each and a Saturday morning instruction of three hours. You should submit a certified account in favour of Mr. Johnson once each quarter, showing the number of hours of instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEdward E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.

I beg to advise the Department that the matter was taken up with Mr Inspector Cairns some months ago and suggestions were presented to Mr Commissioner Pritchburn for his perusal and remarks; the matter was also taken up with the Mission authorities connected with the school, all of whom declared themselves thoroughly in accord with the suggestion, but apparently the time was not then opportune for action to be taken.\n\nThe old class room, a separate building used for class room purposes prior to the building of the present school is available as a manual training workshop. It provides a room 30 feet by 22 by 10, is in good repair having been newly shingled and painted, is amply provided with windows and heating facilities, but would need to be wired for electric lighting if evening classes approved.\n\nMr Johnson the senior teacher is prepared to give three lessons each week, two evening lessons of two hours each and one lesson each Saturday morning of three hours, all lessons to be given in his own time after ordinary classroom work. The remuneration suggested, to be $200.00 per year.\n\nMr Johnson attended the Summer School of instruction in manual training during the past summer, to keep in touch with up to date methods.\n\nThere are 21 pupils at the Alberni Indian Residential School, between the ages of 13 and 18 years, these could be divided into 3 classes for instruction, each class could be given one lesson per week.\n\nShould the Department approve and provide for manual training for the pupils of the Alberni Indian Residential School, I respectfully beg to suggest that that training should take precedence to farming instruction and that the Principal be so advised.\n\nA list of tools and materials necessary for the instruction of a class of six and fitting up of the building, is enclosed herewith, with approximate cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nTools and materials.\n\n6 Jack planes, Stanley, $27.00.\n6 Back saws, 12\", $15.00.\n6 Marking gauges, $1.14.\n6 Rules, 2', $1.14.\n6 Chisels, Firmer, 1\", $6.00.\n6 \" \" \u00bd\", $4.80.\n6 \" \" \u00bc\", $4.50.\n6 Try squares, 6\", $3.66.\n6 Marking knives, $1.20.\n2 Ratchet braces, $9.40.\n6 Bits centre, 1\" \u00be\", 5/8\", \u00bd\" and \u00bc\", $2.50.\n3 Mallets, $1.50.\n3 Hammers claw, $4.20.\n1 Cross cut hand saw, $2.75.\n1 Rip hand saw, $2.96.\n1 Oil stone, 8\", $75.\n2 Screw drivers, 6\" and 8\", $1.25.\n1 Oil can, $25.\n1 Saw vise, $1.50.\n6 Files for hand saws, $75.\n1 Nailset, $15.\n1 Glue pot, $1.25.\n2 Files flat East, 12\" $1.00.\n4 Bench screws, $6.00.\nNails, Screws, Glue, etc $8.00.

Johnson, the manual training instructor at that school has this day informed me that he has resigned from the staff of the Alberni school and is leaving the City today.\n\nI beg to suggest for the consideration of the Department that the Missionary Society be asked to replace Mr. Johnson with a teacher that has manual training qualifications, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. C. Host\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for the information of the Department a brief report from Mr. George Johnson, on the work carried out by the manual training classes during the year ending June 30th, 1928.\n\nI respectfully wish to state that in my opinion it would be regrettable if manual training instruction was discontinued at this school now that such satisfactory progress has been made and provision made in the way of quarters and tools for the continuation of that class of instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd E. Frost\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 4th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Johnson on the work carried out by the manual training classes during the past academic year. We have noted the success achieved in this work and that satisfactory progress was made by the boys who took up the course. The Department is communicating with the church authorities, requesting them to obtain the services of a fully qualified manual training instructor to succeed Mr. Johnson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Johnson, manual training instructor at the Alberni Indian Residential School, has resigned from the staff. During the period he carried on manual training activity at this school, the boys who attended the classes made progress in the work. We are anxious that this type of instruction be continued, and I would request that you take this matter up with the W. M. S. of the United Church, with a view to having them obtain the services of a successor to Mr. Johnson and continue the manual training instruction at this school. When arrangements have been made, I shall be pleased to hear from you, giving the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher appointed to succeed Mr. Johnson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

As it is difficult to secure a male teacher with Manual Training course, we have secured Miss Hazel Guild for the class room and have been able to secure the services of Mr. Ross, for the manual training work. Mr. Ross is a practical carpenter and builder and has built launches and boats and taught this work to the Indians in Ahousaht Indian School.\n\nWe expect to lay out a good course for the boys to the next school term.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) F.E.

Mr. Ross also builds boats and launches and has been engaged in Indian work for a number of years.

Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the payment of the salary of a manual training instructor at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, as you were informed by official letter of October 25th, last, the Department is prepared to allow $40 per month towards the salary of the instructor, and this amount will be paid from the 1st of October, last. You should prepare an account in duplicate for the salary due the instructor for the three months' period ending December 31st, last, and again at the end of each quarter. These accounts you should hand to Mr. Agent Frost to be attached to proper voucher forms, certified by him and forwarded to the Department, when payment will be made. The accounts should be made in favour of yourself as Principal, and a cheque for the salary due each quarter will be sent you. Please forward as soon as possible to Mr. Agent Frost an account in duplicate for the amount of salary due for the December quarter.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Frost of the arrangement made for the payment of the salary of the manual training instructor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Barry, Inspector of Schools for B.C., dated June 10 & 11, 1931, regarding his inspection of the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 159-1-6.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING:\n\nIn addition to the work on the farm, the boys learn to make such things as clock cases, tables, book shelves, chairs, etc. Twenty boys are taking this course. They do not follow the proper Manual Training Course, as their teacher Mr. A. Glen, has no certificate. He is able to teach the boys rough carpenter's work; but could not instruct in the more scientific Manual Training. The shop at present in use is situated under the primary classroom. It is about 40 ft. by 25 ft. There are 4 double benches.\n\nI should like to see these boys taught real Manual Training. The difficulty seems to be that the City schools do not employ a Manual Training Instructor, who could put in some of his time with this class. The Principal seems to think that he would not be able to pay a trained teacher in this subject. I explained to him that the Department was very anxious that Manual Training should be taught in the Indian Residential Schools and were prepared to help in various ways.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.O. BOX 665\nVICTORIA, B.C. June 26, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am submitting herewith report of School Inspector Barry in regard to the Indian Residential School at Alberni.\n\nIn connection with the Inspector's remarks on manual training it will be noted he feels the pupils should receive more advanced teaching along this line than they are at present receiving from Mr. Glenn, who is really the farmer, but the Principal thinks he cannot afford to employ a manual training instructor. It will be noted in the staff list that Mr. Glenn is in receipt of a salary of $720.00 per annum with part board and lodging, which salary is to my mind little enough for the work he has to do on the farm. It will also be noted on the financial statement that this school is in receipt of a grant of $480.00 per annum for manual training. This amount apparently goes toward paying the salary of Mr. Glenn, who is described as besides being a farmer nothing more than a rough carpenter, who gives a certain amount of carpentry instruction to the pupils in the evenings, and as the case is now it really means that $480.00 which we pay towards the salary of a competent manual training teacher really goes to pay about 2/3rds of the salary of the farmer, the balance of $240.00 being paid by the school. Apparently what is really needed at this school is a disciplinarian for the boys and if one with a fair knowledge of manual training could be secured, the intentions of the Department in regard to manual training would be much more efficiently carried out than is now the case.\n\nAs regards the fire escape, your file 109-1-5 contains full information with regard to the same. It would however do no harm, and be of small expense, to have Inspector Barry's suggestion carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School, draws attention to the services being performed by Mr. A. Glenn, the manual training instructor. Mr. Barry's report was forwarded to the Department by Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, who stated as follows:\n\n\"It is felt by the Inspector that the pupils should receive more advanced teaching along this line than they are at present receiving from Mr. Glenn, who is really the farmer, but the Principal thinks he cannot afford to employ a manual training instructor. It will be noted in the staff list that Mr. Glenn is in receipt of a salary of $720 per annum with board and lodging, which salary is to my mind little enough for the work he has to do on the farm. It will also be noted on the financial statement that this school is in receipt of a grant of $450 per annum for manual training. This amount apparently goes toward paying the salary of Mr. Glenn, who is described as besides being a farmer nothing more than a rough carpenter, who gives a certain amount of carpentry instruction to the pupils in the evenings, and as the case is now it really means that $450 which goes towards the salary of a competent manual training teacher really goes to pay about 2/3rds of the salary of the farmer, the balance of $240 being paid by the school.

He speaks of Mr. Glenn as being a man of good personality and fine character, and thinks that, considering the youth of the boys, he is giving them all the manual training they are competent to receive. He also expresses appreciation of the quality of the work which is being done.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you as to whether or not you intend to insist upon the hiring of a special instructor for this work immediately. It does seem that in a year when both the Department of Indian Affairs and our Board are in such straightened financial circumstances, we might very well carry on for another year at least.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

You will find it enclosed herewith.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nEnc.\nAlberni, B.C.,\nJuly 22, 1931.\n\nDear Mrs. Spotton:\n\nYours of the 15th instant just to hand re Inspector Barry's recommendation for the appointment of a qualified manual training instructor. I am indeed pleased that this matter has been taken up through the general offices of the church. Allow me to go into the matter thoroughly that you may understand the situation and decide accordingly.\n\nMr. Glen is farm instructor and also manual training instructor. He had worked at carpenter work for six years before coming to the school. During the last year he has done some very good cabinet work with the boys in manual training. Re. Mr. Glen's salary as stated in the letter of the Department is $720.00. The type written statement of salaries I gave to Inspector Barry was farm and manual training instructors salary $720.00 with part board, free house, partly furnished, free water, free fuel and free electric light, approximately $1100. With all these things free the salary is worth $1200.00 - $480. Is the special grant for the manual training. The Department should not have said they were paying two thirds of his salary.\n\nThe statement that he gives a certain amount of carpentry instruction to the boys in the evening is not correct. Seven senior boys made up the class Wed- 7-9 P.M. Nine intermediate boys Friday 3-5 P.M. and nine junior boys Sat. 9-11 A.M. These classes were followed out regularly. As the work took the farm instructor away from farm work practically all of Friday afternoon and Saturday forenoon I do not think that the $480.00 more than paid for the service in this department. Three years ago I had a qualified manual training instructor as senior teacher. The Department paid him 75 cents per hour for any kind of work. The result was that my teacher went to Technical School in Vancouver for this work at $2000.00 per year. The city of Alberni with four class room teachers - Port Alberni with eight teachers and high school with four teachers are near us. Acting with Mr. Kyle, Supervisor of Technical Education in British Columbia, I tried to arrange with these school boards to get a teacher between us for this work but these boards would not on the ground that they could not afford it.\n\nIn a letter to the Department through Mrs. Clark, dated Oct. 14th 1921, I pointed out that we could not do much at Manual Training so along as the boys were allowed to leave school at 16 years. We have no boys over 16, our list shows only 6 above 14 years and one of these was drowned since holidays,\n8 boys 14 yrs. and 6 boys 13 yrs. If these big schools in the towns cannot afford a manual training teacher it hardly seems fair that the Department should ask us to get a Technical teacher for 19 young boys between 13 and 16 years. Of course, I would be pleased to have an extra man on the staff to take some of the work and responsibility off me but an extra man for this work means another $1200.00 or $1500.00 at least, from the church. In view of the present conditions in our church and country I am not prepared to recommend this expenditure.\n\nI engage a missionary staff who work for less and do work they would not otherwise do, because it is church work, we run the school with the strictest possible economy to keep down expense and yet even with this self sacrificing, hard work and econom, the per capita grant covers only about two thirds of the expense of the school. I paid to three qualified, trained in Manual Training teachers with three or four years experience total $2280.00 with board. Yet with this careful management and the church furnishing one third of the expense, the Inspector points out repairs to the large building and equipment and I am instructed to have these repairs made and pay for it out of school funds. This happened a day or two ago in a letter from Secretary McKenzie of the Indian Department instructing me to have the 84 horsepower heating boiler overhauled during holidays and pay for out of per capita grantor other school funds.\n\nI would be pleased to see a copy of the contract or agreement between the church and the Department about the management of these schools. If there is any expense for typing it I will pay for it.\n\nI shall be glad to hear the decision of your Board as to securing a qualified Manual training instructor. As there are none available, except carpenters, outside the cities of Victoria or Vancouver, and the work would be for only a few hours each week, it is not easy to reorganize our work to use such a member of staff unless he works at something else as well as Manual training.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd.

Original on File 159-1-6.\n\nVocational Training:\n\nIn addition to the ordinary house work, the girls learn to mend, darn, make dresses, make boys' shirts, knit, crochet, etc. The embroidery and fancy needlework are very good indeed. The girls do not make bread at this school. They take it in turns to learn to cook.\n\nIn addition to work on the farm, the boys are doing some sort of Manual Training under a new teacher, Mr. G. Lundine. This man is reported to be a cabinet maker. He takes three classes per week, two lessons being given on Fridays and one on Saturdays. Each lesson lasts for two hours. There are 19 boys in the Manual Training Classes, which had only just been started under the present teacher when I inspected the school. The teacher is paid $5.00 per week. I understand that the farm instructor, who is leaving at the end of the school year, is also being paid for Manual Training which he is not doing. The Principal was not able to explain this to my satisfaction but I gathered that he had given the Farm Instructor something of a contract which he could not get out of.\n\nSix drawing boards are required for the use of the class. These should be paid for by the school in my opinion, in view of the fact that the Department makes a larger grant to the school than is being used for suitable Manual Training. The Manual Training shop in use is situated under the Primary schoolroom. It is about 40 feet by 25 feet, and there are 4 double benches.\n\nI should like to see a proper Manual Training instructor employed at this school. I have been in touch with the Director of Manual Training and Technical Instruction for the Province of B.C. and am informed that there are available a number of partly trained M.T. instructors, who are also teachers and belong to the United Church of Canada. One of these men could easily be selected who would be able to teach the senior grades, and instruct in Manual Training. If a girl is preferred as teacher, such a man might well take the position of Boys' supervisor, and be responsible for the boys when out of school and not with any other teacher or instructor.\n\nI am not satisfied with the new arrangement for the Manual Training on the grounds that the teacher does not hold as far as I can learn any sort of certificate and does not appear to me to have much idea of what is required, and also because the money paid by the Department does not appear to be used for the purposes intended and specified under the heading Manual Training Instructor.\n\nI would ask the Department not to do anything in the matter till I have the opportunity of again inspecting this school in September of this year. I am so much dissatisfied with the general administration of the school that I particularly wish for the opportunity of again inspecting before making a definite recommendation to the Department. I have had a short conference with the Rev. Arthur Barner with regard to the school, and have informed the Principal that, had it not been for the fact that the school was so much cleaner than had been the case on the occasion of my inspection last year, I would not have hesitated to ask the Department to request the United Church of Canada to make a change in the administration of the school, by the appointment of a new Principal.\nIndian Residential School\nRev.

MacKenzie,\nSec'y Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of Feb. 28th #159-1-11, I beg to report as follows:\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, Principal\u2014Graduate in Arts and Theology and ordained minister of former Presbyterian Church, now of the United Church, 63 years of age. Has charge of the religious teaching and services of the school, supervisor of all departments, management of the farm, recruiting and discharging of the children and full responsibility for all matters of discipline, finance, reports to the Department and all office work.\n\nMrs. Pitts, Matron in charge is 60 years of age. Graduate of Alexandria and Oshawa Colleges and gold medallist in music. Has supervision of all the ladies' departments of work and instruction. Teaches instrumental music to about 30 children individually and singing to all collectively, and jointly with the principal looks after the health, nursing of the children and religious services. Gives out all supplies of food, shoes, clothing and material for laundry, sewing room and kitchen.\n\nMr. Lawrence Wallace, Senior Classroom Teacher, age 21. Second year university and normal training.\n\nMiss Laura Lane, Intermediate Teacher, age 30. Grade XII (1st class) normal training.\n\nMiss Ethel Pitts, Primary Teacher, age 27. Grade XII (1st class) normal training, music, and primary certificates.\n\nMiss Grace Lewman, Seamstress, age 28. Grade XI and normal training. Teaches needlework, dressmaking etc.\n\nMiss Clara McLeod, age 45. Stenographer and clerk. Teaches laundry work very efficiently.\n\nMiss Blanche Muir, age 32, very efficient cook and manager in the kitchen. Teaches the girls, cooking and baking and all housework in that department.\n\nMiss Ruby Clark, Boys Matron, age 28. Has some training in nursing. Looks after the boys side of the building, boys' clothing, etc.\n\nMr. Ernest Muir, Farm Instructor, age 31. Raised on a farm. Had 2 years in Manitoba Agricultural College, Winnipeg. Trained in military aeroplane flying. Teaches the boys the farm work, milking, care of stock etc.\nMr. Gus Lundine, Manual Training Instructor is a ship-carpenter and a good practical teacher and gives the boys very careful instruction in all kinds of carpenter work, making diagrams of the work. The boys furnished a very creditable collection for Vancouver Pacific Exhibition last August. 21 boys divided in classes of 7 each take 2 hours per week each in this class.\n\nIt is difficult to specify how many hours per week each pupil has been engaged in each department and to say definitely what each has accomplished as all these have to be varied according to the age, health and strength of the child. The pupils of 14 years and over except those in the entrance class are working in these departments for the half day. They are changed every two months from one department to another so that each child gets training in all the departments. All children vary in what they accomplish. Our boys in the first years when they stay in till 18 years of age are able to handle a team, milk, care for stock and do nearly any kind of farm work that a boy can be expected to do. They have also a pretty good knowledge of handling tools for carpenter work. Of course tradesmen are not turned out at 18 years whether white or Indian. The girls at 18 have a pretty thorough knowledge of the work of cooking, baking, dressmaking, knitting, needlework and general housework and are very efficient at it. When we need extra labor we always engage ex-pupils and find them more satisfactory than any white help we could get.\n\nOne of the difficulties in managing an Indian School is to find a staff who know the work in the departments better than the senior pupils.\n\nThese towns of Alberni and Port Alberni have a large school population in public and high schools. A great many of the parents have said to me that the children of the Indian School get a much better all-round training than their children do.\n\nUnder general remarks I have only to say that the children are bright and teachable, interested in their work and do their work remarkably well. They do this even knowing that when they go out from school the things we have taught them they will have no chance to use.\n\nDo the results justify the expenditure? At the time they go out of school, yes, decidedly yes. Ten years later it may be doubtful. The fault is not theirs. It is not the school course that needs change so much as the conditions to which they go when they leave school.\n\nWe endeavour to teach the pupils farming, gardening, milking and anything that would be useful to them after they leave school. It is difficult to teach the girls milking, gardening and outdoor work as it requires special clothes just for this, extra supervision, cows go dry quickly with too many youngsters milking.\n\nI think the present school course is well adapted to develop the Indian child to the position where he or she can fit into our present civilization. Two factors, not generally taken into account work against the best results. First, the Indian thinks he is disloyal to his own race if he is too much like a \"white man,\" and second, the \"white man\" won't give the Indian a job or position on the same terms and standing as if he were white.

It would appear that, at that time, you had made provision at the Alberni Residential School for instruction in elementary agriculture, carpentry work, etc. I notice, also, that year, you sent in a very creditable collection to the Vancouver Pacific Exhibition.\n\nI am anxious to know just what progress has been made since then and if you have any information at your disposal, in respect to the progress made by pupils who received this training, during the years following their departure from school. I am aware, of course, that the facilities at your disposal are far from perfect. Any information, however, you can let me have along the lines suggested would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. E.

We appreciate very much the assistance the Department has given us in establishing this school and making the transfer from Coqualeetza, and I assure you of my earnest desire to co-operate in every way in forwarding the plans of the Department for Indian education upon the West Coast.\n\nIn the rush of work which has been upon me, I am not sure that I have thanked you for your letter of August 6th last. File:159-1-11. In this letter arrangements were made for the salaries in the Manual Training Department, for an instructor at $75 a month, an assistant instructor at $40 a month and a boat builder at $50 a month.\n\nAs much of the time until Christmas will be used in construction work, it may not be possible for us to use an assistant Manual Training instructor. I have been wondering if for this school year, the Department would allow me to substitute for this assistant Manual Training instructor, the salary of a baker. I have a fully qualified baker who will take charge of the equipment in our bakehouse. A many of these boys, and all of our present sixteen year old boys, will be employed in the fishing industry and most of them on seine boats. The knowledge of baking and cooking is very essential. I did not want to convert this $40 a month without having taken the matter up with you. As I have just said, I am quite sure that it would round out the technical instruction and the navigation given to these boys, if they could at the end of the year, be able to take the position of cook on a seine boat. I would undertake to see that these sixteen year old boys got a real grounding in baking bread, etc.\n\nIt would be understood of course, that this would not set a precedent for next year, but that the matter of this grant for an Assistant Manual Training instructor should be taken up before the beginning of the next school year. From the standpoint of school finance, when so many extra expenses have to be absorbed due to the need for work and equipment which can not wait to be submitted to Ottawa, and owing to the increased...\nprices which we have to pay for commodities, it would be of decided assistance in carrying on for the next eight months.\n\nAgain thanking you for your interest and assistance in all these things, and awaiting your valued reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 9, 1940\nALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nAlberni, B.C.,\nDecember 31st, 1940\n\nRECEIVED FROM - Alberni Residential School, ---------------\n\nTHE SUM OF - Two Hundred and Twenty-five -----00/100 DOLLARS\nON ACCOUNT OF - Manual Training Services for the quarter\nended December 31st, 1940.\n\n$225.00\n\nSigned:\n[Signature]\nManual Training Instructor\n\nI hereby certify that the above account is correct, the\nservices faithfully rendered, and it is a fair and just charge\non the Government of Canada.\n\nSigned:\n[Signature]\nR.C.

While I appreciate that a baking course for the older boys who will engage in the fishing industry is very essential at the same time it is impossible for us to allow any amount toward the baker's salary.\n\nMy understanding of your letter is that the baker employed on the school staff to do the cooking for the whole institution would give special lessons to the boys who are to engage in the fishing industry. If we allowed any amount toward his salary it would mean that we would be assisting in paying the salary of a member of the staff whom it is necessary to employ and as you are aware the salaries of necessary members of the staff are paid by the school management from per capita grants or other receipts. With this in mind I feel that you will readily realize that it is not possible to favourably consider your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. R.C.

The dormitories, classrooms, dining rooms and kitchens were all in first class order. Basement, classroom hallways and toilets were not very clean and were untidy.\n\nThe enamel ware (cups, saucers and plates) have not been replaced and are very unsanitary and unsightly.\n\nThe health of the school is fair. Seven cases of trachoma were found, one of jaundice and a few of tonsillitis. All trachoma cases were pupils from other agencies, and none from the West Coast.\n\nGood progress is being made in classrooms. The pupils are attentive, well behaved, and well clothed. Good substantial meals are being served.\n\nGrounds, outhouses, boiler room and laundry were all in good order. Fire extinguishers have been provided.\n\nThe girls are being well taught in needlework and domestic science, but not much evidence of vocational training for boys was noted. Some were getting training in dairying and agriculture, which is of little or no value to West Coast Indians, and others were doing rough carpentry.\n\nP. B.

You may arrange for the purchase of the tools required and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. I attach the quotations which you received. When forwarding the voucher covering the cost of these tools you should attach your purchase order. An encumbrance will be secured when the account reaches Ottawa.\n\nI am also in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a further list of tools required for the vocational training classes at this school. As the end of the fiscal year is rapidly approaching and there are some funds still available authority is granted for you to purchase additional tools for the vocational training classes at a cost not exceeding $495.00. The account should be dated previous to March 31, 1941, and when forwarding it for payment you should attach a copy of your purchase order. An encumbrance will be secured when the account reaches here. You understand, of course, that the purchase order for the tools to the value of $495.00 should be separate from the one for the tools purchased for the boat building class. I am also enclosing the quotations which you received on this additional equipment.\n\nIt is our intention to direct another letter to you under separate cover in connection with the vocational training at the Alberni School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

While the total amount of the voucher is $404.25 there is included an amount of $225.00 for the services of the manual training instructors. Authority has already been given for the engagement of these men but it would be preferred in future if a separate voucher were issued in favour of the Principal covering their services. This voucher should read -- \"To allowance toward services of vocational training instructors at Alberni Residential School for the month of ..........\".\n\nMy particular reason in returning the voucher to you is that it includes two expenditures, one covering the cost of goods purchased from the Alberni Pacific Lumber Co., at a cost of $57.79, and the other an account of A. McDonald & Sons for $121.46. While the Principal's letter explains quite fully what use was made of the material purchased and I have no doubt that the building mentioned was required, at the same time our files do not show that any authority was given for the purchase of the items covered by these two accounts. As you will easily realize, it is impossible for us to keep control of expenditures if Rev. Mr. Scott assumes the power to purchase over $175.00 worth of material without any authority.\n\nIf you agree with the statements made by Rev. Mr. Scott in his letter of January 20, it would\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nbe appreciated if you would issue purchase orders in favour of the two firms mentioned above. At the same time you should instruct Mr. Ashbridge to the effect that a separate voucher should be forwarded in future for the allowance for the salaries of the vocational training instructors. At the same time you should point out definitely both to Mr. Ashbridge and Rev. Mr. Scott that in future unauthorized purchases at the Alberni Residential School cannot be paid by this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSome years ago, Mr. Jones of Ahousaht had a boat built, which he called the \"Dawn.\" It seems to have been in some way tied up with the School. The Woman's Missionary Society transferred it to Alberni, where it is in the care of Captain Scott, who will use it in connection with his work and also in helping the boys learn navigation. He has not been able to get registration of the boat for lack of certain documents, the first of which is a Bill of Sale to The United Church of Canada from the builder. This boat was built by Mr. Jones when he was at the Ahousaht School, and the suggestion is that the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs should give a Bill of Sale to The United Church of Canada for the nominal sum of One Dollar. Could you arrange that this be done? If so, I should be glad to get this document as soon as possible, as Captain Scott cannot run the boat until he gets registration, and naturally the customs officers are very strict in these days of war.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 25th,\n1942.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe former Ahousaht Indian Residential School was located at Ahousaht on the west coast of Vancouver Island, approximately 75 miles north of Port Alberni.\n\nThe Ahousaht Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire in January, 1940, and instead of replacing it we erected a new Indian residential school at Alberni. This Indian residential school is managed for us by the United Church of Canada.\n\nSome years ago pupils of the Ahousaht School, under the direction of the Principal, built a boat which was called \"The Dawn\". The Principal of the Alberni School, Rev. R.C. Scott, advises that this boat has been transferred to the Alberni Residential School but he has been unable to get registration of it owing to lack of certain documents.\n\nIn view of the fact that both the Ahousaht School and the Alberni School are Government institutions and both of them have been managed for us by the United Church of Canada, there does not appear to be any reason why Rev. Mr. Scott should experience any difficulty in registering the boat.\n\nWith the above facts in mind, I should appreciate your advising what procedure he should follow to obtain registration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Commissioner of Customs,\nDepartment of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of August 18th, File:159-1-11, enclosing copy of a letter which you received from the Reverend George Dorey, D.D., with regard to the registration of the M.V. Dawn.\n\nI beg to say that I am forwarding today by Air Mail the Bill of Sale which you sent me a few days ago. I quite understand the difficulty in which all parties have been placed by the failure of the Reverend Mr. Jones to complete the registration of the boat at the time it was built. Just why he did not do it, I do not of course know. At this late date we are in difficulties.\n\nAs the materials were given by the Department to the former Ahousaht School for a Manual Training project and the engine donated to that school, it would seem that the Department would be right in giving the Bill of Sale to the United Church. The project was completed by the Reverend Mr. Jones at the former Ahousaht school in due course. The boat was much too large to be used by the missionary of the United Church so the Women's Missionary Society agreed to transfer it to this school, to allow the Principal of the school to keep in touch with the villages on Alberni Canal and Barclay Sound from which pupils come.\nMP.R.A.Hoey.  \nAugust 27, 1942\n\nIn my opinion it would greatly heighten the contribution made by the school if this way contact could be kept with these villages.\n\nI trust this will assist you in clearing up this matter. With all good wishes I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6435, file 877-11, part 2)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 18, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Dr. Dorey. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would send forward to Dr. Dorey the Bill of Sale referred to in his communication.\n\nI must express regret that so much delay has occurred in the registration of this boat. I frankly become disgusted from time to time with the amount of documents that have to be signed and the amount of correspondence that has to take place in such comparatively simple transactions as the transfer of a small boat from one school to another. I have learned from experience, however, that it is exceedingly difficult to focus responsibility in such cases. Red tape with all its attendant evils has existed for a long time in this country and is likely to continue long after you and I have made our contribution and passed on. It does seem to me regrettable however, that it should be so much in evidence in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

You no doubt have heard of \"carrying coals to Newcastle,\" which is what you have done, because we had all this information here. What we want is the Bill of Sale, which we sent to you, completed and returned to us, so that we can continue the process of getting this vessel registered. If you will be good enough to get whoever interviewed the Director of Marine Services to concentrate on getting the Bill of Sale from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to The United Church of Canada, we can carry on.\n\nI note you say that you are returning \"the document which was forwarded for signature as it cannot be completed until the other documents are signed.\" I cannot understand this at all. We cannot complete the other documents until we have the Bill of Sale.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\nCopy sent to Dr. Dorey\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 10, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nDr. Dorey has forwarded to us a form in connection with the motor vessel \"Dawn\". One of our officials interviewed the Director of Marine Services, Department of Transport, and was informed that the following documents had to be prepared and forwarded before any action could be taken:\n\n1. Builder's Certificate, signed by the manual training instructor under whose supervision the vessel was built, or, if this is not available, a statutory declaration stating why it cannot be produced and naming the builder and for whom the vessel was built;\n\n2.

I wished to consult Mr. Doucet before answering this letter and he has been away on inspection trips making it impossible to do so before the present time.\n\nBritish Columbia has not been organized in the same manner as the other provinces as regards the Manual Training. Manual Training has been organized for quite some time in your province due to the British Columbia special grant. Supervision of this work was left in the hands of Inspector Barry and on his retirement in care of the Provincial Inspector. For the time being, the Department does not wish to interfere in this set-up.

We would appreciate receiving this material, and any helps for the other courses which may have been prepared as guides for instructors.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA.E.

The office clerical assistance changed also at the same time and the matter was neglected by the office. While keeping in close personal touch with the really excellent work that has been done by the manual instructor, the matter of the neglect to make monthly reports was not brought to my attention until I received your letter.\n\nFortunately, the instructor, who has had teaching experience among the Indians of Northern Manitoba, is very methodical, has been following the complete Department course, adding thereto some of the High School manual instruction, and has kept complete records of the grading and progress of all pupils. Thus we have been able to compile a complete report since he took over. I may say the work was inspected by Dr. Morrison, Provincial School Inspector, at the end of last term.\n\nThe Manual Training rooms, I understand, were originally under the class-room building that was burned in 1941. The present accommodation, in the boat-house, is very inadequate, and boys of all age groups could not be accommodated. The new class-rooms will be constructed this year and we hope that provision is being made for vocational instruction in the building.\n\nMuch work has been done on the school grounds by the Manual classes. Old buildings have been moved to more convenient locations, swings, teetors, and horizontal bars have been erected. During last fall, the harvesting of about 100 tons of potatoes was in charge of the instructor and his classes. We hope to extend the scope of the classes when the new class-rooms are built, and have in mind the instruction in boat-building that was a feature of Coqualeetza.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOffice Phone 232\nRes.

Some defects were found in the building and water system, and these have been dealt with and reported upon.

Some defects were found in the building and water system, and these have been dealt with and reported upon. Vocational training is disappointing, and from a practical viewpoint is non-existent in so far as benefit to Coastal Indians is concerned.\nSEE VOL 3\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6435)\n\nFile 877-10, part 7\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Admissions & Discharges - General Administration. 1946 - 1949\n\nFile 877-10, part 8\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Admissions & Discharges. 1950 - 1952\n\nFile 877-11, part 1\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Vocational Training - Accounts. 1926 - 1937\n\nFile 877-11, part 2\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Vocational Training - Accounts. 1937 - 1946\n\nFile 877-11, part 3\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Vocational Training - Accounts. 1946 - 1949\n\nFile 877-11, part 4\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Vocational Training. 1949 - 1950\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nPrincipal\nA.

Payment of such salaries has always been made from the amount received by the school for per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nOwing to the fact that we have a special Vote, we are able to assist in paying the salary of the manual training teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. E. Caldwell,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni,\nBritish Columbia.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nPrincipal\nA. E. CALDWELL\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nJune 28th 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nMany thanks for your letter of May 21st re the salary of the vocational instructor. I have delayed answering it until now as I have been undecided as to just what to do. I think I have finally solved the problem. Mr. Loewen wishes to keep in the employment of the school, but he intends to get married and we have no accommodation on the ordinary staff for married people. Mr. Loewen, in addition to being a good manual instructor, sports organizer, etc., is, as I have occasion to know at Norway House, an excellent Farm Instructor.\n\nAs you may know, I took over this school under poor financial circumstances. There were several causes, mainly the fact that pupils were not returned to school at the beginning of the term, particularly the local pupils, many being away in the States berry and hop picking. This financial loss, amounting to upwards of $2000.00 a year, I eliminated at once by excluding (after sufficient warning) some 30 tardy pupils, admitting in their place some of the many waiting applications for entrance. This effectively blocked that leakage, and although I have since re-admitted many of the then excluded pupils, I have had no recurrence of tardiness.\n\nAnother leakage was the so-called \"farm\" operations, and this has taken longer to overcome. Our farm operations were laborious, working about 15 acres of indifferent land with three horses and a very poor outfit of machinery. About 6 or 7 cows were being milked. All feed was purchased (and this is expensive in B.C.) and no pasture was obtainable. Our best potato crop was 7\u00bd tons in 1946, and we use approximately 40 tons a year. It required two farmers to work this land and look after the cattle, and these were a legacy left from the previous administration. Their methods were poor, but, during the war time, they had to be put up with. Last year I rented more land and borrowed a tractor for a time, with the result that farm operations were an asset instead of a liability as previously. Our potato crop last year was about 70 tons, although part of this was lost by a blight that affected all B.C. potato crops. However, we had enough potatoes to do the school, which, considering that the price last winter was between $60.00 and $80.00\nPer ton, certainly went far to offset the increasing costs of operation of the school owing to constantly rising prices. However, we still had the handicap of poor farming methods, in both machinery and personal. Recently, by the sale of a right-of-way through the Church lands, conveying water power to a new pulp mill that is being built, the school came into possession of a sum of cash, the opportunity occurring at the same time to purchase a Farm-all tractor, with tandem disk, power mower, plow, spring-tooth cultivator and harrows and a farm trailer, all in almost new condition. I have also rented a number of small pieces of land, about 20 acres in all, such as constitute the majority of small farms in this valley, and these are in crop. These small farms can be made to produce abundantly with efficient farming methods. We are milking 11 cows with a production of over 8000 lbs of milk during the month of May.\n\nThe opportunity now arises to get rid of the two farmers, each married and occupying cottages on the school property. The whole operation, with the tractor machinery, can be undertaken by Mr. Loewen. Neither of the farmers employed could by any means be termed instructors, nor had they any facility in handling boys. Mr. Loewen can instruct them in tractor operation and in small farming methods, such as they can engage in on many of the reserves. Not all the parents of our pupils are fishermen. At first Mr. Loewen offered to combine the manual training work with the farming operations, but this I would consider detrimental to both operations, so I wish to employ another manual instructor, who can be assisted and supervised by Mr. Loewen. Mr. Loewen has lately undertaken the building of small boats, the first of which, 20 feet long, he has almost completed. He will continue this in his spare time. If, and when he marries, he can occupy one of the farmers' cottages.\n\nI think not, I think it necessary to increase the vocational training grant under these circumstances. This may be rather surprising to you after your very kind offer, but I have another matter that is bothering me much more than that of the vocational instructor. It is the matter of teachers' salaries.\n\nI note in Major Mackey's evidence before the Joint Committee that he made the statement that only 24 Indian children attended High School. I presume that he meant that these 24 attended Public High School although it is not clear that this was understood by the Committee. I see by the Schedule attached to minutes 5, where Major Mackey made this statement, that, under the column \"Grade 9\", which is junior High School, and which might even include grades above 9, for the returns do not provide for the notation of grades higher than nine, there are 56 High School students in the Residential Schools and 15 in the day schools. There are 18 in the Residential Schools of B.C., of which the Alberni School had 8 last term. Next term, allowing for discharges, we will have 14, 1 in grade 11, 5 in grade 10, 8 in grade 9.\nThe Committee also seems to have been given the impression that the pupils get little, or no, encouragement from the parents to take higher education, or to make use of it when it is taken. That is definitely not so among our pupils and parents. I have had letters from parents requesting pupil continuance in High School, and the pupils, without exception, wish to continue. Most of them have an object in view, some nursing, some business course, some teaching and some technical work. Their outlook, and the support given them by the parents, is most encouraging.\n\nNow as to the teachers. I have one unqualified, but very good teacher taking grades one and two, a class of 65, on half-day system, of course. One University Graduate teacher taking grades 3 and 4 (a poor teacher, too long in an Indian day school) with a class of 78, on half-day. One returned air-force man teaching Grades 5 and 6, with a class of 47, on half-day, and one teacher teaching grades 7, 8, 9 and 10, a class of 36, with grades 7 and 8 half-day and grades 9 and 10 full day. The teachers up to grade 6 are being paid $60.00 per month, with board and room, estimated in B.C. at $40.00, amounting to $1000.00 for the two months. One is unqualified, one qualified in B.C. and one qualified in Saskatchewan. The minimum teachers salary for these teachers would be between $1200.00 and $1500.00 at the present B.C. scale. Two of these teachers are leaving, the poor one with the B.C. qualifications wishing to remain. I doubt if she could retain a position in the public schools.\n\nI have resorted to the scheme, since coming here, of getting teachers from the prairies, where the teaching salaries have been lower, and where B.C. has provided an attraction. Naturally, their term is only of one year, or less, until something better opens for them in B.C. By this means I have kept on until now, with excellent success, especially as regards the teacher in the senior grades, but now salaries on the prairies are better and that source will not be so productive of teachers for us.\n\nI have left the matter of the senior teacher until the last. The man I have had this term came from Saskatchewan and has been exceptionally good. The grade 10 pupil averaged 75% in June Exams. Grade 9 averaged 76.0%, Grade 8 averaged 75%, Grade 7 averaged 67%. This man was not a High School teacher and had to work almost night and day to get the results he did... from pupils who had only had the benefit of previous half-day tuition, up to grade 6. His salary was $60.00 with board and room, an equivalent of $1100.00 for the 10 months. The minimum salary for an elementary school teacher in B.C. with the five years teaching experience this man had is $1550.00. He is not remaining. He is going back to Saskatchewan for further study.\nAs you know, what is called the Cameron system of enlarged and well organized school districts, directly under the Department of Education, is now operative in B.C. Teachers are scarce. If we are to get qualified teachers at all, they will be the rejects of the Public Schools, and these are not good enough to maintain the standard we have set in this school and a standard that the Indian parents now expect from us. Even if we had sufficient finances to compete with the Public School system, there are still disadvantages to overcome. The Indian School teacher is handicapped by the loss of all recognition by the Provincial Department of Education. Supernumerary is forfeited and Inspector's reports have no value in establishing seniority.... and the provincial scale of salaries is graduated by seniority, by the number of years engaged in teaching. However, we are prepared to compete with this handicap, providing we can offer equivalent salaries.\n\nIt seems almost beyond question that the Joint Committee will do something to remedy this matter; but the ramifications of the whole Indian problem which this Committee are so extensive that I cannot see any findings being brought down, or remedial measures applied, for at least two years. In the meantime what are we going to do? It seems a shame to build up a fair academic status, as compared to Public School standards, and then see it deteriorate because of lack of teachers of ability.\n\nI am not at this time suggesting a greater number of teachers, although certainly the Committee will amend a situation where four teachers are teaching 230 children. I am content to continue with this handicap until the whole system is changed. But this matter of teachers' salaries is one of immediate urgency in B.C. I am sure that other schools (Indian) who must draw their teaching staff from the Provincial teaching profession, are in much the same position. It does not seem to me to be competent to expect the Churches to make up the deficiency and subsidize Indian education, nor do the Churches appear willing to do this further than is now done in some schools.\n\nCan anything be done about it? The situation is entirely due to the advance in salaries in the teaching profession, perhaps also in some measure to the greatly increased consciousness of the Indian parent in adequate education, and also to the scarcity of teachers. It cannot be laid to inefficient administration of Indian School finances.\n\nI regret having to go into so much detail to explain the situation, which, I think, is possibly more acute under the B.C. educational conditions than elsewhere. I trust that I have not imposed too great a burden on your time and patience. I would be glad, however, to know just what is the Department's reaction to this condition.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School\n\nIt is recommended that authority be granted for the purchase of only those items checked in red on the attached Requisition.\n\nIt is felt that the teaching of metal work should be left until the woodwork shop is equipped and consequently the purchase of tools for the proposed metal work course is not recommended. The pupils at this School will find the woodwork of greater use. The purchase of the power tools should be deferred until after the visit in September of Mr. Doucet of the Welfare and Training Branch.\n\nThe cost of the items recommended is $310.00, f.o.b.

We are not certain on what date he commenced duties but you may submit a voucher for the amount due the school from the date on which he started until March 31st. Subsequent vouchers for as long as Mr. Stanton remains should be forwarded at the end of each quarter.\n\nThe vouchers for this service should be issued in favour of the Principal of the Alberni Residential School and should read as follows:\n\n\"Allowance towards salary of manual training instructor at the Alberni Residential School for the period .... to ..... at $75. a month\"\n\nBernard F.

J.

Doucet,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nI am enclosing the form of application for manual training instructor, completed. May I say that Mr. Stanton is a very satisfactory instructor. He was engaged after several men had been tried. While not a technical school trainee, he has had the practical experience, has the faculty of teaching, and the application of the basic course work to the construction of useful articles.\n\nHis classes now are installing a system of lockers in the school...... for which, I may say, we were required to purchase the material out of school funds.\n\nI hope we may be able to keep Mr. Stanton. It is practically impossible to get a professionally trained man in B.C. They are in great demand in the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nI will send the \"division of woodwork\" list with the Feb.

Vancouver, B.C.\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Mr. A. E. Caldwell, Principal\nSchool: Alberni Indian Residential School\nPost Office (nearest): Alberni, B.C.\nExpress Office (nearest): Port Alberni, B.C.\nProvince: British Columbia\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6435, file 877-11, part 3)\n\nFORM NO. LA-418\nR. 9777\nMemorandum -\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet\n\nI have reviewed the requisition for leathercraft supplies submitted by the Principal of the Alberni Residential School through the Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nAs no unit prices have been indicated which might be compared with other known quotations, it is difficult to determine whether the amount of $225 may be considered reasonable for the quantity of supplies listed.\n\nAs far as the quantities of tools desired are concerned, the several estimates appear quite reasonable. However, with no particulars as to the type of program being organized at Alberni, it is difficult to offer an opinion as to whether the quantity of expendable materials is reasonable or not. The total suggested appears to be large for a group just commencing its first efforts. e.g. 288 key cases seems to be a lot for a start.\n\nThe major item might well prove to be the type of tooling leather ordered. It is not clear whether the first twelve pieces are for full sides (averaging 18 to 20 feet each) or for the narrower, belly leather strips (averaging 3\u00bd to 4 feet each). If for full sides, the estimate of $225 would be low, while if for belly leather, the estimate might be an outside figure and including all other items listed.\n\nAs in the former case I reviewed (Eskasoni) I feel some effort should be made by such groups to make their own leather lacing, since the purchasing of leather lacing can become quite an expensive matter.\n\nHad we more details as to the type of program being planned and more exact descriptions of the quality of leather being ordered, we could come much closer to appraising this particular requisition.\n\nIn any case, the results of the program at the Alberni Residential School will be determined ultimately only by the qualifications of the instructor in leathercraft at Alberni. The amount of supplies asked for could be made to work out reasonably, or expensively - according to the ability of the instructor to make best use of materials desired.\n\nDeane H Russell\nRequisition for School Material\n\nHandicraft Supplies (cont.)\n\nDate: October 4, 1946\n\nFor Alberni Indian Residential School West Coast Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well-known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| Cat.No. | ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|---------|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n|         | Gloves-Glove Patterns | -ladies' size-9\u00bd |                     |                 |                  |         |\n|         | Celluloid-20\"x 50\" | 6 sheets        |                     |                 |                  |         |\n|         | Tracing Parchment-18\"x 24\" | 2 dozen | SHELLS             |                 |                  |         |\n|         | 2 packages of each of 25-cent shells | | | | | |\n|         | 2 dozen of each of shells sold by the dozen | | | | | |\n|         | 2 dozen of each of plastic backs (hearts, diamonds etc.) | | | | | |\n|         | 1 gross of Brooch pins-1\" | | | | | |\n|         | 1 gross of Earwires-nickel-plated screw type | | | | | |\n|         | Lacquers-Mother of Pearl(2 oz.)-6 bottles | | | | | |\n|         | Cement-Duco household-6 tubes | | | | | |\n| B-314 | Tweezers-1 dozen | | | | | |\n|         | Shellcraft Publications-Shellcraft Jewelry-loopy | | | | | |\n|         | 24 feet Copper Foil for Picture work | | | | | |\n|         | Felt for Felicraft: 1 Yard each, Wine, Green, Brown, White, Black, Gold and Yellow. | | | | | |\n|         | Clay, Self-setting, Cream...2 x 5lb Cans. | | | | | |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Mr. A.E.

It is obvious that this course is avocational rather than vocational and is designed to serve to overcome the lack of recreational facilities at this school. It will also be noted that there has been a considerable increase in the number of pupils doing this work.\n\nInspector Davey is opposed to the marketing of products by this school as they would compete that the products of our hospitals which are at present experiencing some difficulty in the marketing of their products.\n\nIt will be noted the cost of these supplies and equipment is approximately $1.40 per pupil.\n\nR.F. Davey\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenclos.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nDec. 31st 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVANCOUVER, B.C. Re. Handicraft Supplies.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nI have yours of Dec. 22nd re the requisition for Handicraft supplies. This has been replied to in the enclosed letter by Mr. Maize, who is in charge of class-room and extra curricular activities.\n\nI note that Mr. Maize states that the teachers interesting themselves in this work are not technically trained. While this is so, these teachers have been taking this work for the past year and some of them have been purchasing their own materials from the Bedford Fine Leathers Co., Vancouver. This has been, of course, for their own use.\n\nThe teachers taking this work are Mr. Maize, Miss Bone, Miss Kennedy, Miss Zehner and Mr. Avery.\n\nMiss Zehner takes three periods weekly with her special class. Mr. Maize takes four hours weekly in evening work with the Tuxis Group and the Girls' Hobby Group. Mr. Avery takes two hours evening work weekly with the Boys' Hobby Group. Miss Bone and Miss Kennedy take two hours weekly evening work with the Canadian Girls in Training Group.\n\nI may say that this programme is arranged to keep the pupils occupationally busy in the evenings and is made necessary owing to the lack of indoor recreational facilities at this school.\n\nWhile we have not as yet disposed of any of the work of the pupils, there have been many requests for purchase of leather work, such as slippers, that we have had on exhibition.\n\nI feel that Department supply of this material, or as much as the Department is disposed to supply, isn't warranted when the teachers are willing to put their time into the use of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. Caldwell:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated Dec. 22nd regarding our recent requisition for handicraft supplies dated October 4th.\n\nSince the beginning of the term we have started a Practical Arts classroom for backward pupils where they receive instructions in the basic subjects and a good deal of handiwork. This room is made up of 20 pupils all engaged in leather work and we plan on starting shell work. The teacher is not a qualified handicraft instructor but is interested in the work and spends a good deal of time preparing her lessons, in said work.\n\nIn the senior class rooms grades six and seven receive practical art instruction one period a week in leather work.\n\nThe Grades 5,9,10, and 11 pupils have a hobby class each Tuesday evening. Leather work is again emphasized with shell work also planned for them.\n\nOur C.G.I.T., Tuxis and Trail Ranger groups also meet once a week with leather work being emphasized. We would like to introduce shell work here too.\n\nOur supplies up to last September kept us going until the end of October. Since then we have been finishing off projects as much as possible.\n\nOur instructors have not taken courses in handicraft work but are keenly interested and spend a lot of time working up projects.\n\nThe numbers of boys and girls involved in the various groups are as follows:\n\n|                | Girls | Boys |\n|----------------|-------|------|\n| Practical Arts room | 8     | 12   |\n| Senior Classroom Gr. 6 | 16    | 7    |\n| Gr. 7           | 18    | 11   |\n| Hobby class Gr. 5,9,10,11 | 8     | 7    |\n| C.G.I.T.        | 42    |      |\n| Tuxis           |       | 25   |\n| Trail Rangers   |       | 25   |\n| Sub. Total      | 92 girls | 87 boys |\n| Total           | 179 Pupils |\n\nLast year we had C.G.I.T. and Tuxis doing all the handicraft work and their numbers are much the same this year thus there would be an increase of 112 pupils doing handicraft work this term.\n\nThe reason for larger amounts of some materials was to increase our production of finished articles for sale purposes under the auspices of the various groups and thus make up a fund with which to purchase our own supplies.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Meigs\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nThe requisition for $225 worth of tools and material for leatherwork at the Alberni Indian Residential School has been considered.\n\nTools have been purchased for this school during the past few years. We have no indication as to whether these tools are still on hand or if not what has happened to them.\n\nMay we presume that there is an increase in the number of pupils taking this course. How much time during the week is allotted to this work? Apparently the boys and the girls are enrolled in the leather course.\n\nThonging may become an expensive item in leatherwork unless it is made by the pupils themselves.\n\nHas a survey been made by Inspector Davey of the needs of the school in this kind of work; of the number of pupils participating and of the future utility of this training?\n\nIs the present Instructor sufficiently qualified to teach this subject efficiently?\n\nThe above information will allow us to consider these questions and enable us to reach a decision.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. A.E.V. Eastwood had the position during September and October. He was a good instructor but left at the beginning of November on account of his wife's nervous sickness. His wife was also on the staff. Since then I have had Ainslie L. Avery from the University of Saskatoon, who has been satisfactory, although not of course a qualified Technical Instructor.\n\nThe returns will, in future be made monthly, as we have got back to routine again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEnc: Manual and Sewing reports for Sep., Oct., Nov., and Dec., 1948.\nWest Coast Agency,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\n25 January 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the enclosed School Monthly Reports and Voucher for Manual Training Grant for the Alberni Indian Residential School, Mr. A.E.

CALDWELL\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\nOctober 24th 1949.\n\nMr. N.W. Carrard,\nIndian Superintendent,\nPORT ALBERNI, B.C.\n\nRe: Manual Training Salary Grant.\n\nDear Mr. Carrard,\n\nIt was with some surprise that I received your advice that the Department, in a letter from Mr. Phelin, had refused to sanction the salary grant for the Manual Training Instructor for the months of July and August, on the grounds that payment for these months was \"not customary\".\n\nDuring my term at this school the Manual Instructor has always been engaged on a twelve month salary basis. The salary being paid is $100.00 per month, with board, room and laundry. The Instructor is permitted two weeks holiday with paid salary, if his service has been of the full duration of the term.\n\nWe have had perhaps more turn-over of personnel in this position than any other in the school, for the simple reason that the salary is not sufficient for a fully competent practical man and in several instances other employment has been offered them at a salary that we cannot afford to pay. The basic salary of a Technical Arts Instructor in B.C. is around $200.00 per year of ten months. Qualified men are almost impossible to obtain as instanced by the fact that the Public High School has been unable to engage one this term.\n\nHowever, the Manual Training Instructor's duties in this school are not confined to class-room teaching. All the maintenance labour is done by the Instructor and the Engineer. The months of July and August are employed by the Manual Instructor in painting mainly. In the last five years I would say that the labour thus employed, if it had been done by the Department on contract with Union Tradesmen, would amount to some thousands of dollars.\n\nThe last Instructor, Mr. Cameron, left in August to take a position with the Department of Forestry of the Province. The present incumbent, Mr. Winston Morris, has been here since the latter part of August, and his education and teaching ability seem to be of a high standard. His engagement will, of course,\nMr. Garrard 2,\n\nbe subject to the approval of his ability by Mr. Davey at his school inspection in November.\n\nMay I request, in view of these facts, that the decision of the Department be reconsidered and that the grant be continued for the full twelve months as customary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\n(c/c to Mr. Davey.)\n\nI am enclosing, completed, the form of Application for Appointment which you received from the Department.\nApplication for Appointment as Manual Training Teacher\n\n1.

Garrard,\nIndian Superintendent,\nPORT ALBERNI, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 28th advising that, as a result of my letter to you of Oct. 24th, protesting against the withholding of the manual grant for the months of July and August, the grant has been continued for the full twelve months at $100.00 per month.\n\nI wish to thank the Department for their reconsideration of this matter. I was under the impression that the facts were not fully before them and that it only required the explanation of the terms of engagement, and the amount of additional labour undertaken by the Manual Instructor, with the consequent great saving in labour maintenance costs to the Department.\n\nHowever, the grant has now been reduced from the former $125.00 per month for 12 months to $100.00. I feel that this is either an error or a misconception, caused by my mention in the letter of Oct. 24th of the salary of the Instructor as being $100.00 per month plus board, room and laundry. Our estimate of the cost of this accommodation is $40.00 per month, which is considered low for B.C. Therefore the school is expending $140.00 for the Department grant of $125.00 per month.\n\nI may say that the auditor's report covering the 15 months up to the end of August 1949 shows a yearly expenditure of $300.00 per capita, with a Government revenue of $274.00, making a deficit of $26.00 per capita per year. We have been carrying on at this school by virtue of a Bank overdraft, with the expectation that the excessive cost of living may come down and the school operate within the present income. The tendency, however, is still for the cost of living to increase rather than decrease. The burden of finance continues to be the greatest concern of the Principal, a burden, which, I say advisedly, it would seem to be impossible to carry much longer. The Department must be aware of these conditions and I cannot think that they would seek to add to the burden by a reduction of $25.00 a month in the Manual Grant.\n\nOne alternative to maintaining the present operational cost is to reduce the salaries of all staff members. Obviously this would result in the engagement of incompetent staff and a breakdown in behaviour would follow. Another alternative is to reduce the diet, resulting in dissatisfied pupils and antagonistic parents, apart from impairment of pupil health. Either, or both, these measures would immediately bring discredit on the school and on the Government, and would, for the sake of economy beyond the point of necessity, defeat the whole purpose for which this school is kept in operation.\n\nI have endeavoured, beyond the limits of my resources, to co-operate with the Department in maintaining the highest possible standard in every department connected with the school. I might instance just one particular case. In co-operation with the Nutrition Division of the Department of Health, in the interests of their research project, we have, at the Division's request, increased our pupil milk consumption, since last September, to an amount aggregating $3741.00 per year, about double our former expense for this item. Although a recompense has\nbeen suggested by the Nutrition Division authority to offset the increased school expense occasioned by our co-operation in their project, no such recompense has been forthcoming.\n\nCan the Department advise me just how I am to maintain this set standard, not only with inadequate current funds, but with the added handicap of reduced grants such as the Manual grant in question? I must conclude that this reduction has been occasioned, as I have said, by an error of conception. May I be assured, therefore, that the Manual Grant will remain as formerly?\n\nI am enclosing an application form from a Manual Training Instructor, Mr. Paul Pollock, recently engaged. The former incumbent was discharged by me for incompetence and staff incompatibility. The new man gives promise of being a competent and efficient staff member. The change in this position has not affected in any way the continuity of the manual training classes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nApplication for Position as Manual Training Teacher.\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n1.

We have reviewed our file and we do not appear to have any definite information regarding the date on which he started, and as a consequence, we are unable to decide if there is any balance due the school.\n\nPlease let us hear from you in this matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 6th 1950.\n\nMr. N.W.

Correspondence with the Department reestablished the grant at $125.00 per month as formerly. On Jan. 14th 1950 I received the cheque for November ($125.00). On March 8th, I received cheque for $125.00, being noted as the arrears from June to October, as above. Also on this date I received cheque for $125.00 for the month of January 1950. February has not yet been received.\n\nNow due, including March, is $375.00, grant for the months of December 1949, and Feb. and March 1950.\n\nWill you please request the Department to check and confirm this?\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n| Recruit- | Pupil's Name | Grade | Operations Learned | Time Devoted |\n|---------|--------------|-------|--------------------|-------------|\n| 2888    | Dixon, Alvin  | 13    | 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 3008    | Runcht, Lester | 15    | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2774    | Burden, Earl   | 13    | 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 | 12 hours |\n| 2756    | Cate, William   | 14    | 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 | 12 hours |\n| 164     | Horsley, Sunny  | 15    | 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 3005    | New, Robert     | 14    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 3397    | White, Mark     | 14    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2971    | Hamilton, Eddie | 14    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2990    | Hamilton, Wallace | 15    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2775    | Johnson, Bruce  | 15    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2770    | Aziz, Robert    | 15    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2445    | Alexander, Leonard | 16    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 1888    | Charlie, Benny   | 14    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2834    | Fred, Gerald    | 14    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 1999    | Grant, Arthur   | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2662    | Larson, James   | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2665    | Kuldee, Kenny   | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2114    | Gibbs, George    | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2116    | Spence, David    | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2199    | Thompson, Elmer  | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 2995    | Gordon, Tommy    | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 1072    | Thompson, Johnny | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n| 1772    | Thompson, Johnny | 11    | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 | 12 hours |\n\nInstructor: [Signature]\n\nSchool: Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your File 159/2-33\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, and it is noted that Mr. Pollock began duties as manual training instructor on November 1st, 1949. Owing to Mr. Pollock's qualifications, we promised to allow the school an amount of $125.00 a month towards his salary, effective from the date on which he began duties (see official letter of December 13th, 1949).\n\nOur records show that we have paid the Alberni Residential School at the rate of $125.00 a month for the manual training teacher's services since November 1st, 1949. Under these circumstances, we are unable to agree with Mr. Caldwell that there is any balance due the school.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n| Record No. | Pupil's Name          | Activity       | Sewing Room | Hours Devoted |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|\n| 0274       | Rumehitt, Alice      |                |             |               |\n| 0112       | Gerasia Betty        |                |             |               |\n| 0114       | Anna Maria           |                |             |               |\n| 0263       | Anna Elizabeth       |                |             |               |\n| 0890       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0192       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0187       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0170       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0116       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0995       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0850       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0248       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0254       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0182       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0085       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0019       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0216       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0270       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0186       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0200       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0225       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0276       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0326       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n| 0234       | Anna Louise          |                |             |               |\n\nIndian Affairs.

McDonald & Sons, Port Alberni, B.C. .......... 308.25\nJ.H. Good & Co. Ltd., Port Alberni, B.C. ......... 375.00\n\nIn referring to the tenders submitted by Carter's Hardware, Principal Scott comments as follows:\n\n\"I do not know what plans Carter's Hardware may have for laying this linoleum. They did not do a very good job on a small piece which they laid in our kitchen. They may, however, be making special arrangements if they were awarded this contract. A. McDonald & Sons however, have a fully qualified linoleum layer. I have given Carter's Hardware most of our month to month purchases which amount to considerable, and I really feel that A. McDonald & Sons would give us a satisfactory job.\"\n\nAs A. McDonald & Sons have a qualified man for such work, whose services would be available to the school when required, I feel that it would be safer to place the order with this firm.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nNovember 14, 1940.\n\nI have no information as to what firms at Alberni and Port Alberni are on the approved list and would, therefore, appreciate your instructions as to the placing of the order.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 159-1-12.\n\nI have received your letter of October 22nd regarding the new ironer at the Alberni Indian Residential School which was damaged while being moved into the school.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to advise that Mr. Arnall, Engineer, Dominion Department of Public Works, examined this machine during a recent inspection of the machinery, boilers and equipment at the school, and reported in part as follows:\n\n\"The ironer is badly damaged. Some parts are broken.\"\n\nIn view of this, I consider that my recommendation of October 4th to the Department to the effect that the Company be required to remove the damaged machine and install a complete new ironer in the school be approved.\n\nAccounts for this machinery have not been received at this office to date but when and if they are submitted here I could not, under existing circumstances, pass same for payment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter received from Reverend Principal Scott requesting authority to ship at Departmental expense a carload of hay and one of straw from Coqualeetza school to Alberni.\n\nIt will be observed that the cost to the Department would be approximately $237.20, being made up of $167.20 freight, and $70 labor, loading and unloading charges.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I consider the application reasonable and would recommend same for favorable consideration.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/GR\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlberni, November 9th, 1940.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nI am having to buy straw at $16 a ton and have ample supply in the old barn at Coqualeetza. However, it is only worth about $3.50 a ton in the barn so you can see I cannot sell over there and buy here to any advantage. The same is true of hay. Hay is worth $23 a ton over here, but there is practically no sale for it at Sardis even at $10 a ton. There may be some hay moving later on, but the hay crop was one of the best we have ever had over there.\n\nIt costs $2.50 a ton to bale hay and $2.75 a ton to bale the straw. In addition there would be the labor of five men to assist with the baling. I am informed that it takes eight hours to bale 20 tons, which would make a car load. If the Department would be good enough to pay the freight charges inclusive of cartage both at Sardis and Alberni, I would pay the baling and labor costs for one car load of straw and one car load of hay. This would put me through for this school year, and I would undertake to provide after that wholly at school expense. The freight charges for hay and straw are approximately .38\u00a2 per hundredweight from Sardis to Alberni in car load lots, with a minimum of 22,000 lbs. this would mean a freight charge of approximately $83.60. As the car load of vegetables was loaded in about eight hours, I am sure this hay and straw would be loaded in less time, so that an estimate of $15 at Sardis and $20 at Alberni, where the haul is somewhat longer, would cover the cartage on each car.\nMajor D.M. MacKay\n\nNovember 9, 1940.\n\nThe baling and labor costs would be $60 on hay and $65 on straw on 20 tons, which is about all you can get in a car.\n\nI feel that seeing we had all this fodder ready for use during the winter, and that we have been moved over here in co-operation with the Department, that to some extent the Department should share in the extra costs involved. At the same time, I appreciate more than I can tell you, the generous treatment that we have received up to now. I would be glad if you felt you could recommend this final expenditure for moving charges, to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nRe: 16 mm. Sound Projector\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nConditions in this new school, I find are somewhat different to what they were at Sardis. We are more cut off from the outside than we were there and closer to the Reserves. This creates problems that are somewhat difficult and causes a greater need for improving our equipment to the place where it will meet the need of the children in as great a measure as possible.\n\nNot only do the children, from the West Coast especially, lack in general knowledge of and appreciation of the world outside, but because of what amounts almost to suspicion on the part of parents as to what is going on in the school, I feel that we ought to be able to help these children and at the same time show the parents in a way that they will understand, something of the real effort that is being made by the Department, to meet the needs of their children.\n\nI find there is a disposition on the part of some staff members to assist in securing a Sound Projector for the school. Being isolated as we are, I am sure the Indians on the Reserve close at hand would help either directly or indirectly if allowed to attend a showing of the films. In doing this I would of course be careful not to incur any criticism on the part of Moving Picture theatres, and I do not see that there would be any real danger of the same.\n\nThere is a Filmo Sound Machine, 138-R-Bell & Howell's, with a 12\" speaker. It has a 750 Watt Lamp and guaranteed two serviceings for the first year, the same as a new machine. It has been used simply as a Demonstration machine and is the same kind as has been installed in various military and air camps. For instance the one at Aliford Bay in the Queen Charlotte Islands is exactly the same and cost $576.00 new. The machine I have referred to can be had for $350.00.\n\nI feel that it is an excellent buy and if the Department could assist, we may be able to handle it for instance if a grant of $125 could be made for a down payment. I feel sure that we could get the balance in the ways just mentioned above.\n\nWhile we can get along with the small Silent Projector which we have, it does not afford access to anything like the same number of films, educational and otherwise, as can be found in the Sound Libraries.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nNovember 6th, 1940\n\nI realize that the Department is spending a lot of money on this school, and I shall abide by your decision, whatever it may be, but as stated above, I feel it would be a real advantage.

For your information I attach copy of letter dated the 21st instant which has been forwarded by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nToday I am in receipt, from Indian Agent Ashbridge, of voucher 354 for $4706.80 in favour of the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company. In view of the condition of the ironer, as reported in your letter of the 16th instant, I was much surprised to see this voucher. I note that on the account covering the cost of the ironer there is the following notation:\n\n\"This is to certify that the above Flat Work Ironer was supplied for use Alberni Indian Residential School. It was damaged in being taken down to the laundry room, and has been repaired and installed. So far it is working satisfactorily, but any necessary adjustment must be made between the Beaver Laundry Company and the Department. The 12 months guarantee is attached.\"\n\nIn view of the request that has been made to the Company by the Purchasing Agent it will be impossible to consider payment of this account until we are definitely informed that the Company intends to replace the ironer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Is it possible to obtain this type of equipment in British Columbia?

We will defer replying until you have had an opportunity of securing Commissioner MacKay's advice in the matter. If he is satisfied with the alternative now suggested by the company we have no objection to sanctioning the new arrangement. However, if Commissioner MacKay is not satisfied with the company's suggested alternative of supplying new frames instead of a complete new ironer, it is not our intention to retract from the position indicated in the second paragraph of my letter of the 21st ultimo to the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company, in which we stated that a complete new 66\" Ironer must be furnished and that payment of their account would be deferred until this was supplied and installed to the complete satisfaction of Commissioner MacKay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\n\nToronto, December 11, 1940.\n\nThe Purchasing Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nRe: Your File 34590-15-20-1\n\nPlease accept our thanks for yours of November 21st, copy of which was forwarded to us by our Mr. LeCours of Ottawa, and wish to advise that we immediately wrote our Vancouver Office regarding the Alberni Indian Residential School. On the last report we had from our Mr. Fraser at Vancouver he reported that the machines were all working satisfactorily, and can assure you that we certainly regret the breakage of the frame on the Flatwork Ironer. We note that Mr. Fraser has had the breakage welded on these frames, and in that way the School is not held up for their laundry work.\n\nWe note contents of your letter in which you wish us to supply you with a complete new Ironer on this contract. We do not think this would be necessary as it is only the frames of the Ironer that are broken, and all that would have to be replaced is the frames. We can assure you that when this Ironer left our factory, it was in first class condition, and that the breakage occurred due to getting same into the School at Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nWe believe that the department will be fair enough to us in this matter, and we will ship them two new frames for this machine, and same will be installed on said Ironer at Alberni Indian Residential School, Port Alberni, B.C., and we trust that as soon as this replacement is made it will be satisfactory to the department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY COMPANY LIMITED,\n\n(sgd) C.D.Edgar,\nVice-President and Sales Director.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant you may purchase the injector for the boiler at the Alberni Residential School. It is noted that this can be secured for $35.00. When forwarding the voucher you should mark it -- \"Charge to Vote 99\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to the report of Mr. T.J. Arnall, S.P.E. Engineer, Department of Public Works, dated October 19, 1940, in respect to boiler No. 44912 in use by the new Indian Residential School at Alberni, B.C., in which he states that a one inch injector should be installed, the cost of which would be approximately $35.00.\n\nIn view of this recommendation, I would request authority to have this installation made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to my letter of November 22nd, 1940, regarding an application by the Reverend Principal for rugs to the amount of $226.30 for the staff sitting room and staff members' rooms of the school, I beg to advise that I have received a copy of Purchase Order No.4640, dated November 30, which was no doubt intended to cover purchase of these rugs from Waterhouse and Greene, of Port Alberni. I would point out, however, that the total shown on my copy of the Order is $835.50 instead of $226.30. No doubt it was intended that 15 Peterminster rugs, 36\" x 63\", @ $10.20 each, would be supplied instead of one only, and that the necessary adjustment will be made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Ashbridge:\n\nRe Materials for lockers and cupboards in Boys and Girls' Dormitories.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith estimates for materials for the above purposes. Under date of November 26th last, Major MacKay wrote me asking me to send you such information in order that prices might be secured from local firms. I enclose a copy of his letter.\n\nI would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to the fact that this amount is much less than the amount which I suggested to him in the conversation referred to above. In fact it will be only about one half the cost.\n\nThis is due to my having yielded, at last, to the repeated requests of the supervisors on Boys' and Girls' sides, for some accommodation for storing bed linen etc. in the dormitories. This equipment, sheets, pillow cases etc. was simply left piled on the floors in the dormitories and was not only unsightly but unsanitary also.\n\nConsequently, I told our Board that he might order sufficient lumber for lockers in each dormitory. I had in mind only a cupboard to cover each of two windows, just over the radiators. This would accomplish two things, namely, provide a covering for the windows which are now left one whether on Boys' and Girls' sides, and at the same time afford a place for storing bedding which would be always dry.\n\nOwing to a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \"Cupboards\", Mr Huddleston ordered enough lumber to build continuous cupboards between these windows as well as to merely cover them. Thus we have now on hand sufficient lumber to build all the cupboards on the Girls' side, and need only that for the Boys' side as set forth in the enclosed estimates.\n\nWhile I realize that this amount ought rightly to have come before the Department before being purchased, still, it was the result of a misunderstanding between me and Mr Huddleston. I proposed to buy only sufficient material for linen cupboards, and would have been quite prepared to have paid for it out of School funds. As it has turned out, I am now faced with payment of a bill for a much larger amount, as shown on the enclosed statements from Bloedel Stewart and Welch.\n\nConsequently, I would be glad if you would forward this account to the Department at the same time as you send in the estimates for materials to complete the cupboards.\n\nI might point out that the estimate for hardware is for the complete sets of cupboards on both Boys' and Girls' sides as none was purchased previously.\n\nI may say that I have asked for prices from both the large lumber firms, Bloedel Stewart and Welch, and the Alberni-Pacific Co., but have not found any difference in their prices. Hence I did not hesitate to give the above partial order to the former.\n\nIf the remaining materials were ordered from the A.P.L.Co., it would give them each an equal amount of account.\n\nI enclose herewith one copy of the Bloedel Stewart and Welch invoice to be forwarded to the Department. I shall hold the other three copies until it is known whether the Department will be good enough to authorize its use.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This fireman was purchased by the Principal from school funds and on receipt of Major MacKay's letter Mr. Phelan phoned to Mr. Bask and ascertained that the fireman would not be required at Coqualeetza.\n\nI, therefore, instructed Indian Commissioner MacKay to arrange for its transfer to the Alberni Residential School where the Principal states it can be used.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would advise your officials in British Columbia that this Branch approves the iron fireman being sent from Coqualeetza to Alberni.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

It has been in operation for the past six weeks, and nothing has developed due to original damage.\n\nMr. Bacon, manager of the Alberni Machinery Works, very kindly accompanied us to give his expert opinion and it was mutually agreed that it would be unwise to interfere with the machine by replacing the frames, and that the Department would be justified in accepting it as it now stands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 18th instant regarding refinishing of the class room floors of the new Alberni Residential School, in which it was stated that trouble was being experienced with the linoleum in the school basement, I enclose herewith a further letter, dated the 21st instant, received from the Reverend Principal in regard to the linoleum.\n\nIt would appear that either the linoleum was laid down before the concrete was dry or it is being kept moist by capillary migration of moisture from the ground, the latter being more probable. It is evident that the condition will continue unless remedied by a waterproofing application to the floor, with destruction of the linoleum or any replacement.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with the Tremco engineer who has seen the floor and I enclose herewith his recommendation and a quotation estimating the cost at $715 for waterproofing and relaying the linoleum, with an additional $62 if that in the recreation rooms is treated with protective \"Penetrem\" floor finish.\n\nIt is very apparent that steps will have to be taken to remedy the condition and I would recommend that this be done by the \"Tremco\" crew, who are experts in this work, at the time the floors in the school rooms are refinished if that work is authorized.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Reverend Principal is expected in Vancouver during the week ending February 1st, and it would be appreciated if you would kindly air mail your reply if the work can be undertaken.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nJan. 21st, 1941.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe Lino in School Basement Playrooms Etc.\n\nI have already reported that the lino in the boys' and girls' playrooms is overlapping in places and in danger of being broken and destroyed. I also said that I intended having a local man in, a competent linoleum layer, to do what could be done to save this expensive equipment.\n\nHe came in yesterday and cut the edges of some of the strips thus allowing them to expand in the hope that bulges etc would straighten out.\n\nHe informs me, however, that all this lino on basement floors will, in the end, and likely by the end of this school year, become rotten and spoiled owing to dampness coming through the cement floors upon which it is laid. He turned up the edges of the lino in several places and it showed distinct signs of mould and it smelled badly.\n\nHe recommends that it be taken up and the lino stood on end in rolls and the floors be washed well, and allowed to dry. The only thing is that it will take some months for this to be accomplished.\n\nEven though it will be decidedly inconvenient, and will not help to make the boys happy to have to live in a playroom with rough cement floor after having the linoleum, I feel the steps recommended ought to be taken.\n\nI am not asking that you authorize financial outlay in this regard at the moment. I am paying for this man's work out of school funds as it is \"repair\" work, but I would appreciate your advice on following the suggestion given by the above man. Further, if the floors are allowed to dry out, perhaps some top dressing could be used on them which could be put on ourselves which would lessen, if not remove entirely, the danger of dampness from the floors attacking the lino. As this should have been done in the first place, I feel it might be a fair charge on the Department.\nAs I have already said, I am not writing for the purpose of asking financial assistance in this matter, but on the other hand, feel that any step as suggested is on such a scale, and of such importance, and is a right-about-face on the action of the Department in putting this lino down on floors of cement below ground level, that I feel I ought to have your consent or otherwise before taking this action.\n\nThe only alternative is to allow the flooring to remain as it is, cut the edges from time to time to keep it as flat as possible, and run the risk of having it rot, and then of having a bigger job on our hands in the end to recondition the floors.\n\nIf you think it best to allow the lino to remain as at present, then I shall do so, but it seems the part of wisdom to do anything we can to lengthen its life and justify the outlay already taken in putting it down.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"R.C. Scott\"\n\nPRINCIPAL\nJanuary 25, 1941\n\nMajor Mackay, Commissioner\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nFederal Building\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nCopy to Mr. J. Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRegarding linoleum to floors in basement and further to recent correspondence and prices given you for part of the work required, we now understand that dampness is now appearing in all floors in basement which are covered with linoleum. The prices recently given you do not include the play rooms and we are, therefore, giving you amended estimate as follows.\n\nTake up all linoleum in basement, clean off any cement adhering either to the floor or linoleum, and clean concrete floor thoroughly.\n\nSupply and apply Tremco 122 Linoleum Waterproofing, and replace linoleum in waterproof cement.\n\nThis applies to the following areas:\n- Junior boys' recreation room, 31' x 31'6\"\n- Senior boys' recreation room, 31'6\" x 31'6\"\n- Junior girls' recreation room, 21'6\" x 31'6\"\n- Hall, 6'6\" x 21'6\"\n- Staff & students' dining rooms, 34' x 62'\n- Hall, 6' x 9'\n- Domestic science room, 10' x 12'\n\nTotal - 4859 ft.\n\nPrice of the above work is seven hundred and fifteen dollars ($715.00).\n\nThen, as per conversation with you, we would recommend that the linoleum areas which have not been previously waxed should be cleaned and given two coats Tremco Penetrem floor finish. The areas to which this would apply would be as follows:\n- Junior boys' recreation room\n- Senior boys' recreation room\n- Junior girls' recreation room\n\nApproximate total - 2750 ft.\n\nOur estimate for applying Penetrem finish as above would be eighty-two dollars ($82.00), making a total altogether of seven hundred and ninety-seven dollars ($797.00).\nIt is understood that this work would be done at the same time as the sending and application of Penetrem to the Day School.\n\nYours very truly\n\nFRED M. BEATTY (TRESCO-WESTERN) LTD.\n\nPER Fred M. Beatty\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter dated November 14th received from the Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of the Alberni Residential School, with reference to Assembly Hall and Classroom floors, from which it will be observed that after a very short period of use the surface of the floors commenced to scuff up which may have been due in part to the unsatisfactory finish.\n\nThe floors have been examined by Fred M. Beatty Ltd. who do practically all the refinishing of the local city schools and their report is enclosed, indicating that resanding would be necessary before application of any new finish, for which they estimate the cost would be $285. Owing to the fact that these floors will undergo progressive and rapid deterioration, I would recommend that authority be granted to have them refinished and treated with Tremco Penetrem floor finish, which appears to be the most satisfactory method of treatment for school floors.\n\nIt will be observed that the quotation includes attaching linoleum treads to the stairways and landing areas to the classrooms, together with metal nosings for same.\n\nIt has also been found that the method of laying linoleum in the basement of the school has been very unsatisfactory due to dampness of the concrete slab and the linoleum not only came loose but blistered and puckered, as reported in the enclosed Tremco report. It has also broken through in places and will soon be a total loss. The remedy is outlined in the Tremco report, the cost being estimated by them as between $250 and $300, which includes cleaning the floors, damp-proofing and linoleum underlayment installation, and cementing linoleum in waterproof cement. It will be necessary to get the exact quotation at the time the floors are being refinished if that work is authorized.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nJanuary 15, 1941.\n\nIt is suggested by the Tremco expert that the supply of a rubber mat of the type made from tire outer casings would obviate the pupils carrying a quantity of water into the classrooms on their shoes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlberni B.C. January 6/41.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe Class Room Floors\n\nWhen Mr. Leigh of the Fred M. Beatty Co., was out to look over the above floors just before Christmas he gave me to understand that it was going to be possible for his Company to do these floors. He told me not to have them scrubbed as it was likely that the men would be out the day after Christmas to begin work, and if the floors were not properly dry it would hold up the work. He also said that they would have to be sanded anyway, and that scrubbing would be unnecessary.\n\nThe time for re-opening class rooms has come, and we are today again at work there. I left the laying of the linoleum on the main corridor and the steps until after the class room floors would be done as the metal \"bullnosing\" for the steps was to have come when the men came to do the work.\n\nI think that it would not be satisfactory to lay the linoleum on the steps without the safeguard given by this bullnosing.\n\nIf it is not going to be possible to have the class room floors done at this time, would it be possible for us to have this metal bullnosing for the steps and then we could get them done, and also lay the lino in the outer corridor.\n\nIf you think our Boatbuilder cannot do a satisfactory job of laying this material, there is a trained lino layer at MacDonald and Sons in Port Alberni, and he could be secured for the work.\n\nI shall be glad to have any instructions you may have to offer in the above matter, and thank you meantime for your interest and assistance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"R.C. Scott\"\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nResidential School, Alberni\n\nRe Linoleum to Floors in Basement\n\nPlay room corridors, dining rooms in basement below grade, concrete base, are covered with linoleum.\n\nThe linoleum is apparently cemented to concrete floor, which has not been previously damp-proofed.\n\nThe linoleum cement, through dampness in concrete slab, has failed and the linoleum in many places is loose, badly blistered and puckered. The linoleum cement is wet, gives off an objectionable odour and is fast deteriorating, and is a hazard to pupils.\n\nWe recommend that all linoleum in basement should be lifted and any cement adhering either to the floor or linoleum should be removed and the concrete floor thoroughly cleaned and dried. Tremco 122 Linoleum Damp-proofing should be applied and lino-felt underlayment installed, and the linoleum cement in waterproof cement.\n\nAll linoleum which has not been previously waxed, as in play rooms, corridors and students' lunch room, should be given two coats Tremco Penetren.\n\nHaving regard to conditions, this work should be done during summer months.\nAlberni Day School, Alberni\n\nSir Flooring\n\nThe flooring in this building is showing fast deterioration, and it appears as if the flooring at installation was treated with linseed oil only.\n\nIn corridors, cloak rooms and aisles between desks, and at wall surrounds in front of blackboards, dirt is settling and penetrating into flooring, greatly reducing its life and leaving the floors in a dirty condition, almost impossible to clean.\n\nDue to the present condition and appearance of these floors we strongly recommend that the floors and corridors should be sanded, removing stain now in floors together with existing oil finish, and then treated with an application of Tremco Paste Filler and two coats Tremco Penetron Floor Finish.\n\nWe were advised by Rev. Scott that there is a quantity of linoleum on hand sufficient to fit on the stair treads leading from main entrance to landing, also to landing areas separating class rooms, and we would recommend that this be laid in these areas. This would reduce noise from pupils during class changes, the linoleum to be protected on stair treads by metal nosings of approved design and securely fastened.\n\nDue to the condition of the floor we would respectfully suggest that the sanding, filling and application of Penetron, and application of linoleum on stair treads, etc., as above mentioned, should be done by us to insure a first class job. The total cost of the above work would be two hundred and eighty-five dollars ($285.00).\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hereby agree to supply and install the following plumbing for the sum of ninety dollars. $90.00\n\n2 - Two part cast enamel laundry trays.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Commissioner under date of January 7th, File:15/15/9671 asking me to supply him with information as to local prices and the type of refrigerator required for the kitchen in the Principal's residence.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, prices received from Messrs. A. MacDonald & Sons of Port Alberni and Messrs. Stanley H. Wright and Company of Port Alberni. We shall be glad to have either of these units, but the Frigidaire has an enclosed unit for the ice cubes which is an advantage over the Kelvinator. The Frigidaire also takes 1 3/8 inches less space out from the wall which is an advantage in so small a kitchen. I beg to point out that both the above units are 1940 models and the 1940 price. If either of these are disposed of it will mean that the 1941 models will have the extra 25% tax.\n\nIn conversation with Major MacKay, he stated that all correspondence with his office should come through your own. I am very glad to do this and I am enclosing this letter and the price lists in duplicate in the hope that it may suit your convenience in forwarding same to the Commissioner.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"R.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nThis is to advise you that the two ironer ends, No. 2842-R and 2842-L from the Beaver Laundry Company, have been received and are now at the school.\n\nThese ends are in blank, only the main shafting holes being drilled. It will be necessary to take the mangle apart and set it on the new ends to mark them for fitting. Seventeen holes will have to be drilled on the right end and thirteen holes on the left end. These holes will have to be tapped as well to take the brackets and fittings. As the machine will have to be taken down, levelled and squared for setting up before these holes can be marked and drilled, it will take at least two days work. The job ought to be done at a time when it would inconvenience laundry work as little as possible. As some of these holes are from 5/8\" to 11/16\" it will take a heavy electric drill and we have not got such equipment, although it might be possible to rent it.\n\nI would be glad if you would advise Major MacKay that these ends have come, and I shall await further instructions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\nMEMORANDUM\n\nApril 12, 1941.\n\nMr. W.W. McCutcheon\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company, Toronto, Ont., regarding the damage to an Ironer supplied and installed with other laundry equipment on Purchase Order No. 3105. As a result of this correspondence, we wrote Beaver Laundry Machinery Company Limited on the 4th January as follows:\n\n\"Reply to your letter of the 11th ultimo, regarding condition of Ironer supplied on P.O. 3105 has been deferred pending receipt of additional information from our western representatives.\n\n\"Instead of replacing the Ironer originally supplied in accordance with my letter of Oct. 10, 1940, it will be satisfactory to this Department if you will arrange as follows:\n\n(a) Damaged frames to be replaced by new ones by your company without cost to this Department.\n\n(b) The roller which was bent as a result of the accident to the Ironer, and had to be straightened, to be replaced by your company provided it gives any trouble within the twelve months' period covered by your guarantee against defective parts.\n\nKindly arrange accordingly at your earliest convenience, so that we may arrange for payment of your account.\"\n\nI have been informed by Indian Affairs Branch that the damaged frames and roller have been replaced by the company.

Damaged frames to be replaced by new ones by your company without cost to this Department;\n\n2. The roller which was bent as a result of accident to the ironer and had to be straightened to be replaced by your company provided it gives any trouble within the twelve-month period covered by your guarantee against defective parts.\n\nI am now advised by the Principal of the school that the new frames have been delivered but up to April 15 no arrangements had been made for their installation.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would arrange to have these frames installed at an early date.

R. C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to the suggestion made in the fourth paragraph of this communication. Unless a decision with respect to the purchase of the land can be reached quickly, it might be well to consider a temporary arrangement of this kind.\n\nIt is my intention to discuss this matter with Dr. Dorey when I visit Toronto on Thursday September 5th.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nSardis, B.C. August 21, 1940\n\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D.,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario\n\nDear Dr. Dorsey:\n\nIt is very essential that I have some definite information with regard to the future of the farm in order that I may make arrangements for the transfer of stock, etc. I am willing to undertake responsibility for the farm to the end of September. I would like however to submit the following facts for your consideration. As the Department may be involved in any settlement, and doubtless you would like to confer with them, I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Hoey for his information.\n\nWe have in all, thirty-three head of cattle, including ten yearlings and under, and one purchased Guernsey bull. We have also six brood sows, two of which have litters of four and they will have litters within the next two weeks. We have four work horses and one yearling gelding which we obtained from a colt. Three of these horses I purchased out of school funds, the fourth being one which came down from Dr. Haley's time, but we have two first class teams and this young yearling that can be used in about a year's time. I could not accommodate more than twenty head of cattle at Alberni and accommodation is still to be made for the hogs. The one team is plenty for that school.\n\nI think a decision as to whether the Department wants to take over the farm should be secured, and whether they wish to continue to work it this coming Fall and Winter. The taxes are due November 2nd next, and this would mean that Coqualeetza School is liable for eleven months of the year, leaving one month to be taken care of from some other source. If the farm is left vacant it means taxes will accrue with no revenue to meet same. Betterment will at once set in and if the Department takes it over, they will be a year behind in providing dairy and farm produce for the Sanatorium. There are seven acres already ploughed which will need discing right away. There are twenty-five acres that should be ploughed as soon as possible. Added to the above reasons, so far as the Department is concerned, there is need for fresh milk and vegetables for the fifteen children that will be left here in the Preventorium.\n\nI would respectfully submit, that to my mind it would be good business for the Department to take over the farm and maintain Mr. Carter who is really an excellent farmer, or some other such man, who would give the proper care to the stock and keep the farm in good condition and also act as caretaker for all this property until it is reconditioned and operating as a sanatorium when definite plans could be made.\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D.,\n\nAugust 21, 1940\n\nAs the matter of the future oversight of the Preventorium is a pressing one, I shall write you in a day or two and send a copy of the letter which I hope to address to the Commissioner through Dr. McQuarrie.\n\nIn closing, I am going to take at least twelve head, most of the milkers, to Alberni as this will constitute one our loads. I shall also take some of the hogs. I shall leave the rest of the cattle to provide milk for the Preventorium and shall leave the horses until I hear from you. I would point out that this is the wrong time of year to sell horses.\n\nI shall appreciate an early reply and thank you in anticipation of your consideration of this problem. With kind regards I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nAugust 27th,\n1940\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will no doubt before this have received a copy of a letter from Rev. R. C. Scott, of Coqualeetza, dated August 21st. We hope the matters to which he refers can be dealt with speedily.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Scott wants to know what to do with the stock. That, after all, is a matter to be arranged between the two Branches of your Department. There should therefore be a minimum of delay.\n\nYou will note, also, that, according to Captain Scott, there does not seem to be a place at Alberni for all the horses nor for all the cattle. What Mr. Scott really wants to know is whether your Department wishes to buy this surplus from the Church. I take it from Mr. Scott's letter that we own the stock. If your Department does not wish to purchase the surplus stock, we shall be free to advise Mr. Scott as to their disposal.\n\nApparently this matter is urgent and we hope that in a few days both Mr. Scott and ourselves may hear from you.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nRe: Disposal of live stock\nCoqualeetza School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 27th instant with respect to the above-noted subject.\n\nI have, this morning, discussed the subject matter of your communication with Dr. McGill and with Dr. Moore. At the moment it seems that there is no intention whatever of the Department operating the farm at Coqualeetza. Consequently a decision in respect to the land will be reached in due course. In the meantime we can see no valid reason why Mr. Scott should not dispose of the stock other than the horses and cows required for the operation of the farm at Alberni.\n\nMr. Scott, in his letter to Dr. Dorey, expresses the opinion that this is a poor season of the year to dispose of horses. It is just possible that arrangements might be made whereby farmers in the district might make use of these horses until they could be disposed of profitably.\n\nIt is my intention to discuss with Dr. Dorey and with you, if convenient, a number of matters relating to the farm lands surrounding the Coqualeetza School, but in the meantime Mr. Scott should be instructed to dispose of the surplus cattle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Indian School,\nAlberni,\n\nDear Mr. Pitts,\n\nIn accordance with your wishes I am submitting the following information re the organization of a band in your school.\n\nRe Instruction:\n\nI have written to Mr. J. Kyle of the Technical BR. of the Education Dept. to have him confirm by letter that his Dept. will arrange for an instructor to teach the boys the instruments. Once he gives his permission in writing I can arrange to have a man go out from Port Alberni, twice a week to teach them. I could arrange to go myself if no one else chooses as I have already instructed and led three Boys' Bands.\n\nRe Instruments:\n\nRather than see the boys have poor instruments and, if I were to be the instructor, I would sooner see them not begin. I strongly recommend British-made instruments for, beyond a doubt, they possess better material and workmanship than the American-made. There are three British instruments that I think all good bandsmen would be ready to recommend. They are the Hawkes, the Beeson and the Boosey. The Boosey is, I think, more popular than the others and a little cheaper in Canada. It is used by most of the good bands in the British Isles. All British Instruments are hand-made. The different layers of metal are pounded together with wooden mallets and are not so apt to have small air-pockets between the layers as the machine-made instruments. Some of the American instruments look very nice but when one blows them he detects skimpy material. The firms save on material and depend on advertising to sell their goods. Some cheaper instruments have a weak alloy more nearer to copper than they should. They are more easily dented than the dearer\nMr. Pitt,\n\nand what is worse, whenever they get warm, the keys jam, because copper has a different expansion than brass.\n\n(ALL THE ABOVE APPLIES TO THE BRASS SECTION OF THE BAND. A SAVING WOULD BE MADE BY BUYING CANADIAN DRUMS AND FRENCH CLARINETS BECAUSE BRITISH CLARINETS ARE SKY HIGH FOR SOME UNFATHOMABLE REASON.)\n\nFrench and Italian Clarinets are cheaper and considered exceptionally good.\n\nI have tried to make inquiries from a music store in Vancouver, one in Nanaimo, and one in Victoria. The firm in Vancouver, Copeland and Euper, stated that they could equip the school with any of three makes of instruments made in British Isles and one made in Canada. One of these makes\u2014the Boosey\u2014mentioned above\u2014gives a 15 year guarantee so that the instruments should last twice that long. To give an approximate cost they have made the following quotations on this particular make. They are a very reliable firm, are experts at overhauling instruments and any band equipped by them has the advantage of being able to have an instrument, no matter how badly banged up, quickly overhauled and made to look like new.\n\nYour proposed band should either be a 15 piece band\u2014all brass\u2014or a 20 piece band with fifteen brass instruments and 5 clarinets.\n\nInstrumentation\n\n15 pieces \u2014 (Spanish Silver Plated, Frosted Finish)\n5 Dong Model Cornets (with cases) @ $143.25 Total $716.25\n2 Upright Altoes (without cases) @ $115.50 \" 231.\n2 Slide Trombones (with cases) @ $134.25 \" 268.50\n1 Tenor Horn (Case unnecessary) @ $125.50 \" 125.50\n1 Euphonium @ $161.50 \" 161.50\n2 Basses @ $261. \" 522.\n2 Drums (1 Bass & 1 snare) @ $81.00 \" 81.00\n\n$ 2145.75\n\nTo make it a twenty piece band one would add 5 clarinets to this at an approximate cost of $500.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrim.

However, I believe the money would be well spent and hope the Department may grant our request. I understand that most of the Residential Schools in B.C. have a brass band in them and I am sure it would add to the loyalty of the Indians and children if we had one in our school.\n\nWe have twenty boys from twelve to fourteen years of age from whom we could pick fifteen that would do well at training for a band.\n\nWe were informed by the Superintendent of Technical Education, Mr. Kyle, that the Provincial Department would pay 60% of the cost of instruction in the Indian School as well as the Public schools.\n\nI enclose herewith the communication from Mr. Murray, Principal of Port Alberni Public School, who has had considerable experience in organizing bands.\n\nI am anxious to know if your Department will consider favorably such a request and shall be glad to furnish any further information required.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReceived\n\nAUG 21 1930\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils'\nnames and numbers are as follows: Charlie Watts #160, Oscar Tem\n#161, Eddie Klutesi #191, Warren Rush #188 and Willie Tateesh #171.\n\nI therefore ask your permission for these pupils to attend\nhigh school at Port Alberni and live in residence at Alberni\nResidential School as regular grant earning pupils; and that a\nspecial grant of sixty dollars each be given to pay for High School\nfees of $50 each and $10 each for High School books.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nF.E. Pitts\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 21, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, in which you advise that five boys from the Alberni Indian Residential School recently passed their entrance examination and wish to attend high school. Before the Department can consider allowing any advanced educational grant for these boys, it will be necessary for you to forward to the Department the marks which each obtained. We can only consider allowing grants for those pupils who obtained at least 70% on the entrance examination.\n\nIn connection with two of the boys, it appears from the quarterly return that they are, at least, seventeen years of age. It is doubtful if it would be advisable for them to start high school work at that age. Very careful consideration has to be given before sending pupils to high school. Your request for advanced educational grant for these five children will receive further consideration when you reply giving the information requested in this letter.\n\nI would, also, direct your attention to the fact that you have not yet replied to the Deputy Superintendent General's circular of June 15th, last, with reference to pupils sixteen years of age and over in the Alberni Residential School. A copy of this circular is enclosed and I would appreciate receiving your reply at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that the Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, today brought to this office a copy of a letter written by him to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, on the 13th instant, direct, asking for the Department's authority for pupils Nos. 160 Charlie Watts, 161 Oscar Tom, 191 Eddie Clutesi, 188 Warren Rush and 171 Willie Tatoosh, to attend the Alberni District High School for tuition, and requesting the Department's sanction of an expenditure of \u00a350.00 each, school fees, and \u00a310.00 each for school books. The pupils to remain on the register of the Alberni Residential School and live and board there. The total cost entailed is \u00a3300.00.\n\nThe ages of the pupils in question are as under:\n\n# 160 Charlie Watts - 18- admitted to school. 7. 6.26.\n# 161 Oscar Tom - 18- \" \" \" \" 15.10.26.\n# 171 Willie Tatoosh - 18- \" \" \" \" 17.9.27.\n# 188 Warren Rush - 17- \" \" \" \" 4.9.28.\n# 191 Eddie Clutesi - 17- \" \" \" \" 20.7.25.\n\nI have to state that these pupils appear to be above the ordinary run of intelligence, but unless technical training can be given them during the High School training, such as instruction in repairs and operation of internal combustion engines, carpentry and navigation, I fail to see where a High School training is going to benefit them, as all classes of employment are now over stocked with white youths, and yearly becoming more so, waiting for opportunities for employment, and it is an indisputable fact that whites always get the preference in employment. I fail to see where a High School training can benefit them other than in the fact that they are better educated than their fellows usually are, or to fit them for enfranchisement. I have to point out that these pupils will be about 22 years old, should they decide to finish their High School training, and will be too old to study further to advantage, even if their financial circumstances were such as to admit them to do so.\n\nI am not making these remarks as pertaining to the above mentioned pupils only, but I consider they apply generally to Indian pupils, at least in this Agency, that being the only one with which I am perfectly familiar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to four boys of the Alberni Residential School whom the Principal suggests might attend high school.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department is not prepared to allow any extra grant to enable these boys to attend high school.\n\nIt is considered that pupils Nos. 160, 161, 165 and 191 should be discharged. Willie Tatoosh, No. 171, is shown to be only 16 years of age, and if the Principal and yourself consider it advisable, he may remain in the school for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n| CANDIDATES' SURNAMES | CHRISTIAN NAMES IN FULL |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n|                      | (In Alphabetical Order) |\n\n| Name       | Age in Years | Examination Score | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total Marks | Grade |\n|------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|\n| Elliott    | Donald       | 16                | 399    | 29     | 68          | Passed |\n| Kluteste   | Edward       | 15                | 400    | 56     | 76          | Passed |\n| Rush       | Watson       | 17                | 401    | 55     | 60          | Passed |\n| Tatooah    | William      | 16                | 402    | 47     | 74          | Passed |\n| Tom        | Ossat        | 17                | 403    | 46     | 73          | Passed |\n| Watts      | Charles      | 17                | 404    | 59     | 73          | Passed |\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. E. Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nAlberni, B.C. May 25, 1935.\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of October 10th, in connection with certain Indian boys at the Alberni Indian Residential School who are now attending High School in Port Alberni.\n\nPlease inform the Principal that the Department has decided to allow the advanced educational grant of $50.00 each for these boys for the academic year 1934-35. If they attend high school regularly during the current academic year, you may forward, about the first of June, next, a voucher in favour of the Principal for $250.00, viz., $50.00 for each of the five boys.\n\nAs pointed out in the last paragraph of official letter of October 10th, the work done by these boys at high school during the current academic year should be carefully watched and a report submitted to the Department at the end of next June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nEd. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 18th, last, and official reply of August 29th, in connection with certain boys at the Alberni Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Department is now in receipt of another letter from the Principal, in which he again urges that these boys be allowed to remain on the school roll in order that they can attend high school. The Principal states in his recent letter that all he will require is the per capita grant and that the other expenses will be paid from private funds.\n\nIt has been decided to grant his request and the work done by these boys at high school during the current academic year should be carefully watched and a report submitted to the Department at the end of next June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nEd. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with further reference to the under-mentioned pupils whom you wish to attend high school:\n\nNo. 161 - Oscar Tom\nNo. 171 - Willie Tatoosh\n\" 160 - Charlie Watts\n\" 188 - Warren Rush\nNo. 191 - Eddie Klutesi\n\nIn view of your representations, it has been decided to approve of their remaining in the school and the regular per capita grant will be allowed for them. It is understood, of course, that they will be included in the number for which grant is provided.\n\nIt is, also, noted that the extra expense involved in their attending high school will be paid from private funds.\n\nThe work done by these boys at high school during the current academic year should be carefully watched and a report submitted to the Department at the end of next June, showing what progress they made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nMr. J. H. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nParliament Buildings, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI anxiously await reply to my letter of August 30, recommending that certain pupils remain in school another year. Your letter of August 21, #159-1-22 stated that, \"Your request for advanced educational grant for these five children will receive further consideration when you reply giving the information requested in this letter.\"\n\nIn a letter of Mr. Phelan, July 5th, #159-1-10, he says, \"It is noted that Charlie Watts, #160 and Oscar Ten, #161 wish to return if they are successful in passing their entrance examinations. You should advise the Department when the results of this examination are issued in order that permission can be given for them to return.\"\n\nIn view of these letters I asked in my letter of August 30th for a special grant for these five boys to attend high school at Port Alberni, or if this were not possible that we be given permission to keep the regular list of grant-earning pupils and that I would pay the high school fees and books from per capita or private funds. All five returned after holidays and were anxious to go on. As it was necessary to get started with the others at the beginning of the term I fitted them out with books etc., and started them to high school. At the end of a month the teachers inform me that they stand well up in their classes of 60 white pupils and that Oscar Ten is among the best that have entered this year.\n\nI have gone carefully into their ages and believe the following to be their correct ages.\n\nOscar Ten........17, 21st January, 1934 - /8\nCharlie Watts...17, 29th November, 1933 - /8\nRudie Klutesi...16, 12th August, 1934 - /6\nWarren Rush....17, 7th September, 1934 - /7\nWillie Tateesh..16, 11th May, 1934. - /6\n\nThe parents and other Indians of their respective bands are anxious for them to go on to school. The Indians of this agency have to make their living along with white, Japanese, Chinese, Norwegian and Swedish fishermen, ship loading, canneries and other industries. I feel that we will never have a better chance to improve these Indians than we have at present with these boys.\nWe have personally done all we could for them by way of giving\nthe special training in music. They have been very efficient in\nmanual training. They have the reputation of being among the best\nbehaved and most courteous in the high school.\n\nFor the above reasons I am taking the risk of appearing\nimpudent to your Department in my solicitations that you keep\nthem on our list of grant-earning pupils for at least one year\nmore. The High School fees and books for the five will cost $300.\nThis we will provide for here, if necessary.\n\nAll of which is humbly submitted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.E. Pitts\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nAlberni, B.C. August 30th, 1934.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Sup't of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 21st inst. to hand, #159-1-22 re five boys from this school attending High School at Port Alberni while in residence here.\n\nI enclose herewith their marks and ages as requested.\n\nThey are all anxious to attend high school. They are bright young lads who will profit by the extra work. We have worked hard to bring the school up to the present standard and have encouraged the children to think that they had a chance to go on. We have done this thinking we were winning the approbation of your Department in the progress we were making. We have ten in the entrance class for this present year. Our other United Church schools have pupils in high school; some of them entering this year are older than our boys. All we ask is the same treatment as the others.\n\nHowever if it is not possible to get the extra grant for high school fees, I will take the responsibility of paying these from our decreased grant or endeavor to raise it from private sources providing that we receive the regular per capita grant for them. Humbly submitted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nF.E. Pitts\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nName: Edward Klutesi\nTeacher's signature: J.

The photo of these boys was also received.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that a cheque to the amount of $250, being the grant due for the school year ending the 30th instant, will be sent you. I have noted from the reports that these boys, with the exception of Charlie Watts, made excellent progress in their studies during the year. It is noted, further, that he was absent from the Easter examinations on account of a broken hand.\n\nI presume these boys wish to continue attending high school during the coming academic year. If so, the Department will allow the grant for them, at the rate of $60 each, for the next school year. This grant will be paid upon receipt of vouchers, in triplicate, with reports attached concerning the progress made, at the beginning of June, 1936.

One of these boys is stated to be in his seventeenth year and the other in his eighteenth year. The cases of these two boys are similar to those of the boys from the Ahousaht Residential School, whose transfer was refused in official letter of the 17th instant.\n\nThe Department does not feel that it is advisable to transfer Eddie Clutesi and William Tatoosh from Alberni to Coqualeetza and you should so inform the Principal of the Alberni School. It is considered that they should be discharged from the Alberni School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. P. Nightingale, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nAlberni, B.C.\nSept. 16, 1935.\n\nDear Miss Norris:\n\nI am altogether at a loss to know where we are at with our Indian School management. Neither the Indian Department nor the Church seem to have any definite policy as to what is to be done in an Indian School. This has pretty well broken up our senior work and dampened our interest in it.\n\nLast year we had five boys in Fort Alberni High School and five more in Entrance here. When I reported the work of the High School boys to the Department at the beginning of June, Mr. J.D. Sutherland, without being asked, granted permission for these boys to remain in school here as per capita pupils and to pay the High School fees ($280.00) for this year (Dept. letter June 7, 1935 No. 159-1-22). A letter from his office dated July 24th, enclosing one from Mr. Beaton dated July 17th, said that the Indian Department thought these boys should go to Coqualeetza and that he \"was entirely in accord with this viewpoint.\"\n\nI took the matter up with Principal Scott of Coqualeetza. His reply was indefinite, saying that they had more boys now than they could rightly accommodate but that they would be open for a few more girls. Three of the High School boys decided they would not go to Coqualeetza. I had made application for the other two to the Dept. to have them transferred to Coqualeetza as per your letter of Aug. 9th. A letter from Mr. Sutherland to the Indian Agent in reply to these applications, dated August 27th, states that \"the Department does not feel that it is advisable to transfer these two pupils. It is considered that they should be discharged from the Alberni School.\"\n\nI am putting the three High School boys and last year's entrance class on our discharge sheet for this quarter and am starting the other two boys who did so well at High School last year, to Fort Alberni High School until I have further instructions as to what should be done.\n\nAnother difficulty in this connection is that one of our boys in last year's entrance class made application through the Agent at Duncan, to attend Coqualeetza, and Principal Scott told him to come on to school. The Ahousant pupils have passed through here on their way to Coqualeetza. I understand there are six of them in school there now. The Indian Agent tells me that Principal Caldwell has permission for only two of them to attend.\n\nNaturally our pupils and Indians here are asking why our pupils have not the same chance as the others.\n\nHoping for an early reply, I remain,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(signed) F.E. Pitts.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 3rd, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Alberni Graduates and Coqualeetza\n\nYou will remember that after the return of our Commission on Indian Education from Western Canada, we discussed the problem of further education for graduates of the Alberni and Ahousaht Schools who in their High School Entrance examinations measure up to the standard set by the Department. I was under the impression that we had agreed upon the fact that they should be sent to Coqualeetza and wrote to Mr. Pitts, the Principal of Alberni School, giving that as my interpretation of policy. I am enclosing a letter from him which is self-explanatory. It was addressed to the Acting Executive Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society here and before answering it I would like to be sure that the local Indian Agent recommended that these boys be sent to Coqualeetza. If he did, I fail to understand the Department's attitude, in view of the fact that ten days ago Captain Scott still needed 75 pupils to make up his per capita pupilage at Coqualeetza.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you regarding this matter at your convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, October 22, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, with reference to sending pupils from the Alberni and Ahousaht Indian Residential Schools, who have passed their Entrance examinations, to the Coqualeetza Residential School, in order that they can continue their high school studies.\n\nIn this connection I would say that, last academic year, the Department allowed the advanced educational grant for five pupils of the Alberni School, who attended the Alberni District High School. When the Principal forwarded the request for payment of the grant in June, last, he was informed, should these boys wish to continue attending high school in Alberni during the present academic year, the Department would continue the grant for them. In replying, he requested that two of the boys, Eddie Clutesi and William Tatcoosh, be sent to Coqualeetza. As one of these boys is 17 and the other in his 18th year, the Department did not consider it advisable to send them to Coqualeetza. We are not aware of any reason why the boys from the Alberni School could not take high school work at the Alberni High School.\n\nThe Department doubts the wisdom of sending boys 17 and 18 years of age from the west coast, inland, to Coqualeetza. After three or four years, they would have to return to their home reserves and take up their future life work, and it is doubtful if they would then be any better prepared to make a living. It will not likely be possible, for some years, at least, for them to obtain employment in offices or in business, and their only future, therefore, is to return to their homes, where they will be handicapped by being behind the other boys in becoming established.\n\nThis applies, also, in the case of pupils from\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nTORONTO 2, Ont.\n\n-Ahousaht.\nAhousaht. The Principal stated that three boys had passed their Entrance and he requested that they be sent to Coqualeetza. Two of these boys were 17 and the other, 16 years of age. The Department was unable to approve of their transfer to Coqualeetza.\n\nAfter discussing with the Deputy Minister the matter of advanced education for the pupils from the two above named schools, it was considered advisable, if they could not arrange to attend high school locally, that they be given their discharge and take up work on their reserves leading to their future establishment.\n\nIf the Principal of the Ahousaht School has sent the boys to Coqualeetza, I cannot find that this Department gave any authority. The Principals of both schools should understand, before transferring any pupils to other residential schools, that the necessary authority of the Department should first be obtained.\n\nI am sure that, upon consideration of the question of advanced education for Indian children of the west coast, you will agree that no great advantage could be obtained in their transfer to Coqualeetza for a three or four year period in order that they can matriculate from high school. The advanced education they would receive would not be of any great use to them in their means of obtaining their future livelihood.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing on the authority of your letter of June 7th, 1935,\n#159-1-22, I have sent two pupils, Willie Tatooch #172 and\nEdward Klutesi #191 to Alberni High School for the full year. They\nhave lived at this school and have put in regular attendance at high\nschool. They have done splendid work in a class of 43 white children\nin Grade X. They are taking the full matriculation work. At the\nEaster examinations, Edward's average mark was 81% and Willie's 77%.\nEdward was first in the class and Willie third. (class of 43)\n\nThe High School staff attached this to their reports. \"Edward's\nwork is excellent. His school work is by far the best consistent\nperformance (considering everything) we have yet observed in a grade X\nclass. If he continues and works hard now there is no reason why he\nshould not win a scholarship in his matriculation year.\" \"Willie's\nwork is very good indeed. Like Edward, Willie possesses the ability\nto win a scholarship in his matriculation year.\"\n\nEdward has made good progress in music on piano under the instruc-\ntion of my wife and both have made good progress on the violin under\nthe instruction of my daughter.\n\nThese boys are both Indian (pure bred). I think that you will\nagree that their progress has justified the interest we have taken in\nthem.\n\nThe other three boys I had in high school a year ago dropped out\nin the fall because the Church officers in Toronto thought they should\ngo to Coqualeetza.\n\nI have one young lad writing entrance this year that I would like\nto see get a chance in high school. He promises to stand as high as\neither of these and is only 13 years, pupil 175, Charlie Klutesi.\n\nI hereby request permission to send these same two boys and\nCharlie Klutesi to High School in Alberni next year under the same\nconditions as at present.\n\nI have others writing on Entrance but am not prepared to recommend\nany others, at present, to High School.\n\nI enclose herewith the bill and vouchers for High School fees, as\nwas done a year ago, viz. $50.00 each for two boys, $100.00 and await\nyour further instructions as to what I shall do with them next year.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will no doubt be of interest to the Department to learn that very satisfactory marks were obtained by the great majority of the Indian children writing this examination. In all sixteen candidates passed the High School Test from our schools. Only three or four failed to obtain the necessary 360 marks out of 600 required for a pass to High School. The highest mark made this year in the Entrance Examination was 543 by a pupil from one of the North Vancouver City Schools.

Permission for these three boys to attend high school was given in a letter from Mr. Sutherland, dated about June 12/36; (letter lost in school fire). These boys have attended regularly all year and have done splendid work and are highly praised by the Principal and staff of the high school. In a class of 25 taking Junior matriculation and Grade XI, Eddie Klutesi stood first with 83.4% on the Easter examinations and Willie Tatoosh stood third with 78.5%. In Grade IX, a class of 60 pupils, Charlie Klutesi stood first with 85.56% and over 3% above the next competitor. They are the only Indians in the high school.\n\nPrincipal Dunn tells me that if Eddie Klutesi goes on next year in Grade XII that he will have better prospect of winning the Governor-General's medal for British Columbia than any boy who has ever gone through this school.\n\nThese boys are anxious to go on and take a course in electrical engineering or something of the kind and I hope the Department may see fit to give them a chance.\n\nIn geometry, algebra and chemistry these boys made from 87% to 100%.

It would appear that these boys:\n\nWillie Tatoosh\nEdward Clutesi\nCharlie Clutesi\n\nwere per capita-drawing pupils of the Alberni Indian Residential School and that they attended Alberni High School for classes, returning to the Indian Residential School daily after school.\n\nFrom time to time during the past few years I have seen reports from the Principal of the Alberni High School with regard to the progress of these pupils, and have in fact mentioned these in my own reports on the Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears that Willie Tatoosh and Edward Clutesi are now wishing to enter the 4th and last year of the High School course, while Charlie Clutesi wishes to take the 3rd year.\n\nI consider that these boys are too old to be received as per capita-drawing pupils of an Indian Residential School but I do not wish to place any obstacle in the way of their graduation from High School. I see no reason why these boys should not live in their homes on the Indian Reserve and attend the Alberni High School daily. I understand that they would be allowed to do this, provided the usual High School fees were paid. Owing to the exceptional nature of the case and the fact that the boys are doing so well in school, I would recommend that they be allowed to continue there for another year, and that their School fees and cost of necessary textbooks be borne by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe Principal of the Alberni High School would, no doubt, be prepared to furnish Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge with a copy of the quarterly school report in the case of each of these pupils. Such reports would no doubt be necessary should the Department wish to consider the provision of further education for the above-named pupils at the close of the present academic year in June, 1938.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of this fact, the Department is sympathetically disposed to assist them in completing their high school studies.\n\nI am anxious to know what arrangements can be made to have these boys continue at high school. You might let me know the approximate cost of board, tuition fees, etc., and, if these appear to you to be reasonable, I am inclined to think the boys should be permitted to take up their studies at once. You might also let us know what your opinion is with respect to Charlie Kluteesi. This boy has spent one year at high school and, according to our records, is 14 years old. It is just possible, in view of the lateness of the season, that this boy might be well advised to postpone his attendance at high school until next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nOttawa, October 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 27th, you may inform Indian Agent Ashbridge that the Department approves Willie Tatoosh, Edward Clutesi and Charlie Clutesi continuing their Course at the Alberni High School.\n\nA tuition grant of $60.00 will be allowed for each of them. In addition we will allow books, if required, at a cost not exceeding $10.00 each.\n\nIt is understood that they will live in their homes on the Reserve and attend High School daily.\n\nThe Indian Agent should obtain monthly reports from the Principal of the Alberni High School with a view to ascertaining if these boys are taking advantage of the opportunity offered them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter from Indian Agent Ashbridge, together with a letter from Inspector Barry recommending further High School education for the undermentioned three Indian boys who have been attending the Alberni High School under some arrangement made between the executives of the Alberni High School and the Alberni Indian Residential School, destroyed by fire early this year:\n\nWillie Tatoosh Age 19 For 4th Year High School\nEdward Clutesi \" 20 \" 4th \"\nCharlie Clutesi \" 16 \" 3rd \"\n\nI am inclined to agree with Capt. Barry that these boys should not be received in the Alberni High School as per capita-drawing pupils of an Indian Residential School and, that they should live in their homes on the Reserve and attend the High School daily.\n\nAs these students have done exceptionally well at the High School and appear to appreciate the assistance and opportunity given to them, I would recommend that their school fees and cost of the necessary text-books be borne by the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of October 15, 1937, in connection with further High School study for Eddie Klutesi, Willie Tatoosh and Charlie Klutesi of this Agency.\n\nSince receipt of your letter, I received authority under your letter to the Commissioner, of October 8th, file 159-1-25, for these boys to be permitted to resume their courses, and arrangements were made with the Principal of the Alberni District High School to admit them. These boys will all live at their own homes, and attend school daily at no further expense to the Department.\n\nWith regard to Charlie Klutesi, this boy is away at the fishing grounds and has not yet reported to me, but it is hoped that he may decide to postpone his attendance until next year, as you propose. This I would advise, as he is not quite up to the standard of the other two boys, and a course in marine engineering would be more suitable for him. On his return, I will talk the matter over and report further regarding him.\n\nWith respect to Eddie Klutesi and Willie Tatoosh, these boys have a splendid progress report and I am doing all I can to further their interests against the time they leave school. Unfortunately, in many cases promising pupils have fallen under the influence of the older people and leaving school and reverting to Indian habits and mode of living, and I hope of these two boys setting a new standard as an example for other pupils to try to attain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Worked in Deep Bay Cannery part of holidays. Returned to school soon after opening. Complained of some stomach trouble in October; was in bed, temperature 102; was troubled with vomiting. I feared appendicitis and had her examined a couple of times by Dr. Thomas. Was back in class room. Was not well again about Dec. 16th. Complained of headache and vomiting, temperature about 102. Was in bed two weeks. Dr. saw her than a couple of times. She was around as usual during Christmas holidays and back in classroom till the flu started. Her symptoms same as others except that she complained of pain in stomach and side. I called Dr. Thomas at once, as I thought it might be appendicitis. After careful examination, Dr. thought it was stomach flu, but said that she had better go to the hospital. He went back to hospital, arranged for bed and I took her in car half an hour later, Jan. 24th. Died in hospital Feb. 5th. I saw her three or four times during that week, thought she was going down and wrote and phoned her parents. Owing to roads blocked with snow, was not able to get a message through till Thursday, Feb. 4th, by favour of Nanose Lumber Co. Father phoned as soon as he got the message and came by train, Thursday P.M., Mother, Friday P.M. Daughter died early Saturday morning.

She remained in bed till July 17th and went by boat to her parents at Ucluelet. Was under the doctor's care and did not return until about 10 days after the others. Was not looking well but was playful and active as ever. At times she had a vacant stare that struck us as strange and is seen only in cases of meningitis.\n\nOn Feb. 8th complained of not being well, went to bed and was given laxative and aspirin compound; following day complained of soreness of spinal column. I called Dr. Thomas at once and told him I feared meningitis. He came soon after and said he feared it was T.B. meningitis and as we had her isolated we decided to keep her until next day. She got so much worse through the night that we had to stay by her bed to keep her in and grew gradually worse toward the next night.\n\nHad ambulance and nurse from Port Alberni to remove her to hospital, Wed. Feb. 9th. Grew gradually worse and died in hospital Sunday morning Feb. 14. I had phoned her father, Jimmy McKay at Ucluelet. He came at once and was with her a couple of days before she died.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Was well over these and about June 10 contracted the old fashioned measles, ran a high temperature and was in bed until July 11. Went with father on boat for holidays. Returned to school Aug. 15th looking rather miserable, but picked up some in looks and strength. Had Dr. Thomas examine her a number of times. He thought there was nothing seriously wrong. We tried all fall to build her up with resting in bed in the forenoon, cod-liver oil, egg-noggs, cocomalt, etc. She seemed to be improving but flu struck our school and she was very sick with high temperature for a week. Feb. 8th we feared meningitis. After examination by Dr. Thomas we kept her at school with Violet McKay until the following day and sent her to hospital in ambulance with nurse at same time as Vi\u00e5let McKay.

Jones M.D.\nOttawa, June 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge your letter of June 7th, File No. 15/15/8454, enclosing a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School dated June 5th, in which he requests that the Department allow funeral charges in conformity with our schedule for the burial of a pupil who died in the hospital.\n\nI wish to inform you that we consider the Department is responsible for funeral costs for a destitute Indian pupil in conformity with our schedule of rates if the child dies in hospital. This, of course, does not mean that we will assume transportation costs for the deceased to be returned to the Reserve. If Principals of Residential Schools wish to pay that cost themselves, the Department, of course, would have no objection. It is suggested, therefore, that you communicate with Reverend R. C. Scott and inform him of our ruling, requesting him to submit funeral accounts conforming with our rates.\n\nReverend Scott's letter is being returned herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. A.

However, it would be appreciated if you would advise me in the matter.\n\nThe rest of the Reverend Scott's letter dealing with the hospitalization of this child has been discussed with Dr. McQuarrie, Assistant Superintendent of Medical Services, and it has been ascertained that the objection to the child's removal from Alberni to the Hospital mentioned is that the hospital lacks accommodation for such cases and because of the infectious nature of the disease.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

As a matter of course instructors will be given in agricultural pursuits and other useful employments more or less pertaining thereto.\n\nThe girls will be taught housekeeping, needlework, sewing, knitting, and all such accomplishments in that line as are deemed most essential in fitting them for the life before them. His Lordship further informed me that as the buildings intended to be used have not been occupied for the last several years, it will take some little time to fit them up and prepare them for the reception of the boys and girls and their instructors.\n\nHe says, however, that he will be able by the 14th July to take in 12 boys, a number which he considers, under any circumstances, quite sufficient to commence with, for the reason that it will be easier and more expeditious in the long run to have a number that you can thoroughly attend to and particularly instruct as to\na knowledge of the English language and discipline makes it more so many consider that they are taken from their native wilds and have been accustomed to control whatever that it will be impossible to put them that individual attention required at the commencement. After the first batch of boys learn something of English and have become accustomed to the rules and regulations governing their conduct and daily actions at school, then half the trouble is removed, as each of these partially trained boys will really occupy the position of an instructor by example and communication. The intention is to have the full number of boys within the year.\n\nOver the condition of the building, intended to be occupied by 150 pupils, will necessitate a lengthier delay in completion. Bishop says that what work he fears cannot be opened till the commencement of the second quarter, viz., 1st of October next.\nIn the last paragraph of the Bishop's letter to me dated 20th March, sent a copy of which has been sent to the Department at Ottawa, he states that he is ready to undertake to run an Industrial School at St. Joseph's Mission with a staff of teachers and Road Writers. I have no objection to the Industrial School at Kitchener in accepting that offer on the part of His Lordship and I understand that the furniture and fittings will be supplied by the Department, the funds by expenses already incurred for similar requirements as those already supplied to other Industrial Schools.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are not Indians and therefore have no claim to be treated as such, and their mother and father have worked hard for their support, etc., as natives.

Lejacq, O.M.I., Principal of the William's Lake Industrial School, in regard to the payment of the per capita grant to that institution on an average attendance of 25 pupils, in which that gentleman expresses surprise at being informed by you that the grant towards the institution covers only 25 pupils, the agreement between the Government and the Bishop having been or 50 pupils.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that it was the intention to provide for the tuition and accommodation of 50 pupils at $180.00 each at the said institution, as had been done in the year 1890-91; but, through an oversight, the provision was only made for 25 pupils. The Department, however, was able to pay for the average attendance during the first quarter of the year 1892-93, as that attendance was only 20.66; but, in the December and March quarters last, the attendance\nIn answer to the Deputy Minister's memorandum on the letter addressed by Mr. Vowell to the Department on the 16th instant, the undersigned has the honour to report that for the year 1891 there was provided in the Estimates the sum of $3,250 as a Capitation Grant for 25 pupils at the William's Lake Industrial School, at $130 each. There was further provided in those Estimates $2,970 for salaries to be paid to a Principal, Mason, Cook, Trade-instructor, and Servant, together with rations for those officials. In considering the Estimates as they were originally prepared, and in connection with a letter received from Bishop Durion, dated 18th of March 1890, in which he informed the Department that buildings for the school had already been erected; that there was plenty of good land available, with a sufficiency of implements and cattle; and that there was accommodation for 40 pupils; it was decided to utilize the sum set apart for salaries and rations as an addition to the Capitation Grant of $3,250, and thus to provide for the accommodation of 50 pupils at $60 each, and the money was voted by Parliament.\n\nIn preparing the Estimates, however, for the year 1891-2 the fact of this additional provision for an increased number of pupils appears to have been overlooked, and a grant for 25 pupils only was included.\nincluded in the Estimates and voted by Parliament.\n\nThis sum proved to be sufficient for the first quarter of the year 1892-93, the average attendance having been only 20.68. For the first quarter of the year, therefore, the appropriation was sufficient, but in December and March quarters following the attendance increased, in December to 29.30 and in March to 30.46, and there is therefore still due to the school on account of those quarters the sum of $317. The returns for June quarter have not yet been received, and for the present it is impossible to state precisely what sum must be provided in Supplementary Estimates for the current year on account of this school. The undersigned begs, however, to recommend that when the required amount shall have been ascertained an item to cover it may be inserted in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nJune 30th, 1893.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Mr. [Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 23 June 1893\n\nPlease give me a memo of the attendance at the Williams Lake, B.C., Ind.

That Mr. Macdonald, the Indian Agent, wishes him to grant the request, I mean to let the children free to go home for a month or so. Now I beg leave to present to your consideration that the agreement between the government and his Lordship was $130.00 per head per annum, no mention being made of vacation. If the government wants to give vacation to the children, it is all right, but as the government has been paying according to the number of days of attendance, in order to get the whole grant I am entitled to, I will have to count, in the report, the vacation days as full days. I am sure you will see the justice of the remarks, especially, if you take into consideration that all the servants employed for the school have their wages running on vacation or no vacation, and that I will have to pay them and board them during that time for doing nothing; to discharge them during vacation time is out of the question.\n\nHere I will also state that as yet I have received no cheque for the quarter ending December 1892.\n\nI hope that you have, by this time, received\n\nA.W.

December 1893, you state that, though the Department placed the number of pupils at 50 on the estimates for 1893-1894, that number was reduced to twenty five in council.\n\nYou are very well aware that in 1891 I entered into a contract with the Indian Department to carry on the same Industrial School with the positive condition that the number of pupils would not be less than fifty, each pupil being paid by the Department at the rate of $150.00\n$130.00 dollars a year.

I do not believe the Indian Department would act honestly, were it to retrench any portion of the $130.00 granted by the contract of 1891 for each pupil to the number of fifty, this year.\n\nBut next July, if the Government thinks it expedient, I will dismiss the staff employed for the girls section and close the girls school, till the Indian Department will be able to pay for fifty pupils.\n\nIt is but justice that I should be paid this year for all the Indian pupils.\npupils boarded and educated in said school at Williams Lake during the three quarters ending 31st December 1893, 31st March and 30th June 1894, according to our mutual contract not yet dissolved to the best of my knowledge.\n\nI beg of you to press my just claim and forward it to Ottawa.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

I cannot account for your long silence. I have no doubt but the Government will pay me for all the pupils I had, and will have up to 50, since the contract passed between His Lordship and the Indian Department is very clear on that point, His Lordship accepting only with the positive condition that the number of children would not be less than 50.

The cheque issued at Ottawa as payment of the second quarter of the present year amounts to $756.17 only; so we do not receive a quarterly grant for twenty-five children whom we should receive a grant for about thirty-five.

Provision has, however, been made in the Estimates 1894-5 for 50 pupils, and a sum of $4000 has been inserted for a new building, and it is hoped that these amounts will be passed by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir;\u2014\n\nI beg to call your attention to the manner in which a certain department of the Indian Industrial school at Williams Lake, in the Caribou District, is carried on. I refer to the harness and saddlery department. A few weeks ago, while on a trip over the Caribou road in connection with my business at Clinton, I was informed on good authority that the settlers along the road were being supplied with harness and other leather goods manufactured at this school, and that orders for these goods are being solicited by parties connected with the school. I was also informed that the manager of the harness department undertook to engage a man to drive him through the Chilcoten country for the purpose of soliciting orders for goods manufactured at the school. I have good reason to believe this to be a fact, and if the matter is allowed to continue in this way it is impossible for any person carrying on a legitimate business in these lines to compete with such an institution as this, as they can manufacture goods at penitentiary prices; in fact I believe that their goods are made up by Indians who pay for tuition in the school, while we have to employ competent and expensive men to make up our goods. It is generally supposed that the object of this department of the school is simply to teach the Indians to make harness, saddles, chaperejos &c for their own use, and not to make up stock to sell. Whether this is a fact or not, I do not know, but I understand that it is the intention of the parties who are in charge of the school to do a considerable amount of business in lines of goods manufactured by Indian pupils, assisted by their teachers. I therefore desire to be informed whether or not the managers of this school are authorized by the Indian Department to carry on business in this way, and if so, how the profits derived therefrom are directed to be applied. I forward by today's mail copies of this letter to Mr. Mara, M.P., and to Mr. A.W. Vowell, Supt. of Indian Affairs at Victoria. Should any correspondence ensue regarding this matter, I would ask that my name be not mentioned, unless it is considered quite necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nE. C. Davison\nOttawa, June 1st, 1894.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Barnard,\n\nI have the letter addressed to you by Mr. E. G. Davison, of Kamloops, with reference to trade in harness and leather goods, which he alleges is being carried on by the Indian Industrial School at Williams' Lake. Upon enquiry I find the Department of Indian Affairs is not aware that the Industrial school has been carrying on any such trade, but of course steps will be at once taken to find out what truth there is in your correspondent's assertions. The Indian Superintendent for British Columbia has been communicated with today, and before long I trust I will have some definite information to give you on the subject.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nP. S. Barnard, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nConcierge No.\n\nNaturally there should be the utmost care taken in the matter of the Indians, but not in the manner of the present one, which is merely a formality.\n\nJune 1, 1894\nOttawa, 19th June, 1894.\n\nThe Honourable T. Wayne Daly,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe undersigned begs to direct the Minister's attention to the letter hereunder of the 7th instant from Mr. Superintendent Vowell respecting the complaint which has been made on account of the Industrial School at William's Lake selling manufactured articles. The undersigned fully concurs in the views expressed by Mr. Vowell; and he would state that other Industrial Schools conducted upon the per capita system sell articles manufactured by the pupils, and it has never been suggested that they should be in any way restricted in disposing of their products. The amount contributed by the Government to these schools is not sufficient for their entire maintenance, and the management must sell the product of the industries taught in the institutions in order to provide sufficient revenue. It would be impossible to effectively teach trades to the Indian boys if the schools could not dispose of the manufactured articles.\n\nActing Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Office.\n\nVictoria, 7th June 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a communication received from Mr. J. McEwen, of Kamloops, B.C., together with copy of letter referred to by him as having been written by Mr. E. G. Davison & F. L. Barnard Esq., M.P., in connection with the action options in charge of the W.M. Lake Industrial School in regard to the sale of timber and other leather goods stated to be manufactured at that school. That school is conducted on the per capita system and the Roman Catholic authorities allege that that allowance is not sufficient to maintain the institution and the question arises whether or not they are justified in utilizing the funds today for pupils.\n\nThe Deputy Sect. Genl.\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nfor the purpose of assuring the funds at their disposal for the education of the pupils being instructed at the school. It has been heard that the settlers, farmers, and others, find it a great convenience, as well as an appreciable economy, to have such facilities for obtaining the articles wanted, as well as having such repair as are needed done without the delay necessarily entailed by having to send to distant places; and it is most encouraging to know that the Indian children are acquiring such proficiency in skills of labour, which should be encouraged as much as possible. From my own point of view so long as the vendors of such articles as are wanted comply with the laws of the country as to licenses, etc., a matter for the consideration of the local authorities\u2014I don't see why they should be interfered with.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cheque sent me for the 2nd Quarter of this financial year was short of $387.83, the cheque for the third Quarter was short of $693.32, and if the Department treats me as before, the cheque for this fourth Quarter will be short of $602.01, what makes an amount of $1753.16. I appeal to the sense of honesty and justice of the Department and hope that it will pay all the balance, due to me, some way or other. If there was a misunderstanding somewhere, it is not fair, it is not honourable.\nhonourable for the Department, to lay on me all the burden, especially as I had nothing to do in the matter. I have in my hands a copy of the contract passed between his Lordship Bishop Durieu and the Indian Department where it is clearly stipulated that the Bishop does not accept the running of the School at Williams Lake at the capitation grant of $150.00 per annum, unless the Government agrees to pay at least for 50 pupils. Now, I am not aware, and I was never officially notified that such a contract, by consent of both parties, had ever been dissolved. We have exhausted all our means to fix the Girls Buildings and start the School and now we are heavy in debt and if the Government does not pay us what it promised, we are in a lurch without hope of coming out of it. Hoping that you will see the justice of our cause and come promptly to our relief.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour most obdt. Servant,\n\n(Sgd) J. M. J. Lejacq. O. M.

Payne Hall,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to call your attention to the accompanying letter from the Rev. Robert Lajeunesse, Principal of the Williams' Lake Industrial School, B.C., on the subject of the complaints made on account of his having disposed of certain supplies manufactured by the pupils under his charge, and more especially on regards harness and leather goods. If the amount contributed towards the support of the school and similar institutions, by far the greater portion is paid out for salaries and wages, and unless such burdens can be made self-supporting, the Department will, as a consequence, have to incur increased expenditure to continue to instruct them in handicrafts, the main purpose for which such institutions have been established.\n\nWhen one looks into consideration that nearly all of the pupils are unskilled laborers working for such short hours, the undersigned fails\nfails to see why any traders should fear competition from such a source.\n\nIt is well to be borne in mind that the money expended in wages of instructors, which is all spent in the locality, and the purchase of the raw material to be manufactured, to say nothing of the large quantity of supplies which have to be obtained in the immediate vicinity of the school, is of great benefit to many while the restriction which the complaint wishes to have enforced is solely in the interests of a few.\n\nThe correspondence relating to this matter is marked for your perusal.\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, 23 July 1894\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd ultimo and with further reference to my report of the 7th ultimo relative to the sale of harness and other leather goods manufactured at the Williams Lake Industrial Indian School, I have the honour to submit herewith, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Rev. Mr. Lejeune, Principal of the School, bearing on the subject, and giving full details of the system which he has introduced into the School, the results thereof, and the attitude which he has assumed in regard to this matter; all of which I trust may meet with your favourable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAllan Macdonald,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNew Westminster, 14th July 1894\n\nA.

Barnard was duly received and in answer I will state that Mr. Davison made a trip round in connection with his business he called at the Mission, was shown over the shop, saw the boys at work: as he spoke of establishing a branch house at 150 Mile House we welcomed him, we told him that we were ready to give him all the goods manufactured at the Mission shop at a price that would leave him a margin for a fair profit. We do not want to run opposition to anybody, to interfere with anybody's legitimate business: all we want is to have an outlet for our stock: the Government cannot expect us to put up a shop, buy tools and materials, pay high wages to a Master of Trades and then prevent us from disposing of our stock.\nstock. The firm of Eagle and Paxton and the\nfirm of Veith & Borland are importing saddles and\nharness already made, we offered them all the\ngoods manufactured at our shop at a reason-\nable price; we did not come as yet to any\nterms.\n\nThe shop was started last Fall and the\nnet gain up to date is $123.33, giving credit\nto the shop for everything, even repairing shoes\nfor pupils. We have actually $763.92 invested\nin that Department: so the gains are not much\nmore than the interest on the capital invested.\nUp to date we have made and sold 5 sets of\nwheel harness, 1 set of single harness, and\n2 Saddles: the single harness was bought by\nthe Mission itself: the rest of the proceeds\nis repairing saddles, harness, shoes, etc. for\nthe Mission, the Indians and everybody. As yet we\nnever advertised either through the papers or\nby Circulars of any kind, the people came to\nus by themselves, but we intend to advertise, and\nto send Circulars, even to go round and so-\nlicit orders, if we cannot dispose of our stock\nto the Firms mentioned above, otherwise the\n\nshop\nshop will not pay expenses, nor give sufficient work to the pupils so that they may be able to learn the trade thoroughly.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

He is incurring debts now and then. He accuses both by us of having deceived him by assuring that the Government would provide for fifty pupils from the very opening of the Industrial School.\n\nI solemnly beg of you to lay again and once forcibly before the Indian Department that the said Industrial School was established at the very request of the Honorable, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs with the precise provisions and condition made by him that fifty children would be kept at the School.\nthe school from the first year and that said number would be increased afterwards. Now is it that after four years the number of children is reduced to thirty-five only.\n\nThe Rev.

I would respectfully ask you to use your influence to get the Government to give a grant for fifteen additional pupils this session of the parliament, thus all such bitter complaints will be at an end and the intermediate parties, you and me employed by the Government in negotiating the establishment of said school will cease to be under the ban of blame as we have been these last years.\n\nThe Indian Department should shield you from all blame in the matter, you who have worked so well and still working arduously for the benefit of the service.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant\n\nVice Paul Durien\n\nR.

Vowell\nvisited this school,as directed,on the 3rd ultimo,\nwithout having notified the school authorities of\ntheir intention to inspect it.They have each made a\nseparate report.Mr Bell's report was first received\nand he deals with the statements ad seriatem,and\nstates that no whites or half-breeds are at the\nschool;that in addition to harness-making,farming\nin all its branches,milking,dairying and gardening\nare taught;that statement 3 is untrue; that although\nthe harness-shop is carried on on a paying basis,no\none complains that there is a cut in the prices to\ninterfere with other parties,and he does not think\nthat more than $1000 worth of stock is carried;in all\nhis visits to the school he has found the children\nclean and well clad and that the instructor ia par-\nticularly careful of his personal appearance and\nthat the charge made against him in statement 5 is\nuntrue;he denies that the teaching of the ordinary\nbranches of a common school education is inefficient\nand doubts whether there are any schools in the Pro-\nvince where white children of the same age are\ntaught who can answer questions more readily than the\nchildren of this school; he is not prepared to say\nwhether the school is a money-making institution or\nnot, but states that the children are well trained and taught.\n\nMr Vowell, when forwarding Mr Bell's report says that he will substantially endorse Mr Bell's statements, which he does in his report which was received yesterday. He goes more fully into the charges made, but his finding is substantially the same as Mr Bell's. Mr Vowell states that on his return he called on Bishop Durieu and suggested that instruction be given in carpentry, and was informed that arrangements would be made to have the boys taught this trade. His Lordship also assured him that what the Department most desired would be attended to in connection with this school.\n\nIn the summer of '94 complaints were made through Mr Barnard, M.P., with reference to the trade in harness-making and leather goods carried on by this school, which upon investigation were found to be without foundation.\n\nThe reports of Mr Bell and Mr Vowell referred to are on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Agent Hall and myself has since proceeded to that School having in the meantime advised Int. Agent Hall to proceed)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

During this day I examined carefully the conditions of the pupils, of the dormitories, of the instructors, of the harness shop, offices, floors, etc., etc., and in short everything in connection with the efficient management of the school. Having\nHaving spent the greater part of the day occupied as above I made arrangements to have on the following morning and spend the forenoon in examining the boys and the teachers of education taught them and the afternoon in a similar manner teaching the teaching to be done upon the premises.\n\nOn the 3rd instant Mr. Bell and I arrived at the school at about 8.30 am and during the day the programme prepared as stated was patiently carried out and every act pleasantly as I was highly pleased with the children's attainment and the kind, efficient and painstaking qualities exhibited by the instructive office boys as well as the Rev. Sisters who have charge of the\nThe people looked well and happy, and seemed to have every confidence in, and respect for, their teachers. I will now reply to the separate charges made against the school.\n\n1. \"That the school takes white children and half-breeds.\"\n   Having carefully scrutinized the children of both races, I could discover neither white nor half-breed among them. I was informed, however, that some time ago one or two white children had been taken in, but never charged for under the per capita allowance.\n\n2. \"That only one trade is taught.\"\n   The trade referred to is that of blacksmithing and harness-making, and in addition to that, gardening, general agriculture, pursuits, and care of livestock, etc., is also taught there.\n\n3. \"That one boy, aged 7, is kept at school merely for the work he does, etc., etc.\"\n   There is no truth in that charge.\n\n4. \"That the business shop is conducted for revenue, etc., etc.\"\n   In reference to this charge I cannot join it as my impression that\nthat as a matter of course there is a certain profit derived by the management from what is styled \"the harness shop,\" simply for the reason that the person in charge is a superior workman at his trade; that consequently the work turned out is of a quality above the average, and the material used is of the very best. In particular reference to this matter I would say that the knowledge of such a trade should be useful to the natives or a storekeeping and farming section of the country, since also that not more than 4 or 5 pupils at the school house have been engaged at it, they like it and learn quick and expert, and have told me as easily taught as the average white boy. The demise of the 4 boys it is expected will be quite master of the trade by 20th of June next i.e. can cut and put together and carry on the business all that is necessary in the manufacture of harness of all kinds\u2014working, buggy etc. In further reference to this profit\nprovision every day that the residents and frequent travellers avail themselves of the facilities offered at the school for having repairs done.\n\n5. That the children are dirty and not properly clad, etc., etc. The children appeared clean both as to their persons and clothing and looking well fed and healthy. It must be stated however, that on the first day of my visit that all the clothes the children's clothes were not of a uniform pattern and were very much patched; evidently their working clothes. I called attention to the fact and told the management that it was not a proper school but was supported by the Government and that the appearance of the children in the school room as taken down there was certainly not creditable and not in accordance with what the Department expected. I was informed that the children had other shifts, one for week days and one for Sundays which afterwards came and are very neat and good and of a uniform cut and material but that when the children were let\nlet out, at recess, to play,\nthat they tumbled and\nrolled about so much in\nthe mud and through timbers\nand ditches, etc., that the very\nbest clothes under such\ncircumstances would soon\nbe in need of repair; but,\nhowever, assured that\nwhen attending school\nthey should in future be\nmore suitably clad. The\nappearance of the instructors\nboth on the first and second\ndays of my visit was neat\nand clean and quality\nof his dress as good as any\none. Such I was informed,\nwas his ordinary appearance\nat school.\n\n6. That the teaching of the\nordinary branches of a\nCommon School education\nis very insufficient.

I remark that he states in connection with charge No.8 \"On all my visits to this school I found the children clean and well clad except last visit.\" The fact of his having found them so may be attributed to the fact that he was expected at the school on such occasion and\nand have advised him to in future visit without notice so as he may see the school in its ordinary running conditions and then be able arrange for a visit on the following day when what preparations the management may think desirable can be made for his reception and examination of pupils etc.\n\nForgot to mention that the school hours during winter i.e. to 30th of April, have been 8\u00bd and a half hours each day while during summer, to admits of outdoor training and exercise, the hours are five and a half hours.\n\nBelieving that these herein have conveyed such information as the Department may consider necessary\n\nHave the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Dept.

Leavitt Secretary respecting statements made in connection with the management of the Williams Lake Industrial School.\n\nIn obedience to your instructions I visited the said school on May 2nd 1899 and have the honor to report on each statement charged:\n\n1. \"That the school takes white children & half-breed.\"\n   This statement is not true as there are neither of the above at the school; a great loss, etc. There were 2 white girls and two half-breeds at the school, but more were included in the list of students for which the Department pays.\n\n2. \"That only one trade is taught.\"\n   What is taught at the school is harness making, farming in all its branches, writing and drawing.\n\n3. \"That one boy aged 17 is kept at school simply for the work he does and not for the purpose of his being further educated.\"\n   This statement is also untrue, the boy named has the same hours at school as the balance of the scholars.\n\n4. \"That the harness shop is conducted for revenue and not for the purpose of instructing the pupils.\"\n   This statement is also untrue, the harness shop is conducted for the purpose of instructing the pupils.\n\nIncluding the above articles.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\nI presume that this as well as similar institutions are managed so if possible not to make it a losing affair and no one complaining that there is a cut in prices to interfere with a true picture.\n\nI question the accuracy of the above statement which one half that amount would cover the whole. That the children are dirty and not properly clad and that the instructor does not keep himself tidy and does not present an appearance becoming his position.\n\nOn all my visits to this school I found the children clean and well clad except this last visit; the children were clean but more in the schoolroom in their working clothes which was quite hot and clean. The instructor is particularly careful of his personal appearance and the change which he is in tune.\n\nThat the teaching of the ordinary branches of a common school education is very insufficient.\n\nIn this I must give a complete denial. I question whether there are any schools in the province where white children of the same age are taught. Can anyone the question put to them as readily as these children.\n\nNot in brief this school is successful as a money-making institution but not in the sufficient teaching and training of Indian children.\n\nI cannot say whether the school is a money-making institution or not, but I do know the children are well trained and taught.\n\nSignature\n\nIndian Affairs.

STEWART\nSecretary\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nSt. Joseph's Industrial School\nWilliams Lake B.C. August 15th 1900\n\nO.W. Dowell Esq.,\nSup't Indian Affairs,\nVictoria,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication also enclosed as stated; and in answer to the divers complaints made against this Mission by Mr. O.E. Caron Gibson managing director of the Cariboo Trading Co., in his letter dated July 23rd 1900 I beg to state as follows:\n\nThe above gentleman accuses us of engaging in a regular trading business and being subsidized by the Government we should not be allowed to compete with those who receive no assistance from the Government and to prove his assertions he says:\n\n1st That we have a large house and Blacksmith shop at 3 Mile Creek.\n\nTo this we say: We have a small shed erected thereon mentioned size 16 x 24 feet which was put up there for storing our farm products and receiving freight consigned to us from Atherton instead of having to go and get same from 1st Mile House a distance of seven miles. This is the large warehouse alluded to in the above paragraph.\n\nWe emphatically deny having a Blacksmith shop at 3 Mile Creek nor have we any interest in same. The facts are that: On the 17th day of March 1900 Mr. John Doherty secured a 30 years lease from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate who are incorporated in this Province with...\nheadquarters at New Westminster and owners of the St. Joseph's Mission property. Said John Doherty built a blacksmith shop on the land (5 acres) located near the mission, near our warehouses.\n\nFrom the above you will at once see that Mr. Doherty is the sole owner of the Blacksmith shop and is conducting same as a private business enterprise; consequently the following assertion of Mr. Carson Gibson is wrong \"that although by acting through an agent at 3 Mile Creek we may pretend to be disinterested in the Blacksmith Shop while benefitting...\"\n\n2nd - Mr. Carson Gibson says that at 3 Mile Creek hay and grain are supplied and sold through their agent at the Blacksmith Shop setting prices to an absurd figure and making a profit which they are enabled to do owing to their Government subsidy.\n\nWe are quite astonished to hear that Mr. Carson Gibson complains of our setting prices on hay and grains particularly on hay we were under the impression that it was the reverse; We never sold any hay for less than $1.50 a pound, while he sells for $1.60. A small portion of our grain was sold by Mr. Doherty at $2.50 per pound and we were and still are under the impression that we were getting the market price. I may further add that Mr. Carson Gibson was offered our grain at the same figure and refused to take it.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\ncompel us to follow his example in this or any other matter.\n\nI may also add that Mr. Carne Gibson, Hotel Keeper, Merchant, Farmer, Stock Raiser, and consequently a wealthy man may have known views on these questions but the poorer classes such as tenants, miners, working men etc., also have very different views on the same questions and are entitled to use the same arguments as Mr. Carne Gibson and argue that as we are being subsidized by the Government we should control the price of our products; the last named persons being the great majority and the support of our district are entitled to a hearing as well as Mr. Carne Gibson.\n\nThe mission has a farm here and has had it for the past thirty years; during that time they have worked and operated it just as they are doing today. They have fulfilled all the requirements of the law, are paying taxes, are British subjects and at the time the clerical authorities of the Diocese agreed with the civil authorities to establish and manage the Industrial School, no conditions or objections were made to the farm or management of the farm.\n\nMr. Carne Gibson says \"The mission people now have a harness shop, Butcher shop, etc.\"\n\nMr. Carne Gibson has certainly been misled for we have no Butcher shop nor will we ever have. We only sold or gave away beef in fewer cases of great necessity. In the harness shop it is not controlled by the mission but is a part of the Industrial School and I, as Principal of the school in question, am ready to close it tomorrow if the plaint is purchased by the complaining parties or others providing the Government consents to its closing.\n\nAgain Mr. Gibson says that \"While benefitting from all these sources they (the mission people) will not so much as help a tenant by allowing him the slightest credit either for food or seed grain.\" To this allegation we offer a flat denial and it again proves that the complainant is not informed and is guessing merely at what he states. We have quite recently given seed, food and even money to needy families.\nand have done so from time to time from years past and can say confidently that when Mr. Gibson has given as much as we have, he will be tried of Indian trade when conducted on a credit basis.\n\nMr. Gibson says: \"Of course they use their religion to secure cheap labour and other assistance.\"\n\nOur answer to that is that out of the ten men employed by us on the farm or water works not a single one professes the Roman Catholic Faith. Mr. M. M. Times our late school Teacher was a Presbyterian; Mr. Foster who was in our employ for three years as instructor in the harness department was also a Presbyterian.\n\nMr. Gibson says: \"The obvious unfairness of allowing Government assistance to parties to compete in trade needs no comment. The matter was once previously attempted by those same Mission people but was quickly terminated after it had been brought to the notice of your predecessor.\"\n\nTo the first part of the above paragraph. They too state that the Dominion Government does not now nor it ever subsidized the mission to compete against other traders. The subsidy was given for the school and is being used for that purpose. The farming has not nor has it ever had anything to do with the school. Mr. Isaac Gibson certainly has too much knowledge of things to believe that the object of the Government is other than it is, and if he does not mean what he says when he makes the above statement then he should be more explicit.\n\nTo the second part of the above statement he is, I am afraid, again quoting as facts hearsay, for be it understood Mr. Isaac Gibson has only been in business at the 150 mile House for about one year and consequently cannot know what he states to be facts as there is absolutely no truth in the statement. There never was any attempt on our part other than the usual to interfere in business with our neighbours nor have we ever had any such attempt quickly terminated, as he says, by your predecessor. I wish to state that his assertion that your predecessor is false as we never officially knew other than yourself and had no official correspondence on this nor other subject with any other, for the simple reason that there was no school in William's Lake for Indians and your predecessor but it is not...\nhave made the above statement as all his other are on a par with this one.\n\nMr. Gibson says: \"But it is nevertheless a fact this mission people allow their cattle to die of hunger in full view of dry stacks of hay because they think they can possibly make a few more dollars by selling their hay than by feeding the poor starving cattle.\"\n\nMr. Gibson makes this assertion as a fact, consequently he must be alluding to last winter, and if does not mean last winter, he must again be stating not facts but hearsay. Our loss last winter was only one head; and this same gentleman last spring came to us to purchase fat beef, but unfortunately we were not able to accommodate him with any as we required all we had for our own use.\n\nBefore closing this letter I wish to say that we have had an irregular sequel of accusations to answer from time to time, most of which on investigation have turned out to be without foundation but they nevertheless are to us a source of annoyance in the prosecution of our work, all fair minded men will unite in saying is being done well and good. We have erected good substantial buildings for the accommodation of pupils in our charge and while admitting that it was part of our obligations to do so, we must nevertheless claim credit for having put them up in such substantial, large and attractive manner. This object has been accomplished only after great sacrifice and economy on our part and not by any surplus earnings we may have made on the government's grant for I am certain that were it not for the aid we are receiving from our farm we could not be in the position of being able to conduct the Industrial as we have done in the past and as we are prepared to do in the future.\n\nI wish to lay great stress on the fact that the school is conducted independently of the farm and the children are not utilized in the least on it.\nthan in the gardens and dairyery and the products of these two last named industries are not placed on the market but are consumed by the staff and pupils. The staff of the industrial school is under my immediate control and the same rule applies to the farm hands who are controlled by the manager of that branch but in no case does the farm manager assume any responsibility in the school affairs.\n\nThe water system in use here up to the present having been found to be defective we have at an estimated cost of three thousand dollars decided to put in a water system second to none in the district. This could not possibly be done from the earnings we make on the farm and as a result we have in this case to do again what we have been glad to do in the past viz: to take monies earned from the farm to effect our objects. These additional explanations I believe are appropriate to the occasion and are advanced in rebuttal to Mr. Gibson's arguments that our sole aim in our work was dollars and cents and show conclusively that the contrary is the case. I will again state that although we are paid but for fifty children we are actually keeping fifty-eight. Is this not charity? But possibly Mr. Gibson is not aware of this or many more facts which we could advance were we so disposed in our defense in this particular accusation.\n\nBut, Sir, we have the consolation of having to record here that although we have been on several occasions accused and impartial investigations have been instituted we have been always well treated by the officials with whom we have had dealings and as far as we know we have given or tried to give the best returns possible as we intend to do in future for the monies expended on the children committed to our care.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supv.\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance to a promise which I made to you some time ago, I take the liberty to express my views on the conditions of the Williams Lake Industrial School. In your communications of the 13th instant marked C15, X, 2, you state the various reasons which urged the Department to bring the matter of the management of the above named school to my attention with a view that a change for the better might be made.\n\nIt is in your communication that I have the honor to answer. I shall take up the paragraphs of the same one by one.\n\nLet us to the dismissal of the trade instructor in the harness shop and of the Prefect, of outdoor work and discipline.\n\nI do not know what reason the Principal put forth for asking the discharge of Mr. Horan, but I was aware for some time past that Mr. Horan could not remain long in the school and give satisfaction, unless he would abandon his pretensions to do as he pleased. I might mention that this is Mr. Horan's second engagement at the school, he having been obliged to resign in 1896, I believe for having taken too active a part in electioneering against the advice of the Principal: Revd. Mr. Lejeune. Mr. Horan was hired again in the fall of 1899.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 578-1, part 1)\nlast spring he took it upon himself to undertake the employment of Census Commissioner and left the school for three months. On the remark of the Principal that he could not do that, he answered that he had the authorization of the Indian Agent. The Principal should have acted with determination, and in my estimation should have made his hand in his resignation, if he wished to go counter to the rules of the school. On my remark that he should have done so, he said that he thought Mr. Bell had given his sanction to Mr. Moran's absence from the school. He would not dare offer any objection; besides being recently arrived as Principal, and having already been criticized for having made another employee do his duty, he thought it preferable to tolerate Mr. Moran's action. It is well to state here that Mr. Moran is well known in the district and exercises some influence with some people.\n\nThe Principal found out later on that Mr. Bell did not sanction Mr. Moran's absence from the school at the time that he began his census tour.\n\nLately Mr. Moran made himself obnoxious to the proprietors of the 150 mile house and, naturally, the school would suffer from it. Again he owed some important bills for articles bought by and for himself, and delaying the payment thereof was incredible to an employee of the school which paid him a good salary. As to Mr. Brophy, Prefect of our door work, he has disgraced himself twice by going to the 150 mile house, the second time without leave, and then gambled and intoxicated himself.\nHis second absence lasted three days. The Principal was in duty bound to discharge him, first because Mr. Brophy was an employee of the School, secondly because of the scandal to the Indians.\n\nThe Department might here ask why not get better men? We have tried to get the best we could find for the sum money. The present teacher and Mr. Brophy were hired at Ottawa, purposely. Up to this Mr. Brophy had done very well, and Mr. Fulop, the teacher, gives satisfaction.\n\nWe have to labor under heavy odds, in a district which it is hard and expensive to reach and in which a man accustomed to the social conditions elsewhere, finds it still harder to live. Here's when a young man has realized a little money, he returns to civilization. The temptation to drink is stronger on a man when he is isolated, and the trouble consequent therefrom for the Principal, is increased. You are sufficiently aware of the truth of my remarks on this.\n\nAnd as to the number of pupils which the Department was asked to discharged last November. Some of these pupils had been at the school for eight years and were anxious to leave it; but instead of going the right way about it, went the wrong way. The older ones drew a few of the younger ones with them. This escapee process began a year ago last November, under the incumbency of the former principal, Rev. Fr. MacKinnon. The symptoms of a serious determination to leave school, especially on the girls' part were deep set and it was evident for any one who was acquainted with the Indian character, that they would try again. Many measures were tried but to the only purpose of setting\nthe Indians, as a whole, against the school. The spirits having been once aroused, it was not easy to allay them. Gentleness was tried with the result that, with the exceptions of an occasional lull, the run always became frequent, always under leaderships of those larger girls. During my visit to the Indians of the district in the fall, I saw most of those pupils who had thus failed. To my questions they answered either that they wished to go home, as they had been long enough at school, or that one of the other girls had asked them to go with her, or that the teachers were cross and other equally childish reasons.\n\nIndian parents are too easy on their children, and they believe too willingly what their children tell them. Hence some of them become the abettors of the truancy. When it was rough the parents it was more relative. When the children saw that they were upheld, they launched forth with more vigor; it came to such a pass that it was considered cowardly for one not to run away. Now when we consider the surroundings of the Williams Lake School and the cleverness of the Indian youths to hide, it is easy to realize how a set of determined children could defy the strictest vigilance, and carry out their well laid plans. I must say, however, that beyond the running away no child became guilty of any grievous misdemeanor. It was quite serious enough as it was. During my visit with the Indians in October I spoke to them on their duty with regard to the school. All showed a good spirit.\n\nAs a practical conclusion the principal culprit\namongst the children had to be removed from the possibility of giving bad example again, hence the request for the discharge of such a number at the time.\n\nSince then the girls have improved perceptibly, of course greater care was taken than ever to remove all reason, either of complaint or disorder. You may well imagine the concern the previous state of affairs gave to all those who had any interest in the school.\n\nAs to the accusation of the lax management,\n\nOne of my reasons when I asked the Department a year ago, to allow a change of Principals for this School was precisely to insure a better discipline in the Institution. I am convinced that the present principal has the qualities of a good disciplinarian and his work so far proves it. Any one may come to the school at any hour and find good order & cleanliness in all of the Departments of the Institution.\n\nThen why this disposition of the children to run away? Some of the pupils had begun their pranks before the present principal came in office. In the foregoing lines I have analyzed the symptoms of the disorder and it is apparent that it was not with the arrival of the principal that the truancies began. There was even a good few months before the truancies were repeated. I think that the girls were determined to carry out their intentions in spite of any body.\n\nAs to the boys, only a few ran away during the summer. True the principal insisted with the employees that they should do their duty. A refectory, Mr. G. Veil, seeing that he was repeatedly found in fault, asked to go. He did not appreciate the principal's way of doing\nbusiness. He had been accustomed to do a little as he pleased. Later on Mr. Bridger, the teacher, also left, giving for reasons that he could beat his position but in reality I think that was not his motive.\n\nHe did the boys harm by talking to them about the Father's want of love for the Indians etc. He also made the boys write to their parents to complain. This man was instrumental in putting an idea in some of the boys heads that they were big enough and that they could earn money if they left the school, and that the school was keeping them to get work out of them. I might also mention that the previous principal, Rev. Mr. Roycevin was deservedly popular with the white people, as a whole, and his removal was not liked; his successor had to suffer a time as a consequence of a measure to which he was a stranger.\n\nYou know the conditions of the country up there to realize that such a state of mind is possible with the people. Besides there have been, to your knowledge periodical attacks on the Mission folks by people who were urged by motives other than love, either for the Mission, the school or the Indians. Everything that happened at the school is subjected to their criticisms and blame is cast on the Fathers. Naturally the new principal came in for a part and without being known, was described as a hard man. His opinion is turning in his favor.\n\nAs to law among us regards ethical training, I do not know the exact meaning which is intended by \"ethical training\". If it means moral training, I must say that the children are no worse than\nother children of the same race and class. Everything is done to inculcate the principles of religion and morality and to watch the practice thereof.\n\nIt is more true to say that the stricter these moral directions are attempted to have enforced, the more Indian children will find the school irksome.\n\nI will conclude: Indians, although desirous of profiting of the benefits of which the schools are intended to confer, feel the strain of remaining long at the task very severe. Children surely feel more than their parents, and parents are too tender hearted to correct their children when they complain.\n\nIndians have a holy horror of anything which smacks system and order. Now these are precisely the things which have most to be insisted upon in a school. Hence the opposition found in those who are to be benefitted by the training. It is not a subject of wonder for me that we find the greatest difficulty in dealing with the Indians from that habitual and innate disposition to shirk what is so disagreeable to them. They do not realize the weakness in their character and point it out to conclude that when Indian children are brought face to face with the necessity of going against their hereditary inclinations to indulge in their love for independence and are restrained in their habits of disorder, it is not surprising that they should wish to throw off the yoke of discipline.\n\nI trust that this difficulty which has arisen in the Williams Lake School will be thoroughly and impartially examined by those whose part it is to do so, and that responsibilities shall be fixed on those who deserve them.\nthem. If it is the management, then I am willing to allow a change.\n\nI beg to assure you that I am ready to receive suggestions as to what should next be done. These suggestions could, of course, be offered only after a thorough sifting of the whole affair.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nDear Mr. Vowell,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) A.

The usual price at this place is $2.50 per ton for hay and $5.00 per ton for grain. The Williams Lake House people believe they have been charging much more than this, but I understand from Mr. Carson and others that this has been the regular practice the Mission people have charged for years, so that the charge that the matter was a previous attempt by those same Mission people has been quickly terminated after it was brought to their attention.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am unable to report an if such be the case it will be an item in our Office. My recollection is that you had no predecessor so far as the industrial school at Williams Lake is concerned, as for the harness shop I am sure the mission people are not making any money from that source and is employed for the teaching of the boys in that class of industry, and I know the Indians would not care to have the shop closed. They do not lack a butcher shop. They have a store building in which meat is kept for the use of the employes and children going to school, and I have been told refuse to sell meat when there was plenty in the building. The charge that they allow their cattle to die with hunger in full view of his stock of hay must be untrue a number of years ago hundreds of cattle died and much all the hay they could eat provided for them. Mr. Moore attested one of the best breed raisers in the District and most humane with domestic animals, look at head count all the hay they could eat provided for them as for raising their religion to secure a keep later and also assisted me. I am obliged informed the majority of the famous employes at the Mission are Hop of the Catholic faith.\n\nSigned the Secretary\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to a matter touching your Department which deeply concerns ourselves.\n\nThe St. Joseph's Mission which as you are aware is heavily subsidized by the Dominion Government every year has seen fit to go into trade and cut prices and compete against outside traders who are not receiving government assistance. While they confined their attention to stock-raising no objection was lodged by us but now that they have gone into a regular trading business we think it is time that something is done to interfere and prevent if possible the gross injustice of subsidized traders being allowed to compete with those who receive no assistance from the Government. The St. Joseph's Mission have a large\nlarge warehouse & blacksmith-shop at a point called\n3 Mile Creek some 3 miles down the waggon road from\nthis point, and here grain and hay are supplied and\nsold through their agent at the blacksmith shop, cutting\nprices to an absurd figure and making a profit which\nthey are enabled to do owing to their Government\nsubsidy.\n\nThe obvious unfairness of allowing\ngovernment assistance to parties to compete in trade\nneeds no comment. The matter was once previously\nattempted by those same mission people but was\nquickly terminated after it had been brought to the\nnotice of your predecessor. I am now writing to ask if\nyou can interfere in the matter for us and I would\nprefer if possible that the matter was terminated\nquietly. I understand the Bishop is a fair-minded man\nand would doubtless take a fair view of the matter\nand see that we have no further cause for complaint.\n\nThe mission people now have a harness-shop, butcher-\nshop, hay and grain stores besides benefitting from\nthe newly erected Blacksmith's shop at 3 Mile Creek\nalthough by acting through an agent they may pretend\nto\npretend to be disinterested in the Blacksmith's shop, while benefiting from all these sources they will not so much as help a siwash by allowing him the slightest credit either for food or seed grain and hence take none of those risks which are forced on all other legitimate traders and of course they use their religion to secure cheap labor and other assistance.\n\nIt is perhaps rather a hard thing to say of any one but it is even worse when it concerns an industrial establishment but it is nevertheless a fact that the mission people allow their cattle to die of hunger in full view of big stacks of hay because they think they can possibly make a few more dollars by selling their hay than by feeding the poor starving brutes, such wanton cruelty is surely not a good object lesson to the young people committed to their charge and for whose education the institution is so handsomely subsidized.\n\nI feel sure that a few words from you will be sufficient to terminate our grievance and remove all cause for any complaint from us.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Sgd) E. A. Carew-Gibson.\nWilliams Lake Agency,\n\nClinton, B.C., July 28th, 1907\n\nTo Mr. Vannell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent of the\n\nAs instructed in your letter of July 13th,\nNo. 614, I proceeded at once to Williams\nLake Ind. School to make an investigation\ninto the subject of some of the aboriginals of a\nnumber of the boys from that institution, one\nof which a lad named Duncan when\ndetained was found dead about 8 miles\nfrom the school, and the facts in the case\nas far as I can gather are as follows:\n\nOn Saturday the 15th instant the boys\nwere in the play ground in charge of their\nteacher, Mr. Parker. The latter had occasion\nto enter the water closet and was returned\nafter a few minutes. 9 of the pupils had\nescaped belonging to Klinine Lake 3\nbelonging to William Lake and 2 from\nAthlit Lake. When they immediately\nwent in search of them, the William Lake\nboys were captured and the teacher\ncaught sight of the Athlit Lake boys and\nmade after them. He overtook the boy Duncan\nand told him to remain where he was\nuntil he returned the other boys, which\nhe did and when he returned to where\nhe left Duncan, he was gone. He could\nnot leave the one he caught and when\nhe got back to the school with him\nit was getting late and cannot be found.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\nWilliams Lake Agency,\n\nClinton, B.C.\n\nIn the meantime the Principal and one of the men on the farm took lanterns and tracked the boy from Williams Lake travelling towards their home. They followed them nearly 4 miles and the Principal got frightened and asked them further, an Indian was sent after them and captured them within 2 miles of where the Principal gave up, and at once returned them to the school. The boy was sent out in search of the missing boy and he was found in a nearby field lying down under a tree quite dead.\n\nI may add that after leaving the school the boys separated; the Williams Lake boys going south, the Allato Lake boys west and the Williams Lake boys north.\n\nI claimed the boys as to their reason for running away from school and the only one reason they gave me was \"the teacher whips.\" I asked them if it was the Principal they said no, asked if he whipped them hard they said \"no\" only on the legs. The teacher showed me his hands where a record of all the chastisement the pupil got is kept, and almost every day they are slightly injured compared to the time I went to school. I asked the boys why they were whipped and the reply was, \"it has not done any harm.\" I have frequent letters from the parents of the boys who have been running away from this institution asking me to find out why the boys turn off claiming they cannot do as from their children.\nMy own opinion is that it is too good a reason for this alarming thing only the wild nature of the Indians hates confinement as they will fight and fight for it.\n\nI think however the school is short-handed the late Principal place has not been filled and the Principal and teacher cannot watch these children carefully.\n\nThe Principal is not at all popular with the children why this is so I cannot find out so he came next to them but this time the late Principal Father Lefebvre who during his stay at the school they ran away all the same.\n\nHave the honor to be\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, March 17th 1902.\n\nFile No. 117,123/10.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo\nand to the communication from this office of the 13th\ninstant, No. 155, V.

He ran away from the school about a year ago, and was found on the road and brought to the Rancheria\u2014he had two companions with him. He gave as his reason for running away that he did not get sufficient food\u2014and that they whipped him too much\u2014he said he was beaten with a quirt\u2014he said the food was bad and he could not eat it, and he was allowed no other food until he had eaten it. He was sick when he arrived home\u2014and when he got better I brought him back to school\u2014I made no complaint to the fathers at the Mission about his treatment. I last saw him alive in July at the school\u2014he seemed well and happy\u2014the next time I saw him was on Monday the 10th February last about 6 o'clock in the evening, a mile and a half this side of Harry Felker's Ranch. He was lying 75 yards off the road in the snow\u2014he was quite dead, but not frozen. His hat was lying about one yard away, and he had marks of blood on his nose and his forehead\u2014the left side of his face had been partly eaten by some animal. I picked up the cap, and saw marks of fresh blood on the inside, and thought it came from his nose\u2014the body was\nwas then brought on a sleigh to my house\u2014I saw his tracks on the road for about 600 yards from where he lay\u2014there seemed no other track except that of the man who first found the body\u2014I concluded he had died of hunger and cold\u2014I received no word from the Mission that any boy had run away\u2014if I had I should have gone at once and hunted for him\u2014he ran away from the Mission about one o'clock on Saturday and must have been dead for nearly 2 days when found.\n\nJohnny X Sticks\n\nS.E.

I looked out for his tracks and first saw them where the road forks about two miles below Harry Felker's. There was no other track, and I kept on the road until I struck his track again on this side of the bridge crossing Chimney Creek. I kept following the track which appeared to have been made the night before for about a mile and a half beyond the bridge, until I found the boy's body lying under a tree, about 70 yards from the road. He was lying on his face, and his hat was lying under his face\u2014there was blood on his cheeks, and behind the ears, and a portion of one cheek had been eaten by an animal\u2014the body was not frozen stiff, but was quite cold and he appeared to have been dead for some hours.

I came to the School on 15th Sept last, and until Jan 1st I had charge of the boys in school hours\u2014there are about 18 boys\u2014since Jan 1st I have charge of the boys out of school all the afternoon except for an hour up till 1-4 past 8 at night.\n\nKnew the deceased boy Duncan Sticks\u2014was a good quiet boy, but lazy at his lessons\u2014had occasion sometimes to punish him\u2014never punished him severely\u2014used a leather strap across the legs\u2014seldom exceeded 6 blows.\n\nRemember the day he ran away\u2014knew of no particular reason why he should have run away on that occasion.\n\nAm aware that the boys have been in the habit of running away very frequently, and on or about the 8th Feb 9 boys ran away between 12.30 and 1 O'clock p.m. after dinner hour. I learned in a few minutes that several boys had run away, and pursued the deceased and Augustine, who were already across the Creek, but not in sight\u2014I soon came in sight of them\u2014they were running hard, and took to the mountain and separated.\n\nI followed Augustine who was furthest ahead, shouting to Duncan to come back\u2014he was then about 20 yards from me\u2014he kept running, and I followed the other boy into the brush where I caught him\u2014I brought him back\u2014Duncan had disappeared and I returned to the school\u2014I told Augustine to call after him\u2014but he wouldn't\u2014Father Capini rode to sugar cane Rancherie and told the Indians the boys were gone, and 3 were brought back.\nback the same night\u2014do not know if any one pursued\nthe deceased that night\u2014deceased had no cut or blood\non his face when I saw him last\u2014I gave the names of\nthe absent boys to the Superior when he returned\nabout 4:30 p.m.\u2014did not make any suggestion that\nDuncan should be followed\u2014did not hear the Superior\ngive any orders to have Duncan followed\u2014knew that he\nwas alone\u2014Duncan did not seem to be ailing, or sick\nbefore he ran away\u2014have often asked the boys why they\nran away, and was told it was because I whipped them.\nThe boys have often complained to me of the food they\ngot, and have sometimes said it was bad\u2014have seen them\nthrow their bread away, or give it to others, but they\nhave never said to me that their food is not suffi-\ncient\u2014I believe I get the same food as the boys, and\nhave no complaint to make\u2014I have never seen meat,\nor any other food given to the boys\u2014I think the diet\nis good & sufficient\u2014the boys had access to water\nfor drinking purposes up to 5 p.m. before January\n1st, but after 5 could not get it without asking for\nit\u2014since the 1st January water is accessible at any\ntime without asking for it\u2014have noticed that the boys\ntake advantage of the extra liberty.

Henry Boening, Superior of St Joseph's Industrial School and Mission said: Took charge there on March 6th, 1901; the first time any boys ran away was in the following May, and since then they have continued running away all the time. I believe more boys run away now than formerly, but can give no reason for it. I have never had complaints from any of the boys as to being punished too much, or being badly fed. Only in November last I asked the boys to give me any reason why they ran away, and Thomas Johnson was the only one who gave as his reason \"the cat is bad.\" I asked the others if they found the food good, and they said \"yes.\" Previous to that at the great meeting held by the Bishop & Fathers at Canoe Creek in October last, the Bishop had asked the children the reason they ran away so often\u2014and some of them had stated it was on account of the food\u2014on being asked for particulars the only article of diet they complained of was the soup which was sometimes given for breakfast during the week, as being the remnants of other meals. Since then orders have been given that the soup should always be made of fresh ingredients and to my knowledge no child has been given food left over from a previous meal. The porridge is made of ordinary oatmeal\u2014and I have tasted it myself and am satisfied it is good and nourishing. Neither girls or boys have ever made any complaint to me that the meat was bad.\n\nOn\nOn two occasions I have found girls throw away meat under the table\u2014the meat was good\u2014I have also seen boys throwing pieces of bread about their dining room but I examined the bread and found it good.\n\nI have never known the teacher punish the boys with undue severity or too frequently, and the strap which he uses I do not think too severe. I sometimes have occasion to administer corporal punishment to the boys myself for special faults, and I use a strap similar to that used by the teacher\u2014I have used on perhaps 3 occasions a saddle whip or quirt to punish boys for immorality\u2014I limit myself on these occasions to 3 10 or 12 blows across the back outside of the clothes on the seat, and on only one occasion have I punished several boys after taking off their coats and then used the ordinary strap. The punishment of the girls is within the discretion of the Sister Superior, but where I consider any punishment given to a girl excessive, I have authority to forbid or lessen it\u2014no case has come to my knowledge of undue severity or punishment in either the girls or boys school, as far as I can remember. I have never known of a girl being confined alone in a room for a week, or being whipped with a strap across the face, at least since my arrival, though I am aware of such a case occurring in the past. No child has ever been confined in a dark room since my arrival, though I have heard from others that cases of the kind have occurred in former times. In my time no girl has been slapped across the face with a strap to my knowledge though I have heard from others that this has been done before my\nheard from others that this has been done before my time. I have no knowledge of any girl either in my time or previous having been stripped naked and whipped. I have no idea why the deceased boy Duncan sticks should have run away on the 8th Feb nor was there any reason to my knowledge for the other boys running away. On returning to the Mission about 5 O'Clock I learned from Mr. Fahey that he had brought back Augustine and at the same time learned that Duncan Sticks was still missing. I asked Father Capini to go immediately to Sugar Cane and tell the Indians the names of the missing boys so that they might hunt for them but was not anxious about Duncan Sticks, thinking that as his companion was caught he would not dare go on by himself, but would return to the neighbourhood of the Mission and get in the shelter of some hay stack. I was out all night hunting after 4 boys belonging to Nanom Lake as one of them had lately been very ill and another had delicate lungs. On Sunday after Mass as nothing had been heard or seen of the deceased I got anxious about him, and got Father Capini to see if he could get some Indian to go after the boy, and he was promised by the Chief that someone would go after him, but am not aware if any one actually went. Between 4 and 5 o'clock Monday afternoon I was informed by the Chief from Sugar-Cane that the boy had been found dead, the other side of Felker's place at Chimney Creek. On Tuesday morning I came up to 150 Mile House and I asked Mr. Hall, the Justice of the Peace, if the ordinary law relating to a Coroner's notification...\nnotification applied to the Indians\u2014he told me it did.\n\nAfterwards I sent Father Capini up, who again asked Mr Hall if a Coroner should be notified, and Mr Hall replied that it would not be necessary, as the Coroner would not go on account of the distance and expense.\n\nMr William Thompson of Horsefly, a Coroner for this district was however notified by Mr Horan, of the Mission, and the present at the Mission at the time took no steps in the matter. Hearing that the Coroner would take no action I offered to go over to Alkali Lake and bury the body as the Indians had decided to bury him on Thursday. No complaint was made to me by the Father or Mother of deceased as to the boy\u2019s treatment at the school. I saw the body of the deceased, and saw some wounds on his face which I was told had been caused by some animal after his death.\n\nHe had not to my knowledge any cut or wound on his face before he ran away. I considered he was in good health and should never have expected him to meet with his death at so short a distance from the Mission. I would myself have gone after the boy, but having been on foot all the time from one o\u2019clock on Saturday afternoon until 7 o\u2019clock on Sunday morning, excepting for 2 or 3 hours on Saturday night hunting after some of the other boys, I was too exhausted to do anything more, and had to leave it to others to go after him.\n\nWitnessed by.

I have run away twice from the school - the last time, I was caught writing letters to the boys and the Priest wanted to whip me, so I ran away. I went as far as Springhouse, and was brought back the next day. I was not whipped then - last winter I was whipped in school for talking to another girl - she hit me with a strap on the head several times - but did not hurt me very much.

Sometimes I have found the soup not very good, but I have never known it to have a bad taste. The porridge for breakfast once or twice a week is made of shorts, and tastes good\u2014other mornings it is made of oatmeal\u2014they get bread and tea besides and on Sunday morning they get Sausage and butter on Friday\u2014the girls have sometimes to be whipped with a strap\u2014generally on the back, sometimes on the hands, and on the occasion when Ellen Batiste was hit on the head, she raised her hands to her head and the blow took part effect on the head unintentionally\u2014I found fault with the Sister on that occasion and I believe it has never occurred since. Sometimes girls are shut up in a room for serious faults for periods varying from a few hours to 10 or 12 days\u2014this is the longest time\u2014this latter has only happened once, they are fed on bread and tea, or water at breakfast when confined as above and get the ordinary\nschool diet for their other meals. If a girl is whipped it is always done outside some of their clothes. Girls are sometimes punished by being made to kneel on the ground for 5 or 10 minutes, but never longer than that\u2014the rooms in which girls may be confined are never darkened. I remember saying to the girls on one occasion that the Government didn't allow enough money to feed them any better, but this was said in a joke. The blow which Ellen Batiste once got on the head raised a mark on her ear and cheek but didn't cut her.\n\nI always see the food given to the boys\u2014it is always good and plentiful.\n\n(sgd) Sister Superior\nS.E.

The boys parent sometimes complain of the children being whipped, and others have written and told us to whip them, if they ran away.

Mr William Thompson a Coroner of this district was at the Mission on that day, and was told about the case by Mr Horan of the Mission, but took no action in the matter. Deceased was not a very strong boy, but had no illness lately\u2014I rode to sugar-cane Rancherie that evening and told the Indians the names of the boys who had run away, and some of the Indians went out to look for them next morning but no Indians went on the Alkali Lake road to look for deceased.

It appeared to be that of a fairly well nourished boy about 9 years of age. The body had no bruises or injuries of any kind; the limbs were also free from injury. On the left side of the face on the upper part of the cheek bone, the flesh had been eaten away by some animal, for a space about one inch in diameter. There was a small wound on the upper part of the forehead, about one third of an inch in extent, crusted by blood\u2014small patches of blood were also found over one eye, and on the left cheek, and some traces of blood were found behind both ears; there appeared to be also a slight bruise on the forehead. The wound or bleeding were not sufficient to cause death, and appeared likely to have been caused by stumbling or slipping and falling against a tree or rock, but did not appear to have been caused by any weapon. I examined the clothes worn by deceased at the time of his death, they were all free.\nfree from traces of blood, with the exception of the cap, on which were several blood stains and a small quantity of coagulated blood. I am of opinion that death was due to cold and exposure, from sleeping out at night in cold weather with insufficient clothes and without food or fire\u2014exhaustion from a long tramp over the mountains in the snow was no doubt a predisposing cause.\n\n(sgd) S.E.

Vowell, who forwarded correspondence had with the Principal and Mr Agent Bell relative to an application for the discharge of nine pupils on the ground of frequent desertions. Their discharge was authorized, as it was claimed that they set a bad example to the younger pupils and to relieve the Principal of their dangerous presence in the school.\n\nOn the 13th ultimo, Mr. Supt. Vowell reported the death of a pupil named Duncan while absconding from the school and stated that he had instructed Mr Agent Bell to visit the school at once and investigate into the circumstances leading to the boy's death. The Department approved of Mr Vowell's action saying that it hoped Mr Bell would, by careful observation and close enquiry, be able to place the true state of affairs at this school before it.\n\nMr Bell's report has just reached the Department from which it will be seen that he does not consider that there was any good reason for the desertions as the pupils are well fed and cared for. The school is, however, he states, short-handed and the Principal is not at all popular with the children. This is the result of Mr Bell's enquiry, and it is not\nnot satisfactory, as he make no suggestions as to how matters might be improved.\n\nMr Supt. Vowell is at present making a tour of inspection of the Fraser and Kamloops-Okanagan Agencies and as he will be passing Ashcroft it would be well if he had the time to visit Williams Lake personally.\n\nAn inquest is to be held to enquire into the circumstances leading to the death of the pupil Duncan, when, no doubt, further facts will be brought to light.\n\nThe school should not, however, be allowed to go on as it is and you will see from a copy of a letter from His Lordship, Bishop Dotenwill, hereunder, that he is most anxious to have the management thoroughly examined into and willing to make any changes that may be suggested.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th of last month and the reply thereto of the 13th ultimo, No. 616, X. 7., on the subject of the apparent lack of discipline and ethical training at the Williams Lake Industrial School and to the death of the pupil Duncan thereof I have the honor to submit herewith for your information on the subject the following correspondence lately received here bearing on the question, viz:\n\nLetter dated the 26th of February 1902 addressed to the Indian Superintendent by the Right Reverend A. Donlevy, O. M. I., Roman Catholic Bishop of New Westminster, B. C.\n\nLetter dated the 28th ultimo from Mr. Agent Bell.\n\nLetter (Private) dated the 28th ultimo from the same source.\n\nPrevious to his departure for the Fraser and Kamloops-Okanagan Agencies last evening Mr. Superintendent Vowell instructed me to place before you these communications that the Department might be in possession of all the facts of the case as known to this office. Yesterday the Indian Superintendent waited upon the Attorney General for British Columbia.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nColumbia who promised a full inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of the pupil Duncan. A request shall be made by this office to Mr. Agent Bell to be present at the inquiry on behalf of the Department the outcome of which will in due course be made known to you.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor the Indian Superintendent, P. C.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nClinton Feb. 28th, 1902\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand on good authority that there is pressure being brought to bear on the Attorney General to hold an investigation as to the cause of the death of the unfortunate boy, Duncan who escaped from the Industrial School at Williams Lake. This matter is being pressed by E.C. Gibson of the 150 mile house, using the late Prefect. On my way down he (the Prefect or Brophy) passed me on the stage and said he was going to the Coast and most likely will interview you. He is a smooth and polished talker but I think what he says should be taken with a great deal of caution. He was dismissed from the School for going to the 150 mile house and getting drunk during the Principal's absence for a day or so and remaining away for several days. For my own part I do not think that an investigation was necessary. However, one of the employees of the school asked the Coroner he had better go and hold an investigation, to which he replied he did not think it necessary. Afterwards the Constable at the 150 mile house asked the Coroner to go and offered him all the assistance he could and he again refused to go and said there was no hint of foul play and considered an inquest unnecessary. Gibson and Brophy are not aware that the Coroner was asked to go.\nbut claim the principal did not want an investigation etc.\n\nI did not wish to write this letter officially as Gibson and Brophy may be innocent in the matter, but as regards the employees of the school and the constable asking the Coroner to hold an investigation, I have this statement from them both.\n\nShould the Attorney General or Mr. Brophy interview you on the matter you will be in a position to tell them what your information is. Brophy claims he kept a memo of everything happening at the school; food, whippings etc., from the day he entered until dismissed and claiming the children did not get half enough to eat.\n\nI certainly do not believe this as the children are looking fat and healthy, and I happened to drop in on them while at dinner and there was abundance of food\u2014true there was no meat, being Lent time.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nE. Bell.\nBritish Columbia,\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\n\n228176\n\nVictoria, 17th May 1902\n\nMEMO.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honour to call your attention to the fact that on the 14th ultimo (over a month ago) I mailed my report upon the inquiry which the Dept. requested me to make in reference to alleged irregularities etc., at Williams Lake Indian School.\n\nI have received no acknowledgment of its receipt by the Dept., and as I had considerable trouble in connection with it, not to speak of my having type-written it myself, I would like to know whether or not the Dept. did receive it?\n\nI may remark that whatever its demerits may have been it could not, at all events, be found fault with on the score of undue brevity!\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that, in compliance with the desire of the Department that I visit Williams Lake School and make full inquiry into the management\u2014as per telegram dated 14th ultimo,\u2014I visited the school mentioned on the 24th ultimo. I arrived at the 156 mile house, some four miles distant from the school, early in the afternoon and although, as far as my knowledge extends, the management was not advised of my coming still as the people residing in that vicinity, most of whom are adverse to that function, are in the habit of expressing their opinion that the coming of the Agent or myself is always known at the same beforehand, I considered it best not to proceed at once to the Mission but to let it be thought that I would go there till next morning. I consequently, and apparently with this intent, remained at the 156 mile house till after 5 p.m. and then drove quietly to the school so as to arrive in time to find the children at their evening meal. I did so and found the young people partaking of their ordinary food which upon examination I found to be good and wholesome. It consisted of soup with bread and rice in it, boiled beef and bread, with tea and sugar. The children appeared in the best of health and spirits and most certainly not indicating by their looks that there was any scarcity of food. The children are always pleased to see me, and look upon me as their friend; I went amongst them and asked if they always had as good a supper and if the food was all\u2014\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nalways as good and sufficient and they smilingly told me it was. After inspecting other departments which I found equally satisfactory I returned to the 150 mile house for the night. Next morning (25th) I returned to the school at an early hour when I examined everything in connection with the management carefully. In the boys class room I with the Indian Agent\u2014 none of the staff of the school being present\u2014 questioned the boys as to how they were treated, dealt with whether they were harshly, treated and if they always had enough to eat, etc., in response nothing could be elicited reflecting in any serious manner upon the management. The boys whose names appear in the evidence taken at the Coroners Inquest (copies of which have been forwarded to the Dept.) were particularly examined by me with the following result\u2014\n\nAugustin, aged 7, his only complaint was that he was whipped on the legs with a strap by the teacher for not knowing his lessons. When I asked him if he was much hurt he laughingly said he was not.\n\nLouis, aged 13, said he ran away because the teacher whipped him on the legs, he was not badly hurt, said he had plenty to eat but that a long time ago he was sometimes hungry.\n\nFran\u00e7ois, aged 10, also ran away because he was punished in like manner; said he had plenty to eat since Father Beening came to the school.\n\nTommy Johnson, aged 12, stated that he ran away because he did not get enough food, and also because he was whipped on the legs.\n\nFran\u00e7ois, aged 10, repeated what the last boy said.\n\nUpon questioning the boys generally as to the shortness of food it came out that sometimes some one or other of them did not get enough bread; I asked them if on such occasions they ever asked for more and they said they did not. I then told them that when they did not have sufficient bread they should ask for more and they would get it and explained\nto them that many of the boys, as I had been informed, often get more than they could eat, the uneaten portion being wasted; and that in future if the piece of bread placed at each boy's plate was not sufficient that the Father or any member of the staff in attendance, upon request, would give them more; they then said that in future they would do so and seemed satisfied. They then after whispering among themselves for a time, said that they would like to get potatoes more frequently at their meals, and that that was all they had to ask for. I afterwards in their presence explained matters to Father Beening, both in respect to the bread and to the potatoes, and he said that certainly the Management would be only too pleased to do what they asked for, and what I suggested, and further that on no occasion had any pupil ever been refused an additional piece of bread, etc., if asked for. In the afternoon, with only the Agent being present, I questioned the girls, who were gathered together in their class room, with the following result:\n\nEllen Babtiste, aged 16, said that she had run away twice and was brought back each time; was whipped at school for talking to another girl; she had plenty to eat all the time. I asked her about being whipped on the head (as stated in the deposition before the Coroner) when she stated that when she was struck on the head with the strap she was holding her hands close to her head and that it was when endeavouring to hit her hands the Sister hit her on the head, which did not hurt much.\n\nThe other girls who had run away when questioned in doing so, said they had none, merely felt like running away, wanted freedom from the restraint of school discipline and wanted a chance to play with the boys, which they never had an opportunity of doing at the school. Before leaving I told both boys and girls how wrong it was to run away as by so doing they, to a certain extent, disgraced themselves by such bad conduct, and also caused much trouble to their parents, to their kind friends, instructors and guardians, at the school, and also the Government which was doing so much for them, etc., etc.\n\nI also impres...\nimpressed upon them that if ever they had any real grievance they should at once mention it to the Principal, Father Boening, who was always kindly disposed towards them and did not want them to suffer in any way or to be uncomfortable; I further told them that if upon any such occasion arising they found that the Father did not help them that then they should tell their parents who would inform the Indian Agent, etc., etc.\n\nThey promised to do so, seemed sorry for the trouble they had caused by running away, and said they would not do so any more.\n\nI may here mention that some dozen letters, mostly written by the girls to the boys, which were found at the school in the girls' desks after they had at different times run away, were produced by the Father (Principal) and that in none of them was mention made of bad treatment either in regard to punishment or to insufficiency or badness of food etc., etc. I was also shown letters from some of the pupils' parents\u2014Fathers and Mothers\u2014in which the Principal is asked to punish their respective children when they don't do what is right, etc. There were other communications written to the Principal by some of the pupils who had run away in which sorrow was expressed for the trouble and anxiety they had caused the Principal and the Sisters by their foolish conduct, etc., in none of which was there any mention made of their having received bad treatment at the School. As previously stated, the real reason given by the girls for running away was that they longed for freedom and for a chance to play with the boys, and such like foolish excuses. The boys, the big ones, wanted to get away because they thought they could get work and make some money; when the big boys ran off the smaller ones wishing to be considered brave and not afraid, etc., followed their example. It was the same with the little girls who I am told were often twitted by the older ones, the latter saying that their smaller companions dare not make the attempt. Touching the reliability of answers received from\nfrom Indian children to questions put at random I may here remark that from my own observation outsiders asking questions can seldom really obtain correct answers inasmuch as the children, in most cases, don't understand exactly the nature of the question put from the fact that they are too timid and don't pay proper attention, etc. I have known them on such occasions to say 'yes' when it afterwards turned out that they would have said 'no,' did they thoroughly understand; consequently, as they are inclined to answer as they think you would like them to, if an outsider wants them to say that such and such a thing is the case it is an easy matter to get them to answer in the affirmative, or vice versa. It may also be mentioned here that there is much jealousy existing in the neighbourhood of the School in connection with the Mission people because the latter raise stock, hay and grain, etc., for the market, which others in the same line of business object to fancying that the Mission has in some way an advantage over outsiders. I have seen the punishment books and do not consider that the punishment awarded at various times was excessive. Letters written by Mr. Bridger and addressed to the Principal were also shown to me which were couched in the most friendly language; in one of these letters he begged to be taken back as teacher or if that position was filled then\u2014to use his own language\u2014he would be glad to go as warden or prefect, or in any capacity. Mr. Bridger, it will be remembered, was formerly a teacher at the school but voluntarily resigned that position on the 9th of June, 1891. As soon as he was clear of the Mission he at once commenced to make the most serious charges against the Management, etc., which he kept up all the way down the wagon road. While at the school I examined all departments carefully: dormitories, store rooms, kitchen, etc., etc., and found all in good order, well kept and clean. There was an abundance of food and clothing on hand in addition to which there was pleasing evidence of the skill of the girls in housewifery and in ordinary and fancy needle work, etc. I was busy all day at the school where every assistance was given me by the management to inspect and observe everything down to the minutest detail. I left for the 150-mile House at 6:30 p.m.\nAt 7:30 next morning (26th) I started for Alkali Lake\u201433 miles distant,\u2014where at 2 p.m. I saw all the Indians at their village they being at the time gathered together for religious exercises under their Missionary Priest. They had no complaints to make about the school, expressed themselves as being sorry for all the trouble caused by the running away of the children from time to time; and promised to do all they could to put a stop to any future irregularities of the kind. I explained to them that if ever they knew that their children were not well treated they should notify the Agent, and if he did not attend to such complaints then to apply to me. They thanked me and said that they would be sure to do so. While at the village I questioned Christine Haines and Ellen Charlie who both persisted in stating that the meat was bad in the soup and that at times the bread was like putty. Ellen Charlie said she was whipped sometimes for talking to and looking at the boys; whipped on the hands mostly, sometimes her clothes were turned up. Regarding these girls it must be remembered that they were discharged from the school for bad conduct. At about 4 p.m. I left on my return when the Indians told me at parting that they were very glad to see me, and seemed highly pleased with my visit. Next day (27th) I arranged so as to get to the Mission unannounced by the time the children would be sitting down to their midday meal. I managed to do so and found the children partaking of roast potatoes and gravy, boiled rice sweetened, bread with tea and sugar; they had drippings on their bread which they seemed to enjoy very much. It being lent they had no meat. The staff as at present composed is as follows,\u2014Principal, Father Beening, who has general supervision; Sister Superior, Euphrosia, now engaged as head teacher for the boys; this arrangement it is hoped will work well as the pupils know the Sister and will advance better under her instruction than under the teaching of a comparative stranger which owing to the many changes on account of\nthe difficulties experienced in procuring the services of an eligible male teacher has been too much the case in the past. The Sister Superior is also head teacher for the girls; their hours for instruction not being the same as that arranged for the boys there can be no confusion of duty in connection with the dual undertaking.\n\nSister Dennis, assistant teacher;\nSister Joannes, who is engaged in instructing the girls in needle work, knitting, making and mending the girls clothes, and in fancy work;\nSister Gonzales, prefecting generally;\nSister Fabrian, head cook and housekeeper;\nSister Glaver, assistant cook, etc.;\nMr. Fahey, agricultural instructor for the boys who being small are only capable of very light work;\nM. Lajoie, carpenter.\n\nThere is no harness instructor at present. The Management is seeking for a suitable man to undertake the teaching of shoemaking and harness repairing, etc.\n\nIt is intended to put 4 of the boys (largest) at practical gardening on a piece of land especially provided for them where they will be taught the cultivation of grain, roots, the cutting and saving of hay and the raising of vegetables, etc.\n\nThis last mentioned work was not carried on to any extent last year the boys being so small and also owing to the fact that amongst a certain portion of the surrounding settlers and store keepers an outcry was raised to the effect that the Mission was making money out of the boys' labour which enabled crops to be raised more cheaply than outsiders could do, a most erroneous impression, as the work at any time done by the pupils could not reasonably be considered as a factor in the economic working of the Mission lands. I may here refer to the letter of complaint written by Mr. Carew Gibson, of the 150 mile house on the 23rd July, 1900, and to other correspondence.\ncorrespondence of a like nature. In discussing matters with the Rev'd Principal he informed me that sometimes such of the boys as were given to wetting their beds were not allowed to drink water after supper; I told him that I thought it was bordering on cruelty to refuse a boy a drin of water if he was thirsty; he replied that in most cases they were not actually in need of a drink but took it out of mischief, etc.; he, however, promised that in future if any boy wanted a drink, saying he was thirsty, it would be given to him. I also suggested that corporal punishment should not be resorted to except in very extreme cases and that I thought good advice and kindly treatment would be far more effective in gaining their confidence and inducing them to pay proper respect to the school management, etc. The Principal remarked about the bread that sometimes there might be a batch that was not quite a success when it was doubtless a little doughy, this, however, did not often occur and when it did the Management fared no better than the pupils. As to the soup being thin and like water he granted that at times it might not have been extra strong but that always it was made out of good meat when it was stated that the meat was rotten such a state was not true as every care was taken to have things clean and sweet in every department. Later I examined the meat safes and found them clean and well ventilated. In this connection I must state that in nearly every instance the pupils said that since Father Boening came and took charge the food has been good, but that before his time on many occasions it was bad. In conclusion I would state that the inquiry held will I feel sure be beneficial in every respect as giving confidence to the children that they are being looked after by the Department and also in letting the Management understand that their actions in the conduct of the school are under close observation, etc.\n\nIt\nIt has also proved highly satisfactory to the Indian for the same reason, and I trust that there will be much less in the way of irregularities to complain of in the future than unfortunately there have been in the past.\n\nList of punishments given by S.L.

On the 15th inst., as I was preparing to leave Vancouver for Victoria I received the Department's telegram of even date re my visiting William's Lake and inquiring into the management of the Indian Industrial School there situated. On the 14th, I wired \"Returned last night, will write inclosing depositions re Coroner's Inquest.\" On yesterday a copy of the depositions was duly forwarded to the Dept. under cover of letter dated 17th inst., No. 198, Y/3. The evidence of the pupils point to bad and unsatisfactory food, to undue punishment and to the restriction of water for drinking purposes. On the other hand the Teachers and those superintending the Management declare the food to be of good and wholesome quality, and abundant for all requirements. Judging, however, from the repeated and determined efforts to escape made by both boys and girls it must impress one with the belief that all is not well, especially as the pupils in other Industrial Indian Schools in the Superintendency do not seem to be so actuated; although at times (as there will be at all schools whether for whites or Indians) some one or other of the pupils may attempt to run home. I will in accordance with the wishes of the Department leave here on the 20th inst. and proceed direct to the school where I will endeavour to get at the bottom of the trouble. I, however, apprehend much difficulty in\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nbeing able to see to my own satisfaction on account of the contradictory nature of the statements made by the interested parties.\n\nThe trouble at the school having assumed such serious proportions and having been more or less brought to the notice of the public, it is highly necessary, in the interests of all concerned, that the inquiry be made.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Superintendent.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nAn application is being forwarded by His Lordship Bishop Dotenwill of New Westminster, B.C. for the usual capitation grant of $130. per annum for additional pupils at the William's Lake Industrial School. Father Boening, the Principal of this School, writes me to assist him in securing the grant and to advise him as quickly as possible whether the grant is likely to be passed or not, as he is anxious to enlarge the premises if the grant can be secured. This school is the only institution in the extensive district of Cariboo and Lillooet which looks after the education of Indian children. I have visited the school several times and believe that they are doing excellent work. To my mind there is no good reason why the grant should not be extended to cover the number of children attending the school and for the last two years there have been as many as 100 Indian children in attendance there.\n\nTrusting that you can see your way clear to recommend the additional grant, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 23, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Duncan Ross, M.P., member for Yale and Cariboo, writes stating that His Lordship Bishop Bentenwill, of New Westminster, is forwarding an application for an increase of pupils at the Williams Lake Industrial School. Mr. Ross says that he sees no good reason why the grant should not be extended to cover the number of children attending the school, which for the last two years has reached about 100.\n\nIf they have ever had 100 in attendance there, their returns do not show it; neither does Mr. Inspector Green's reports. The highest enrollment shown by Mr. Green is 55. The Department pays for 50 at $130.00 each. Fifty is the limit of all the industrial schools in British Columbia, with the exception of the Cocqualeetza Institute, and if the number were increased at Williams Lake, all the other Roman Catholic schools would expect similar treatment.\n\nThe British Columbia Indians have excellent opportunities of earning good wages in the fisheries, canneries, on ranches, in lumber camps and saw-mills and in other lines of manual labour, and it does not need industrial school training to fit them for such work. In fact, the time spent in schools of this class does\ndoes not fit them to gain a livelihood in these call-\nings. There are nine industrial schools, eight boarding\nschools and forty day schools in operation in British\nColumbia, which furnish all the educational facilities\nthe Department is fairly entitled to supply. The clergy\nseem to be going wild on the subject of Indian educa-\ntion, and it is time that some limit should be fixed\nas to their demands.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 24, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., recommending that when an application from His Lordship Bishop Denewill, of New Westminster, B.C. for an increased number of pupils at Williams Lake Industrial School is received, it may be granted; and in reply I beg to say that on receipt of the application referred to the same will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Of children from 6 to 15 years incl. there are 177 and of children from 16 to 20 years incl. there are 311. For this grand total the Williams Lake industrial school is the only school, no boarding nor day school exists in this agency.\n\nYear by year the Indians are learning more and more to appreciate the school and its work. This is fully shown by the great number of applications for admission, even from the farthest points of the district.\n\nThough receiving a capitation grant for only fifty children this institution, for the past few years, has kept between 60 and 70 children, the present atten-\ndance being 76. Of course this was done under great hardships and debts. A glance at the financial statement will convince anyone that such a large attendance cannot possibly be kept up indefinitely without a permanent, substantial grant by the Department.\n\nIn the contract between the Government and the late Bishop Durieu for the establishment of an industrial school here, it is explicitly stipulated that the Department expects that this number (50) will be afterwards augmented to the full capacity of the two buildings.\n\nIn view of these facts and also in consideration of your own solicitude for the advancement of the Indians, I feel assured that my appeal will not be in vain and that you will grant my humble request.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant\n\nH.

According to the blue book of 1906 the population of this agency is 978 Indians, of whom 758 are Roman Catholics. Of children from 6 to 15 years old there are 127, and of children from 16 to 20 years old, there are 311.

Boening\nPrincipal\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, October 28th, 1907.\n\nFile No. II7, I23.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter (not dated) received at this office on the 26th instant, through Mr. Agent Bell, of the Williams Lake Agency, from the Rev. H. Boening, Principal of the Williams Lake Industrial School, asking that the grant allowed the institution under his charge be increased from 50 pupils, as at present, to 80 pupils. Mr. Bell sent no covering letter, as far as can be ascertained, with the principal's application and he will be asked to report on the subject without unnecessary loss of time.\n\nFor the information of the Department it may be stated that the Williams Lake Industrial School is the only one of the kind within the confines of the Williams Lake agency. As clearly set forth by the management of the school, there is a very large number of Indian children in that extensive agency who have absolutely no means of providing an education for their offspring, more especially an Industrial\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nindustrial training, such as can be had at the institution in question. Good results have been obtained for years past at the school, which has turned out many pupils well able to engage in the several trades taught at the institution. But as only a small proportion of those seeking admittance can be accommodated owing to the comparatively limited funds of the school the possibilities of the institution cannot be taken full advantage of. To remedy matters in this respect I would strongly urge that, as requested, the grant be increased to 80 pupils.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

The Department considers that it is most essential that farming should be taught to all the boys who are old enough and strong enough to work and you should, when you next visit the locality, impress upon the Indians the necessity of having the boys taught farming in all its branches, so that they may become self-supporting. Agent Gordon will be instructed to do this also. As for the objections of the white settlers living near the school the Department does not see how it can affect them except for good and, in any event, the prejudice of the white settlers should not be allowed to interfere with the most important branch of industrial school work.\n\nYour suggest that something should be done in respect to the water supply, as the present supply is not sufficient for fire fighting, but you have not stated what\n\nRev.

He has been informed that the matter of their retention would appear to be a question of discipline. However, the Department wishes you to communicate with the Indians whose children have left the institution and advise them that they must at once be returned to complete their term.

The Agent, Mr. Ogden, will be communicated with. You may further advise the Indians that if the children are not returned to the school it will be necessary to enforce Section 12 of the Regulations, a copy of which is being sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to appeal direct to you in regard to a matter that we consider of the greatest importance for the welfare of this school. Since a month that the pupils have returned from their holidays the boys have been more or less all running away from school. The girls have been free so far from this epidemic but proofs are not wanting that they too mean to do likewise. We are at a loss to explain this running away on such a large scale as for the last few years we have been practically free from it. You easily understand our pain and our grief at such a state as we are all one mind and one soul to do everything for the children given over to our care. We cannot have an explanation from the pupils and the parents do not say anything either. Hence we beg you to kindly have someone come here and see the school and the Indians and hold a general inquiry so that these sad dispositions may soon cease.\n\nI take the liberty of adding a few letters written by some girls to their parents. I think these letters good proofs in favor of the school as the girls did not think otherwise than that these letters were to be sent home.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH. Boening\nPrincipal.\nDear Father,\n\nI received your letter and money that you have sent me last week. Just tell you that I am well. All the Sisters and girls are well too. I like to stay here at school. One of the school girl died on August 23rd. She was sick and she went home. Father Superior went with her up to Fort George. And she was very sick and she died there. Please be kind enough you will tell my brother Eliza and Priscilla good-bye for me. When you wrote to me you said that my little sister was sick, but she may get better and I will always pray for her all the time. I wish you could send me Louie and Priscilla's photo. I am sending pictures to four of my little friends and my mother. Their names are Alice Priscilla and Eliza. Please be kind enough to bring Joseph back as soon as possible. I don't know why they ran away from school. This school is very good for him to stay. I was sorry when I saw that he ran away again. This happened while Father Superior was at Fort George. You must bring back right away and not listen to stories stories. Joseph and the other boys are as well treated as I am and they also must be glad and happy.\n\nSeptember 4th, 1910.\nhere if they do work and obey.\n\nyour loving daughter\n\nLouisa Bobby.\nMr. Baptist\nAlexandra\nDear Father:\n\nIt is not long time before I have not seen you, but I thought I would write you a little letter today. I am always happy though I feel lonesome when I think of you and my brother and sister. We came safely on the stage and on the boat, and Freddy brought us to his house so we stayed there for the night. It is pretty cold around here already and nearly all the vegetables are frozen. We see Jerome and Baptist pretty often they come to church nearly every Sunday. We began our studies a month ago already and the school year opens very nicely for everyone. I guess you are finished with your hay now, the hay around here is nearly all finished. Two or three weeks ago two automobiles came here, so some sisters and some girls had the pleasure to take a ride in it. They went to the yellow lake near the mission. Please tell us where Juliana and Jimmy are staying now. And about Alice and Jimmy if they are well or not. I suppose all the steamers are running on the river yet except the poor...\nCharlotte who is drowned. We picked pretty much berries this year. Sarah found her umbrella at 50-Mile House, and another thing when we came back Sister Superior gave us two thimbles as a present.\n\nI have no more news, hoping you are well. I send my best wishes to all and a kiss to Alice.\n\nFrom your loving daughter\nAnne J. Baptist.\nDear Father:\n\nI thought of writing you a letter today, though I have not much news to tell you. I am always in good health. It made me sad to hear that you were not all very well. But I hope you will soon be well again.\n\nEulalie from Stuart's Lake died on August 23rd. She was brought from 150 to Soda Creek in an automobile with Father Superior and another girl who accompanied the sick girl. From Soda Creek Father took the steamer. When they arrived at Fort George it is said she was sinking lower and lower. Father came back on Tuesday night, on arriving at 150 he found a telegram there. The poor girl was dead. In the morning Father said high mass for her. There is nobody sick here now.\n\nWe enjoy our time very joyously. Summer is lonesome for I have so much playmates. And besides the Fathers and Sisters are always kind and good to us. As I already told you I had not much news. I close my letter with all my best wishes for you.\n\nYour affectionate daughter,\n\nRosy Louis.\nDear Father:\n\nIt is not very long since I have left, but I am a little lonesome without you. I am happy all the time for I have a lot of playmates here at school. We arrived here on the 3rd of August, we have passed by the Sugar Cane road to come back, and we were tired before we reach. A few days after we arrived Sister Superior gave us something because we came back on the third and count it just the same time as the other girls. The mission girl was sick and so she went home, and died on the 21st of August. Thursday afternoon, she was from Sturats Lake, we all prayed for her. I suppose all the people are well, and also my brother and sister. The leaves around here are getting yellow. All the girls are drawing today. Please be kind enough to send us some money, for we spent all ours when we were coming on the road.

They are now in receipt of a per capita grant of $130 for each of 50 pupils. The enrolment according to the last return shows that they have that number in attendance now.\n\nThis school is well spoken of by the Inspector, Mr. Supt. Vowell, Mr. Duncan Ross, M.P., and Bishop Don-tenwill, of New Westminster. They are all anxious that the application should receive favourable consideration. Mr. Vowell in his letter of the 28th ult. says that he would strongly urge that, as requested, the grant be increased to 80 pupils.\n\nIf the Department is favourable to increasing the scope of the industrial schools, this application could reasonably be allowed, but if an exception is made to any of the schools in British Columbia and they are given more pupils, all would expect similar treatment. In fact some of them are now pressing the Department for an extension of the industrial school system.\n\nBefore dealing with this particular application it seems to me the Department should settle its policy in regard to boarding and industrial schools.

Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on your school remarks that, while farming ought to take the first place among the industries taught, he regrets that outside of a little gardening no boy has been employed in the fields, the reason given being that you say that the Indians and the white settlers living near object to the pupils working on the farm.\n\nThe Department is at a loss to know how it can effect the white settlers and in any event their prejudices should not be allowed to interfere with the teaching of agriculture to the older boys, as this is the most important branch of industrial school work. The Department will expect you to see that they are taught farming in all its branches in future. The Agent and the Inspector will cooperate with you in seeing that the wishes of the Department are carried out. You will be good enough to state why the white settlers should make any objection to the boys learning farming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. H. Boening, Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nPrincipal,\nWilliams Lake Industrial School,\nWilliams Lake P.O., B.C.\nOttawa, November 29, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Williams Lake Industrial School states that none of the boys are taught farming, chiefly owing to the objections raised by Principal the white settlers. The Department is being informed that the Department expects all the elder boys who are strong enough to receive instruction in farming, which is the most important branch of industrial school work, and that the objections of the white settlers should not be allowed to interfere. You will be good enough when you next visit the reserve to inform the white settlers that farming must be taught to Indian boys in industrial schools and that they have no right to place obstacles in the way of having the wishes of the Department carried out. You will be good enough to state what cause, if any, there is for their interference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIsaac Ogden, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLac La Hache, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJanuary 28th, 1911\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter marked 117123/1 and dated November 29th, 1910 with reference to a remark in Mr. Inspector Green's report on this school, so that XXXXXX no boy has been employed in the fields the reason given being that I say that the Indians and white settlers living near object to the pupils working on the farm.\n\nI very much regret on account of pressure of work I was unable to answer this letter before Christmas.\n\nNow, however, I beg to state first that this fact of the boys not being employed in the fields ought not to be understood as being general and universal, it being an exception only and particular to last year's two seasons: summer and fall. All my reports in the blue book lay special stress on our efforts to give the boys a good training in agriculture.\n\nWhy, then, were the boys not employed on the fields this year?\n\nOn September 6th I wrote the Department stating that since their return from the holidays the boys had more or less all been running away from school; that, as this was an extraordinary thing for them to do and not being able to get an explanation either from them or their parents I respectfully requested the Department to send somebody here to hold a special inquiry.\n\nA few days later there being a new breaking away I immediately sent a telegram to our Indian Agent, Isaac Ogden, living only 33 miles from here.\nand requested his presence here. This telegram gave occasion to some correspondence between him and myself of which I herewith enclose true copy so, letter of Indian Agent dated Sept. 12th, letter of myself dated Sept. 28th enclosing letters of pupils: Modest Charlie and Lizette Theodore, both dated Sept. 18th.\n\nIn my telegram, however, I did not say as mentioned in the Agent's letter: \"the children have run\" but \"the children are running\" and my reason for calling the Agent by telegram was that, of the many who wanted to break away, only one succeeded and the others being held here it would have been an easy task for the Agent to get at the bottom of the affair.\n\nSuch then being the boys' dispositions would it have been wise on my part to expose them to still greater chances of escape by allowing them out on the fields or was I not rather justified, in order to prevent greater harm, to choose the lesser evil by keeping them near me? What a cry would have gone up both from the Indians and the white settlers had the boys escaped when forced to work at hoeing for example? In our long experience here we have met with the most absurd accusations not only from Indians and envious white settlers but even from such as we thought friendly disposed, yes, even from employees who knew better. The enclosed correspondence gives you a fresh instance of how an innocent word can be twisted and easily even a false accusation meets with success.\n\nThe fact is that the Indians of this agency are ignorant about the purpose, the working and benefits of the school. How could they know?\nI am therefore much pleased with the Department's assurance that \"the Agent and the Inspector will cooperate with me in seeing that the wishes of the Department are carried out.\" The Agent's authority as Government officer, we know, is very great among the Indians. If then, after previous understanding with the principal, on his customary visits to the reserves he could make it a point to see as many Indians as possible and would speak to them about the school, its necessity and benefits to them, I am sure the task for us would be much lighter and the good still more apparent.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH. Bening\n\nPrincipal.\nLac La Hache,\nSept. 12th '10\n\nRev. H. Boening,\nWm. Lake.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI received your wire, and am sorry cannot go up just now. I got permission from the Department allowing me three weeks holiday and have made arrangements to take my son down at once to Victoria, and will be away about two weeks. I cannot see where I can do much good by going there, as you say the children have run. I think a closer watch should be kept on them.\n\nI saw the Kanes Lake children both times going back from their runaways. I questioned Modest first time and he complained of the carpenter growing or annoying him in some way. I told him he should report anything of that kind to you but not to run away; he also told different stories to outsiders stating that he was not well enough fed.\n\nI made inquiries from some of the Indians coming from Alkali Lake today and they inform me that children have not run away from there, but Wyott's daughter has not yet returned to school and she complained to her father about the grub.\n\nI have written the Indian constables stating it's a part of their duty to see that children return to school as soon as they run away. I will be away about two weeks and on my return will proceed up there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIsaac Ogden,\nIndian Agent.\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n150 Mile House, B.C.\n\nSeptember 23rd, 1913\n\nIsaac Ogden, Indian Agent,\nLac La Hache.\n\nSir:\n\nI received your letter of 12th inst., informing me that it was impossible for you to come here as requested by me in order to look into the matter of the repeated runaways among the boys.\n\nI must, however, take exception to your statement that a closer watch should be kept on them. This implies that, if the children run away, it is on account of want of supervision. Now nothing could be further from the truth than this. It is not after nine (9) years I have been with them that I would have requested your cooperation in. I have been conscious of not doing my duty in this regard. We are all very pleased at such kindness.\n\nNot less pleased have we been by what the two pupils, Modest Charlie and Lisette Theodore, are reported to have said. My answer, however, to these two points is made the easier by the letters, herewith attached from each of the two pupils. And I wish to state expressly that these letters have not been dictated to them but are their own work.\n\nI notice that you have reminded the Indian constables of their duty in seeing that children who escape from school return thereto as soon as they run away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Boening\nPrincipal.\nMr. I. Ogden,\nIndian Agent,\nLac La Hache B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nWell in regard to the story I told you about the carpenter the time when I ran away is not all true, he was not in the least wrong but it was I. Yes, he was grumbling at me but he had reasons to, because I was not doing the right thing and because, moreover, had the superior been here we would not have done so. I was therefore in the wrong in telling you such stories.\n\nNow as for the other thing that was written in the letter. I did not at all say anything about the food we have at school. Only at the 111 Mile House when we came there, Minnie Johnson asked me to tell her about the grub they gave every day at table; this I told her. But I did not say that at school we are not fed enough. Since that time I never said a word about the food at school neither to my parents nor to anybody else.\n\nAlthough I don't want to say much I just wanted to talk about these two things that were written in your last letter that Father Superior received.\n\nNow I must close my letter and say Good-bye. Y\n\nYours very truly,\n\nModest G.\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n150 Mile House, B.C. 379067\nWilliams Lake P.O., B.C.\n\nSeptember 18th, 1911\n\nIsaac Ogden,\nIndian Agent,\n\nLee La Hache,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the last mail Father received a letter from you in which you said that I had said the food was not good. I never even said or think to say such a thing. Whoever said so told you a big lie, for I never even speak about it. Suppose the person who told you just said it by himself and go told you. I tell you thousand times I never think to speak about foo nor think of the school when I am at home. I was late only for few days and go you wrote to my father to bring me back quick.\n\nNow I must close my letter for it's all I can say.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nLissette Theodore.\nOttawa, November 10, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant in reference to the committal of a boy named Edward to the Williams Lake Industrial School I beg to say that the Department will pay the grant for this boy at the usual rate for the time he remains in the institution and the Principal will be so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. F. Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n1076 Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJ.D. McLean Esq., Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that an Indian boy, Edward, aged fourteen years was charged at Clinton Assizes with attempted rape on a girl six years of age. The girl being the chief witness, and not having been sufficiently instructed as to her obligation to speak the truth (in the opinion of the Judge), he refused to let her evidence go in. The Jury having been discharged it was decided to put the boy in school, and Judge Gregory ordered the Father to place him in the Industrial School at William's Lake till Spring, when he is to be brought before the Assizes again. He was placed in the school on October 10th.\n\nThe school has a grant for fifty pupils, but have over that number in the school. The Principal wrote me for instructions, and to ask if the expense of his keep will be paid for. As it would be too bad to turn this boy loose, I beg respectfully to recommend that a small grant be made the school for care of the boy, as long as he remains in the school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 6, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo in reply to official communication of November 29th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to call your attention to the last paragraph of that letter in which you were informed that the Department was at a loss to know how the working of the pupils on the farm can affect the white settlers and what their prejudices are to the boys being taught farming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Boening,\nPrincipal,\nWilliams Lake Industrial School,\nWilliams Lake P.O., B.C.\nOttawa, November 10, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised by Mr. Inspector Green that a boy named Edward was lately committed at the Clinton Assizes to the Williams Lake Industrial School to remain there at least till the spring.\n\nThe Department will pay for this boy at the usual per capita rate for the time that he is in the institution pending his trial at the spring Assizes. You will be good enough on your returns forwarded during the period that he is in the school to place his name on the list and in the column for \"Remarks\" refer to the fact that his admission was authorized and the Department agreed to pay the grant for him at the usual rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Boening,\nPrincipal,\nWilliams Lake Industrial School,\nWilliams Lake P.O., B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report for the information of the department that during the month of June, besides attending to the usual work connected with the duties of the agency, I visited the boys' Lake Industrial School and find the whole institution in a healthy state. After the recent fever, and the children seem to be recovering, the worst after their return.

Besides the regular grant earners this school has a number of children in residence for whom no grant is paid. The buildings in connection with the school comprise a main building and residences for the boys and girls and also a building which contains the kitchens and dining room.\nMr. Inspector Cairns, who inspected this school in May, last, states that, while, the grant is allowed for only 50 pupils, there is generally more than this number enrolled and there is no difficulty in keeping up the attendance. The pupils all come from the Williams Lake Agency. They have an abundant water supply, which is brought from an artificial lake by means of wooden pipes and there is also a good drainage system. The only means of ventilation is through the windows and doors. The buildings are heated by hot air and lighted by acetylene gas. A new railway is under course of construction which passes through the farm. This gives direct connection with Vancouver to the South West and Fort George to the North.\n\nI would suggest that, as the Department has no particulars regarding the size of the school or the dormitories, either Mr. Inspector Cairns or the Agency Inspector, Mr. Megraw, be instructed to furnish a report on this matter.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOtterton\n\n27 Jan. 18\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received today a communication from Rev. Father Macleod, O.M.I., principal of Williams Lake Indian School, stating that he has accommodation for 70 Indian children. I shall be grateful if you will make arrangements for them to receive that number.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch, O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant reporting the resignation of the Rev. H. Boening as Principal of the William Lake Industrial School and in reply, I beg to say that the Department regrets that it will be necessary for Mr. Boening to sever his connection with this school as his work there has been entirely satisfactory. The appointment of his successor the Rev. Edmund Maillard is approved of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIsaac Ogden, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLac la Hache, B. C.\nOttawa, April 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant enclosing a copy of your letter of January 6th, last, with reference to the returns of school material and government property on hand at the Williams Lake Industrial School at the end of each quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Principal, in preparing his quarterly returns of attendance, should include on the form under the heading \"Return of School Material and Government Property\" the quantity on hand of each article, as called for by the return. Any supplies furnished the school by the Department are considered as the property of the Department and a return of these articles should be made on the back of the quarterly school returns each quarter.\n\nI may say that the December quarter return was received and the amount of the grant due for that quarter paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information and action, the quarterly Report to date of the Cariboo Industrial School, showing an average attendance of 70 pupils and calling for a payment of $297.00.\n\nI also enclose the yearly Report of the Principal, for the fiscal year now closed and which is self-explanatory. My own Report in this connection was forwarded you on the 27th ult., to reach Ottawa on the last inst., it is therefore unnecessary to make further comment on the work of the School.\n\nI am also forwarding you an original letter from the Principal, received by me this morning, in which he calls attention to the financial statement accompanying his Report and in which is shown a deficit at date of $375.62.\n\nThis loss he claims to have been caused by the high cost of living, and the fact that the per capita Grant of the Department was not sufficient to meet expenses without lowering the standard of living furnished the pupils, and which I can emphatically state the School did not do. Ever since the spring of 1919, when I came to the Agency, the scale of living at the school has been most generous, and the pupils show for it, but there can be no question that the grant did not begin to cover the cost in so expensive a country as the Cariboo.\n\nThe Principal requests the consideration of the Department, with a view to the extension of some monetary aid towards the wiping out of this deficit, and while I of course am not in a position to know the facilities of the Department in this direction, I feel that the petition of the school is a just one, and trust that the Department will be able to extend at all events some aid in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.

It was $12683.44 at the end of the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1923, and at the end of the present fiscal year there is a further sum of $3715.62 to be added.\n\nAny remark about it would be out of place in an official report, but will naturally find its place in an explanatory letter.\n\nWe have tried to reduce to a minimum the expenses of running this school, having however due regard to the health and material comfort of the children, and the new deficit is ENTIRELY due to the necessity of providing for them. No extraordinary expense has been incurred for the school during the last fiscal year, and the high cost of living is alone responsible for that item.\n\nI must add that unfortunately we are facing another heavy but necessary expenditure for the next fiscal year.\n\nLast December, some mischievous muskrat blocked the INTAKE of our school WATER SYSTEM during a very cold spell, and before we could have noticed it, the water pipes were frozen between the INTAKE and the RESERVOIR behind the school buildings on a distance of at least one mile. Since that time we have been compelled to carry water to the school, every day, from the creek. The Water System must of all necessity be repaired as soon as the ground is sufficiently thawed out; the difficulty of the present unsatisfactory way of taking water from the creek, and more so the children's health demand it imperiously.\n\nI foresee an expense of at least $2000.00 to do that work. But where shall I find money? It causes me to worry.\n\nI would hate to make any suggestions or to appear begging, but I feel, Sir, that something ought to be done on our behalf.\n\nI think that all that is done here at our school, and what is proposed to be done is ENTIRELY for the benefit of the children who are the wards of the Government; we have in view their material interests as well as their spiritual, and in our case, in view of our present difficulties a little further MONETARY ASSISTANCE from the Department of Indian Affairs would be much needed and most welcome.\n\nI beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nL. Choinel\nPrincipal\nCar. Ind. School\nNovember 4, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 18th ultimo enclosing report for the Cariboo Industrial School for the quarter ending September 30, 1921.\n\nIn answer to your request that the pupilage for this institution be increased from seventy to eighty I am directed to reply that it is with the strictest economy that the Appropriation for school purposes will have to be administered until the end of the fiscal year. The matter will be placed on file for reference when preparing the Estimates for next year. You have asked that we pay the grant based upon the average attendance. I might draw your attention to the fact that for the quarter ending September 1921 the attendance does not exceed seventy pupils.\n\nI have noted that it is your opinion that complaints regarding the management of this institution will from now on be a thing of the past, as the new principal is getting along in a satisfactory manner. This information is gratifying to the Department.\n\nYou might inform the Rev. L. Choinel, Principal of the Cariboo Industrial School, that it will be impossible to increase his pupilage until the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. O'M. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the Report of the Cariboo Industrial School for the quarter ending September 30th 1921.\n\nIt will be apparent from it that there are now some 77 pupils upon the strength, and in respect of which the Principal is claiming the per capita grant.\n\nIn your letter No. 117123-10 of October 17th 1921, you inform me that the grant is only payable in respect to an average attendance of 70 pupils, and I am therefore directing your attention to the discrepancy in the present claim.\n\nI would however take this opportunity to remark that 70 pupils represents only about 50% of the School age children in the Agency, and with this in view, would it not be possible to extend the number covered by the grant?\n\nThe school can take care of about 80 so far as the accommodation is concerned, and I think we can get this number from among the Shuswap Bands east of the Fraser River.\n\nThe Chileetin Indians will not mix with the Shuswap, and will not send their children to the common School with them, if they can avoid it, and in view of this and the fact that we are desirous of making education compulsory, I would draw your attention to the need of a 40 to 50 pupil school in the Chileetin area.\n\nI may add that I inspected the School at the end of the quarter and after the pupils had returned from their vacation and found it in a very satisfactory condition, and from what I have seen of the new Principal, I think that complaints are likely to be fewer than under his predecessor, who while a smart manager and good Principal in one sense, did not seem to be over-sympathetic towards the children. I do not think he was cruel, as we understand it in college in our day, but the lower you go in the human strata the more delicate the susceptibility apparently becomes, and what would not appear out of the way to a Duke's son in the way of discipline would entail great hardship and outrage upon that of a working man or an Indian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\n5 Aug 1921\n\nA.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nReferring again to your letter of October 5, and No. 117123/1 in which you ask for information regarding the report that unduly severe punishment has been inflicted on Indian pupils at the William's Lake Industrial School, I beg leave to report as follows:\n\nI wrote to Mr. Agent Daunt who replied at considerable length. He sums the incident up in the following paragraph: \"A medical examination at the time I asked for it, would have revealed what boys, if any, had been flogged, and you could have carried on your inquiry with every chance of arriving at an accurate estimate of conditions, something I consider utterly impossible to do now.\"\n\nThe Rev. John Duplanil who was Acting Principal of the school at the time of the trouble is now Principal of St. Mary's Boarding School. I saw him last week and went into the whole matter with him.\n\nBro. Joseph, the Disciplinarian, was in charge of the boys. One of the largest boys called him \"a son of a bitch.\" He naturally was very angry to have an Indian boy use such an objectionable expression.\nBro. Joseph carried in his hand a rod and with this he then and there flogged the boy and made him apologize for his rudeness. In doing this the Disciplinarian was breaking the rules of the school. He should have reported the matter to the Principal.\n\nThat night this boy ran away from school. He never was brought back.\n\nThe Rev. John Duplanil maintains that there was not any connection between this incident and the fact that nine boys shortly after this ate Water Hemlock from the effects of which one died.\n\nI do not see that any good purpose could be attained at this late date by an investigation. It would not be an easy matter to get the parties face to face.\n\nIt is admitted that the Disciplinarian did wrong in taking the matter in his own hands. It is not admitted that the boy was too severely punished for such a serious offence. The punishment should fit the offence.\n\nIn my opinion, the boy should have been brought back to the school, and if it was considered wise he could then have been discharged.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of the Province of British Columbia.\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir; I have been in the North for one month, hence the delay in answering your letter, dated October 5th. No. 117123/1.\n\nI am writing today to Mr. Agent Daunt as you suggest. He may know something regarding the complaint that pupils of William's Lake Industrial School are punished too severely.\n\nThis school was inspected July 24, 25, and 26. From my report I now quote: \"The Rev. John Duplanil has been the Acting Principal since last October, during the absence of the Principal who is visiting in France. The Principal left Europe July the 17th, and will soon be home\".\n\nUnder the heading of DISCIPLINE I said: \"One boy ran away. This was the only serious case of a breach of discipline. He is still at large\".\n\nIn due time I shall report in full to the Department concerning this matter.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, October 26, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, at the request of the Principal, it has been decided to change the title of the Williams Lake Industrial School to the \"Cariboo Industrial School\". This name is considered more appropriate, as the school covers the district and county of Cariboo, and also in order to avoid the inconvenience which has been occasioned in the past in the delivery of mail. Any mail addressed to the Williams Lake Industrial School has been forwarded to the Williams Lake post office, which is not the correct address of the school. The proper postal address is, and always has been, 150 Mile House, B.C. The Agent is being informed to advise the Principal accordingly and that this name is to be used in future correspondence and reports regarding the school.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will note this change in the name of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is hoped that, with this change in name, the annoyance complained of in the past regarding the delivery of mail will be overcome. It is noted that the proper postal address for the school is 150 Mile House, B.C.\n\nYou will be good enough to notify the Principal of the approval of the change in the name of the school and in future he is, in all communications and reports, to refer to the school as the \"Cariboo Industrial School\".

Severe corporal punishment for breaches of discipline is something that the Department would not tolerate.

It is desired to have an explanation from him before acting upon your suggestion for an investigation. The same letter will be sent to him by concurrent mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nConduct of Williams Lake School.\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter #117,123-1a of the 9th inst., asking for a report from me in regard to undue severe corporal punishment at the above named Institution.\n\nIn this connection, I already informed you of a complaint which had reached me, (my letter of the last inst.), and asked that authority might be wired me to have a medical examination made of the boys before they went home for the annual vacation.\n\nThe reason I asked for this was that it appeared the only way to obtain direct evidence that the abuses complained of existed, as the children would never own up to such treatment if called as witnesses at an investigation, unless we had first direct medical testimony that certain given children bore the marks of too severe beating. These upon being called upon to explain how and where the marks were received, could hardly fail to give testimony.\n\nIt is now too late for this, and by the time the holidays are over, it will be very difficult to do much, and I can only suggest that the Department allow me to visit the various Reserves, and in their own homes question all School children.\n\nIn going into such a matter, it must be remembered that in fairness to the School authorities, Indians are very much averse to restraint of any sort, and are not at all careful of what charges they may make against anyone who incurs their displeasure.\n\nOn the other hand, from my own personal knowledge of Mission conditions in the past in other places, the fact that it is a Religious organization of any sort running the place does not by any means place it above suspicion, and in fairness to the poor\nChildren who are committed to the mercy of the missionaries for several years of their young lives a thorough and at the same time unbiased investigation ought to be made. To do this properly, without first having medical evidence will be very difficult, as anything I can now find out will be unconfirmed statements of Indian children, against the testimony of the Church authorities, and to take action upon that will bring a religious hornets nest around the ears of the Department, unless the reverence in which missionaries are held in the East has undergone a great change since I lived there.\n\nThe general Indian attitude towards Mission Schools throughout Central B.C. is not friendly, and they are very much more in favor of Department run day schools in each Reserve.\n\nSo far as this is concerned, there is no doubt that the money spent annually by the Department #### in connection with each of the Missions I know anything about, would go far towards providing day schools in every Reserve in each of the Agencies concerned, and all the children would receive education instead of the very small proportion which is now the case. The Agricultural end of the education would be met by the appointment of a competent Farm Instructor in each Agency, and in any case, the Indians work so much upon white ranches that they acquire a knowledge of up to date farming automatically in the course of their work, and would really only need the Instructor as a \"prod\" to make them apply the principles they already know, to their own lands.\n\nI may also say in connection with the School question, that the Missions in the Lytton and Williams Lake Agencies with which I am familiar do not play the game with the Department, as they take entire credit with the Indians for the educational facilities offered. Indians have told me time and again, in both Lytton and here, that the missionaries say they are at the entire expense of the Schools and that they receive no help from the Department. I have of course, disabused them upon that score, but it shows that there is something wrong in the attitude with which Departmental help is received, by the denominations concerned, and is one more reason why a more efficient service would be obtained under the direct control\nof the Department.\n\nI am quite aware that a good deal of this has not\na great deal to do, in one way with the question of the moment, but\nI wish to bring both sides of the Mission School question to your\nnotice. On the one hand, we have the great tendency to lying upon the\npart of the Indians, and on the other we have a decided lack of some-\nthing upon the side of the Missions.\n\nTo make a really proper investigation under these\ncircumstances, we should have had had the medical examination asked\nfor by me, and without it we will be very much at a loss. However,\nif you think it in order, and will advise me accordingly, I will go\nover all the Reserves, and take what statements I can get, and send\nthem in to you, and you can then decide what further action you wish\ntaken.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nWilliams Lake, B.C.

Agency.\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nComplaint has been made to the Department that unduly severe punishment has, in some cases, been inflicted on Indian pupils at the Williams Lake industrial school.\n\nSevere corporal punishment for breaches of discipline is something that the Department would not tolerate, but, before taking any steps to have an investigation held, as has been requested, I should like to have a full report from you. I shall be obliged if you will give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\n\nJ. R. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nConduct of Williams Lake School.\n\nI have the honor to report in connection with my recent trip to the above Institution, that I received a complaint from a Canoe Creek Indian named Sam that the Disciplinarian of the School, Brother Joseph was much too free with his cane, and Sam wished to take his boy Wilfrid Basil away.\n\nThis in itself would not be very serious, as Indians are very much averse to any kind of restraint, and to put it mildly, are not to be believed, as a general thing when they complain about Schools or similar Institutions, as they let their imaginations run riot, if they think that by so doing it will help them to gain what they happen to want at the moment.\n\nIn this particular case, however, a boy ate poison hemlock, and died, while 8 more were very ill. The coroner was duly communicated with, but did not consider it necessary to hold an Inquest, as there was nothing suspicious about children eating a poison weed.\n\nSam however in making his request for the withdrawal of his son from the school says that the boys were in a very depressed frame of mind, and that the deceased boy said to the other 8, that he would eat the hemlock first and that they should eat after him. If this were true it would make what appeared an accident into a case of suicide.\n\nI may as well say at once that I do not for one moment believe the story, but as you know anything of that sort will spread like wildfire among the Indians, and having been reported to us, it would appear that we should take some action to ascertain the truth of the complaints against this \"Lay brother\".\n\nWith this in view, I went up to the School, but the Acting Principal being away I could not do anything, and after talking...\nthe matter over with the Provincial Government Agent, to whom, in his capacity of Stipendiary Magistrate, the death of the boy was first reported, it struck me that it would be good policy to have a general medical examination of the school, previous to holding any sort of enquiry.\n\nBy this means we should know whether boys were unduly flogged as claimed by the Indian, and if the examination was held ostensibly for some other reason, such as to locate possible cases of Rupture etc., the School authorities would not be aware of what we were doing. Should the doctor find no traces of abuse, as I do not think he will, the matter can rest there, and we can ignore the complaint of the Indian.\n\nWithout in any way impugning the character of the school authorities, it is a matter of common knowledge that religious bodies carry what may be termed \"Esprit de Corps\" to an extent that would make it very difficult to place the guilt of one of their members unless we had in advance indisputable medical testimony.\n\nWhile putting this matter before you, I would like to be quite plain that I do not think from what I have seen of the general conduct of the School in question that there is anything to the story, but in view of all the circumstances, I certainly do think that we should go into the matter.\n\nWe have no medical officer nearer than Doctor Wright at Alexis Creek. There is however a Railroad doctor, who used to be in the service of the Department at I think, Kamloops, named Dr F. Vere Anew, and I would suggest that this gentleman would be more suitable than Dr Wright for such an investigation.\n\nAs the usual School holidays will, I presume, take effect somewhere round the 15th inst., there is little time to be lost if you desire an examination to be made, and I would suggest that you notify me by wire if you think such a course advisable.\n\nI may add that without a medical examination, to identify boys who have recently been flogged, it will be quite impossible to obtain any evidence as the fear of the Church would keep any youngster from coming forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assist Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6436, file 878-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant suggesting a change in the name of the industrial school near Williams Lake. The Department would prefer to have some local name by which the school would be officially known and would therefore ask you to give the matter further consideration. If for their own purposes the authorities wish to use a Saint's name to designate the school, they may do so, but \"St. Joseph's\" would not be appropriate as we already have an industrial school known by that name.\n\nI would also like to know what address mail should be sent. The Department was not aware that the post office had been closed and would like to know the proper address to which mail should be directed. I should be glad to have any suggestions that you can make, as we wish to avoid inconvenience to the staff at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nClinton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWilliams Lake, Industrial School.\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Acting Principal of the above School has drawn my attention to the fact that a great deal of confusion and delay to mail, etc., arises from the fact that the newly born Provincial Government prospective townsite and P.G.E station, have adopted the name of Williams Lake. Mail and goods for the School get there, 15 miles from the Institution, instead of where they are required, and the Principal wishes to know if the Department have any objection to the title of the School being changed to some other name, such as \"St Joseph's Industrial School\".\n\nThe name Williams Lake Industrial School is a misnomer, anyway as the Lake is 5 miles away from the Buildings.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.

I regret that we have no funds available for the payment of the deficit at this school. As you were informed in official letter of the 5th instant, provision is being made for an increase of 10 pupils at this institution. If this is allowed, it will provide a grant for 80 pupils from the first of the present month.

It is considered that equipment of this nature should be purchased by the school from their per capita grant or other receipts. We therefore regret that we will be unable to comply with the principal's request. You may inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE.

Father Welch, O.M.I., to bring to your attention a request for an increased pupilage at the Caribou Indian Residential School. The Rev. Principal, in a recent communication, writes in part as follows:\n\n\"We all appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made by the Indian Department for the welfare of the Indian - never any of our requests, when reasonable, was turned down.\n\n\"The attendance at our school has been larger than ever - last year, their number was at the highest, at 83. This year, we accommodate 92. I could not refuse them. They came from miles and miles with their children, begging me to take charge of their children. They have nothing. Winter is approaching and we need help to feed and board them. Now, our per capita grant is only for 80 pupils. As there is room for over 100 pupils, I wish you would ask the Department to increase our per capita grant from 80 to 100 at least. I bought already 20 new beds and there is room for some more.\n\n\"This school is in an outlying district. Transportation expenses are very high. We are grateful to the Department for the substantial help we received, and, in return, the staff of the school made many sacrifices to give a real education to those children. Also we give work to many of those children after their school term is over. At present there are three former school boys employed at the school at $50 a month. During the hunting season, we had as many as 10 of them. They all like the old place and to work there.\n\n\"We buy fish from the old people and, in exchange, we give them flour, rice, meat, etc., for the winter months.\n\n\"In consideration for all this, I hope you will be able to obtain for us the 100 per capita grant, which will enable us to receive more pupils and do more good to the poor natives scattered in the Williams Lake agency.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nPlease let me have, at your earliest convenience, the dimensions \u2014 length, width and height \u2014 of the pupils' dormitories at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

While there I frequently heard that there were about one hundred children in the Chilcotin District. The Reverend Mr. Millard assured me that there were about that number without any chance of getting even the most elementary education.\n\nThe best way, in my opinion, to meet the problem is to enlarge the present school, so that one hundred and fifty pupils could be accommodated. Here, you have plenty of land and an abundance of water. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway runs through the farm, providing splendid transportation facilities.\n\nThe Chilcotin District is from fifty to sixty miles from the Cariboo School; that is from the nearest railroad point, and it would be a long haul, if a new school were erected.\n\nAs this is an urgent case, I would respectfully recommend a careful consideration of the whole matter by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.H.

I regret that I cannot make an exception in your case; but I am sure you will understand that fuel costs are always met from per capita or other earnings. I would be more favourable to increasing the pupilage at the school, provided there is accommodation for them. The last time the dimensions of your dormitories were forwarded to the Department, it was found that there was room for only 90 pupils. If any changes have been made, you might let the Department know, and it is possible that grant could be allowed for a few extra pupils.

Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince December 1st the winter made its appearance. From 30 above zero the thermometer dropped suddenly to 10 below this morning. We are all busy heating up the buildings. With 5 furnaces going, not including the kitchen, the bakery and the laundry a lot of wood is used up. I hate to send my little boys out on the wood pile every afternoon in this cold weather. They are not strong and need a lot of care.\n\nThis is the reason of my letter to you today. Year ago when the wood supply was near it was very easy to provide fuel for all the buildings. But now we have to haul it from a distance of about two miles, and we need extra labor.\n\nI thought of telling you of my difficulties I fear to abuse of your generosity. But as it is a case of necessity I take my heart in two hands.\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\n\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nTo ask you for assistance to the amount of about $500. There are always a number of needy Indians eager to work here during the winter months, and it would be a great charity to give them extra employment.\n\nThere are 98 children at school and we receive a per capita grant for 90. We always had a greater number of pupils than the per capita grant would allow. But it is hard to refuse assistance to any of those poor Indian children. Dr. Stone made a personal inspection of some of the Indian reserves in the Cariboo. He could tell you about their poor and filthy conditions. It is far better for those children to be with us than to be at home.\n\nIn view of all this and in the name of the staff and children, I dare to ask you to kindly grant to us as Xmas present, the extra money required to keep us warm during the cold weather.\n\nThanking you for the interest you have always shown to the Cariboo Indian School,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nV. Rober O.M.Y.\nPrincipal.\nDecember 29, 1927.\n\nDear Father Rohr:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant and I wish to thank you and all those at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for your kind wishes. Please inform the children that I have examined their letters with much enjoyment. Their work shows evidences of careful and systematic training on the part of the Reverend Sisters, to whom I extend my congratulations. I was also glad to receive the pictures which you enclosed.\n\nI have noted your kind reference to Mr. MacLeod and your suggestion concerning a circular regarding the Allied Tribes' claims.\n\nI regret to inform you that our Estimates for the coming fiscal year are now closed and it is very doubtful if funds could be provided at the next session of Parliament for an addition to the school.

I am glad to mention to you that since I have been in charge of them, not one ever ran away.\n\nI wish you would read every one of their letters at home. Undoubtedly you will enjoy reading them and appreciate their gratitude for all that has been done for them. As the girls are crowded in the convent...\nthey are anxious to have also a playroom. For the present the sewing room is their recreation room. As a basement in the convent would be too costly I would suggest an addition to the convent of two halls: recreation - dormitory & infirmary on the upper story. All this could be done with an addition of $30 x 50. Rev. Fr. Anthony is prepared to undertake the work. I wish you would remember us in your estimates and set aside an equal sum for improvements in our school.\n\nThere are now three or four fire escapes - two for each school. Enclosed you will find the plans of the fire escapes at the Convent.\n\nWe are sorry and very sorry to lose our devoted Indian Agent, Mr. E. McLeod. He certainly worked hard for the Indians and his departure is keenly felt by all of them.\n\nI received also a copy of the report of the claims of the allied Indian tribes, and I would recommend that\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School\nPost Office: 150 Mile House\nBritish Columbia\n\nYour or Mr. Bitchburn's circular would be sent\nto every chief of every Indian Reserve in B.C.\nWishing you again God's blessing for your\nnoble work,\n\nI remain yours faithfully,\n\nV.

As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Principal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House,\nB. C.\nMay 14, 1929.\n\nDear Sister Alphonse:\n\nI have received several compositions written by the pupils of the Cariboo Indian Residential School on the subject \"The Forest\". These have been read with interest, and I am pleased to note the knowledge displayed by each pupil in this important subject. The penmanship and drawings are most creditable. These compositions reflect highly on the pupils who wrote them and on yourself as their teacher.\n\nI wish to thank you and the other members of the staff on the work that is being accomplished for our young Indian wards at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Sister Alphonse,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B.C.\nFebruary 6, 1929.\n\nDear Father Rohr:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, giving the dimensions of the dormitories at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I note that you would like to recruit some of the Chilcotin children, and I believe it might be advisable to accept a few when there are vacancies. The Department finds that your dormitories have air space for not more than an average of 95 pupils, and your pupilage will be increased to this number as from October first, last. I should be grateful if you would see that not more than 97 or 98 children are in the school at any one time, as there would be danger to their health if more than this number were placed in the dormitories. You will be able to earn the full grant of 95, and this will be an added $350 per year.\n\nI am quite concerned about the difficulty you are having, securing fuel, and the Department cannot allow young boys to be regularly engaged at heavy work. The extra grant per annum should be used for the engaging of hired help for the securing of your fuel. A cheque for the balance due on account of the December quarter earnings is going forward to you without delay, and this will make it possible for you to engage a couple of men immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. V. Rohr, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Res. School,\n150 Mile House,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith Inspection Report on the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the month of February 1930.\n\nI visit this School several times in the course of the month, as a rule and, although the report is based on the actual class figures for one particular visit - in this case on the 26th inst.- the general remarks are the result of my observations throughout the whole month.\n\nThe girls were all employed in class-room work on my last visit but the boys were all outside. Owing to an exceptionally early thaw the snow has all gone and the boys were working at clearing up around the school, wood-yard and buildings. They had all been present at class in the morning.\n\nI was glad to note continued rapid improvement in the manual training shop - some very creditable articles of woodwork are now being turned out and I hope to have a comprehensive display of such articles at the Fall Fairs this year. The boys draw the plans themselves and work from them in the correct manner and the instructor seems to be very competent.\n\nThere has been very little sickness at the School this winter, which speaks well for the general health and cleanliness of the place. I took the doctor out with me a short time ago and he gave attention to one or two minor troubles and two eye cases but generally speaking the pupils present a very well-fed appearance and are always smiling and cheerful.\n\nThe Sisters presented me with two large chalk-drawn landscapes done by the pupils which were very creditable and are now hung in the Agency offices.\n\nAs this School goes in considerably for live-stock and maintains a large farm the boys get invaluable training in the operating of machinery and the conducting of ranch activities which should be of inestimable value in later years.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is pleased to note the success and interest taken by the pupils in preparing for and carrying out the entertainment. Please express to the Reverend Principal and the pupils the Department's appreciation of their efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that on the night of the 29th inst., I attended a concert given by the pupils of the Cariboo Indian Residential School. I thought you might be interested to hear of the excellence of the work and talent displayed by the pupils on this occasion.\n\nAll costumes, scene painting and decorations were made by the children, and formed a most creditable display.\n\nThe various items of the concert itself, were of a high order of merit, and compared very favourably with a similar concert staged by the white children of Williams Lake, a week previously.\n\nThe concerted singing evidenced very painstaking preparation on the part of the teachers, patriotic and other songs being rendered with clear melody and good enunciation.\n\nA novel feature of the concert was a Punch and Judy show, built by the children who also painted the miniature scenery and manipulated the puppets. This was a most realistic effort and showed a great degree of imagination as also did the acting in the dialogues and sketches.\n\nI took a party of friends from Williams Lake to attend this concert, as I feel that most people know very little about the work done by our schools amongst the Indian children, and to say that the visitors were surprised is putting it very mildly. There were repeated expressions of amazement at the standard of education and intelligence exhibited.\n\nNuts and candies were distributed amongst the pupils at the conclusion of the concert, and as they received a liberal number of toys and other good things on Christmas Day, I am satisfied that the holiday season was properly observed and very much enjoyed by the children of this School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHET/MT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your report of the 27th ultimo, on your inspection of the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the month of February, last.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is pleased to note that the general conditions at this school are satisfactory and that progress is being made by both the girls and boys in manual training and other classroom work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

All Monday we sped south with frequent halts at points of interest, and last night paid the great chasm and then down beside the long flats of Lac la Hache to lunch at the famous old 122-Mile House. Thus the Arctic Ocean was reached, and the last stage of the trip which has made the mile houses of the Cariboo road famous to British Columbians since the gold rush. Lashings of heavy, homely-cooked food were eaten, and the hearty welcome and huge belongings that this caravan's digestion will never be able to service but you can not refuse these people's hospitality for this is the land of James Douglas.\n\nFAMOUS MISSION SCHOOL.\n\nThrough miles of meadows where the hay already is being cut we circled, and where the Indians who have been educated by Methodist missionaries have been educating the children of the interior Indians. This mission school is the most famous in all British Columbia. With its fine substantial buildings, spotlessly clean, the trees, shrubs, gardens and large barns, the Mission is doing a great work for the natives.\n\nThen they were photographed by motion picture men, and the resulting negatives of two of them in the capacity of entertainers and entertainers of amusement and administration. The Indians are told that their education should go to St. Joseph's Mission School, and that there, for it is off the main road, and few people ever go there. Father Heuer will tell you that, growing up among the Indians, he has seen wonders among the natives, making them better than they were before. And the remarkably fine drawings and paintings which he showed that they possess talents that seem to exist only in the adult Indians in their children.\n\nThe splendid conditions of the schoolhouse, the vastness and grandeur of the place, the Indians' minister of mines. One can imagine the difficulties encountered in the shape of a high power generator, and the vast number of public works started to make the schoolhouse a reality in road machinery, and was examined by the members of the party from the driver's seat.\n\nThe splendid conditions of the schoolhouse, the vastness and grandeur of the place, the Indians' minister of mines.

The energetic little town has seen the vision of the future, and has realized the enormous possibilities of tourist traffic. The railway has opened up the mountainous zone no bounds as ten thousand tourists have visited the place, trying to make the highway an active one. The government has taken a hand in the Stampede Hall, Premier Toulouse has given his personal attention to the western reception, and left no doubt that the government is behind the great project. But to the Cariboo, the Indians are very glad that the government has taken a hand in the planning of road work in other parts of the province, and has made special arrangements for financing that scheme when we undertake it.\n\nIn Daily Use\n\nIndian Affairs. (Re 10, Volume 0436, file 578-1, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the question of additional accommodation for pupils at the Cariboo Indian Residential School is still a vital one.\n\nThere are a large number of very bright and healthy children amongst the Chilcotin bands of Indians who have at present no opportunity for any education. Last year a start was made with three Chilcotin children - these rapidly became accustomed to school life and now we have twelve Chilcotin children at the school, with many more willing to come in should the necessary accommodation be available. It was previously thought that the bringing of Chilcotin children to the school would never prove satisfactory and that they would not mix with the other Indians who speak a different dialect. This, however, is not the case - the Chilcotin pupils have proven most adaptable, and it seems a great pity to turn away more prospective pupils now that the way has been paved for them by the successful showing of the children from that area who have already been admitted.\n\nI have discussed this matter with the school principal and he also is of the opinion that additional accommodation as early as possible is a vital matter if we are to retain the interest at present being shown in the school by the Chilcotin Indians.\n\nThis year the school built a manual training building with material supplied by the Department - the building is 24' x 50' and the principal suggests that two similar buildings be erected, one for girls and one for boys, adjacent to their present buildings. These would accommodate seventy-five pupils each and would be used for classrooms and for men's study rooms. The classrooms at present in use would then be released and available for dormitories and for sick bay, which the school is at present without.\n\nThis would enable the small pupils to be housed entirely on ground floors and would provide additional fire safety and less wear and tear.\n\nThe principal states that he would be willing to buy the necessary material and erect these two buildings if the Department will make a grant of $3,000.00 for the purpose. These buildings could be ready for occupancy by June 1931. As it will doubtless be some time before the Department will have funds for a new school for the Cariboo, this proposal would appear to be the best solution for further accommodation at present. I would be glad to know the attitude of the Department in this matter as soon as convenient.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.E.TAYLOR)\nIndian Agent.\n\nCOPY TO W.E.DITCHERSON ESQ.\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\nOttawa, November 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the carrying out of an inspection and forwarding a report each month on the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you should make a visit, if possible, once each month and inspect the buildings, fire equipment, food supplied the pupils, general routine, etc. During your inspection, you should visit the classrooms and report regarding attendance and any other matters which come under your observation. Forms for the purpose of making a report on your inspection will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E.

I think I must subsequently have torn a leaf of my pocket note book by accident. However, I inspected same in company with Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, and found everything in order. The school, I recollect, was full up, and there are more applicants than there is room for. Some of the children from the Chilcoten are being accommodated, but more should be at the school. The manual training was good, and the building clean as usual. Apparently the projected improvement in the water supply broke down owing to previous claims to the water. This was a pity.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nVery Rev. Father Byrne Grant, O.M.I., has discussed with me this morning the proposal to erect two outdoor classrooms at the Cariboo Indian Residential School. This would permit of using the present classrooms on the first floors as dormitories and would mean safer conditions in the event of fire. Further, the accommodation would be increased by 40 and the Chilcotins, who are now favourable to sending their children to school, could thus be assisted. I have made a note for Estimates, of a $4,000 grant, towards the cost of these outbuildings and also an increase in pupilage of 40. It should be kept in mind that these outbuildings could be used as carpenter shop or implement shed, or gymnasium after the proposed new building is erected.\n\nJune 16, 1931.\nRev. W.

Genl.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe destruction of St. Joseph's Church made me return to Ottawa after only two days' stay in Vancouver, but during that time I had an opportunity of studying one or two problems in connection with our Indian work and as a result I would like to recommend to you the appointment of Rev. Father Geo. Forbes, O.M.I., as principal of the Cariboo Industrial School.\n\nRev. Father Forbes is a young man, who for the last three years has been engaged in Indian Work in the Kamloops District and during this time he has shown not only a great interest in the Indians confided to his care but also considerable administrative ability. I feel sure the Department will be well satisfied with the work he will do at Williams Lake.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nOttawa, November 28, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to increasing the accommodation at the Cariboo Indian Residential School so that more Chilcotin children can be admitted. It is true that funds will not be available for a new main building at this institution for some time but the Department cannot consent to housing children in temporary buildings even if the proposed new buildings are used for class room and study purposes. The dining room, kitchen, laundry and other Departments would not stand the additional pupilage. The Reverend principal will have to be patient and wait until such time as proper accommodation can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake,\nBritish Columbia.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I am in receipt of a request from the Reverend Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, asking the Department to consider increasing the pupilage grant in order to take care of orphan and neglected children whom he feels it incumbent upon him to take into the School.\n\nAt present the grant is paid for 95 pupils. In his letter to me of April 8th last Mr. R.T. Ferrier, the Supt. of Indian Education, in referring to the admission of a non-grant earning pupil, stated: \"It is understood, of course, that the Department allows grant for 115 pupils only\". This I presume, was an error.\n\nThere are now 110 pupils on the School roll, which means that 15 pupils are being taken care of without any grant. Requests for admission of fresh children are numerous but owing to lack of funds the Department was unable this year to carry out a proposal to augment the accommodation.\n\nThe Principal states that there are several children left with one or no parents, who really need to be taken in to the School, but without further consideration from the Department they cannot be admitted.\n\nWill you please advise me if there is any possibility of an increase in the grant being considered. If the total of grant-earning pupils could be raised to 110 or 115 it would undoubtedly help the situation.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the pupilage at the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to inform you that provision has been made in the current year's estimates for per capita allowance for 115 pupils at this school. This pupilage will be allowed from April 1st, 1932. You may so inform the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E.

Scott recently resigned, as they added that you would not likely enter upon your duties until some time in November, I have delayed writing until now. Together with the staff and pupils, I offer you my best wishes that your tenure of office will prove as pleasant to you as profitable to the Indian Department and its wards.\n\nWe have about a hundred and twenty children in school at present; had we more room, it would not be difficult to get more as the Indians are very well disposed towards the School. Some time ago, the Chilcotin Indians were opposed to the School here as they wanted one in their own country. Thanks to the tact and efforts of the Indian Agent, the Indian Policeman and the Missionary and also to the progress made by the few Chilcotins who came in spite of the general opposition, the situation has changed and we now have 34 of their children here.\n\nOn account of this, it was necessary to enlarge the school and, at first, Mr. Ferrier thought the Department might be able to pay for the addition but later found that this was impossible. Rather than turn down many applications, the Oblate Fathers put up the addition, the work being done almost entirely by the boys, as part of their Manual Training under the direction of an experienced Contractor. The Department was good enough to increase our pupilage and to supply furnishings.\n\nWith every best wish,\n\nGeo. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On account of the knowledge you have of the situation, it is unnecessary to say what a boon this is especially to the Shilastic tribe.\n\nI trust that what looks like the beginning of a typhoid epidemic will not prevent our profiting by your generosity.

Mr. Taylor took some of our wives and fancy work as well as some of the boys' carpentry and blacksmithing to the Kamloops this fall and brought us back some. There have been not many changes this year. The boys built a few sheds and new fireplaces, repaired the buildings, and made some alterations through the hole worn in one of the old pine frame and made quite a few articles of furniture. The girls have been busy in sewing some...\nKitchen and bakery, our work won high praise at the Williams Lake fair and we took quite a few prizes which will make our Christmas tree better.

An electric bell rings when the open door to the girls' dormitory is opened and so it is impossible for anyone to leave or to enter the dormitory without two of the sisters knowing it. The night watchmen inspects all furnaces four times each night.\n\nThe children are, in general, doing well in their studies. Their conduct is satisfactory. They are well-fed and happy. An indication of this is that none have tried to run away. Another indication is that some of the boys asked to stay here to work on the new building rather than to go home for the summer holidays. It was only after they had made this offer that I told them that I would pay those who stayed. This building was put up almost entirely by the boys under the direction of the Manual Trainer who has 30 years experience as a Contractor. It was good training for them. That they have not neglected the cabinet-making side of their training is shown by the fact that in this branch they took first prize at the Kamloops Fair. They also took first prize in agriculture. The girls took second in needlework and painting and third in cooking. Seven Indian schools competed.\n\nWith every best wish for the New Year,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C., dated April 16, 1934.\n\nThere appears to be no member of the staff of Sisters at this School, with adequate nursing training, or First Aid knowledge, to effectively take charge when any sickness occurs. I mentioned this to the Rev. Principal last year, and he informs me that he made an effort to have a trained nurse included in the staff, but so far without result.\n\nIt would seem very necessary that such an appointment be made from the Order responsible for maintaining this school.\nOttawa, April 30, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn connection with the recent outbreak of pneumonia-influenza at the Cariboo Indian Residential School, Mr. Agent Taylor writes in part as follows:\n\n\"There appears to be no member of the staff of Sisters at this School with adequate nursing training or First Aid knowledge to effectively take charge when any sickness occurs. I mentioned this to the Rev. Principal last year, and he informs me that he made an effort to have a trained nurse included in the staff, but so far without result\".\n\nIt is very important that one of the members of the staff should have nursing training, and the Department trusts that you will again take up the matter with the Superior of the Order to which the Rev. Sisters at the Cariboo Residential School belong, with a view to securing a Sister with the requisite training. Please let me know the results of your efforts in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Forbes, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your letter, dated April 30th over a week ago but wished to see Mr. Indian Agent Taylor before replying. I was unable to do so as when I went to see him I found that he had gone to Prince George in the interests of an Indian charged with murder.\n\nIt is perfectly true that we have not a trained nurse on the staff. I am not quite certain but I think that it was I who brought this to the attention of the agent about a year ago when the Provincial Superior of the Sisters was here. At that time I asked for a better qualified infirmary especially as the Sister in charge of this department was very ill at the time and not able to do much. So far, no change has been made but I intend to take this matter up again in about a month's time when the Superior General's first Assistant will be here. The main difficulty is that these Sisters are a teaching Order and have no hospitals. For other reasons, the principals to whom I have talked prefer this Order to other Orders in the conduct of Indian schools.\n\nAs for the present infirmary, she is not entirely incapable and the little training she had, together with several years' experience in looking after the sick children, appears to be enough to enable her to look after ordinary cases. I do not mean to say that I am satisfied with this nor do I intend to imply that Mr. Taylor misrepresented the situation. I might add that for the last three years there has been a duly qualified first aid man on the staff. As I was speaking to the Indian agent only of the infirmary, it is quite likely that I did not mention this fact to him. There is another point I would like to add but I do not know how to do so without appearing to criticize the Department. I as-\nsure you do I have no intention of doing so. Two years ago two nurses were sent to work in this district in conjunction with Dr. Wall. After seeing them at work and listening to them at a clinic conducted for their benefit by Dr. Wall, I believe that our infirmary is better qualified than they apparently were. You will recall that, so soon as the facts were brought to the attention of the Department, these two nurses were dismissed.\n\nI gave the Indian Agent a full report on the recent epidemic. A boy was taken to the hospital by the Doctor to have his tonsils removed. Next day two more were sent in to him for examination. The three were kept in the hospital by the Doctor and were reported to have pneumonia. There were a few more ill next day and, so as to avoid a hospital bill and to assure these boys of the best treatment, I got in touch with the Agent and the Doctor, and it was decided that a nurse would be the best solution especially as the treatment prescribed was to be given every two hours. For the same reason, the Doctor asked me to get help for the nurse who could not work 24 hours a day. Another reason for asking for a nurse was the effect it would have on the Indians, that this was a good move was shown by the remark made by the relatives of one of the boys who was very near death. \"Look, they have a real nurse,\" the mother said even before sneaking to her son. This spread among the Indians and whatever fears they may have had were allayed. Had we not had a nurse and had there been any deaths, recruiting would have been very difficult, especially among the Chilcotins, for several years.\n\nWhile the Nurse was in full charge of all the sick, the infirmary practically in charge of the girls. That she was able to handle the situation is indicated by the fact that the epidemic did not spread to them and that those who were ill (pleurisy, bronchitis, heart attack, severe colds) made rapid recoveries.\n\nHowever, I would feel more at ease with a better qualified infirmary and will ask for one.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is quite a big ranch here, and that gives the boys a chance of learning what will be useful to them when they leave school. The girls learn to sew and mend, to knit and do fancy work, to wash, cook and bake.\n\nAs I do not wish to bother you too...\nmuch.

It is sent as written so as to give you an idea of their writing, spelling and composition.\n\nThe past year has been a successful one and far from unpleasant, with the exception of an epidemic in the spring, which put about 15 boys to bed for a couple of weeks; there has been practically no illness. There was one death but the boy, six or seven years of age, had been in school for only a couple of months before going home to spend his last few weeks of life with his parents. It was a case of tubercular meningitis for which nothing could be done.\n\nThe children are doing well in the classroom and in vocational training. They carried off most prizes at the Kamloops Fair and will therefore have a much better Christmas tree than they would otherwise have had.\n\nWith every best wish for Christmas and New Year, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI join with the children in wishing you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\n\nDuring the past year we have been as fortunate as usual: no deaths, no cases of serious illness and no cases of truancy. That the Shuswap and Chilcotin parents are satisfied with the school is shown by the fact that I have more applications for admission already than I shall be able to handle next September.\n\nAs a rule, former pupils are trying to profit by what they learned here. I get letters quite often from them and also visits from those who are not too far away. This enables me to follow up the work done here.\n\nThere are not many changes here. Last year, ending with the summer holidays, we repainted a number of the buildings so that all are of a uniform color, dark brown with white trimmings. The Indian Department was not asked to help defray the costs but was good enough to grant us enough money to paint the interior of the boys' building. This was greatly needed. It was also appreciated.\n\nWe are grateful also for what was done to give us a better and safer domestic water system. The actual work could not be started on account of the cold weather; however, this caused no inconvenience since the water has no disagreeable taste or odor during the cool and cold months.\n\nThe pupils' health and conduct have been good. Their work in the schoolroom and in the various branches of vocational training is satisfactory. Quite a few of our former boys and girls are working for white people and are a credit to the school.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A good dairman who really understands the management of a dairy herd, theory as well as the practical side has also been engaged and it is hoped something can be worked out so that some of this knowledge may be imparted to the Indian pupils.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nEducation;\n\nThe Cariboo Indian School appeared to be back to normal during the month and the school was closed for the holidays on July 2nd. The Provincial of the Oblates was written to asking that a disciplinarian and competent staff be procured before this school opens in the fall, otherwise the Agent would recommend that the School be closed.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Cariboo Indian School put on a programme on Sunday evening, consisting of songs, dances, recitations and a display of Pro-Rec., which was very good and shows much improvement on past performances.\n\nThe boys at this school are now afforded much more liberty of movement and there have been less truancies for the past two months.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1944.\n\nEducation;\n\nThe pupils of the Cariboo Indian Day School put on a short program of songs and dances on Sunday, March 19th.

Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1944.\n\nEducation:\n\nThe pupils of the Williams Lake Superior School put on a Concert recently and thirty of the older children from the Cariboo Indian Residential School were brought in to see it with their teachers. Three of the local townspeople were kind enough to help with the transportation.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1944.\n\nEducation;\n\nThere have been several cases of pupils running away from the Cariboo Indian Residential School during the month, no doubt due in some part to the fact that the disciplinarian, Mr. Sullivan, has been sick and is now convalescing in Vancouver. Father McGrath, however, expects another man to replace Mr. Sullivan in the near future, and it is to be hoped that truancy from this school will not be the problem during the coming spring and summer that it was a year ago.\n\nDuring my visit to this school, the children all appeared to be well fed and happy, and I would say that the conditions, so far as providing sports and recreation are concerned, have improved to a very great extent since Father McGrath took over as principal. The pupils who ran away gave no valid reason for doing so. One girl, Anita Wycotte of Alkali Lake Reserve, was expelled during the month, and no doubt approval will be forthcoming from the Department after the circumstances are known.\n\nWm.

She expresses the opinion that there are too many children at this school in view of the accommodation available. She also points out that milk is not one of the items on the children's diet. The Department realizes that while the staff at this school is no doubt putting forth their best efforts, the accommodation available is not altogether suitable. Consequently it would appear very inadvisable to allow the school to become overcrowded. This condition presents problems at any time and especially when there is an epidemic like the one at present. Please discuss this matter carefully with the Principal and let me have your recommendation.\n\nR.A.

In the present case, the intention was to train leaders from various Reserves so that they could go back and conduct courses among the Indians of their Reserves and I consider the expenditure very reasonable for the results attained. If funds could be provided from the Educational Vote, I would recommend authorization of the expenditure.\n\nFor D.M.

No.1).\n\nPersonally, I don't think much will come of this programme on the Reserves until we get Day Schools with someone to organize community work, but there is no doubt of the urgency of clean recreation and social work on the Reserves. At present the only form of amusement seems to be gambling.\n\nI would suggest that a small food allowance, say $10.00 each, is provided, for the two week period.\n\nWm.

Rubin at the Cariboo Indian School from October 18th to 30th inclusive.\n\nIt was difficult to interest any of the Indians on the Reserves since most of them were out working, but Chief David Johnson, Tommy Harry, May Johnson and Augusta Johnson of the Alkali Lake Indian Reserve did attend the course and did quite well.\n\nThe Chief has now decided to have a log building erected on the Alkali Lake Reserve during the coming winter in which to conduct these activities. Since I have been very busy and was not sure whether any of the Indians would definitely attend the course, I could not advise you of the number likely to attend as requested in your letter.\n\nI had intimated to Chief David Johnson that the Department would very likely assist them to some extent with food while they were attending the course. It would be very much appreciated, therefore, if you could authorize purchase of food up to $36.52 to cover payment of groceries which they used during the two weeks of the course.\n\nI might also say that these Indians drove all the way from Alkali Lake and camped at the mission, so that there was no extra expense for transportation or lodgings and I am of the opinion that this expenditure is well worth while.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWC/MM\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nEducation;\n\nA Pro-Rec. instruction course has been given at the Cariboo Indian School for the past two weeks, and a competition was held on Saturday, the 29th, at the termination of the course. The Chief and three other members of the Alkali Lake Band took the course which I consider was very beneficial, and hope to see something of the sort organized on the Reserves.\n\nWm.

Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nThe children of the Cariboo Residential School, on the whole are looking healthy and happy. The boys have had several hockey games with the white boys from Williams Lake. The new Principal has succeeded in breaking another old tradition whereby none of the girls had ever before been allowed to indulge in the healthful exercise of skating. Their first appearance on ice, I am told was a lot of fun.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nNovember 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Agent expects quite an improvement in the general condition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School with the appointment of Father McGrath O.M.I., as Principal. Too much stress has been laid, in the past, on teaching the children to work, without much attempt to hold their interest in the scientific side of farming in the raising of better livestock and crops. A skating rink has been fixed up for skating and hockey and the old church is being converted into a Gymnasium. The children are all very well with the exception of Joan Eugene who is in Quesnel General Hospital.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nA/Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. M.

Doran,\n17 Graham St.,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Father Doran,\n\nThe Department has considered the application that has been made by the British Columbia Magnesium Co. Ltd., to explore and develop certain mineral deposits on the property owned by the Oblate Fathers in British Columbia, on which is located the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nI wish to inform you that the Department has no objection to an arrangement being entered into with the Company along the lines suggested in view of the fact that it is important in our war effort to assist in every way possible the development of all available deposits of strategic war materials, of which magnesium is one. It is understood that in your agreement with the company you will make provision for safeguarding as far as it is possible the carrying on of the operations at the school consistent with the reasonable exploration and development of the mineral deposit.\n\nThe Department agrees that the assistance or grants this school receives from the Government will not be affected or changed by reason of the agreement being entered into with the company and that the school will be entitled in the future to the same assistance that is or may be given to all residential schools. Should, for any reason, the mining operations make it necessary or advisable to close the school and to re-establish it elsewhere similar assistance will be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\nMarch 13th, 1942\n\nClarence Jackson, Esq.,\nExecutive Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nUpon my return to Vancouver I set to work to try to resolve the difficulties which beset B.C. Magnesium Company Limited. I think we have satisfied the Oblates' Order on all but two questions, namely:\n\n1. If it becomes necessary to move the school will the Department of Indian Affairs authorize the building of a school on another location?\n\n2. In that event, will the Department of Munitions and Supply agree to give the necessary priority as to the materials required for the new buildings?\n\nI believe that if the Metals Controller will say that this is a necessary development, the Department of Munitions and Supply will grant the necessary priority. With that in mind, I have written to Mr. Bateman the Metals Controller a copy of which letter I enclose herewith.\n\nShould Mr. Bateman's reply be favourable, will your Department be prepared to give an affirmative...\nClarence Jackson, Esq.,\n\nMarch 13th, 1942.\n\nanswer on the question which affects it, since I am satisfied the Order will not enter into the arrangement on any other basis.\n\nI would very much appreciate a reply at your early convenience. I very much appreciate your kindness in seeing me while in Ottawa, and the assistance which you gave to me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. S. Owen\n\nWSO:A\nEncl.\nMarch 13th,\n1942\n\nG. C. Bateman, Esq.,\nMetals Controller,\nDepartment of Munitions & Supply,\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur client, B. C. Magnesium Company Limited (N.P.L.), has located what is considered to be a substantial deposit of magnesium ore on property Crown granted by the Province of British Columbia to the Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in the Province of British Columbia, and has been negotiating for some months past with the officers of that Order with the object of securing mining rights on the said property which is described as \"Lots 22, 23, 24, 27, 43, 118 and 450, Group 1, Cariboo District\". On this property at the present time, the Order conducts an Indian School and the mining operations, if carried on, may interfere with the school work to such an extent that the School will have to be moved to another location.\n\nOur client is prepared to compensate the Order for any loss or damage suffered by it, but the Order is primarily concerned in conducting its educational work and is very much afraid that if it becomes necessary to move from this property...\nand build another school, one or both of two things may happen. Either the Department of Indian Affairs may refuse to grant permission to the Order to establish the School elsewhere, or the Department of Munitions and Supply may refuse to give the Order the necessary priority to secure the required materials for the new buildings. The writer has discussed this matter with both Mr. Clarence Jackson, Executive Secretary of the Department of Mines and Resources and with Mr. W. J. Bennett, Executive Assistant to the Minister of Munitions and Supply. Both Mr. Jackson and Mr. Bennett are anxious to do everything possible to secure a supply of this very essential war material and we believe that if you will express the opinion that this is a necessary development, both these Departments will give the required assurance to the Order so that the Order may enter into an agreement with our client with safety, and we may without delay run the necessary tests to determine whether or not a process can be found to extract the magnesium and if so, commence the mining operation without delay.\n\nWe should say that certain tests have been made, and the responsible officers of the Company are satisfied that there are important deposits of magnesium ore and that the showing justifies a full examination of the claims by diamond drilling and other ways, and the securing of an engineer's report.\nG. C. Bateman, Esq.,\nMetals Controller,\n\nMarch 13th, 1942.\n\nMr. H. G. Wilmot is the Company's engineer and has made a preliminary examination. Mr. E. R. Shepherd, another mining engineer also interested in the Company, has been over the property also. Both these gentlemen have had very considerable experience and samples have been taken from the property for the purpose of conducting experiments as to the proper method of treatment of the ore.\n\nIf there is any further information which you require we would be glad to secure it for you from either Mr. Wilmot or Mr. Shepherd. If you wish a reference as to either Mr. Wilmot or Mr. Shepherd, we believe Dr. John Walker, Deputy Minister of Mines for British Columbia knows both of them favourably and well.\n\nWe need not stress the urgent need for an early reply and will appreciate anything that you are able to do to advance this matter. Naturally the information contained in this letter has been obtained from our clients, and is forwarded to you in the strictest confidence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCAMPNEY, OWEN & MURPHY\n\nPer\n\nW. S. Owen\nExtract from Commissioner MacKay's letter dated November 5, 1938.\n\nIt is noticed by me that apparently no school work is done at this school on Monday at all. This reduces the school days, i.e., days on which academic work is done, to four days a week. This would not seem sufficient, as even during those days certain work, agricultural and domestic, has to be done by the children. I would suggest that the Principal's attention be drawn to this and that, even though Monday is washday, a couple of hours classroom work be done in the afternoon.\n\nHere, too, as at Lejac, the washing of sheets once a month would hardly seem to be adequate from a sanitary point of view.\n\n(Sgd.) D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Cariboo Indian Residential School dated October 28, 1939:\n\nI had an opportunity to see the children and the school in its ordinary condition and without any special preparation for such an inspection.\n\nThe conditions were just the same as when notice is given of my intended inspection.\n\nThe new Principal is not a young man. I hope that he will be able to conduct this very old school in as efficient a manner as the Rev. G. Forbes did, but I somewhat doubt it. He had no assistant Priest at the school when I visited it. All the Priests were away on Missions, with the exception of the Principal of course.\n\nWhile the actual classroom work is much the same as on the occasion of my last visit, I was not very much impressed with what I saw on the boys' side.\n\nA large number of small boys were playing about without supervision around 9 a.m. when I think they should have been doing useful work of some kind. In the ordinary way on any other day of the week they would have been probably in the schoolroom. The girls were in the laundry at this time. The boys' disciplinarian was unsheaved. I am told that he is very good with the boys. His manner in my opinion is far from good. He is inclined to shout at the boys working.\n\nI explained to the Reverend Principal that the Department held him responsible for the proper administration of his school, and that he was responsible for any corporal punishment of the children, no matter by whom administered.\n\nI certainly hope that we shall not hear of any undue roughness with the children here.\n\n(Sgd.)

Forbes, O.M.I., has left the Cariboo Indian Residential School and has been succeeded by Rev. M. Murphy, O.M.I. We do not appear to have received any communication from you in regard to this change in principal at the Cariboo School.\n\nWhile no official communication has been received, we have heard several rumors that the Oblate Order intends to take over the Christie Residential School. I should appreciate your advising if such action has been taken and, if so, when it will go into effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Jos. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\n151 Laurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Rev. G. Forbes, principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential school has left for the west coast and his place here has been filled by the Rev. M. Murphy whom I have not yet had an opportunity to interview. The Rev. Forbes was a capable official and will be greatly missed.\n\nH. E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\nKamloops, B.C.,\nMarch 7, 1945.\n\nGeneral Report\nCariboo Residential Indian School\nPrincipal: Rev. Father J. McGrath\n\nVocational Education\n\nTwo notable improvements were made during the past year in conditions relating to pupils' tasks outside the classroom. The first was the renting of a saw for a few days last fall and the sawing of a considerable quantity of wood. The boys were thus relieved of much hard labor. The second was the installing of the clothes-washer purchased before my last visit, and the consequent lightening of the girls' labor.\n\nThe Principal has in mind plans for the better use of the time saved by these improvements. For the boys he plans, and indeed has already organized, courses in carpentry. He is also thinking of organizing boys' milk-cattle clubs. Later in the season he hopes to interest the girls in gardening.\n\nIf properly executed, these projects should be very valuable. Proper execution involves, I think, the following features:\n\n(1) Pupil participation in planning.\n(2) A thorough understanding of, and an interest in, the purposes served by each project and the principles underlying it. (A mere mechanical performance of set tasks will yield meager results).\n(3) The correlation of the classroom courses, particularly science courses, with the projects.\n\nFire Protection\n\nThe fire-protection in the plant as a whole is inadequate. The water-pressure is low; fire-extinguishers and water carried in pails would have to be relied on to extinguish a blaze.\n\nThere are still ordinary locks on the fire-escape doors and the girls' door was locked when I inspected it. Outside of these doors are porches, the doors of which are firmly secured by hooks. There appears to be a grave danger that in case of fire at night pupils would pile up against these doors and be trampled, suffocated, or burned. The hazards are particularly serious in the girls' dormitory.\nCariboo Residential Indian School\n\nDormitories\n\nAlthough the floors in the girls' dormitory are rough, conditions generally are satisfactory. The bedclothes are clean and the beds fairly comfortable.\n\nAs much cannot be said of the boys' dormitory. The springs of many of the beds are sagging almost to the floor, the bedclothes are dirty, and the odor which meets one at the door is anything but pleasant.\n\nDining Room and Food\n\nI have heard no complaints regarding food in this institution. It appears to be plentiful and fairly adequate in other respects. The supply of apples is this year more plentiful than last. Meals are carefully supervised.\n\nWater Supply\n\nA supply of water is piped in from the hills. It is filtered before being used.\n\nGeneral Conditions\n\nPlant. For reasons which I have mentioned in previous reports, I regard this plant as wholly unsuitable for present school needs. I think that the time has come for the Indian Department either to close this institution and establish day schools in the villages, or to acquire the land on which the buildings stand and erect a modern plant.\n\nClassroom Program and Procedures\n\nAs I have indicated in my reports on individual teachers, there appear to be few marked changes in the character of the teaching since last year. There is, I think, a slight tendency toward more freedom and informality in the classroom, but it is far from certain that much of the work done in grades III to VI is still unrelated to the children's experience and is almost meaningless to them. The discussion of pictures shown in the assembly hall is valuable...\n\nonly one of the general proposals that I made last year for the improvement of classroom instruction has been carried out. These proposals were: (1) the division of the primary division into two parts for at least part of the year; (2) the making arrangements for the sisters to visit the Williams Lake school; (3) the providing of more supplementary books; and (4) the reading of some professional books by the teachers.\n\nA few supplementary books\u2014a stock which in any B.C. provincial school would be regarded as insignificant\u2014have been purchased.\n\nI am myself partly responsible for the fact that my last proposal met with no response: I neglected to supply the principal with the names of a few professional books and magazines.\nRecreational activities. During the past two years there has been a notable improvement in the providing of facilities for recreation. Action pictures are shown every two weeks and are later discussed in the classrooms. Ice rinks have been made for both boys and girls and are used regularly. The pupils play basketball. Evening entertainments are held from time to time. Instruments for a pipe-and-drum band and some brass instruments as well have been purchased, and, when leaders become available, will be used.\n\nFor the organizing of all these activities the Principal has been mainly responsible, and should, I think, be highly commended.\n\nRepairs. The Principal hopes before long to have in operation a saw which will produce rough lumber, much of which is badly needed for many purposes\u2014among others construction of bookshelves in the classrooms.\n\nH.

I have again suggested that she attempt to secure a more natural and informal atmosphere in the classroom, and that she eliminate from her courses all terms and principles that the pupils cannot understand and use. She is still placing considerable emphasis on mere lip learning and verbal memory.\n\nI again suggest that more language and less grammar be taught in grades VI and VII, and that all courses should be related to the pupils' surroundings and immediate experience.\n\nI am pleased to note that some library books have been purchased during the year and are being used.

The teaching of 51 Indian children in Grades I and II, many of whom entered school for the first time this year and are only now beginning to speak English, is beyond the ability of any teacher who tries to carry out modern aims and to use modern procedures. Under these circumstances Sister Cecile cannot be blamed for relying rather widely on \"concert\" methods by which pupils are treated in the mass rather than as individuals. The unfortunate result, however, is to accentuate the Indian child's tendency toward diffidence and inarticulateness.\n\nIt is difficult to predict what Sister Cecile might accomplish under normal conditions. She appears to be sincere and conscientious, and has improved her procedures noticeably during the past two years.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nI.

She appears to be conscientious and interested in her pupils.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Cariboo Indian School was visited and Brother MacDonald seems to be holding the interest of the boys. The drum and fife Band is coming along and preparations are under way for hockey during the Winter.\n\nThe present Delco lighting plant is overloaded and the batteries are worn out. An old auxiliary plant is a complete wreck and it is doubtful if the present outfit will last the Winter. I would suggest that if might be possible for the Department even at this early date, to get a Diesel plant with sufficient capacity, that has been discarded by the Military authorities. In view of the fact that several Air Training Stations are closing this might be possible.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH SEPTEMBER, 1944\n\nEducation;\n\nThe Cariboo Indian Residential School re-opened on September 3rd with Fr. Hennessy in charge temporarily. Several Indians asked for an extension of time to return their older children so that they could help with the hay harvest which has been seriously delayed on account of wet weather.\n\nThe appointment of Brother MacDonald as disciplinarian is a much needed improvement. He is organizing a drum and fif Band and keeps the boys occupied playing games in their spare time.\n\nThe new Washer in the laundry is now installed and it is now possible to have one extra half day for teaching academic subjects.\n\nWilliam Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Board recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of $5,685 for the employment of eight watchmen at the following Indian Residential schools, such expenditure to be chargeable to Vote 166, 1944-45, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n(a) NUNAVUT\n\nFort George Church of England Residential School\n\n(b) NWT\n\nMoose Fort Church of England Residential School\n\n(c) NORTHWEST TERRITORIES\n\nThunderchild Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(d) ALBERTA\n\nKootenay Roman Catholic Residential School\nCrowfoot Roman Catholic Residential School\nHoly Angels Roman Catholic Residential School\nJesuit Roman Catholic Residential School\nSt. Albert Roman Catholic Residential School\nSturgeon Lake Roman Catholic Residential School\nVernon Roman Catholic Residential School\nWabasca Church Roman Catholic Residential School\nWabasca Roman Catholic Residential School\nWhitefish Lake Church of England Residential School.\n\n(e) BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nCariboo Roman Catholic Residential School\nChristie Roman Catholic Residential School\nSt. Mary's Mission Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(f) NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nAkranvik Church of England Residential School\nAkranvik Roman Catholic Residential School\nFort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School\nFort Providence Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(Sgd.)

Christie, Indian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay has forwarded to us Inspector McArthur's report regarding his inspection of the Cariboo Residential School. He states that he has already written you regarding fire exits and the condition of the beds and bed clothing in the boys' dormitory.\n\nThere is another section of the report which I wish you would bring to the attention of the Principal. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Only one of the general proposals that I made last year for the improvement of classroom instruction has been carried out. These proposals were: (1) the division of the primary division into two parts for at least a part of the day; (2) the making arrangements for the Sisters to visit the Williams Lake School; (3) the providing of more supplementary books; and (4) the reading of some professional books by the teachers.\"\n\nIt is felt that the classroom teachers should make provision for carrying out the first two recommendations made by the Inspector. Regarding the third and fourth recommendations, we will arrange to send more supplementary books and also some professional books for the teachers before the classrooms re-open in September.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector McArthur's report of his inspection of the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\nThe condition of the buildings at this school is well known to the Department, the matter having been dealt with in previous inspection reports and referred to from time to time by Mr. Indian Agent Christie and this office. The remedy is the replacement of the existing group of buildings by an up-to-date residential school unit or the provision of suitable day schools in the areas from which the pupilage is drawn.\n\nThe situation complained of by Mr. McArthur with respect to the fire exits could no doubt be improved without much expense and the Agent is being requested to look into this matter and advise in what ways this could be brought about.\n\nThe condition of the beds and bed clothing in the boys' dormitory reported by Mr. McArthur is also being drawn to the attention of the Agent with a request that he discuss the matter with the Rev. Principal and arrange to have this situation remedied.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, March 26, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. DOUCET,\n\nInspector McArthur, in his report on the Cariboo Residential School, recommends as follows: (a) providing more supplementary books and (b) the reading of some professional books by the teachers.\n\nAs soon as you have an opportunity to do so, I would appreciate your reviewing the requisitions received from the Cariboo School within the last year and forwarding some additional supplementary reading books as well as some professional books for the teachers, for September 1.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGeneral:\n\nMost of the Indians soldiers in this Agency have now returned from overseas and several have made application for enfranchisement. Most of them seem to have benefitted from their experiences with the Armed Forces, and have come back with more ambition to live as the white man. Jimmy Tyrell, who was doing blacksmith work in the Forestry Corps, has been employed as blacksmith and handyman on the Farm attached to the Cariboo Indian residential school.\n\nRehabilitation on Indian Reserves has been discussed with most of the Indian veterans who have returned, but it is felt wise to refrain from rushing them into any of these schemes prematurely until they have a little time to settle down.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING SEPTEMBER 30th, 1945, ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe Caribou Indian Residential School opened on September 1st and the Anaham Indian Day School on September 4th, 1945. The return of the pupils to the Residential School was much better this year. It was expected that there would have been very poor attendance at the Anaham Indian Day School during September due to the fact that most of the Indians were still having away from the main reserve, but a special effort was made to get their children back in time and practically all the pupils who attended last year are now back.\n\nThere are now fourteen pupils in the senior room and they show a very keen competitive spirit. Sr. Mary of the Angels, teacher of the senior room, visited St. Mary's school at Mission last year and saw the Pro-rec. work; and now has her pupils started on this type of physical education.\n\nDuring the Indian Commissioner's visit, a site was chosen for a new school on this reserve, and, as soon as it is possible to get a representative meeting, the Indians will be asked to surrender this land to the Department for school purposes.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has not yet found a teacher for the Alexis Creek Day School, but Fr. Hennessy will, in all probability, fill for the winter months, i.e., November to March. With the erection of a school and living quarters, it may be possible to get the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King to supply a teacher for this school next year.\n\nIt was thought that there might be great difficulty in getting new pupils for the Cariboo Indian Residential School this season due to the non-payment of family Allowance to pupils attending Residential Schools, and, although the principal advises me that he is ten pupils short of the number provided for by the Department in the grant, there\nEDUCATION\n\nIt is presumed that the grading of pupils in Indian schools should correspond to the standard of grades in white schools. If this is the case, I am of the opinion that the grading is too high at the Cariboo Residential School, since the five pupils transferred from that institution to the Anaham Indian Day School, two who had completed one year in Grade 6 were put back in Grade 4, the teacher of the senior room at Anaham advising me they were unable to do the work.\n\nOne of the drawbacks to Indian education in this Agency has been due to the fact that Indian parents would not, in most cases, send their children until they were 10 to 12 years old, and, therefore, they never got very far. On the other hand, it has been found that at Anaham it is difficult to keep the pre-school children under six away from school.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH 31, 1945, ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION\n\nInspector McArthur visited the Cariboo Indian School during March and his report has no doubt been received by the Department by this time. Having been called out to the Chilcotin, I could not accompany Mr. McArthur on his inspection, but following his report, I paid a visit to the School some days later, and paid particular attention to the matters on which complaint was made and had the fire alarm sounded.\n\nThe children were very orderly in getting out of the buildings and were all out in under one minute. Fr. McGrath had already taken the locks off all the escape doors, the subject of a very legitimate complaint by inspector McArthur. It is felt, however, that Mr. McArthur has exaggerated regarding the condition of the boys' dormitory, which has been painted up and is very considerably improved since last year. The improvements in this school since it opened last September have been very considerable, and are as follows:\n\nEquipment: Laundry equipment, consisting of power washer and extractor, saving much time for the girls and improving hygienic conditions.\n\nVocational: Manual Training classes have been organized. Also Calf Club and Potato Club.\n\nRecreational: The Pro-Rec. program has been continued. Three Skating rinks were maintained during the past winter, two for the boys and one for the girls. Hockey games were organized and matches played with boys from the Williams Lake white school.\n\nA boys' fife and drum band has been organized by Brother MacDonald and is making good progress. Brother MacDonald, who commenced duties as disciplinarian last September, has been a great asset to the school, and there has been only one occasion of truancy since last September. The morale amongst the boys was very low during 1943-44 and a number of boys were expelled in June, so that I consider Brother (over)\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR JUNE QUARTER, 1945 - WILLIAMS LAKE\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAn annex is under construction at the Cariboo Indian residential school to be used as an infirmary and for isolation purposes, which is long overdue.\n\nI attended a concert of singing, dancing, pro-rec work and short plays put on by the pupils and found much improvement over previous efforts.\n\nThe Boy's Fife and Drum band took part in the Victory day Celebrations at Williams Lake, and they also headed the Parade at Quesnel for July 1st celebrations.\n\nWm.

Morris, O.M.I., has been acting as principal of Williams' Lake School, owing to the breakdown in health of Father McGrath. Father Morris seems to have given satisfaction in his work, with the result that I have great pleasure in submitting his name as the permanent principal of the Cariboo Indian School.\n\nI am anxious that some time next year a representative of our Schools (Father O'Grady for preference) as well as one of our Missionaries,\nEDUCATION\n\nBrother MacDonald has now got the assistance of an Indian boy from St. Mary's Indian Mission School, Ernie Charles who is instructor in physical training and Pro-rec work.\n\nMr. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nOctober 12, 1946.\n\nAGENCY REPORT FOR QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1946.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAt the Cariboo Indian School, Sister Josephine has been replaced as Superior by Sister St. John the Baptist which I consider will be an improvement.\n\nWm.

McGrath, O.M.I., Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School resigned on account of ill health and his place has been filled temporarily by Rev. Fr. Morris, O.M.I. I am of the opinion that the Principal's duties at this school are too onerous consisting of running the school and also a large farm.\n\nI would say that this school has had the most satisfactory year since I came to this Agency, especially so far as morale is concerned. Sports have been indulged in to a greater extent and softball games have been played with the Williams Lake School by boys and girls. The calf club is coming along well and also the boys band which was again invited to play at the Quesnel Dominion Day celebration. The boys also put on a Pro-Rec display at Quesnel which was very much appreciated by the onlookers.\n\nWm Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 5, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M.

Until such time as a permanent appointment of a new Principal can be made may I suggest that Reverend Father A. Morris be allowed to take charge as Acting Principal. Father Morris has been in Williams Lake for several years, knows the Indian temperament, and I think should be able to carry on for some time.\nOttawa, June 1, 1946.\n\nDear Father Scannell:\n\nThe cheque for the March Quarter per capita allowance of the Cariboo Indian Residential School was forwarded to Reverend J. McGrath, O.M.I.\n\nThe cheque has now been returned in a letter signed by Reverend J. Morris, O.M.I., who states that he is Principal of the School.

Provincial of the Oblate Order, discussed the great need for a new school building to replace the present structure and promised his fullest cooperation in the acquisition of land from the Order for school purposes and intimated that the Order is unable to finance the erection of a new building.

A survey of the educational requirements of this Agency will be undertaken as soon as possible with a view to determining the reserves that may be better served by day schools.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nST. JOSEPH'S RECTORY\n151 Laurier Ave., E\n\nOttawa, Ont., 22nd February, 1947\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Welfare Department,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have just returned after being three months in the West, during which time I visited all our B.C. Indian Schools with the exception of Kakawis. Unfortunately an attack of bronchitis prevented me from taking that trip.\n\nI feel that I should draw your attention to the hard struggle that most of these schools are experiencing in order to make ends meet from the financial angle, and I am respectfully asking you to submit this matter to the Department for their very urgent consideration.\n\nWilliams Lake School in particular is in a very bad way. Already there is a large overdraft at the Bank, even though all the salaries on the part of the Fathers and Brothers have been eliminated. With the cost of living mounting to such high proportions it is impossible to finance a school on the present per capita grant. I am not in a position to carry the overdraft that I can see will be on the books by the end of the present school year. It seems to me that, unless some financial assistance is forthcoming to help to meet this crisis, we shall be obliged to close down the school.\n\nThere is another point upon which I beg you to give particular attention, and that is the electric plant now working in Williams Lake school. During the days that I spent there it was practically impossible to read by the light produced. The enclosed letter from the Principal, which has reached me since my return, speaks far more eloquently than I can upon the haunting fear that I had during my stay, namely should fire break out!\n\nDuring my stay in the West I was, shall I say\namused, but at the same time annoyed, as I listened to a broadcast put on from the Vancouver Radio Station concerning Indian affairs. The speakers on the broadcast were Chief Michael of Lillooet, Mr. Guy Williams, President of the Native Brotherhood together with another speaker. There is no doubt that such broadcasts are doing considerable harm to the reputation of the Indian Department, because there seems to be no one authorized to reply to the very false charges made over the air. Perhaps I am going too far in suggesting that the Department should ask for a copy of the script of the Broadcast that was put over from Vancouver some weeks ago. I immediately called Father O'Grady's attention to it and suggested that he should get in touch with the Commissioner. One of the statements made in that broadcast, and naturally believed, because not contradicted, was the Indian schools did not teach the Indian child anything beyond the third or fourth grade.\n\nWith my kind regards,\n\nBelieve me, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nProvincial.\n\nP.S. I enclose a summary of the Broadcast as taken down by Rev. Father Forbes during the Broadcast discussion.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMarch 20, 1948.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Bishop of Kamloops in which he asks me to bring to your attention the serious situation of the schools and other educational facilities carried on by the various Catholic orders throughout the Cariboo. The Bishop has drawn to my attention, especially, the condition of the Indian residential school at 15C Mile House, and the day schools at Redstone Meadows and Anaham Indian Reserve, near Hanceville and Alexis Creek respectively.\n\nI myself have visited the school at 15C Mile House and can vouch for the dilapidated condition of the buildings and the fact that they constitute a very serious fire hazard. The Oblate Fathers have found that they are unable to carry on the task of education and to repair, renovate and renew buildings as they should be. The result is that while they have striven for years to keep the buildings up, they have seen them going steadily behind, with constantly increasing regret until they are now practically forced to the conclusion that they cannot continue under present circumstances. This is not to mention the heating and lighting arrangements, which are utterly inadequate.\n\nAt Anaham Indian Reserve the Department has apparently accepted the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King as teachers, social workers and nurses, and I understand has undertaken to build a day school there. At present, the Sisters are forced to use the old community hall as a school. This is an old log building\ntotally unfit for the purpose, and it seems an injustice to accept the services of the Sisters and expect them to continue under these circumstances.\n\nMuch the same situation prevails at Redstone Meadows\u2014the church is used as a school there, which is inadequate for the purpose.\n\nIn general, it is felt that the work of education in the Williams Lake Agency lags far behind those in other agencies throughout the province. The Bishop states that he fully recognizes and appreciates the splendid facilities which have been made available, for instance, at Kamloops (although there are still certain improvements which could be made, as outlined by Father O'Grady in a brief presented to the Indian Affairs Committee last year), and from my knowledge of these circumstances and of those prevailing in the Cariboo, I am able to appreciate his feeling that the two areas are not to be compared.\n\nI would appreciate very much the favour of advice from you as to what may be intended to be done, if anything, to remedy the situation throughout the Williams Lake Agency with respect to educational facilities there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. D. Fulton\n\nEDF/MG\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Fulton:\n\nI received your letter of March 20th with reference to the education of Indian children in the Cariboo district.\n\nWe have recently supplied a new lighting plant and at the present time certain wiring is being done to the Cariboo Residential School at 150 Mile House. We hope to have funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 for additional repairs.\n\nWe also propose to erect a new day school at Anaham Lake during the coming summer.\n\nI appreciate the interest you are taking in Indian educational work in the Cariboo district and I can assure you that the representations that you have made will receive our very careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nE.D.

However, I observe that no mention is made of the situation at Redstone Meadows, which was referred to in my letter of March 20th. I would be very glad indeed if you will be kind enough to let me hear from you in this connection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Caribou Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1941\n\nPrincipal: Michael Murphy\n\nDated March 31st 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and do hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOO INDIAN RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1941\n\nPrincipal: Michael Murphy\n\nDated July 5th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 2, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December, 1941.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Jan. 3, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cariboo Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: Jan. 3, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.
