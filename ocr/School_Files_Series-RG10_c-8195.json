Voucher no. 258 covering the non draft glass which I purchased on request of Mr Cowan Principal of the U. C. School.\n\nThe widows are so low in the school, that he asked if it would be possible to buy some glass to set on the inside of the windows to prevent the direct draft on the children when the windows are open, it was necessary to buy plate glass, then they had to be ground on one edge, to prevent the kiddies getting cut, I hope my action in this connection will meet with your approval. You will note that the kinder garden table did not cost very much, as we were able to make over an old table, and all that was necessary to buy was a few bits of lumber, and some oil cloth to cover it.

SCHOOL, CHRISTIAN ISLAND, Ont. for February, 1946.\n\nRe: Katharine Monague - The parents have voiced a complaint that a predisposing cause of this girl's serious illness was the cold classroom. We agree with them. The teaching conditions in this classroom during the winter are, at times, highly unsatisfactory, e.g.,\n\nOn Fri., Feb. 15 - Room temp. 9 A.M. 42\n\" \" \" 4 P.M. 36\n\nJan. 21 - \" \" 9 A.M. 34\n\" 22 \" \" 9 A.M. 32\n\nThe temperature on these days rarely rises to a comfortable degree of heat.\n\nHow can a teacher insist that pupils attend school on such days? We try to carry on in one room, but this is not conducive to good teaching results.\nOttawa, March 12, 1946.\n\nMr. G.E. Hurl, Indian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\nWhen submitting his monthly report of day school attendance for the month of February, the Principal of the Christian Island United Church School points out that the classroom is very cold in the winter time.

We are at a loss to understand why this is chargeable to Band Funds.\n\nOn voucher No. 99 you state \"Chargeable to Band Funds and Vote 76\". The same confusion exists on your voucher No. 97, dated August 7th, 1946, which we note is a Credit voucher. When a Credit voucher is submitted it must be against an advance made for the purpose. Would you be good enough to give the number of the cheque which you received to be used in this connection. We are also returning voucher No. 97.\n\nIt is requested, please, that where separate expenditures are required, i.e., an expenditure from Vote 76 - Education, and an expenditure from Band Funds, that separate vouchers be drawn up indicating thereon the amount chargeable and the authority for the expenditure or in the case of an advance, the cheque by which you received the advance. If you will destroy these vouchers and, in due course, return separate vouchers for each account we will arrange to pass them for payment.\n\nThe above remarks are not made in any spirit of criticism because we are aware of the fact that you cannot be expected to follow all the details of correct procedure until you have had an opportunity of familiarizing yourself with them. It would be appreciated, however, if you would be guided by the foregoing remarks and if there are any points on which you desire information do not hesitate to advise us and we will be glad to assist you.\n\nA.G.

The school is in good repair. The residence is on a foundation but there is no foundation, or cellar, under the school room section. There were complaints that the class rooms are very difficult to heat. Mr. Gauthier reports that he had the furnace pipes under the class rooms repaired and covered with asbestos last year, which made a big improvement in the heating. Consideration should be given to boarding up the lower part of the floor joist and fill it in with shavings and lime. This small repair could be done at little cost and, no doubt, would be very helpful.\n\nThere are no outside windows on the school, or residence. I would recommend that the Superintendent be authorized to purchase for the school 9 windows 5'6\" x 3' and six outside windows for the residence 5'6\" x 30\".\n\nThe desks are in very bad condition. I would recommend that thirty of the new type desks be supplied - 10 small, 10 medium and 10 large.\n\nIt was drawn to my attention that in the senior class room, the windows with an eastern and southern exposure should have blinds. The Superintendent was instructed to purchase blinds and submit a voucher in the usual manner.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJuly 27th 1948\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File: 6-1-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Mr. H.E.

Kindly give full particulars in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nW.B. Maclean, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nExtracts from annual report of Sept.

School matters are in a very state on this reserve, as there is no school; consequently the education of the children is entirely neglected.\nSept. Maclean's\nStat. state - asked for\n\nOCT26 1898\n\nOhio\nPop. 79 from 6 to 15\n\naccording Sept Maclean's\nstatistical statement to\n30 June 1898.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your favor of the 21st inst requesting a report on the lack of educational facilities for the education of the children at the Dokis Reserve, I wish to say that owing to the isolated position of the Dokis Reserve, located as it is on the French River, about forty miles west of North Bay, it would be impossible for the children of this band (who number 17 of school age) to attend any white school in the vicinity of the Reserve, as I do not know of any white school being located within a very considerable distance of Dokis.\n\nThe only manner in which the children of this Band can be educated, would be by the establishing of a school at their Reserve, but owing to a lack of funds I do not see how this is to be accomplished at present. I may say however that the Dokis Band are the owners of one of the most valuable tracts of pine timber in this district, which if disposed of, or the proceeds therefrom placed to the credit of their Trust Fund, would enable them to establish and maintain a school for the education of their children, as well as to entitle each member of the band to a sum of interest money sufficiently large to purchase a great...\nSir,\n\nmany of the necessaries of life which they do not at present enjoy. The accomplishment of this most worthy object which would place the members of this Band in such a prosperous condition is prevented by the absolute refusal of Chief Pokio to consent to the sale of their timber; who being himself fairly well off, cannot be made to understand the many benefits which would accrue to the members of his Band through the sale of the timber, nor to appreciate the advantages which the establishment of a school on the Reserve, would give to the children of the Band.\n\nI am therefore unable to see how any progress can be made in educational matters on this Reserve at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.B. Maclean\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 14th Oct., 1900\n\nMemorandum for Schools,\n\nI notice the following remark in the annual report of Superintendent Maclean.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThere are no facilities for education for the members of this band; consequently the children belonging to it are growing up without any of the advantages which education gives.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 3rd Feb., 1903.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pedley,\u2014\n\nSuperintendent Maclean, in his annual report, states that there are 32 children in the Dokis Band, French River, that they have no educational facilities whatever on the reserve, and that consequently the children are growing up without the advantages that education gives. I do not think the funds of this band will warrant any expenditure therefrom towards the construction and maintenance of a school on the reserve; but it is questionable whether it would not be advisable to ask Parliament to vote sufficient money for the purpose. I think that the refusal of these Indians to surrender their timber, to be sold for their benefit, is largely owing to their ignorance. If the timber were sold they would have ample funds to maintain a school of their own and pay for expenses incidental to the management of their reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nExd.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:-\nOTTAWA, 18th February, 1903.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:-\n\nMr. Supt. McLean has on many occasions called the attention of the Department to the fact that there are no educational facilities provided for the children of Dekis Band, whose reserve is on the French River. On two occasions provision for a teacher's salary has been noted for the estimates but has been disallowed. These Indians have no funds from which a salary could be paid and in the meantime their children, who number 32 of school age according to the last Census, are growing up without any education whatever. Schools are provided for other Bands with a smaller number of children and it is a question for the Department to decide whether anything shall be done for this Band.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the Indians would be willing to take their children to school if the Department paid the cost and expenses. It is stated that there was no expense in case of the late payments they were receiving in pension to offset. Land was also being used by the Indians which could be suitable for a school. It was also suggested that the school should be built near the Chief's residence with the securing of the building costs. It was also suggested that the Indians should be able to secure a suitable site for the summer school.\n\nThe question of starting a school upon the Mohawk Reserve has been taken up with the Indians several times during while the majority state they would like to have a school and are willing.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This rental is to include cleaning, heating and any repairs that may be required to the building.\n\nYou may appoint Miss Alice Bitawanakwat as teacher of this school and she will be paid at the rate of $50.00 a month for her services. The school should be opened as soon as possible after the first of June, next.\n\nIn regard to the requisition for supplies which you forwarded I beg to say that the blackboard, readers, chalk, blackboard eraser, copy books, pen holders, pen nibs, slate pencils and lead pencils will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office.

The only excuse the Chief gives that He does not want the Department to use any of their money for school or other purpose.\n\nWhen I was leaving the reserve the Chief brought up the question of children attending school who do not belong to the Dokis band. There are two families, Chertrand and Laravier, the women belong to the band but their husbands or children do not belong.\n\nThe Chief's brother Frank Dokis Sr has also two children of school age who belonged to his wife previous to his marriage. The Chief's brother has always encouraged the starting of a school upon the reserve against the Chief's wishes, and I am under the impression this move is to try and deprive the above two children of Frank Dokis attending school.\n\nThe Chief's action may affect the attendance but like the timber question will come around in time. On the whole the band is in favour of a school excepting three families.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 7, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in further reference to starting a summer school on the Dokis Indian Reserve and stating that you visited the reserve with the teacher and made arrangements to open the school the next morning.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is satisfactory.\n\nI may inform you that the Chief of this band called at the Department a few days ago in regard to the school.

If this teacher is to be kept on in this or any other school, she should be required to qualify by attendance at Summer School.\n\nIf the best success is to be attained in a school of this type, the pupils should be given a thorough training in Oral English, in special periods in Form I, and in correlation with other subjects in the other grades. Pupils should be required to speak more loudly when answering. Examination of grading given above shows that very little of the work of the school is at all satisfactory. It would be advisable, if at all possible, to secure a teacher with Ontario qualifications.\nTo Mr. Farris,\n\nDear Mr. Farris,\n\nI was at my mission garden village trip recently, just a short while after you were there, and I would have liked to meet you.\n\nMiss Addy, teacher that you met, has been 4 years at garden village and I am glad to hear that she is coming back. She was very encouraged when you told her that there was no complaint against her, which is absolutely true.\n\nTwo fallouts, at Dottie Bay, is doing fine and I wish she would come back. Dottie Bay is so lonesome that a young girl or boy can't stay there, or if they stay they go to French with the outsiders and become wild, according to the Indians' point of view, of course. There who rely troubles and complaints at Dottie Bay when a boy or girl was teaching there. So, I wish that third fallout would be re-engaged in the Indian service. I know of only one Indian kicking, but he doesn't even know how to sign his name, and in fact he kicked against every teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cockburn, Indian agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThey tell me that Miss Jallett was just re-appointed at Dottie Bay, surprising. I can't believe it for she is the best teacher we ever had in these since 1919. She has been teaching during 5 years when Dottie Bay had only a summer-school and one year in the school school.\n\nThose who taught out of that period were young people, and because Dottie Bay is very hard to stay in and the people very hard to please, there was no one who did the work well. The three years before Miss Jallett's coming, there was a young man well qualified in the normal school, but he had no authority, no control, and the children learned nothing and he learned himself how to gamble, drink, and stay late at night. The same for the young girls who were teachers at Dottie Bay; as they were so immature and had to face first-class kickers, they sought for consolation and amusement with outside boys, increasing the mischief and troubles, and the children learned nothing.\n\nThen, the conclusion is that no young people should be teaching at Dottie Bay, therefore she can't please the Indians who want a teacher quiet, giving good example, having control over the pupils, and making them improve.\n\nMiss Jallett is the ideal for the Dottie Band.\nshe is quiet, aged, don't run after amusement to parties nor then she has a good control over the pupils, teaches them well, and so I am no more tired with complaints when she is there.\n\nSo, I ask you eagerly for the good of the Dottie Bay Band and for the good of the children in there as far as instruction and morals are concerned to endeavour to keep Miss Jallbut into this Ditto school.\n\nI hope that the Department won't refuse us this great favor and that the new Interior Minister, Hon. Murphy will understand our situation.\n\nMoreover, I belong to an order, the Jesuits order, which knows something about instruction and education, since it is our specialty, and who also, numerous as they are in Canada, can help considerably the Conservative Party.\n\nSo, dear Mr. Cashman, tell me the truth absolutely, is Miss Jallbut re-accepted or not? If she is not accepted, I am going to write to Honorable Murphy, to explain the situation about the Indian mission.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. L. Porchon S.J.\nJesuit Indian missionary\nSt Ann's Rectory\nSudbury\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also beg to report that Mrs Jalbert was informed on the 11th instant that the Department would not require her services after the school closes after the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to the statement of an inspector you claim that Miss Jallott, the best teacher who was ever in Dots Bay, is not coming back. I declare that your inspector is wrong saying that she did not give satisfaction. She is aged, experienced, has control over the children, and made them learn something, although she is not qualified into the normal school. A second class does not give necessarily the gift of teaching.\n\nThe young Basil Horan, a 2nd class certificate, was at Dots Bay before Miss Jallott gave a circus and a show in the school during 3 years; the children could hear shootings coming from the school. Miss Cooper and Stella King, both of them having a 2nd class certificate, did not earn their wages. The best teacher I ever knew was Miss Addy, in supervising, Miss McDemott in Winnipeg, Miss Jallott in Dots Bay, yet they never went through normal school.\n\nYou may say: the inspector says so. He can't know about it fairly well. He goes in the Reserve once or twice a year, and I go 12 times a year. The inspector is well qualified, you may say. But I have been in the school and college and university for 5 years old till 35 years ago as a student, and I had my B.A. into an University. So, I know something about education.\n\nSo, I say that if a young girl is sent from normal school, even with a first class certificate,\nis appointed to Dottie Bay's school, the trouble will start again, because a young person can't run that school. We had a quiet year, but that year, and I thought this will last, but I am afraid that the circus will start again in the school, if a young person is appointed there. And how the \"kids\" could learn when the teacher has no control over them, when he plays too much with them, or when he is afraid to touch any of the parents who run the school after all. So was the teacher Basil Moran.\n\nI may say that the Indians at Dottie Bay, are very vicious and hard to please and interfere too much with the school business. So it needs a teacher, old and firm enough, to make them mind their business. Which a young teacher cannot do, generally.\n\nSo, considering the welfare of the Dottie school, I beg again the re-appointment of Mrs. Gilbert.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Parchman\nSt. Ann's Rectory\nSudbury\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File385-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 30, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in which you strongly urge the re-engagement of Mrs. Jos. Jalbert as teacher of the Dokis Indian Day School for the coming school year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your recommendation as to the services of Mrs. Jalbert, the Department has reconsidered its decision and will be pleased to approve of her re-engagement. We are informing Mr. Geo. P. Cockburn, the local Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont., accordingly, and requesting him to notify Mrs. Jalbert of her re-appointment.\n\nI may add it is hoped that Mrs. Jalbert will give satisfactory service during the next school year and that she will meet with every success in the work. You might also inform Mrs. Jalbert of the approval granted for her re-engagement and impress upon her the necessity of giving every attention to her work. It is hoped that the children will make better progress under her charge next year than the Public School Inspector states they did during the past school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. L. Porcheron,\nSt. Ann's Rectory,\nSudbury, Ont.\nOttawa, June 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding dispensing with the services of Mrs. Jos. Jalbert, teacher of the Dokis Indian Day School, I have now to inform you that, upon the strong recommendation of Rev. Father Porcheron as to the services Mrs. Jalbert has performed and also as regards her suitability for the position, the Department has decided to revoke the instructions given to dispense with her services, and will now approve of her re-engagement for the coming school year. Father Porcheron states that, although she has not professional qualifications, she is able to perform the duties of teacher to better advantage than a younger woman who might be professionally qualified.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will inform Mrs. Jalbert that the Department will approve of her resuming duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, with salary at the same rate as previously allowed her. Please ascertain definitely from Mrs. Jalbert whether she will accept the position and inform the Department accordingly. I may add that we are informing Rev.

This young lady has been practically isolated all winter and has been teaching under considerable difficulty. It appears that some of the Indians have gotten out of hand and are causing her considerable trouble.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Sturgeon Falls, Mr. Marleau was appealed to and he handed the matter over to the Royal Mounted Police. I contacted them and they said while the matter really should have been handled by Mr. Marleau, they would be glad to get Mr. Marleau and go in and see if they could adjust matters satisfactorily this week. In the meantime some of the adult Indians have advised Miss Gribbon that this is just what would likely happen and that they would not pay any attention to any gratuitous advice. We would write Mr. Charron, the Inspector, who has not appeared at the school yet but we do not know his address.\n\nWe will be glad if you could get in touch with him and have him go in and inspect the school immediately and get to the bottom of the dispute.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMcGaughey & Little,\n\nPer\n\nIndian Affairs.

As a matter of fact, the Department considered that she was satisfied with the school as, in a letter dated March 16, 1942, she wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"I like this school very much. The country may be likened to Heaven. The people are very agreeable, but there is one disadvantage and, for me, not a small one. It is very difficult, sometimes impossible, to reach a doctor.\"\n\nHowever, I am forwarding Indian Agent Marleau a copy of your letter and instructing him to have Inspector Charren visit the school, if Mr. Marleau considers such action necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMessrs. McGaughey & Little,\nBarristers, Solicitors, Notaries &c.,\nImperial Bank Bldg.,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has been received from Messrs. McCaughney & Little. You will note that it refers to the teacher of the Dokis Indian Day School. Please let me have detailed information immediately regarding the matter which was referred to you and which you, in turn, referred to the R.C.M.P. It would appear that such a matter should have been handled by you and, consequently, I do not see much merit in the suggestion of Messrs. McCaughney & Little that the Separate School Inspector, Mr. Charron, be requested to visit the school. However, if you consider that such action is advisable, you can no doubt arrange with Mr. Charron to inspect the Dokis School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 27th with enclosure from Messrs. McGaughey & Little, concerning Miss Gribbons, Teacher at Dokis Indian School.\n\nI have to report that Miss Gribbons did report some trouble to me a few weeks ago, and at that time told me that she had, before speaking to me already written to the R.C.M.P. in Ottawa. I told Miss Gribbons that we had R.C.M.P. at North Bay but that I would investigate the matter myself. Miss Gribbons did call at the North Bay office and one of the officers called me and told me that they would only go in with me.\n\nI have had several letters and many verbal protests against Miss Gribbons recently. It was not a matter to be too impulsive about and I took time to hear all sides of the question. On May 26th I visited the school in the afternoon and found only 11 pupils, representing 3 families, present.\n\nThat night I held a meeting of all the men and women of the band. They were agreeable to send their children back to school but resented family matters being brought up by the teacher in class. Miss Gribbons did not follow my advice last October in selecting her boarding house, with the result that she has moved three times and left bad friends each time. She is also accused of having Indian boy friends, which has caused considerable jealousy among the village belles. In short, she is a complete failure as an Indian teacher.\n\nMr. Charron, Inspector, made his annual inspection on May 27th and reports that the pupils have only been retarded. I had occasion to judge Miss Gribbons' temper on Wednesday morning. After I had persuaded the Indians the previous night to send their children back to school, and with a class of 21 pupils that morning, the first thing Miss Gribbons did, I am certain she thought I had left the reserve, was to strap a big boy and send him home, for as she claimed, telling lies out of school. I think the matter is adjusted till the end of the term, as I advised Miss Gribbons that she must leave personal and private grievances out of school.\n\nI am well aware of my responsibilities as guardian of my Indians, at the same time, according to Section 10, Paragraph 6 of the Indian Act, the R.C.M.P. is truant officer of an Indian Reserve and I presume that was Miss Gribbons' reason for writing to them. I did not take the R.C.M.P. to the reserve with me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nJ. A. Marleau, Indian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 385-1, part 2)\nThe Commissioner:\n\nFORWARDED, 11-6-42. It would appear that the above complaint has been the result of the inability of Miss Gribbon to understand the ways of the Indians on this Reservation. The Indians apparently have very little respect for subject and according to the Indian Agent, Mr. Marleau she has proven very unsatisfactory and will not be engaged for another term. No doubt the fact that Miss Gribbon has had to board with Indian families while teaching at the Dokis Reserve has led to a great deal of this trouble.\n\nHANDED TO DEP'T CONCERNED. CONCLUDED.\n\n(F.W. Schutz) Insp.,\nTORONTO for O.C. \"O\" Div., A.O.D.\n\nWB.\nWith reference to the complaint of the above named, dated the 7th of May last which was forwarded to our Headquarters in Ottawa, Ont., this lady has been interviewed by the writer on two different occasions and this matter has been taken up with the Indian Agent at Sturgeon Falls, Ont. Different other reliable parties have also been interviewed who are well acquainted with conditions on the Dokis Indian reserve. A patrol was not made to the reserve to investigate this, as considerable expense would have to be incurred, and the complaint which appears to be a personal matter, does not warrant a patrol being made.\n\nMiss GRIBBON has taught school on this reserve for the past season only. She is a very young lady and quiet small. She is of Irish descent and has a very quick temper,\n\nOn her arrival at the Dokis reserve last September, she became friendly with two or three of the young Indian men there, which caused a great deal of criticism. She boarded at an Indian home, and no other boarding houses are available on the reserve, and found it rather difficult to live with Indians and I found fault with the meals etc., and voiced her opinion to the Indian owner. Since this, she has moved from one Indian home to another and of course found conditions the same in each one. At the present time, she is forced to live in an Indian home there which is not any good, nor are any of the others, however, Miss GRIBBON feels that Indians should keep their homes in the same condition as any clean living white man would and has told them this, and the result is that she is not liked for this.\n\nIn the class room, Miss GRIBBON has tried to impress upon the pupils that they should live like whitesmen, not like savages etc., and in several cases has strongly criticized certain individuals on the reserve, in the manner in which they are living etc. The pupils in turn have carried this information to their parents, who in turn have accused Miss GRIBBON and told her that it is not her affair how the Indians are living and that she is in no position to criticize others. At the present time, none of the Indians on the reserve have any affection for Miss GRIBBON and are quite cold in talking to her about she is no good etc., and that she is only a man crazy woman.\n\nFrom inquiries made, it has been learned that Miss GRIBBON has punished pupils in the school for something that their parents have done and the pupil was not to blame, such as the pupils coming to school not properly dressed and very dirty. She has also ordered other pupils out of the school and not to return again.\n\nContinued.\nValma GRIBBON - Dokis Indian Reserve.\nComplaint of -\n\n5. Miss GRIBBON, in the manner in which she has attempted to correct the faults of the pupils, and in an effort to correct the faults of the parents, through the pupils, and in the manner in which she punishes the pupils, she created a discord between the Indians and herself, and has lost all control of her pupils. Instead of trying to get cooperation from the older Indians, she has tried to dictate to them and now has them all working against her.\n\n6. Miss GRIBBON called in at this office during the early part of May, and when questioned, stated that the older Indians are always insulting her, but as yet, have not assaulted her. When further questioned she stated that the Indians are always teasing her, telling her that she is no good etc., but have not used any vile language. She was also questioned on other matters concerning the use of liquor on the reserve and stated that once in awhile some of the Indians get some wine from somewhere, but that liquor conditions general, was good on the reserve. She was also questioned regarding the unpatriotic ideas that some of the Indians are alleged to have picked up from the American tourists, but could not supply any worth while information whatsoever.\n\n7. In general, it appears that the Indians have teased Miss GRIBBON to such an extent that she can no longer bear it. The majority of the pupils in her school are far bigger in stature than she is and therefore, has not been able to exercise any discipline over them. These she orders to stay away from school and when the parents want to know the reason why, her temper gets the best of her, which has resulted in many hot arguments.\n\n8. Mr MARLEAU, the Indian Agent states she is unsatisfactory altogether and will not be engaged for another season.\n\n9. American tourists do not go to the Dokis reserve, although they may fish and hunt near by. A large number of the Indians on the reserve are employed as guides, but the tourists do not remain on the Dokis reserve, which is a large Island in Lake Nipissing.\n\n10. For the reasons as stated above, it was not considered that a patrol should be made to the Dokis Indian reserve. The difficulties she is having can be cleared up by the Indian agent, however, if he requires any assistance, members of this Detachment will assist him. Fyle in this connection is being considered closed at this Detachment.\n\nEXPENSES NIL:\nCASE CONCLUDED:\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is a somewhat isolated school with no teacher's residence, at which we have been paying a salary of $85.00 a teaching month.

Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. Horey:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th, which came to hand this a.m., I ought say that until I have further information re this appointment I cannot give a decided answer.\n\nYou state there are no teacher's quarters. Where then am I expected to live? As I have never heard of this reserve I would like direction as to how I should proceed there; the nearest town; the names of the present missionary, former teacher and inspector; number of pupils and condition of classes.\n\nDuring the holiday I have had letters from Fr. T. Dwyer; Fr. Oliver; Fr. Primeau and Fr. J. Dwyer all missionaries inquiring\nabout my new appointment. I was unable to give them any information as I had no reply to my letter of June 18th. All the Fathers were anxious that I stay at Mississauga, but with the conduct of your Indian Agent there, my usefulness was at an end. They, therefore, wanted me take over at Sagamok as the chief there had asked me to. You will recall I resigned conditionally, and very early in the year, all in keeping with my instructions from the late Mr. Ferrier regarding transfers. In that light, Mr. Dooley, I feel that I have not had a fair deal. My services have been the best possible, as those connected with the work know.\n\nWould you be good enough to give me my successor's name, as I have personal belongings which I wish removed. I shall be obliged if you will.\nOttawa, September 18, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant in which you seek additional information in respect to the Dokis Indian Day School and conditions generally on the Dokis Reserve.\n\nAs I intimated to you in my letter of September 14, the Dokis school is in the Nipissing Indian agency and the Indian agent is Mr. J. A. Marleau, Sturgeon Falls, Ontario. Mr. Marleau, in a recent letter, states:\n\n\"The distance to Dokis Indian Day School from either North Bay or Sturgeon Falls is 30 miles by boat. The mail during the summer months is sent to King & Glick, which is approximately two miles from the school. However, during the winter months the Dokis Indians themselves usually get the mail for the reserve at the post office here in Sturgeon Falls every week. There is no living accommodation at the school but excellent board and lodging may be obtained on the reserve.\"\n\nThe Dokis Indian Day School has at this date an enrolment of 28 pupils, in grades from 1 to 7. The last teacher at the school was Miss Velma Gribbon. The Dokis Band is a comparatively small one, the population at this date being approximately 180. From the standpoint of trust funds, however, this is one of the wealthiest bands in Canada.\n\nYour successor at Mississauga is Mrs. R. T. Moran. In respect to your belongings at the school, you should communicate about these with the Agent and not the teacher. This property at the school, as you know, is under the direct control of the agent who will be held responsible for its disposal. In this connection the Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Laurence, in which he states that, so far, you have neglected to forward the keys of the school. These keys, if they have not been already sent forward, should be forwarded to the agent at the earliest possible date.\n\nWe have no information in regard to the missionary or missionaries that may be employed on the Dokis Reserve. The name of the inspector who made the last report in May 1942, is Mr. C. X. Charron.\n\nAn immediate reply to this letter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I should think an Indian girl would be more suitable than I.\n\nI am still expecting a transfer before school re-opens and hope it can be arranged. I have encumbrances and my finances are being gradually depleted.\n\nRegarding the key. The Indian Agent demanded the key three weeks previous to the close of school \u2014 I could hardly give it.\nthen. Afterwards I awaited the transfer, so that I could have my belongings shipped to that quarter. The keys will be forwarded at an early date. I hope this is satisfactory.\n\nHoping to hear from you favourably in a few days,\n\nI am, Very Sincerely,\n\nMargaret McNulty.\nOttawa, September 23, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in which you intimate that you are not prepared to accept the position of teacher at the Dokis Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I may state that the Dokis School was offered to you for the simple reason that in our judgment it was by all odds the most suitable Indian day school available. As I intimated in my last letter, the members of the Dokis band are the wealthiest in Canada and have reached a very high standard of living. Your appointment to that school was discussed with the Indian agent, who was very anxious to secure an experienced teacher for the position.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of the resignation of Mrs. George, who has been for a number of years teacher in charge of the day school at Golden Lake, Ont. It is anticipated that we shall experience little difficulty in securing a teacher for this school. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month plus cost-of-living bonus, which at this date amounts to approximately 17%. There are no living quarters at this school, but I understand board and lodgings can be easily secured close to the reserve.\n\nThis school, I may state, opened on September 1 but was closed as the result of Mrs. George's resignation on Friday September 18. We are anxious that it should reopen at the earliest possible date and not later than October 1. Your immediate reply to this letter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

At that time, I was not certain that there would be one available. However, Mr. Paul Landriault, B.A., with first class certificate, has applied for the position and would be willing to teach from May 15th to September 1st.\n\nI am fairly certain that there will be no teachers available again next fall as there are too many openings elsewhere.

It would be much better, however, in our judgment, if Mr. Landriault could be persuaded to take charge of the school during the regular academic year - September 1 to June 30. However, he may not be prepared to do this. The matter is one in respect to which you may exercise your best judgment.

Please let me have your comments on this communication and when replying you should return the letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nDear Sir,\n\nSince two years our school has been closed, and so the majority of us we had quit the reserve and live in town to send the children to school. But we can't do that, for we are too poor our pay being only $13.60 a month, and there is no child who could live in town and go to school for that price. Besides we have a new and expensive school, built by efforts of the President agent Mr. Cockburn, and it would be a sin to let it go to waste.\n\nSo, we are asking to re-open\nthe school, in the good of our children, and the welfare of our economy and saving. If all the children were in the Reserve, there would be around 50 and then there would be more children on the Reserve, if the school was going on.\n\nI hope that you will take our interest,\n\nI remain yours,\nFrank Dokes\nDokes Band Chief\n\naddress: Sturgeon Falls P.O.\n\nP.S. Please answer me, and not only to the agent.\nSturgeon Falls, August 31st, 1935\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have your letter of August 29th with attached letter from Frank Dokis concerning Dokis Reserve School.\n\nI have to report that I have tried unsuccessfully to get teachers for both Dokis and Nipissing schools. Mr. O'Neil, North Bay, Inspector for this district, informs me that it has been impossible to get sufficient teachers for his schools.\n\nThere will be approximately 25 pupils at the Dokis Reserve to attend school, the others reside permanently in town.\n\nJ.A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAs yet I have not been advised by the Department that teachers are available for the Nipissing and Dokis Indian Reserve schools.\n\nI have been unsuccessful here as Mr. O'Neil, Inspector for this district, informs me that he has not sufficient teachers for his schools.\n\nThe Indians residing at the east end of Nipissing Reserve can attend school in North Bay. The school bus will come as far as Beaucage and the children can commute for 10 cents per day.\n\nThere is no bus for the west end of Reserve and Garden Village. These children are 6 and 10 miles from school and will not attend unless their transportation is paid. The account for transportation last winter is not yet paid.\n\nNow that vehicles from the army will be available, would it be possible to get a bus reasonably enough to warrant buying one for the purpose of transporting the children? I believe the children make much better progress in white schools.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 6th September, 1945.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to your inability to secure a teacher for the Nipissing and Dokis Indian Day Schools.\n\nI understand from a recent letter that you expect to visit the Department in the near future and when you do we will discuss the situation at both these schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nSince 18 years a school was built at Dokes Bay, but and the Indian agent, George Cockburn, a first class agent, was telling the Indians, and he was absolutely right, that all the children would go, without exception, to school. He insisted strongly about the obligation of the parents to send their children to school. And he was absolutely right.\n\nNow a day the children are 3 times more numerous. And the school is closed since 2 years, and starting the 3 year. So the children either stay in the reserve, or have to live in town and go to the white people schools, which are already crowded, and don't like to have them in their schools. A school inspector was complaining about that.\n\nBesides the Indians of Dokes Bay are too poor to live in town, and to pay rent, fuel-wood, water, etc., etc.\n\nSo, is there still an obligation for the Indian children to get instruction and education, but how...\nyou may say you have an agent go to see them. But I spoke to the agent and he said that he could not find any teacher and so he told to some Indians go to school in Sturgeon Falls, with the white people. I asked you already what far is the Indian school not re-opened, and I did not give get an answer.\n\nI am yours truly\n\nFrank Dokes, Chief\nDokes Bay\nvia Sturgeon Falls, P.O.\n\nout.\nOttawa, 11th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated 7th instant from Chief Frank Dokis regarding the opening of the Dokis Day School. It appears from his letter that there are a number of children of school age on this reserve and he states that the parents are not in a position to send them to a white school in the neighbouring town. I presume he refers to North Bay.\n\nOn the occasion of your last visit to the Department I believe we discussed this situation but I have not heard anything further from you since that time. If there are sufficient children to justify the opening of the school, I would like you to make another attempt to secure a teacher, even though the teacher may not be highly qualified. I realize the difficulty in obtaining a teacher but every possible effort should be made to do so.\n\nPlease let me know what prospects there are for re-opening this school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 11th with reference to teacher for Dokis Bay Indian Day school, I am very sorry to report that I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a teacher for either Dokis or Nipissing schools.\n\nHowever, when paying the Dokis Indians last week, I found that with the exception of 5 families, they are all residing in town and their children are attending school here.\n\nOf the 11 children of school age still on the reserve, I found that three will be going to Bisco with their parents and will attend school there. Two others will be going to a lumber camp where the parents are employed.\n\nSix children will remain on the reserve for the winter and even if a teacher could be found at this late date, it would not be worthwhile to re-open the school.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 12 September 1946.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ontario.\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received. We have not written to Miss Lepage but from her letter it appears that she is applying either for Garden Village or Dokis.\n\nYou will remember that we discussed both these schools on the occasion of your recent visit. Please let me know definitely if you wish either of them reopened and if so if you consider Miss Lepage would be satisfactory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Teacher, Dokis Reserve.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 12, 1946, concerning the re-opening of the Dokis Indian Day School, on the Dokis Reserve.\n\nYesterday I visited the Dokis Reserve, to ascertain the number of children who would attend school this year, and how many families will be moving into Sturgeon Falls, as has been customary in the past. Due to the re-opening of the Sturgeon Falls paper mill, in the near future, there is a shortage of houses in the town, consequently, the Dokis Indians will definitely stay on the Reservation. Thirty-one children of school age would attend school if it is possible to procure a teacher.\n\nSister Helen of the Sturgeon Falls Convent, informed me that Miss Lepage was a brilliant girl, with natural talents. She left the Convent in the course of her third year high, but has not completed her High School.\n\nUnder the circumstances I am of the opinion that she could teach at Dokis Reserve.\n\nIf you approve, please advise, when the school could be opened.\n\nJ.A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 20 September 1946.\n\nDear Miss Lepage:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter applying for appointment as teacher at an Indian Day School, it has been decided to re-open the Day School on the Dokis Reserve. It is our understanding that you formerly lived in Sturgeon Falls and consequently we presume that you are aware of the location of the Dokis School.\n\nAs you are not a fully qualified teacher, we are prepared to allow a salary of $112.00 a teaching month. Please let us know at once if you are willing to accept this appointment and if so state when you will be ready to begin duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nBernard F.

A. Marleau,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, 2 October 1946.\n\nMr. J.A.

In that event you should advise the exact date when Miss Lepage begins duties.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSturgeon Falls, Nov. 18, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nATTENTION OF Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nI wish to refer to your official letter of Oct. 2, 1946, concerning the Dokis School. I have written to Miss Depa, requesting that she advise when she could report for duty, but so far she has not answered.\n\nI note from a letter received from Mr. Bernard Neary, Superintendent of Welfare & Training, that Mrs. Kinoshemag is available as a teacher, although I don't think very much of her conduct over an incident at Lake Penage, last summer. Could it not be possible to procure her services for the Dokis Day School. We have thirty-one children there, that should be going to school.\n\nAs reported, the housing situation in Sturgeon Falls, is getting worse, and we cannot hope that the Dokis Indians will reside in town this winter.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, 20 November 1946.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent,\nSTURGEON FALLS, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant with regard to the Dokis Day School. In view of the great difficulty we have experienced in endeavouring to find a teacher for the Dokis School, it is considered that Mrs. Kinoshemag should be appointed temporarily on the understanding that we can dispense with her services if they are not satisfactory.\n\nPlease make arrangements with her to open this school as soon as possible. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $112.00 a teaching month. We enclose one of our regular application forms and staff questionnaire which she should complete and return as soon as she begins duties.

He got them only just before his 3 months were finished, that didn't make him very happy & it's no encouragement for anyone to come here and teach. He also ordered school supplies, and the supplies didn't come until the teacher was through for the summer & gone home.\n\nWe want to know if our agent\nreally can't find a teacher or if he just doesn't look after us. I think he works more for the town of Sturgeon Falls than he does for us, because every time we go into his office there's always one or two Sturgeon men or women in there.\n\nI know that this letter will end up in our Indian Agent's office like it always does, I wish you would explain the situation to us, because we are tired of listening to the Agent's yarns.\n\n(Yours Truly)\n\nFrank W. Daki, Chief\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing the signature of several members of the band to show their approval.\n\nAlbert Washuck\nJohn Washuck\nEdward Daki\nHarry Daki\nBilly Daki\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the Dokis Indian Day School, situated on Lake Nipissing, near Sturgeon Falls, Ontario. Yesterday I telephoned to Mr. Marleau, our Indian Agent at Sturgeon Falls, concerning the school and your possible appointment there.\n\nThis school has been closed during the winters for some years, due to shortage of teachers. Both the Missionary and the Agent have been very anxious to obtain the services of a full-time teacher this year. We have had a teacher there during the summer months but the children will require an experienced teacher to bring them up to standard again. I understand that most of the work will be with the primary grades, whereas at Rabbit Island you would have had all grades from one to eight, and a fairly large Entrance class.\n\nThe Dokis School has no teacherage but I understand from Mr. Marleau that a good boarding place is available at the rate of $40.00 per month. The school is reached by boat across Lake Nipissing and is rather isolated in the winter. However, the Indians are a fine type and I feel sure that you\nwill like it there.\n\nIf you want any other details concerning this school, accommodation, etc., I would ask you to write directly to Mr. J. A. Marleau, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Sturgeon Falls, Ont. I am sending him a copy of this letter so that he will be expecting to hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

However, in view of the fact that this school has been operated during the summer it is likely that Mr. Marleau will not wish it open until about the middle of September. However, I am sending him a copy of this letter so that he can advise you directly, the date upon which he would recommend the school being opened.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The reserve is approximately 70 miles from North Bay, or 25 miles from Sturgeon Falls, on what is known as the Upper French River.\n\nThere are about 450 summer cottages and tourist resorts, on the various islands dotting the Upper French, in the vicinity of the reserve, and during the summer months transportation is very convenient. The Ontario Northern Railway operates a large boat, transporting tourists from North Bay to the French River. You could, if you wished, spend your weekend at North Bay or Sturgeon Falls. Boat service is also available from Sturgeon Falls.\n\nThe Indians of Dokis are all half-breeds, mostly of French and Scotch extraction. They receive a good income and live very well. They have good homes and speak either French or English at home.\n\nDuring the winter months they have horses, and you can also travel by plane from North Bay.\n\nThe proposed boarding house for you is approximately 500 feet from the school. Mrs. Dokis was formerly a white person, and keeps a very clean house. They have no children. The previous and present teachers were both well pleased with the efficiency of Mrs. Dokis.\n\nSchool attendance at present is 25, all between Grades 1 and 3.\n\nI trust this is the information you desire, and will look forward to your arrival.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Would you please make the necessary arrangements to arrive at Sturgeon Falls on the train which gets there on the morning of September 19. You can then go to the Windsor Hotel for your breakfast and attend Mass. Mr. Marleau will be expecting a phone call from you and will then arrange to take you, by boat, across Lake Nipissing to the Dokis School.\n\nI would ask you therefore please to make the necessary arrangements with the railway company and to advise Mr. Marleau directly as to your plans for arriving in Sturgeon Falls, as outlined above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

He was employed for the period 10 June to September 15 and the Indian Superintendent reported most satisfactorily upon his work there. As it was his first teaching experience, Mr. Dean was faced with many new problems and difficulties which he overcame with initiative and dispatch.\n\n(b) During the summer of 1947 Mr. Dean was employed on casual labour as a warehouse man and shipper. During this time he was mainly engaged in shipping library books to our various schools across Canada. During most of this period he worked alone and without close supervision.

I would suggest that the school be closed during those two months and re-opened 1st March.

Murphy, teacher at Dokis reserve, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIf the Department approves, I am of the opinion that the school should be closed, due to Mrs. Murphy's age, for the months of January and February in lieu of school vacation and re-open in March. I think she is afraid of the winter months and has already told some of the people on the reserve that she would not teach after Christmas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJAM:GF\nEncl. 1\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Agency,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.,\n\nDokis Indian Day School\n\nReference your 43/2-32-385\n\nWe are anxious to have our schools operate only on the regular academic year basis unless it can be proved that the Indian children can not attend during the winter months.\n\nWe have had many complaints from the Indians against our schools differing from the Provincial schools. We are doing everything possible to follow the Provincial Course of Study and are using Provincial text books.\n\nIt is felt that we only provide grounds for criticism if we operated this school on any but the normal academic year basis.\n\nTherefore, we are not prepared at the present time to approve Mrs. Murphy's request that this school be closed during January and February.\n\nIf Mrs. Murphy is not willing to teach in January and February, please advise accordingly as it is believed that we can secure the services of another teacher for you.\n\nBernard F.

As far back as 1898 the Agent for this reserve pointed out the fact that these children were growing up in ignorance. There are about 20 children of this Band who could attend school. Although this Band owns a very valuable timber limit, which they are not disposed to sell, they have no funds of their own from which the salary of a teacher could be paid or a schoolhouse erected. It seems hard that the children should be made to suffer for the stubbornness of their parents, and if anything could be done to provide for their education, while they are making up their minds as to the disposal of their limit, I think it would be only fair that they should have the same advantages as all the other Indians of Ontario enjoy. The limit will no doubt eventually be sold, when they will be able to support the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nTen years ago Mr. Maclean, who was then Superintendent at Parry Sound, called the attention of the Department to the fact that there was no school on the Dokis reserve and the education of their children was entirely neglected. He was asked to report the number of school age in the band and whether they might be sent to some white school in the neighborhood. He replied that the only way to educate these children would be to establish a school on the reserve.\n\nMr. Agent Cockburn has also brought this matter to the Department's notice, and now that these Indians are reaping in money it seems to me that a portion of it could not be better expended than in making provision for the education of their children. They have ample funds to build and equip an up-to-date school and pay for a first-class teacher, and I think it would be well that this matter should be attended to at once, so that another year may not pass without something being done for them in this direction.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

But the Chief and two of his brothers unite to be favorable. They say the former Chief was always opposed to an school, and he wished me to talk to the band.\n\nThe only people residing on the reserve are the Mohawk family. The other live in nearby communities or the opposite side of French River. A school house could be erected on the reserve, sufficiently central to accommodate all the children there are 17 children of school age who could attend a school.\n\nWe will take this matter up again with the Chief and his brothers, and will report results at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

P.

Mr. Agent Cockburn, who has tried time and again to induce the Indians to authorize the expenditure of a amount of money from their capital to put up a school building, reported on the 1st instant that he had recently visited the members of this band and found that the majority are opposed to the building of a school from their capital funds at the present time. It is pure stubbornness on the part of the older Indians which blocks the building of a school. They have a capital of over $730,000.00 to their credit. There are only 89 members all told in the band and there are between 20 and 25 children of school age and they are growing up in ignorance and something should be done to educate them.\n\nThe opinion of the Department of Justice is that the\nthe Department cannot use any portion of their capital for the building of a school-house on the reserve without their consent. They evidently know that they cannot have their money used for this purpose unless they are willing and it is for the Department to say whether they will allow the children to suffer or come to their relief.\n\nThe band could be charged with the teacher's salary and equipment and everything save the erection of the building. The Department will either have to give them a school building, obtain special legislation to take the money from their funds, or leave matters as they are now.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 385-5, part 1)\nWe must expect that the Indians will be educated, and the Chiefs should consider this question as if there was no fear to break up the Band. If the law is ever amended we can act accordingly.\nOttawa, 16th April, 1912.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Department of Justice on the 25th day of May, 1899, gave an opinion with respect to the powers of the Governor in Council under Sections (now) 89 and 90 of the Indian Act, in which it was thought that a proposed expenditure under (now) Sec.90 for anything coming also within any of the classes mentioned in (now) Sec.89, would require the consent of the band.\n\nI have discussed these sections and this opinion with the Department of Justice in connection with the Dokis Reserve School question as referred to in Mr. Benson's memorandum hereunder, and am advised that while these sections are not altogether clear, it is thought that Governor in Council could very properly expend the Capital belonging to a band for any of the purposes mentioned in Section 89 without the consent of the band, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 90 of the Act.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that in the interest of the children this step should be taken.\n\nI have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to give the Department information as to the number of children that should be provided for; the kind of building that should be put up; whether accommodation should be furnished for a teacher or not and, if so, of what nature and to what extent; how the work should be done, whether by day labour or contract; means of communication between the reserve and the nearest point from which materials, etc., can be transported and such other information as you may consider necessary. I may say that it does not appear that the Department has at the present time any plan suitable for this building. For Whitefish Lake on the north shore a plan has been prepared providing living quarters at the rear with two rooms upstairs and two down. This plan, however, is for a building to accommodate 36 children, which would be altogether too large for the Dokis Reserve. I should be pleased to have this information above.\n\nGeo. F.

You may find it necessary to make some minor changes in order to work in the log construction.\n\nIt was understood at the time of your recent visit to the Department that you could arrange to have the building erected of logs, under the charge of a competent foreman, employing Indian labour as far as possible, also that you would purchase all materials and keep proper time sheets of the labour employed. A supply of labour returns for this purpose will be sent under separate cover. The returns should be prepared in duplicate, signed in the column for the purpose by the men employed, certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department.

Upon looking over the situation at this season of the year I find in order to secure suitable logs for the erecting of a log building it would be more costly than a frame building constructed of lumber, and would recommend the latter material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Geo. P.

You should have the man whom you engage as foreman on the work assist you in preparing an estimate of the lumber and other building material required, and you should then arrange, after obtaining competitive prices, for the purchase of same. You should see that all material is obtained at the most advantageous price. As instructed in our letter of the 9th instant, the work of erecting the building is to be under the charge of a competent foreman and Indian labour should be employed as far as possible. You may arrange to have the work started as soon as possible, and all costs should be kept down to the lowest possible point. The blue print plan sent you should be used as a guide in the construction of the building.\n\nYou should select the best possible site on the acre of land obtained for the erection of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Cockburn, Esq., Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont., the following:\n\n- 6 - #6 Sanitary Single Desks - Pupils 5 to 7 Yrs.,\n- 8 - #5 - - - - 7 to 9 Yrs.,\n- 10 - #4 - - - - 10 to 13 Yrs.,\n- 10 - #3 - - - - 11 to 14 Yrs.,\n- 1 - #25 Teacher's Sanitary Desk, Oak, 26\" x 42\",\n- 1 - #112 Arm Chair to match Desk,\n- 2 - #110 Plain Chairs.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, should also be forwarded to Mr. Cockburn, who, upon receipt of the above furniture, will certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. E. N. Moyer Co. Ltd.,\n106-108 York St.,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nOttawa, September 6, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is today placing the following order with the E. N. Moyer Co. Ltd., Toronto, for desks for the Dokis Indian Day School:\n\n- 6 - #6 Sanitary Single Desks - Pupils 5-7 Yrs. ... $6.25 each,\n- 8 - #5 ... 7-9 ... 6.25\n- 10 - #4 ... 10-13 ... 6.50\n- 10 - #3 ... 11-14 ... 6.50\n- 1 - #25 Teacher's Sanitary Desk, Oak, 26\"x42\" ... 27.00\n- 1 - #112 Arm Chair to match Desk ... 9.00\n- 2 - #110 Plain Chairs ... 6.00\n\nWe are instructing the above firm to ship these desks as soon as possible, addressed to you at Sturgeon Falls, Ont. As soon as they arrive, you should accept delivery and have them placed in the school.\n\nThe account covering the cost of the desks will also be forwarded to you, and upon receipt of the desks, if in good condition, you should certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nMr. F. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir,\n\nMay we call your attention to the quotation filed in your office by us on August 26th., in answer to your request for prices, dated August 24th?\n\nIn that request you asked for prices on our Style No. 101 Single Desks and our prices were based upon that style. It now occurs to us that it may be that we would be more in line with what we must meet in competition if we were to offer you our Style No. 18, an illustration of which is attached hereto.\n\nPlease note that whereas, our price for the quantity of Desks mentioned in your letter of August 24th, based upon the No. 101 Style of Desk, is $298.34 for the complete quantity, we find that by basing our figures on the No. 18 Style of Pupils Desks, we could offer them to you for a total price of $230.50\n\nWould not this saving of nearly $70.00 make a difference in our chances of being favored with your kind requisitions?\n\nThis letter is intended to call your attention to the fact that while the Style No. 101 Single Desks are without doubt the very BEST being manufactured in Canada and well worth what they cost the user, we seem to be unable to get any of your orders and therefore we thought it might be better for us to get into the PRICE CLASS.\n\nAwaiting your kind comments, we are,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paget:\n\nWe have your letter of September 6th, reporting that on account of our quotation not being the lowest received for the desks for the Dokis Indian Day School. It has not been accepted.\n\nWe are quite certain that such will be the case as long as you request us to submit prices, on the highest type of school desks manufactured in Canada which is our #101 style, being made with steel metal parts instead of cast Iron, as then as is doubtless the case the order is placed strictly from the standpoint of price and without any consideration whatever of quality.\n\nYou will we feel sure agree that this places us in a rather unfavorable position.\n\nWon't you please advise if you will consider prices on our lowest grade of desks? We shall appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE CO., LIMITED\n\nSales Dept.\nOttawa, September 12, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letters of the 6th and 8th instant, relative to your quotation of the 26th ultimo on school desks required for delivery at Sturgeon Falls, Ont. The various styles of desk as manufactured by your firm have been noted. I have also noted the quotations which you make on both your style No. 101 single desk and your style No. 15 desk. The order for Sturgeon Falls has already been placed, but, in future, when calling for quotations, we will be guided by the information furnished by you as to the difference in price in the two styles of desk.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe Globe Furniture Co. Ltd.,\nWaterloo,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No 43-1-5 of the 6th instant advising that an order has been placed with the E.H. Moyer Co., Ltd. of Toronto, for desks for the Dokis Indian Day School. In connection I beg to report that I have not received any advice yet as to shipment.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\nOttawa, September 21, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to refer to letter of the 6th instant, placing an order with you for school furniture for the Dokis Indian Day School, to be shipped addressed to G. P. Cockburn, Esq., Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont. The Department is informed by a communication dated the 19th instant from Mr. Cockburn that he has not yet received any advice as to shipment.

L. Percheron has a 60 pound church bell which he offers to sell for the sum of $15 for the use of the new school building on the Dokis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that a bell of this size would be small for school purposes. Where we have supplied bells for Indian schools, the weight, including mountings, has been approximately 125 pounds. Do you consider that the bell offered by Father Percheron would be large enough to meet the requirements. Please also state what arrangements you could make to place this bell at the school. Is there a belfry on the school building, and, if not, where would the bell be placed? When we have the information asked for, consideration will then be given to the purchase of the bell referred to by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst.

There is a suitable belfrey on the school building, the cost of freight and having the bell placed in position would not exceed $7.00. I beg to recommend the purchase.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, with reference to the purchase of a church bell from Rev. L. Percheron for the use of the new school building on the Dokis Reserve. It is noted that the bell weighs 175 pounds, is in good condition and would be quite suitable for use at the school, also that there is a belfry on the school building in which the bell could be placed.\n\nThe Department will approve of the purchase of this bell for the sum of $15, and will also pay the cost of the freight and having the bell placed in position in the belfry. If any bell rope or other supplies are required in installing the bell, you may arrange for the purchase of same. You should see that the bell is properly installed.\n\nYou may forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, in favour of Father Percheron covering the cost of the bell, and also an account, in duplicate, covering the freight and placing of the bell in position in the belfry at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

They have been attracted by higher prices for furs and cheaper goods. We have been visited by several weeks ago and confirmed in the above report. This means that there will be a goodly number of children\u2014some 30 at least\u2014at English River whose education should be provided for. I had thought several years ago that a teacher and school should be commenced at this place, but the number of children was small then and the outbreak of the war caused me to give up the idea. Now conditions are ripe and call for action as soon as possible.\n\nI had some correspondence with our missionary at Albany who visits English River every summer as one of his charges. He also concurs with my plan and urges an immediate start with the school work. He has forwarded the enclosed proposition for that purpose. We cannot do anything this year, but I would like to have the material ready for next summer. I propose sending a man there by November across down the Saguenay River next May. He will teach the school for the summer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the school makes good, perhaps the Department will undertake a building.\n\nI understand that Mr. Caldwell who passed that way on his journey to James Bay, noticed the need of a school and strongly recommends that a beginning be made.\n\nPossibly he may send you a report after his return in the autumn.\n\nWill the Department be ready to give the usual grant for the school and forward the material enumerated in its requisition? This oughtly could be sent by Messrs. Neville Bros. via Montreal, or perhaps better to save additional freight charges, direct to them at their warehouse at Parry's Harbour, some 170 miles west of Cochrane. It could be sent at any time as they have a resident agent at Parry's Harbour.\n\nThe material, of course, could not be taken down till next May when the snows follow the ice as it breaks up and the water is high.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I offered in a previous letter the use of our Church building until a school could be built and rent in a requisition for the school material.\n\nI trust that the Department will decide to grant my request as some 20 or 25 families of Indians are now making headquarters at English River and it is important that a school be established\u2014at least a summer school to begin with.\n\nI would like to have the material forwarded at once\u2014preferably by express\u2014addressed to P.

I am very much disappointed that the Department feels unable to undertake the costs of school material and a salary for the leader at the usual rate of $30 per month. This was undertaken earlier at the usual rate of $30 per month, and the splendid results have fully justified the step. I would not ask for anything that was not \"absolutely required.\" I have had this idea for some years and each visitation of a school at English River for some years and each session has confirmed me strongly the need of such.\n\nIf the Church offers the use of a building, I shall be glad to offer the use of a building, especially as the Department should meet us half way, especially as the Department owes the duty of the Indians to provide education. The Department owes the duty of the Indians to provide education. We pay the missionary a salary for the whole year while the Department provides only a stipend for the 3 or 4 months of the summer session. I am sending the missionary in any case as I have already engaged him and made arrangements for his transportation which is considerable and paid by us. I hope the Department will consider this matter and at least furnish the school material, if not the salary.\n\nJohn G.

This will be paid upon the receipt of the usual quarterly returns, showing the attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nWith reference to the furnishing of school material I beg to say that the Department will also be prepared to send a reasonable quantity of supplies, if instructions are given as to how it could be sent in to English River. Messrs. Revillon Bros. informed the Department that their scows would be leaving Pagwa on the 25th of this month and it is now too late to have these supplies sent in by them. If you know of any other means by which these could be forwarded, I should be pleased if you would give full shipping directions, when the articles asked for in the requisition which you enclosed in your letter of August 14th, last, will be sent, with the exception of the desks.

They only began loading today and it takes 6 or 7 days to complete the work. So that if the material were shipped immediately, it might reach Lapwai in time. If not in time, it can be taken down by canoe. There are always canoes going up and down. I understand also that another steamer (not the Neillies) are coming up from Lapwai a little later. So that there is abundant opportunity to get the material transported by steamer which is only 70 miles from Lapwai.\n\nI have instructed the teacher\u2014Mr. Northerm\u2014to make arrangements for the transportation of the material in case it is too late for the steamer. Kindly therefore send the material by express at once addressed to \"Mr. P. A. Northerm\" to Mr. Neillies, Lapwai, Ont.\n\nBe sure to include in the shipment blank forms for school returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6124, File 386-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA request has been received from His Lordship the Bishop of Moosejaw for the opening of a school for the summer months at Marten's Falls. He compares the conditions at this point with those at English River, where a school was open last summer from May 1st to August 31st. The pay list shows that there are 77 children at Marten's Falls and the Bishop states that there are at least 25 of these of school age. He states that he has been fortunate enough to secure the services of a teacher, Mr. A. E. O. Anderson, a student from St. John's College, Winnipeg, to carry on the work. Mr. Arey informs me that there is a church building at this point and, no doubt, the school would be conducted in that building.\n\nHis Lordship also requests that the school at English River be re-opened next summer. The cost of this school for the past summer was as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Teacher's salary, 4 months  | $200.00|\n| Rent of building, 4 months  | $40.00 |\n| Stationery and school supplies | $32.79 |\n| **Total**                   | **$272.79** |\n\nThe school at English River, from reports received, seems to have been successful, having had an enrolment of 57 pupils, with an average attendance of 29.\n\nI would beg to recommend that the school at English River be re-opened and that a trial be given during next summer to the work of conducting a school at Marten's Falls. The expense of carrying on the work at these points during the summer would be about $250.00 at each point. This is the only opportunity the children have of receiving any education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 386-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 3, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing requisitions for school material for the use of the summer schools at English River and Marten's Falls and requesting that a grant be allowed for the salary of teachers at both these points during the coming summer term.\n\nWith reference to Marten's Falls I beg to say that the Department will provide a grant for salary at the same rate as was allowed the teacher at English River last summer, namely, $50.00 per month for a period of four months. The grant for the teacher at English River will also be continued at the above rate. It is noted that you have secured the services of Mr. A. E. O. Anderson, a student from St. John's College, Winnipeg, to take up duties as teacher at Marten's Falls and have also again secured the services of Mr. Northam for English River.\n\nWith reference to the requisitions which you forwarded I beg to say that the stationery and school material considered necessary will be ordered and the Department will endeavour to arrange with Revillon Bros. to take in these supplies by their scows next spring. The teacher of the English River School has requisitioned for a stove and stove pipes, but, as this school is open during the summer months only, the Department cannot supply a stove, neither is it prepared to supply desks, chairs, etc.\n\nIt is presumed that buildings suitable for carrying on the work at both these points can be secured.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nRight Rev. JOHN G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, June 8th, 1922.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department of the change in teachers in the schools at Fort Hope, Fort Albany and English River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted the Rev. Thos. McReynolds has been placed in charge of the mission and school at Fort Hope; the Rev. P. A. Northam is to take charge of the school at Albany and Mr. A. E. O. Anderson the English River School and Martens Falls. The above changes and appointments are approved.\n\nThe return for the quarter ending March 31st, last, has not yet been received from the Albany Mission School, but your reference to the teacher who may have been in charge is noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 6, 1922.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nMr. A.E.O. Anderson, who conducted the summer school at English River, forwarded accounts for the rental of the building used for school purposes and for janitor services during the period the school was open. A cheque for $41.00 - being the amount of these accounts, has been sent you.\n\nReturns have also been received, showing the attendance, days taught, etc., by Mr. Anderson, and a cheque for $200.00 in payment of the salary due has been sent to the Royal Trust Company, Montreal. This is in payment of salary for the 4 months the school was in operation, during May, June, July and August, last.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

E. O. Anderson at the English River Mission and Summer school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) John G. Moosonee.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1923.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department of the change in teachers for the coming summer in the schools at English River and Fort Hope.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Mr. Edward Pratt will be placed in charge at English River as missionary and teacher in place of Mr. A. E. O. Anderson, and that Rev. D. McDonald will replace Rev. Thos. McReynolds at Fort Hope. We also note that an assistant in the person of a young student, Geo. Linklater, will be engaged to assist the teacher and missionary at Fort Hope. The above changes and appointments are approved.\n\nSalary will be allowed Mr. Pratt, at English River, and Rev. D. McDonald, at Fort Hope, at the same rate as was previously paid. We are not prepared, however, to allow any salary to the assistant at Fort Hope, as it is intended that he will only have part in the teaching of the school during the absence of Mr. McDonald.\n\nThe requisitions for school material and drugs for the above schools have been received. I may say that a sufficient quantity of school material for the English River school was forwarded from the Government Stationery Office here on February 26th last. This material was forwarded to Messrs. Redillon Freres, and will go forward by their schooner from Pagwa. We are placing an order for the school material required at Fort Hope, which will be forwarded in care of the Hudson's Bay Co., Ombabika, Ont. A small quantity of drugs will also be forwarded for each of the above schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John G.

Dawson, of St. John's College, Winnipeg, will take the place of Mr. L. W. Hatt, at the English River Summer School. He will begin teaching about May 1st.\n\nAs we have lost touch with Mr. Hatt, I do not know just what requisitions for school material and drugs are required, so I cannot say what he will need in hand at English River. Probably you will know from Mr. Hatt's returns last autumn just what is needed as well as school return forms.\n\nIn any case the usual yearly supplies of each will be known to you from your books and I shall be glad if you will send the same to Mr. Dawson, English River, Moosonee, Revillon Fires, Sagwa River, Ont., at once so that Mr. Dawson can pick them up and look after them on May 1st when Revillon's season usually starts down the river.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that the Department approves of his appointment, and salary will be allowed him at the same rate as was previously paid.\n\nWith reference to the school material required, I beg to say that the requisition for the previous year has been duplicated, and the supplies have been forwarded by the Stationery Office, here, addressed to the Missionary in Charge, English River Post, and were sent o/c Revillon Freres, 134 McGill St., Montreal, securely packed. These supplies were shipped from the Stationery Office on the 7th of February, last.\n\nSupplies were also forwarded at the same time for the schools at Moose Fort and Albany Mission.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will no doubt know from Mr. Dawson's\nreport last year what school material is in hand at that\nplace. It might be well to send a small supplementary\nsupply of the material usually renewed in the way of Scrivener's\ncopy books etc. It is difficult to keep track of these things with\nnew men coming each year.\n\n2. I wish to inform you also that I have decided to open a new\nsummer school at East Main, James Bay. I was there last summer\nand found some 40 children of school age, who had no opportunity of\nbeing taught. The Indians asked for a teacher and I promised to try and see.\nI have engaged Rev.

This will be paid upon receipt of the usual returns showing attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nWe will forward to Mr. Walker, c/o Messrs.

Richards, St. Hope School, for the Sept. and Dec. quarters of 1915. I have not received payment for the June quarter. Evidently the Department has not received the returns through the mail. Mr. Richards testified that he enclosed letters from Mr. Richards testifies that he forwarded the returns in due course. They may yet reach the Department, as I have had letters not only long delayed but sometimes lost altogether. I am afraid that the same has happened regarding the Mississinewa School. I had a letter the first of October, only one for some fourteen months. From Mr. Richards' letter will interest you as showing the condition of the Indians on the Athabasca River. Unless you have any wish to obtain the letter kindly return to me.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn G.

Teacher's salary (Fort Hope) amounting to $112.50.\n\nMay this amount paid. May be that the teacher was absent on missionary work for part of the month. If so, that is all right, but I hope the balance will not be lost because the teacher was most convenient for his work, but rather holidays when most convenient for his work, that is, he will teach in July and August, which are the usual holidays as arranged by your Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G.

I note that the school has been open during July and August, and, when this teacher forwards his September quarter return, it will no doubt show the exact number of days it was in operation.

In this connection I would point out that payment of bonus to teachers of Indian day schools was discontinued from March 31st, 1926. Previous to that time, salary was paid at the Fort Hope Indian Day School at the rate of $300 a year, plus bonus of $150 a year, or a total of $450. Since April first, 1926, the salary allowed at this school has been at the rate of $450. You will note, therefore, that the salary at the present time is as large as when the bonus was being paid. When the returns have been received, cheques in payment of salary at the above rate have been forwarded to Right Rev. J. G. Anderson, Cochrane, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking over the school accounts for the year 1929 I notice that the grants for the Fort Hope school for the June and Dec. quarters as well as for the month of September have not been paid. The last grant I received was for the March quarter.\n\nI notice also that no grants for 1928 have been paid for the Albany school. The Rev. P. A. Northam fell sick last July so that the returns for the March quarter at least should have been sent in. The school, I know, has been regularly kept by the Rev. Andrew Wesley, native assistant minister, who has so informed me by his letter written in English. Though able to teach school quite well, he may not be able to make out the returns. This too soon, of course, to expect the returns from Fort Hope for both June and Dec. quarters.\n\nI shall be glad to have your decision or information on the above at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nOttawa, February 11th, 1930.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to say that the salary of Rev. D. Macdonald, teacher of the Fort Hope Indian Day School, for the quarters ended June 30th, September 30th and December 31st, 1929, have been paid. Through oversight, cheques for these three quarters were sent direct to him instead of to you. A note has been made and future cheques in payment of the salary at this school will be forwarded to you.\n\nThe last return received from the Albany River Indian Day School was for the quarter ended December 31st, 1928, and, consequently, no salary has been paid since that time.\n\nThe return of the Fort George Day School for the quarter ended June 30th, last, has been received and cheque for $150.00 forwarded to the Royal Trust Company, Montreal. The September and December quarter returns have not yet reached the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRt. Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nBishophorpe,\nCochrane, Ont.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\n**FOR QUARTER ENDED March 31st, 1950.**\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Rev.

I do not think they made a good choice, but as the school & school affairs is principally managed by the Council & Dept., it does not so much matter.\n\nI would therefore ask the Dept. to sanction the appointment of Samuel Wahbeyes as one of the Trustees for French Bay School Section.\n\nIn reference to the vote taken whether or not they retain the present teacher Miss Helen Cameron, it is conclusive that the majority is in favor of change.\n\nThe desire for change being a characteristic of the Indians does not indicate that the pupils would be benefited thereby. She fulfils the purpose has to the teacher, as that their school is not progressing as well as the other schools on the reserve, this is owing to a great extent to the irregularity of attendance of pupils.\n\nIn my opinion this teacher is well qualified especially on account of her long experience, being so well acquainted with the Indians which is essential to progress in an Indian school she perhaps has not the force of character that some teachers have to command control, but if the pupils attended regular I believe she could do as good a work perhaps better than a teacher without experience in Indian Schools which if we made a change he would be likely to get.\n\nShame the honor to be sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Scofford\nAgent\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nChippawa Hill sep/18-1898.\nOttawa, 24th September, 1895.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing resolutions of the Saugeen Indian Council passed on the 12th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that although it is observed that you do not exactly approve of the appointment of Samuel Wahbezee as trustee for the school at French Bay, the Department does not see sufficient reason to interfere in the matter.\n\nWith reference to the vote of the Council that the present teacher of the French Bay School, Miss Helen Cameron, be not engaged for another school year, as the School Inspector speaks well of Miss Cameron's management the Department is not inclined to comply with the resolution of the Indian Council in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill,\nOntario.\nIndian Office,\n\nFrench Bay Oct 14\n\nChippewa Hill, Oct., 1808\n\nTo the Saugeen Indians Council\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe the undersigned, members of the French Bay School, wish to say that our present teacher be removed and placed a new teacher in the school in place of Miss Cameron.

The facts as represented to us are these: Miss Cameron, the present teacher of the school has been in charge for about nine years, and during that period from evidence supplied us it would seem her services have been satisfactory. It appears, however, that an effort is now being made in the face of the protest of the majority of the Indians on the Reservation to have her removed and have another teacher of another denomination put in her place. Miss Cameron is a member of the Methodist Church, and the majority of the Indians belong to the same body. A requisition signed by the Indians both at Saugeen and French Bay has been sent to us expressing the wish that Miss Ellen Cameron be allowed to continue to teach at least until the close of the year. Of course the school receives no grant from the Missionary Society, but the majority of the Indians being Methodists feel that under the circumstances their present teacher ought to be allowed to remain, and that something approaching denominational prejudice or preference on the part of the Agent enters into the attempt now made to discontinue the services of the present teacher. I write\nChippawa Hill March 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report the attendance of the French Bay school as visited on the 21st Feb. 1894 and found seven pupils six children and one white. A number went home for their dinner and did not return on account of the day turning out very stormy. Their studies in Reading, Writing, Spelling, Drawing and Arithmetic are progressing fairly well. The teacher is very attentive and if the children would attend regularly they would make considerable progress. At this school there is considerable inconvenience felt for the want of a supply of wood and no doubt it is disagreeable to the children coming to school in cold weather. They have to remain outside before the room is heated up.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Reed Esq.,\nDeputy Sect. Encl. of Indian Affairs,\nOntario.\n\nJ. Allen,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 20th May, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of the 2nd December last, in which you were instructed to inform Miss Cameron, teacher of the French Bay school, that her services would not be required after the 30th June next.\n\nRev. Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, has written the Department stating that the majority of the Indians on the Reserve would like Miss Cameron to be allowed to continue to teach, and in view of this statement and of the recommendation of Mr Public School Inspector Clemening, the Department has decided that Miss Cameron may be re-engaged for another year. If the existing dissatisfaction has not ceased by the end of the current year, it may be necessary to make a change after the 1st of January next, and Miss Cameron should be so informed when she is being engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scoffield; Esq\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\n\nJ.

I may add that Mr Inspector Clendening in his last report, states that he would be pleased to see the present teacher kept on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th inst., No.153978, I am under the impression that there is a mistake somewhere. We have no school at French Bay on our list, nor have we any teacher of the name of Cameron. If the teacher in question was continued in her position at our request, it must have been under a misapprehension.\n\nI assume that French Bay is a settlement on the Saugeen Reserve. The Indians there are, for the most part, adherents of the Methodist Church, and if a new teacher is to be appointed I would suggest that in accordance with the provision of the Indian Act a Methodist be selected. If it would be any assistance to the Department we could submit names from which a selection might be made.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Depart'tt of Indian Affairs,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOTTAWA, 13th November, 1889\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant; and in reply I beg to say that the reason you were written to about Miss Cameron, teacher of the French Bay school was because you had interested yourself in her case, as you will see by reference to your letter of 25th May last.\n\nI should be glad if you would be good enough to submit the names of any suitable persons who would be likely applicants for Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, B.D.\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the Indian schools on the Saugeen Reserve, I am just in receipt of a letter from the Rev W.B. Danard, the Missionary in charge there, from which I make the following extract:\n\n\"At French Bay we need an experienced teacher, and if possible a married man. There is a house there for the teacher to live in. At Chippawa Hill a male or female will do, but it should be one who has had experience in teaching.\"\n\nIn reference to the above, I do not know whether the house spoken of at French Bay is rent free or not. It would be impossible, I suppose, to secure a married man for less than $400 per annum; but if the Department concurs in Mr Danard's recommendation, and will provide a salary of $300, I will ask the Board of Missions for a supplementary grant of $100. When I hear from you on this point I will gladly avail myself of the permission you have kindly given to submit the names of one or more persons suitable for the school at French Bay.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 5th December 1899\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the French Bay Indian school, I beg to say that the Department is in communication with the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society with a view to obtaining the services of a married man who has had experience in teaching, to take charge of this school, and it has been informed that there is a house on the Reserve for the teacher to live in.\n\nThe Department would like you to furnish full information in regard to the house referred to giving the number of rooms, state of repair, ownership, and any other particulars in relation thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The building is in a good state of repair, is six or eight rods from the school house and has about half an acre of garden enclosed by a board fence.\n\nThe Department would be glad if you would endeavor to have a qualified teacher take charge of this school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I never said anything to a teacher before, that were here.\n\nMr. Jesse Root.\n\nThis note was received since I gave my report to your agent.\n\nIt was the bell and fire lit at 8:35 a.m., with 21\u00b0 ad air 30 minutes 8 A.M. on 27 March.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nFrench Bay, March 24, 1900,\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour Indian Agent,\nMr. John Scuffield, received a report from me in the work of your recently appointed caretaker for this school, and in all probability such report has reached you prior to this.\n\nMr. Scuffield informed me, when I took charge of this school, that your department demanded of me a correct report, giving day and date of the work of the caretaker, as such caretaker was simply appointed on trial. I said to your agent that this was hardly fair, as he knew\nand acknowledged to me prior to my coming here that no Indian boy could be secured to do the work properly, and it was in his authority that I applied for the position in February before I came here. Therefore, I must report the facts; and according to his opinion the facts would not be favorable to the Indian caretaker, and hence would naturally antagonize the Indians against me. I have reported in good faith and tried my best to get the little Indian boy to do his best. When he opened the door in the morning and put on the fire and rang the bell within a few minutes of 9 o'clock, the 8 o'clock...\nhill I mean, and when the pupils and myself were nearly perished with cold, I told the boy I would be compelled to report him to the Department; his father sent me a note, telling me as follows\u2014\u201cWell, dear Sir, you may first report Joseph to Department. I never said anything to a teacher before, that was here. Mr. Jesse Root.\u201d This is the note in full, and shows, when read between the lines, the mailed Indian threat of trouble ahead. Now I am not wanting the job of caretaking for myself, if it can be at all done by some other means, I do not want the ill will of the Indians for the sake of a twenty dollar job. If the Department is satisfied I\nI am willing to try and do the best I can under the circumstances. I had the Inspector (Mrs. Alexander) a few days ago and he was highly pleased with the improvement in the school. He said to me, \"Mr. Wallace you have perfect control and you are going to do splendidly here.\" The Department is anxious to get good faithful teachers for the Indians and will be pleased at your success. You may, perhaps, have his report by this time. Now it is too bad to have my influence blighted just at the outset. I would suggest that the Department, by some means, endeavour to make it understood by the \"Indian Committee\" that I was but faithfully\nthe mandate of the Department, when I reported, and as a servant of the department was compelled to obey them, otherwise the responsibility would rest upon my shoulders in the care of school furniture &c., for this is what your Agent informed me at the outset.\n\nI cannot be responsible for school appointments (e.g., over which I have no control from 4 P.M. until 9 A.M. not including Saturdays, Sundays and vacations), nor can I assume such a responsibility, where I am deprived of the authority to carry out the same.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJ.G. Wallace, Teacher, French Bay School\nGentlemen,\n\nAfter giving the subject serious consideration, I would beg to say, that so long as the Indians see any opportunity of securing the $20 salary attached to the position of caretaker, they will be making trouble with the teacher, and would do anything to have him removed, in the hope that a change of teachers would throw the position open and thus give them a chance to secure it.\n\nIf the position of caretaker could be attached permanently to the position of teacher for $825 per annum all this trouble would be obviated for all time. The Indian agitation would cease and it would greatly strengthen...\nthe hands of the teacher, as they would have no object in creating trouble. One thing is certain, the efficiency and usefulness of the school and teacher is going to be greatly interfered with if the care and attention remains in the hands of an Indian. They have no clocks and depend on the school bell entirely, so that when it is not properly and regularly rung, the government's school is almost lost. I am a life long supporter of the Reform party and am proud of our success and therefore do not make these suggestions for impertinence but because I know my party is always anxious to do what they consider best. Your humble servant,\n\nJ. G. Wallace\nReport of the work of the Caretaker of French Bay School, Longuean Indian Resv.\n\nFebruary 6th\nPupils allowed to re-enter school-room after teacher had left, thus injuring the school property by running and playing through the room and jumping from desk to desk.\n\n7th\nTeacher warned the caretaker against allowing the other children to come in to school-room after dismissal at 4 o'clock, to no purpose as the same thing occurred the same evening. Teacher also instructed caretaker to sweep the room thoroughly at night and dust with a damp cloth in the morning, telling him also to report the names of any children who refused to keep out of school-room after 4 o'clock.\n\n8th\nTeacher compelled to leave his own residence and go to the school-room to protect the school furniture from being smashed by the running of caretaker himself with a number of other children whom he encouraged to re-enter. Teacher assumed control, sent the children to the road again, and once more explained to caretaker his duties in care of school-house and school property.\n\n13th\nTeacher compelled to go out of his own house into full view on the yard in order to stop the caretaker from running in and over the kids of the school-desks and leaping from the top of one to the other. Stone chucked with ashes. Caretaker requested to remove same to no purpose.\n\nFloor unclean, no broom to sweep with, no dusting done since caretaker assumed control.\n\n15th\nFire lit at 25 minutes to 8 o'clock and 8 o'clock bell rung at same time.\n\n16th\nFire lit at 30 minutes after 8 o'clock and 8 o'clock.\nbell rung at same time (8:30). Result no pupils until nearly 10 o'clock, and almost half a day lost. No burnt yet, so dusting done. Any dirt removed is simply left littered in the lobby or anteroom to be carried in again on the children's feet. Ashes not removed yet.\n\n2nd Door opened at 25 minutes to 9 o'clock and the 8 o'clock bell rung at 20 minutes to 9 o'clock. Fire lit 15 minutes to 9 o'clock. Result no pupils until after 10 o'clock, practically almost half-a-day lost.\n\nSchool-house door opened at 15 minutes to 9 o'clock. 8 o'clock bell rung at 13 minutes to 9 o'clock. Fire lit at 10 minutes to 9 o'clock. Teacher compelled to remove the ashes from stove at 8 minutes to 9 o'clock in order to get stove to draw. Result no pupils until after 10 o'clock, practically half-a-day lost. No burnt yet, so dusting done since caretaker took charge. House getting filthy for want of sweeping properly. Any dirt removed simply left littered over the floor-steps and on the lobby floor. Caretaker reminded of his duty in regard to the ringing of the 8 o'clock bell and lighting of fire.\n\nMarch 1st\n\n8 o'clock bell rung at 25 minutes to 8 o'clock and a small fire put in stove and caretaker gets house again. Result house intensely cold and totally unfit for the reception of pupils at 9 o'clock making it dangerous for the health of both teacher and pupils. No burnt yet, so dusting done yet. Teacher keeps a dust-rag in his own desk in order to keep his own chair and desk fit for use. Teacher compelled to go in the evening and remove ice from doors of wood shed and school-house lobby in order to close them.\nTo prevent their destruction by the action of the wind, our caretaker (who is only a mere child) is entirely unfit to understand taking care of a house or outbuildings and cares nothing about their protection. His sole object is to get the money for the parent because he is compelled by the parent to do so. The building is now actually filthy for want of proper and regular sweeping and dusting.\n\nSchool-room unfit to work in owing to the cold. Fire built; a couple of small sticks put in stone, no more put in until teacher come in at 5 minutes to 9 o'clock, when he had to carry wood from the shed and build the fire himself. Result\u2014no work done until about 9:30 o'clock.\n\n5th. Teacher compelled to sweep dirt out of lobby himself. Room dirty, no dusting done since 6th of February.\n\n6th. A cold wet morning, stone choked with ashes, room so cold at 9 o'clock that it is positively a danger to the health to sit in it. No work done until about 25 minutes to 10. Children compelled to stand around the stone for warmth. There is first-class dry wood in the shed\u2014no expense for this kind of work.\n\n7th. Bell rung 8:10 o'clock. Room cold at 9 o'clock, caretaker put in a small fire and then left\u2014thus the room was unfit for the reception of either teacher or pupils. Ashes not removed.\n\n8th. Stone choked with ashes, teacher again orders caretaker to remove the ashes. Room cold at 9 o'clock, fire swept in lobby. A new broom provided on teacher threatening trouble to caretaker's father.\nMarch 9th\n\n8 o'clock bell rung at 15 minutes to 8. Room swept in the morning. No dusting done since caretaker took charge on Feb. 6th. Room chilly at 9 o'clock, as caretaker put in a small fire, simply lighting the fire and then returning to his home.\n\n14th Room unfit to sit in owing to the cold at 9 o'clock. Room not properly swept. No dusting done yet.\n\n15. Temperature of room below zero at 9 o'clock, cause same as here before. Dangerous to the health of both teacher and pupils.\n\n16. Fire lighted at 15 minutes after 8 o'clock. A few small sticks put in stove at the outlet; simply enough to start a fire. The morning being very cold, teacher anticipating the condition things would be in, went to the school-room 15 minutes early and found the fire nearly out, the house intensely cold and the caretaker standing by stove trying to keep himself warm, with only a solitary stick in the room to put in the stove, the stove choked with ashes to such an extent that they were overflowing into the floor, rendering it very dangerous lest live coals should fall in the pine floor and burn the floor out of the house. Both teacher and pupils and teacher were compelled to stand around the stove until the house got heated at about 15 minutes to 10 o'clock. Remained half the fire-room last. The inner room was fairly well swept the evening before, but the greater portion of the dirt was swept into the lobby or anteroom and left there. No dusting done since Feb. 6th.\n\n19. Caretaker and his brother amusing themselves by running on the tops of the school desks being joined by other Indian boys who are not pupils. Stove choked with ashes. School-room used as a rendezvous for secretly smoking cigarettes and cigars after school hours, leaving the school-room in an\na lovel state with the foul stench of tobacco and tobacco smoke, the floor and damper of stove being left filthy from the expectation necessary from the smoking abuse mentioned. Lobby door and wind-shed door kept open. Teacher, in order to guard against the wind breaking down off their hinges, was compelled to go to school-house and close them after the caretaker and the other Indian boys kept for the night.\n\nSchool-room very chilly at 9 o'clock, no warmth in stove nor even in the house. 30 minutes after 10 o'clock before the temperature of the room was comfortably raised, stove choked with ashes. Room filthy with tobacco fumes from previous nights debatable. No dusting done.\n\nT.J.

One of the ink wells missing out of one of the desks.\n\nMar 6th - Bell rang at 8:30 and the first pupil on time late! It was nearly 10 O'clock before I could get the school opened today as the school room was too cold for the pupils.\n\nA meeting was held in the school house last night in connection with church business when one of the window blinds was torn half off the roller.\n\nMar 12th - The bell rang at 8:15, school was two late.\n\nMar 20th - Four boys (including the same lads) acted improperly in the school by running over the desks when the caretaker was left to sweep out the school house after 4 O'clock P.M. I had to go back to the school after I went home to prevent them from...\nfrom injuring the School Furni-\nture.\n\nI am sorry that I have to complain\nbut extreme necessity compels me\nto say that I can not open school\nin time and proceed with my\nwork successfully unless there is\nsome improvement.

No. 153978.\n\nAs instructed I took the Indian boys Joseph Root and Abiah Michkawa and visited our Caretakers of French Bay and Scotch Settlements School House. As I could not be present often enough to form a correct opinion of how they performed their duties I requested the teachers to report to me and I herewith enclose their reports. On the strength of these reports and what I have seen, I would recommend that the two schools be again transferred to the Indians. In this connection I would inform the Dept. that the Indian Council decided that the caretakers of the schools churches on the reserve should in future supply the Broome.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Deafield\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 3rd April, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with enclosures reporting upon the work of the two Indian boys, Joseph Root and Abiah Nashkawa, lately appointed temporarily as caretakers of the French Bay and Scotch Settlement school houses; and in reply I beg to say that as recommended by you the care of these two schools is to be taken away from the boys and given to the teachers, the remuneration to be at the same rate as that paid their predecessors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Scofield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge letter of the 23rd ultimo No. 153978 re - the care taking of French Bay and Scotch Settlements schools.\n\nIn reply would inform the Deptt. that when I informed the teachers of the decision of the Deptt. on this matter, they refuse to be responsible for the safety and care of the buildings and furniture of the schools both before and after teaching hours and as I do not consider the buildings would be safe in regard to fire nor the furniture from getting broken as they would not be in care of any person in particular who I could hold responsible for the safety of them.\n\nI therefore instructed the teachers to keep possession of the key and continue their duties as caretakers until I could correspond with the Deptt. on the matter.\n\nI wish to state that in my opinion there is no one can so conveniently attend to the duties of caretaking as the teacher, and in an isolated school like Fr. Bay or Scotch Settlement there is great danger from fire, and from the scholars alone but also from other Indians who are in the habit of congregating in the Schools Churches and Council Chamber.\n\nThe most obedient\n\nSecretary Deptt.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nvigilance has to be kept up to prevent them from entering these buildings after night. And if the keys were in the hands of an Indian who was doing the work of a caretaker without remuneration, he would not consider himself responsible for any damage that might occur.\n\nI therefore would not vouch for the safety of either building or furniture, lest if the teachers do not attend to kindling the fire, and ringing the bell at the proper time, I am sure that our schools on the Reserve will fail to maintain the standard which they have heretofore held.\n\nWill the Dept kindly give this matter their serious consideration and let me know their decision at their earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Scofield\nAgent.\n15 May 1900.\n\nCan funds be drawn without a Resolution of Council to pay the caretakers of French Bay and Scotch Settlement Schools?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that it is a matter of regret to me to inform the Deptt. that the attendance at French Bay School has decreased to much that I would ask the Dept advise me in regard to the matter.\n\nFor explanation of the above I would say that from the week after Mr. Wallace assumed the duty of teacher at French Bay until the month of May last the average attendance exceeded any three months since I came to the Reserve. Although the number that should attend had decreased on account of removals from that part of the Reserve from about 130 to about 20. The latter is the number that should attend and I do not expect that number to attend every day but would expect an average of 12 to 15; but for the last month it will not average more than 5 or 6.\n\nI think the cause of the decrease is that in accordance with official letter dated April 3rd last No. 153978 the caretaking of the French Bay school was taken from Joseph Root (son of late Root) and given to the teacher. This appears to have aroused the antagonism of Jesse Root\u2014against the Secretary Deptt. of Ind. Affairs Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had an interview with him, gave him a written copy of what appeared to me to be a Trust officer's duty.\n\nI heard no other complaints until the 23rd of May last when the schools were celebrating Empire Day by recitations & songs from the children, speeches from the district teachers & others.\n\nJesse Root being a trustee and on the program made a speech which the interpreter informed me was full of resentment to the teacher.\n\nIn June last the Council & I were letting the work of erecting & repairing buildings in the French Bay section. While there, we visited the school. We were in the school a short time when Jesse Root came in & took this opportunity of complaining to the Council concerning the teacher's untimely & the scholars and of teaching bad language because he taught the English word \"pushy\" which has an unmentionable meaning in the Indian language. On Aug the 23rd we visited that school section and found Jesse Root boys with others playing at the lakeside also found a number of children at this home their parents would not give me any excuse for them not being in school.\n\nI notified J. Root Trust officer that if he did not attend to his duties I would report him to the Dept.\n\nI am informed that the attendance is...\nattendance is no better but worse some days having only one pupil in school. The teacher who appears to be doing his duty in every way is very much discouraged on account of the irregular attendance of the pupils. I believe there is too much in these reports complaints; as I informed him that if he could establish any wrongdoing on the part of the teacher, I would report the same to the Dept.\n\nI believe if the compulsory law were enforced it may have a beneficial effect.\n\nI have the honor to be sir,\n\nJohn Scofield\n\nApril 1st.\nOTTAWA, 24th September, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant reporting that the attendance at the French Bay school has greatly decreased and giving reasons why it has fallen off. The Department regrets to learn of the attitude taken by Jesse Root, the truant officer, and thinks that it would be well to make an example of him if he does not send his children to school, as other Indians can hardly be expected to compel their children to go to school, while his is allowed to play truant. You will, therefore, notify Root that you have been instructed to proceed against him under the Regulations unless his children are sent promptly and regularly to school. Failure to do this will entail his dismissal from office in addition to the penalties provided by the regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa Hill Aug 21st 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer the Dept. to official letter dated 24 Sep last 1901 regarding the attendance and attitude taken by Jesse Root, the Tenant Officer at French Bay School.\n\nI would inform the Dept. that the Tenant Officer sends his own children much more regularly than he did previous to the date of the letter referred to, but I am sorry to say that there is not much improvement if any in the average attendance. It is difficult for me to account for the small attendance, as the teacher appears to do everything possible to encourage regular attendance and his pupils appear to like him.\n\nThere may be room for complaint with the Tenant Officer for neglect of duty. He has never reported to me or the school of a case of truancy or neglect of parents to send their children to school.\n\nThe teacher tells me that he has reported to the tenant officer more than once of the nonattendance of pupils and asked him to try and secure their attendance but without beneficial effect. For these reasons I would advise the Dept. to try a change of Tenant Officer for the French Bay School Section, and that each Tenant Officer be supplied with a copy of regulation relating to the education of Indian children.\n\nI have the honor to refer your obedient servant,\n\nJohn Sheppard\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Hilton, Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nHon. and dear Sir,\n\nI humbly beg to be allowed to bring to your notice the very small salaries which we, as teachers on the Sanger Indian Reserve, are receiving and to pray you to raise our remuneration on a par with the teachers in the surrounding White Schools.\n\nDuring the past three or four years teachers' sala have advanced substantially in the province. Inspector of public schools (Mr. Clendenning) informs me that salaries have advanced very substantially in all the schools under his care except the Indian schools. Our families are isolated, we have many discouragements to contend against unknown to those in White settlements. My wife has never been able to leave French Bay or to associate with her own race since last summer, cost of living has advanced rapidly since we came to this Reserve four years ago and notwithstanding all this our salary remains fixed at twenty-five dollars a quarter. I have to support a family of five members on the sum a thing I could not accomplish were it not that the Missionary Society helps me a little and the same help had to be extended to Mr. Burr of Scotch Settlement since last midsummer.\n\nI am well aware these conditions might exist without your knowledge if your attention were not especially directed to them. Having your high sense of honor and justice as a public man and a citizen of the Crown I make bold to lay our case before you, fully believing the justice of our prayer will lead you to extend unto us what assistance you may see our case deserves.\n\nYours, respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This Band has a very large capital and might be able to stand the expenditure of an additional $150.00 a year out of their interest.\n\nThree hundred dollars is certainly a very small salary for a competent teacher of an Indian school. These schools were originally conducted by the Methodists, who contributed towards their support but the teachers are now wholly dependant on the salary paid by the Department. If it could be raised $50.00 for each of them, I do not think it would be too much for white teachers of Indian schools in Western Ontario.\n\nI may add that Mr Wallace came highly recommended and is still doing good work.\n\nAbout two years ago we raised the salary of the teacher of the Moraviantown school and charged the increase to the Band.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are 20 children of school age in attendance, but the average runs between 12 and 15. The Teacher is very anxious to have an example of persistent truants made. He says he has asked the Agent to act but nothing has been done.\n\nThe attendance found consisted of 2 boys and 4 girls. This small attendance probably was to be attributed to there being a funeral upon the reserve to which most of the children had gone. The schoolroom is bright and clean, the Teacher brisk and energetic. He should have a regular attendance of twenty at least. The number of children of school age in this district is quite sufficient to maintain a large attendance, and if the Agent exercises the authority entrusted to him this can easily be done. The Indians themselves would be pleased to see attendance enforced.\n\nThe Teacher's house and stable are in good condition and the whole establishment is most creditable, but is not being as effective as it should be because proper control is not exercised. The co-operation of the Agent is needed for the exercise of such control.\n\nSgd J.A.

Wahbege.\n\nI think the cause of so much for the truant officer is that we have not\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nhave not the sympathy of the parents and guardians, they would rather sympathize with their children and will not make an honest effort to have them attend.\n\nI have notified all parents and guardians on the Reserve more than once that it is the wish of the Dept to have the Compulsory School regulations enforced on this Reserve.\n\nI have also summoned some of them to give reasons why their children were not attending school; they make many excuses such as sickness, want of proper clothing etc. I did not fine any of them as I did not see that any good would be accomplished by doing so.\n\nImmediate action should be taken in replacing the truant officer at French Bay. I think I could get Wahbezee or someone else to take the office if the work was made less, say one day or one and a half days per week should be all that was necessary, if we had the cooperation of the parents and guardians in securing the regular attendance of the children.\n\nWill the Dept kindly advise me what action I should take on this matter at its earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Scoffield\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 31, 1907.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., advising the Department of the resignation of Thos. Wahbesee as truant officer for the French Bay school section, on the Saugesen reserve, and stating that you cannot obtain the services of such an officer to replace Mr. Wahbesee at the salary paid him, namely, $6.00 per quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your explanations, the Department will, if the consent of the council is obtained, allow a salary of $10.00 per quarter to such officer.\n\nThere would not, however, appear to be much use in appointing a truant officer, unless action is occasionally taken against the delinquents, by way of example, and it seems hardly fair to expect such an officer to devote all his time to the work. You should be able to arrange with the teacher as to the number of visits he should be called on to make.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAsst.

I cannot therefore recommend the Dept. to grant the prayer of the resolution.\n\nMoved by Hiram Ahyahla Sec. by Jno Cameron\nThat the School Teachers at French Bay and Scotch Settlement Saugeen Reserve be charged $25 per year, rent for dwelling house and ground, and the Dept. be requested to retain the said amount from their salaries.\n\nCertified Correct.\n\nIn explanation of the foregoing resolution I would inform the Dept. that the greatest number of the Indians are annoyed at the short teachers of the reserve at present, on account of their persistent efforts to secure the regular attendance of\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nregular attendance of the children, and wish to force them to resign or bring some cause against them to secure their dismissal.\n\nAs far as I can judge I believe the teachers to be quite competent for the duties required of them.\n\nAs to engaging teachers holding First-Class Certificates, to teach children who to my knowledge scarcely ever attend school after being promoted to the senior third class, would be superfluous and an unnecessary expenditure, as first-class teachers in this country are getting from five hundred dollars salary per year for the above reason I cannot recommend the resolution.\n\nMoved by Ed J. Macintosh and seconded by Sol. B. James\n\nThat we request the Dept. to engage as School Teachers for the Sanguen Reserve only persons who hold a First Class Certificate.\n\nCarried.\n\nCertified correct.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient Servt.,\nJohn Scoffield,\nAgreed.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., embodying two resolutions passed by the council of the Sauganee reserve, one to the effect that the teachers of the French Bay and Scotch settlement schools be charged a rental of $35.00 per year for the residences in connection with the schools; and the other that only teachers with first-class certificates be engaged for these schools.\n\nWith reference to the first resolution I beg to say that the Department cannot approve the same, as the salaries paid the teachers would not warrant their being charged rent.\n\nIn regard to the employment of only first-class teachers for these schools, the Department would, in the event of any changes taking place, prefer engaging such, provided they could be had for the salaries offered, but as very few teachers who look for rural schools hold first-class certificates, the Department does not consider it would be well to be confined to a choice from that class, and cannot, therefore, approve the resolution as it stands.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nChippawa Hill Oct 30th 1908\n\nReceived from John Scoffield, the Agent, the sum of $2.50 for services rendered as Tenant Officer in the case of Elijah Monogon Band No. 4, refusing to send his child to school.

Most of the children have it.\n\nI am at a loss to know how to cope with\nit. The want of changes of clothing and bedding\nand the general neglect of bathing and body\ncleanliness are a big obstacle to the treatment of\nthe trouble. There are matters about I am not\nable to direct efficiently. Scarcity of clothing\nand vague ideas of cleanliness stand in the\nway of effectual treatment. Perhaps some method\nbe adopted surely the trouble.\n\nYours truly,\nP.W. Williams M.D.\nChippawa Hill, July 8, 1909.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to state that\n[illegible] got into the School at French Bay\n[illegible] Reserve, last year.\nRequested R.W. Williams M.D.,\nMedical attendant for the Reserve\nto attend to the matter then, and\nhe did so.\n\nBut it could not have been entirely\ngot rid of, as it again made\nits appearance this Spring.\n\nWhen I first noticed it this\nSpring, I suggested to the Teacher\nto send some of the pupils\naffected home. This he did not\nseem inclined to do, as it would\nlower his average attendance.\n\nI wrote to the Doctor and\nreported the matter. At my\nnext visit to the School, the\nChildren had not been sent\nhome, the teacher claiming\nthat it was not his business\nto do so.\n\nI then interviewed R.W. Williams\nand asked him to visit the School\nand send me a written\nreport which I herewith enclose.\n\nI then brought the matter\nbefore the Indian Council, which\npassed the following Resolutions:\nMoved by Andrew Ritchie, Seconded\nby Peter Henry\u2014\n\nThat J.S. Mandowoub is hereby\nappointed to enforce the Doctor's\norders in regard to means to be\nto be adopted to get rid of the itch; and that he be paid $1.50 per day from the Band Funds for the time spent in performance of this work.\n\nCertified Correct\n\nCarried.\n\nMoved by T.

The expense for clothing will not be great.\n\nI would recommend that the proposed arrangement be authorized by the Department and I hope to have the trouble remedied before the School opens again after the Summer Holidays.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scofield\nAgent\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOntario.\nOttawa, July 12, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., in reference to the prevalence of Itch in the French Bay school section.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the two resolutions passed by the Council for the eradication of the disease, and you are authorized to see that the Doctor's directions are properly carried out.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Seoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nRegarding itch in School\n\nFrom house to house inspection with agent John Scofield re itch urgent - sulphur 12 lbs\n\n$12.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nJohn Scofield\nAgent\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to the enclosed receipt of $12.50 rendered by R.W.

Wallace\nTeacher\nI have the honor to state that Mr. Wallace has a great deal of trouble to secure the attendance at school of a child named Jerry Ahonegot. The child is an illegitimate 13-year-old boy who has lived all his life with Band No. 7 Elijah Ahonegot. His daughter is mother of the child. His attendance at school has always been very irregular.\n\nThree or four years ago a complaint was laid against Elijah Ahonegot by the Indian Officer on account of the irregular attendance of this same boy. He was summoned to appear before me, but did not appear. I had a conversation with him; he promised to send the boy more regularly. I let him off by paying the expenses of the Indian Officer. The child has attended fairly regularly until the end of the last quarter.\n\nOn the 22nd, the Indian Office again laid information for the same offence. Being busy in the Office, I lay the matter over until after Pay Day.\n\nHe & two witnesses were summoned to appear before me on the 26th inst., neither he nor witnesses appeared.\n\nAs it would be a bad example to the rest of the Indians to try to make a settlement with him, I would request the Dept to kindly inform me what further steps I should take.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scofield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa Hill 28 Nov. 10\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to the case of Band No. 7 Elijah Shonogot, that as instructed by the Dept. I issued a warrant and secured his attendance on the afternoon of the 26th inst.\n\nHe acknowledged the offence of neglecting to cause the child Jerry Shonogot to attend school, in accordance with regulations re. education of Indian Children.\n\nI heard the case\u2014Shonogot stated in his own defense that the child had been sent to school most of the time that he was marked absent on the School Register. That he was an old man and could not provide for the proper education of the child; he wished the Agent to request the Dept. to relieve him from any further responsibility in regard to the child's education.\n\nThe other evidence heard strongly supported the defendant's statement.\n\nAs the defendant disobeyed the summons served on him in the first place and had\nand had to be arrested to secure his appearance, and as he was guilty of the offence I adjudged him to pay a fine of $2.00 + costs and gave him one week to pay it in.\n\nI cannot advise the Dept. to relieve Elijah Ahonogot of the responsibility of the education of Jerry Ahonogot, who is not more than 14 years old. It would be a bad precedent to others.\n\nThe boy will certainly have to earn his own living and I would suggest that the teacher, by certificate, release him from attending school while he is at work. This would compel him to attend school when not at work.\n\nI enclose the fine to the Dept. as soon as I receive it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient Servt:\n\nJohn Scoffield\n\nAgent\nChippewa Hill, Nov. 26th, 1910.\n\nThis is to certify that I have had charge of French Bay Indian school for almost eleven years, and during all this time I have never once refused to excuse a pupil from attending school when asked to do so by a parent or guardian.\n\nThis is also to certify that Elijah Ahumuguet and his boy Jerry were not moved to the Scumble when any Truant Officer laid the information against Elijah Ahumuguet nor for some time after.\n\nThis is also to certify that Elijah Ahumuguet was arrested against my wishes as expressed to Mr. Scoffield in writing, as we realized no good results would follow from the arrest, but that it would engender and create ill will and animosity against the teacher and his family when the arrest was not made at the time of the trial.\n\nJ.J. Wallace\nTeacher.\nChippewa Hill, Nov. 26th, 1910,\nSaugeen Indian Reserve,\n\nSec'y of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn passing the Agent's office this evening at Chippewa Hill, your Agent, Mr. Scalford called me into his office. On going in I found Constable Henry Ritchie there and with him Elijah Ahnawquet whom he had arrested under Mr. Scalford's warrant for not obeying a summons issued by the Agent some time ago in sending a boy to school whom he is the guardian.\n\nThe Agent led me to understand that the said Elijah Ahnawquet acknowledged his fault and had requested the Agent to report a line of defense to the Department, coupled with a request to have the fine remitted and the Department to relieve the said Elijah Ahnawquet of the duty of sending the boy to school any longer.\n\nAs your Agent knows little about the history of Elijah Ahnawquet's case except the version given by Elijah himself, it seems to me a short-sightedness of Elijah's and in school matters will enable the Department to decide this matter not in the best interests of Elijah but in the best interests of French Bay school and the schools in general in this Reserve.\n\n1. This is his second offense in disobeying a summons in the education of his children.\n2. During my 11 years experience in French Bay school, he has given continuous trouble in educating his children.\n3. He has raised a family of 3 boys and 6 girls all almost destitute of education.\n4. Every possible means was used to get him to obey the Law prior to his being summoned.\n5. He willfully and persistently endeavored to over-ride the Law and ignore it evidently his aim being to break the Law down and discount entirely.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\n6. He failed to over-ride the law, and now when he discovers his failure, he attempts to snatch a victory by crying and pleading for sympathy.\n\n7. He has no necessity for contributing towards the support of any of his legitimate children as they are all grown up and should be able to look after themselves. He has his wife and the boy Jerry an illegitimate son of Elijah Ahumugwato own daughter and on whose account he was summoned. His family consists of 3 including himself.\n\n8. Mrs. Angus, who knew the mother of the boy Jerry, informed David Root, my Tenant Officer, that she requested Elijah Ahumugwato and Mrs. Ahumugwato (her father and mother) to give the boy up to her and her husband and they would keep him and educate him. Elijah Ahumugwato and Mrs. Ahumugwato refused her request.\n\n9. It is said the boy Jerry was sent to school one week but failed to come. I know that he was out of school Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday evening my Tenant Officer reported him to the Agent, and the next morning, Friday he was at school bright and early. He then came the following Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. As Elijah had not yet received his summons, imagining the affair had blown over the boy Jerry was out of school again. A few days after this Elijah received his summons which he entirely ignored. His daughter (the boy's mother) and her husband were summoned as witnesses. They ignored their summonses too.\n\n10. Five of Elijah Ahumugwato's children including Jerry the boy in question, attended my school in their time. 3 were taken out of school under age, one died and now Jerry is sought after to follow the same course.\n\n11. Jerry is a member of my 2nd Part class, and pure at that.\n12. I attempted to get Mrs. Elijah Ahnwegecut to send this boy Jerry to school when he was over 6 years of age. My Tenant Officer came to me and reported that Mrs. Ahnwegecut declared to him that Jerry was only 3 years old. The Tenant Officer told me then that he himself knew Jerry was about 7 years old.\n\n13. Taking the children out of school all too soon is a great evil in these schools and to my mind should be discouraged.\n\n14. It requires some moral courage on the part of a teacher to brave the ill-will of these ignorant parents who refuse to properly educate their children. Fortunately these ignorant ones are in the minority.\n\nThese facts are submitted for the consideration of the Department. The Agent's report may not reach you until later.\n\nIt will be in the best interests of my work here for the Department to consider this report as confidential unless it becomes a necessity to return a copy to the Reserve. In such case I am prepared to substantiate every statement it contains.\n\nI have the honor to be your humble servant,\n\nJ.J.

When doing so, state to the Agent that Mr. and Mrs. Ahumquot now claim that the boy is Seventeen years old.\n\nHaving now carried out my instructions I leave the matter in the hands of the Agent.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. J. Wallace\nTeacher\nFrench Bay, Feb. 8th, 1911.\n\nMr. David Ross,\nSuperintendent\n\nI am informed that Jerry Johnson is at Elijah Okemohebo and that he is not sick. Please be at my place at 4 o'clock to night to go with me to the agent. I will do with this boy what the Department ordered.\n\nYours,\n\nJ.J. Wallace\nChippawa Hill Oct. 17/10\n\nMr. Sir:\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to official letters and my letter of Nov. 28th/10 re Elijah Ahnogot Band No. 7, neglecting to send Jerry Ahnogot to school. I would inform the Dept. that Jerry has not attended school one day this quarter. He has not been legally excused; he is not circumstanced so that he can claim an excuse under Clause 3 of the Compulsory regulations.\n\nBand No. 7 is guardian & grandfather of Jerry, and has been fined for said neglect, but has not paid the fine as he promised to do. At the trial he asked that the Dept. relieve him of the responsibility of educating the child.\n\nHe was notified that the Dept. refused to relieve him, and that he was expected to send the child to school till he was 16 years of age. Band No. 7 now claims.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nnow claims that Jerry is 17 years old, which claim I think can be easily contradicted.\n\nBand No. 7 is an old man and I cannot collect a fine from him. The cost would be considerable and he has the sympathy of the Band.\n\nBefore proceeding further I decided to report the matter, and have the advice of the Dept. as sending him to jail I think is the best thing that can be done.\n\nI enclose herewith communications that will show the actions of the Teacher J. J. Wallace in the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Scoffield\nOttawa, February 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and in reply I beg to say that in view of the fact that Elijah Ahonoquot, grandfather of Jerry Ahonoquot, is an old man the Department is not disposed to carry out the sentence enforced upon him by you for neglect in educating the boy, but thinks it would be better to commit the boy to an industrial school provided he is not over fifteen years of age. I have to ask you, therefore, to make inquiries and ascertain definitely the age of the boy and advise the Department, when further instructions will be given you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa Hall\n\nMar. 9th/11\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to the age of the boy Jerry Thoreau, that the most reliable authority available is Chief S. D. Mandanouk, whose son George was accused by the grandmother of the child as being father of said child.\n\nThe Chief says that the child was born in April 1897.\n\nI came to the Reserve Feb. of the same year, and if my memory serves me right, what the Chief says is correct.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scofield\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has decided that it would be in the best interests of Jerry Ahonoquot to have him sent to the Mount Elgin Industrial School. You should, therefore, have an application for his admission signed by the grandfather on the enclosed form and forward it to the Department, first having the boy medically examined. As soon as this is done, if the examination is satisfactory, you may make arrangements to have the boy sent to the school. Should the grandfather not be willing to sign an application the boy may be committed by you as provided for in Sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children. The Department will write the Reverend Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute and advise him that this boy will be sent there. Kindly take immediate action and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, March 24, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department desires to send to the Mount Elgin Institute a boy named Jerry Ahonquot of the Saugeen reserve aged 14. This boy is being neglected as his grandfather will not send him to school. The Department will pay for this boy at the usual rate over and above the number already authorized so long as he remains in the school. I trust that this will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. S. R.

I have not been consulted in respect to this arrangement and I strongly protest against it. I have exhausted my ingenuity in vain attempt to manage this boy and unless peremptorily ordered to do so by the Department I shall not admit him to any school at French Bay. If this boy is permitted to give all the trouble and annoyance he has done and then is permitted to turn the whole business into a burlesque, it is simply useless for a teacher on this Reserve to attempt to enforce the Compulsory Act. Any pupil may give all the trouble possible and then when all arrangements have been completed and said pupil has exhausted every means of opposition and annoyance simply promise to attend the Reserve school and he is turned loose to follow his old tactics and thus the moral lesson is lost so far as others are concerned,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe teacher has been discounted and his hold on refractory pupils vastly impaired and the authority of the Department set at naught.\n\nThe point to emphasize is this, \"Our object is not simply to look to Jerry Abernathy's well being, but to have in mind the great moral lesson we are anxious to teach both pupils and parents and guardians that the Department is determined to see that all Indian children shall be properly sent to school and educated and that no shuffling or avoidance of this regulation will be tolerated by the Department.\n\nAs I am entirely responsible for the discipline, success and well-being of French Bay School, and as my eleven years of faithful endeavor has not been entirely void of some little success, I trust the Department will do its way clearly to meet my wishes in this matter.\n\nShall be pleased to hear from the Department addressed to myself as soon as convenient.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJ.J.

Mr. Wallace is very obstinate in the matter, and has written me the enclosed card. Either of the other schools on the Reserve is too far from the boy's home for him to attend.

But as his friends have signed a guarantee that they will send him regularly to school and I have forwarded it to the Dept., perhaps it will be better to allow him to attend until I receive an answer. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\nJohn Scofield\nChippewa Hill, Saugeen Reserve,\nApril 29th, 1911\n\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs considerable discussion is being carried on re the legality of the Department's action in committing Jerry Almington to an Industrial School and as to my authority in refusing to re-admit to a pupil in French Bay School, I wish to lay before you a history of the Elijah Almington business from the outset up to the present time in order to show the Department that both its action and mine are well and strictly within the law. In this history I have well in mind Sections 9 and 10 as quoted in your letter to your Agent at Chippewa Hill.\n\nElijah was 1st summoned March 15th, 1910 to appear March 27th. He entirely ignored this summons.\n\nElijah was summoned 2nd time Nov. 5th, 1910 and at same time Jerry's mother (Mrs. Angus MacKenzie) and her husband were summoned as witnesses. All three entirely ignored their summonses and not one of the three appeared.\n\nElijah was arrested and appeared at Agency Nov. 24, 1910 but not one cent of expenses was charged against him by the Indian Constable or by the Agent. Simply a farce.\n\nOn or about Dec. 6th, 1910 Department wrote Agent that Jerry would be sent to an Industrial school if he did not attend the Reserve school at once. This was notice of intention to commit Sec. 9.\n\nYour Agent, through Henry Ritchie (constable) notified Elijah of this intention and read and interpreted the Dept. letter to him, and to me as well, on Dec. 12th, 1910, over 4 months prior to the Department's committing him and no objection registered in all this time see Sec. 10.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nElijah Shumagust came home from the Sauble with Jerry and I immediately sent my Trust Officer to him and notified him that Jerry would be arrested and committed to an Industrial school if not sent to Grand Bay school at once. Elijah absolutely refused to send him and stated that Jerry was 17 years old when as a matter of fact he was not yet 14 years old. These unethical assertions are added to exaggerate his disobedience. This was the 2nd notice of intention to commit, see sec. 8 fully 2 months and over prior to committed and no objections registered in all this time, see sec. 10.\n\nAgent received papers in March from Department and instructions to have said papers properly filled up, Jerry medically examined and removed without delay to Grand Bay Industrial School. If Elijah refused to sign said papers Agent was charged to commit by Sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations. Henry Ritchie carried these papers in his pocket until April 7th, 1911, when he called on me and informed me that Jerry's mother (Mrs. Shumagust) had consented to sign the papers and had done so that day viz April 7th. 3rd notification of intention to commit see sec. 9 and 10 of Regulations.\n\nOn April 18th, 1911 eleven days after this, the first objection from any source was registered, see sec. 9 and 10 as to 4 days.\n\nNow I submit, Jerry was removed by the Department from my jurisdiction on the day Agent received instructions and papers for Jerry's commitment and forfeited all right to entering any school on the Reserve or and after said date, your Agent contrary to his instructions allowed him to attempt to enter my school. Twice I turned him away 1st in April 24th, at 10 o'clock and over 5 hours and one-half before the Agent communicated or mentioned his proceedings to me. Agent allowed him to make a 2nd attempt, again...\nturned him away and as his conduct has been so vicious and as he has many times during my absence at the noon hour taken from 3 to 8 and 11 of the smaller pupils away with him and as his conduct has a very demoralizing influence on the entire school I cannot allow him to attend this school so long as I am in charge of it. This Elijah Ahumuguet and his family have made trouble for me now for over eleven years and in ten days this same Jerry would be practising his old tactics did he get an opportunity. As to section 15 of the Regulations\u2014 I interpret it thus\u2014 Where a case presents extenuating circumstances or redeeming features the Regulation would apply, but the circumstances and features in this case are overwhelmingly against the application of section 15.\n\nEvidently your Agent knew it was unfair to me to have this boy admitted to finish Bay school again as you will see from the following quotation of his letter of 24 inst. to me, yet he is permitted to come for another attempt the following morning. \"You refused to have him there. I do not want at it.\" In fact I will enclose the Agent's letter to me in its entirety.\n\nI beg to submit that inasmuch as the Department has followed a correct, straightforward and business-like course in this case throughout, Your Agent should be compelled to carry out his instructions in a business-like way. I have given my best efforts and thought and time to my work here, I have set the pace for the Reserve but my efforts have been, at times, nullified by the shifting, hesitating policy of your Agent. Nothing but a rigorous policy, fearlessly enforced is of any value in educational matters on this Reserve.\n\nYours T.J. Wallace\nTeacher\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with enclosures in further reference to the attendance of Jerry Ahonquot at the day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department gave this matter very careful consideration, and in view of the definite promise made by the parents it was decided to withdraw the order for commitment. The boy must be given the privilege of attending your school upon the conditions laid down in letter of May 2nd, last, i.e., that he give you no trouble whatever while at the school or going to and from. Had the Department been made aware in the first place that this boy's character while at the school was altogether unsatisfactory different action might have been taken. However, in view of the fact that the Department has given its word that he will not be committed provided he attend the day school and his conduct be satisfactory, I must ask you to again enroll him as a pupil upon trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. J. Wallace, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, May 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has today written the teacher of the French Bay school instructing him to admit Jerry Ahonquot as a pupil upon the conditions laid down in letters to you of the 26th ultimo and the 2nd instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa Hill\nMay 5th 1871\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter re Jerry Ahonogot. In reply I would inform the Dept. that the extra condition imposed on the boy is accepted by his friends who have promised to do all they could with the boy that he may be no trouble to the teacher. The boy has also promised to do all he can but claims that the teacher does not treat him as he should. And it is well known how easy it is for a teacher to find fault and complain of a pupil with whom he is dissatisfied and I am convinced it will not be long before the Dept. will have a complaint from the teacher against him if he admits him to school at all. I form this opinion by the way the teacher generally treats him.\n\nIt is my opinion that the Dept. might as well commit him at once to an Industrial School.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\nJohn Coffield\nAgent.\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSaugeen Indian Reserve,\nChippewa Hill, May 15th, 1911.\n\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform the Indian Department that Jerry Ahwamow's friends have broken their solemn promises to send Jerry to school regularly according to the Regulations, three times in succession already.\n\nSending a boy regularly according to the Regulations means sending him every day for the full term during which the school is open. See Regulations section 1.\n\n\"The school must be opened and closed punctually at the hours approved of by the Department see Instructions to Teachers, Page 1. Quarterly Report.\n\nThe hours approved of by the Department are from 9 o'clock in the morning of every legal school day until 4 o'clock in the evening. Each school day to consist of two sessions viz. 9 A.M. to 12 A.M. and from one P.M. to 4 P.M. Every teacher being vested with the authority to refuse to admit a pupil to take a seat in the school-room who is not in his or her seat at the opening of the session viz. 9 o'clock A.M. and 1 o'clock P.M.\n\nComing into the school-room and interrupting the classes at any hour of the forenoon was,\nand always has been Jerry's pet methods of annoying the teacher. An appeal to his friends only caused the offensive habit to be aggravated. When I had exhausted all my powers of moral suasion in an effort to correct Jerry's bad habits as a last resource I used the switch. On this being done Jerry's grandmother, Elijah Ahumocoot's wife, actually came into my school and abused me first in the Indian language in the presence of the entire school while the school was in session. Not content with this method of abuse she finally assaulted me and I was compelled to eject her from the room. She refused to go until I was forced to remove her by force. The department will clearly understand that I am prepared to prove every statement I shall make in my letters. I have been working throughout for this boy's good and the good of the community. In his present environment I can do nothing to prepare him to become a useful citizen. At the very best you cannot hold him in this school long enough even to do him much good. His friend's promises are not worth the paper they are written upon, and no man knows this better than your agent for he has tried the promised time and again at Scotch settlement under Mr. Burr. I never allowed it here.\nI am convinced the officers of the Brantford Institute will act very well, will do all possible to give him an education and to make of him a useful citizen. My only hope for Jerry is to have him removed from his present environment and away from these new friends and placed in some Institute where he will be under kind but firm restraint. The very best Indian parents on this Reserve exercise no control over their children, give them no moral training whatever. Young girls and boys of tender years will leave home and be away for days and the parents know nothing of their whereabouts or what they are doing. The only person on the Reserve who exercises any control over them for good is the teacher. The Agent seldom or never comes in contact with them and they fight shy entirely of the missionary. The teacher, in his school and Sabbath School comes in touch with their young lives and is the only hope for their uplift. The teacher must be kind but always firm. His authority must not be impaired or his hold on the children is gone. Let me cite a concrete case. Last Saturday and Sunday it was circulated around East over this Reserve.\nthat the Department would not allow Wallace to send Jerry Adamseout to Brentford and that the Agent was going to send Wallace away and get another teacher. We have not had a case of turkey for months until this week. No less than six boys played turkey this week, a direct result of above report.\n\nNow allow me to show you how Jerry's friends broke their promise from the moment they tried to get Jerry re-instated into French Bay school. Please do not misunderstand as I never make pretenses. Elijah Adamseout started out with the sole purpose of overruling the Compulsory Law and openly and brazenly bragged that he would do so. I simply said nothing but kept the law after him as he drifted towards the rocks. He was doing the very thing I desired he should do, otherwise I would be compelled to expel Jerry from the school for the sake of the other pupils. The action of the Agent or his friends solemn promises carried out without my knowledge, and without giving a correct and full report to the Department brought, in good faith by the Department, an answer adverse to my plans for\nthe boys welfare.\n\nJerry was brought to my school the first morning April 4th at exactly 10 o'clock. I refused to let him take his seat. School had been open one hour. He did not return for the afternoon session. I gave no reason for my refusal to the friend who brought him. The 8 and 9 o'clock bell had been rung. All knew the hour for opening school.\n\nThe next morning another friend brought Jerry at exactly 15 minutes after 10 o'clock. This time he came from the home of his aunt who is living in a state of adultery and fornication with the friend who brought Jerry to school. Jerry had about 40 rods to come from this home. Again both bells 8 and 9 rang out. I again refused to allow him to take a seat. He did not come for the afternoon session nor did he come again until May 1st. Another friend brought him the 3rd time. Late as usual. I refused him a seat and he has not been back since.\n\nElijah Shumaguet or his friends had evidently no intention of fulfilling either the letter or the spirit of the law. The sole object was to override the law in some way. My tenant officer laid the information against Jerry's guardian on October 20th, 1910 over six months ago. Six months lost in Jerry's education.\nJerry is now over 14 years of age. If it takes six months to handle a charge of this kind where the law and regulations are clearly stated and where plain and imperative instructions are given by the Department for the law to be strictly complied with, it seems to me that Jerry will be over school age before the Agent could get another information dealt with.\n\nHis friends have now had another chance to act squarely and honestly but have sadly failed. I can prove the charge herein laid by any trust officer who was watching the case carefully and by others as well if necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nOttawa, May 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in further reference to Jerry Ahonoquot.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to take the action suggested in the last paragraph of your letter until the boy is given a further trial. As you predicted a communication has been received from the teacher in which he complains of want of punctuality. I would ask you, therefore, to report at the end of this month and if you then consider it advisable to have the boy sent to the industrial school the Department will act upon your suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, May 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department desires you to give Jerry Ahonouot and his friends every chance to make him good the promises that they have made to the Department. It is not considered that you should refuse the boy admission to the school because he came late in the morning, but should be allowed to take his place in the class-room and the facts may be then reported. In refusing the boy admission to the school-room you virtually exceeded your authority, as there is nothing in the school regulations or in the regulations of the Department that provides for this. Mr. Scoffield has been instructed that the boy is to have an opportunity during this month to make good his promise and it is expected that no obstacles will be placed in the way by you. Should his action and conduct during the rest of the month not be satisfactory the Department will take the necessary steps to have him committed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. J. Wallace, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSaugeen Indian Reserve,\nChippewa Hill, May 20th, 1911\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 12th re Jerry Adamson.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Jerry has been enrolled since May 14th. Your reference as to me placing obstacles in his way instead of aiding me, proved rather amusing. Why I should place obstacles in Jerry's way is a mystery to me. I can assure the department that I am keeping perfectly sweet in so far as any instructions I may have received from the Department is concerned. Rest assured Jerry and his friends shall receive from me every assistance in order to enable Jerry to make good his promise and I shall be delighted at his success.\n\nOn April 4th 1910 the Department wrote me as follows:\n\n\"In view of your lengthy and satisfactory services at this school Dr. D., the Department trusts that you will be able to maintain the high standard at this school which now compares favourably with the white schools in your district.\" I have acted throughout this Adamson incident simply and solely with a view of fulfilling the wishes of the Department as expressed above. This school has steadily improved since that date up to a few weeks ago when this trouble was\nI shall continue to give this school my best thought and attention. I shall afford the tenant officer every opportunity of examining my register when he calls at the school. I shall give him any information I can in order to assist him when such calls are made. I shall furnish with a report at the close of each week similar to the enclosed report which is a copy of the one I sent him last night. I shall forward a duplicate to the Department. When this is done I shall consider myself relieved of all further responsibility re the regular attendance of the pupils.\n\nI trust the above-quoted affair is now closed to the satisfaction of the Department,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nMay 19th, 1911, French Bay,\n\nMrs. David Robt.\n\nStewart Officer, 383798\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI kindly allow me to make the following report for the week ended today:\n\nMonday, May 15th, 7 pupils out of school.\nTuesday, 16th, no school.\nWednesday, 17th, 11 pupils out of school.\nThursday, 18th, 5\nFriday, 19th, 11\n\nIsabella Aheehah was 5 days this week.

He came to me for advice. He informed me that the child was found at 11 o'clock in the night in the bush on the road-side and sleeping soundly. He brought her to school himself last Monday. She came every day this week and punctually at 9 A.M., I referred him to Mr. Scofield. I promised to report the facts as communicated to me to the Department.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nP.S.

(See letter of May 12, 153478/1)\n\nWhen Jerry was admitted on May 15 I had your letter of May 2 read to him and interpreted by tenant officer. It was impressed upon him that he must be at school at 9 o'clock, that he must give no trouble in school or going to and from school. That he must attend to his work at school and obey his teacher. He came to school eleven days in all. Eight days he came in late; three days he came on time. Mr. Scoffield visited the school on May 29. He asked me if I would allow him to speak to Jerry. I said most assuredly. He then gave Jerry a lecture and told him he would have him placed in some Industrial school if he did not get to school in time. The tenant officer being present interpreted to Jerry what the agent had said. Jerry was not very seriously impressed for he came blundering in...\nThe very next morning late as usual. Jerry does no work in school. He simply rolls around in his seat and keeps all the little ones within reach from their work. I had to take his knife from him to save his seat. He will not go home when dismissed but generally goes to the lake. On one occasion he asked me to go home at 3:30 telling me that Angus MacKenzie wanted him to plant potatoes. I gave him permission to go. Instead of going home he walked out of the school-room and direct to the lake not even attempting to do it on the sly.\n\nIn conclusion, the boy's action and conduct from the teacher's point of view has been very unsatisfactory and injurious to the general welfare of the school.\n\nI am humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.G.

When the child's eldest sister married Joseph Root (Band No. 194), Isabell was transferred from the Hashkawa family to Root where she now lives.\n\nI interviewed Root on the matter.

No excuse given, none asked for by any of them so far as the teacher knows.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. A. Wallace Teacher\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I will not have time the latter part of next week I take this opportunity of reporting on the conduct of Jerry Ahmuneet for the month of June. I bore with Jerry's conduct and disobedience throughout the month of May in order to avoid any appearance of placing obstacles in the way of him making good his promise of regular attendance at school. His coming in at any hour of the forenoon had demoralized the whole school until no fewer than 16 pupils came in late on the morning of June 2nd, some coming in as late as 20 minutes to 11 o'clock. The thought pressed itself upon me that the department concluded that if it compelled Jerry to attend school I was quite capable of managing him when he did come. In this the department made no mistake so long as I was not interfered with from outside sources. Accordingly, on the evening of Friday June 2nd, I informed the school that beginning on Monday June 5th, I would whip every pupil who was not in his or her place.\nplace in the school-room when the nine o'clock bell ceased tolling. Moreover I informed Jerry that henceforth every time he failed to have his school work done in proper time and every time I found him interfering with other pupils in the way of keeping them from their work I would punish him severely.\n\nOn Monday morning June 5th, Jerry came in late. I made good my promise before I allowed him to take his seat. The next morning June 6th, Jerry came late again. This time I took Solomon's advice Proverbs 14:18. Jerry soon realized he was late for school. This caused Jerry to consider the matter and to such good purpose that he has never been late one solitary morning since nor have I had a single pupil late since June 6th. That is not all. I have had no trouble with him for sickness &c. I have not had to touch him since for any cause. Not one syllable of complaint has reached me from any of his friends touching my treatment of him.\n\nI have a diligent, obedient and punctual pupil in Jerry now and he will come regularly so long as he fears being sent to an Industrial School.\n\nThe attendance the week ended last night was\nbeen the best since the second week in May.\n\nThere are a few boys who are giving considerable trouble in respect to irregular attendance. It is so near vacation now that it is not worth while taking any action until after the holidays. I find that the fear of being sent to an Industrial School works far better than giving the parents as it touches both pupil and parents and thus directly aids the parent though the Indian parent fails to comprehend this aspect of it.\n\nWhen the Department gives a parent personal notice of intention to commit to an Industrial School a certain pupil or pupils if not sent to school regularly, unless excused as the Law provides ninety-nine times out of a hundred the trouble ends right there and the so mentioned pupils are sent to school right along after such notice is served. It saves putting the parent to expense as well.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I sent the department a report concerning Isabella Ayokolah formerly of Scotch Settlement, later adopted by me Joseph Root who is now the child's guardian and who resides at French Bay. When I sent my previous report the said Joseph Root was desirous to have the little girl sent to an Industrial School and the said Joseph Root informed me that Hiram Ayokolah, the child's father, was also anxious to have her sent to an Industrial School. The child ran away and was out of school the week beginning May 1st again the week beginning May 15th again the week beginning May 24th again the week beginning June 5th again the week beginning June 12th in all five weeks. Joseph Root, her guardian, brought her to school again on last Sunday June 19th and she has been in school all weeks. Her guardian Joseph Root when I sent my first report lived back in the bush and the child had no company coming to or going from school. He has now moved out of the bush where the child has company to and from school. He informs me he is going to build near the school house and therefore thinks with my assistance he can keep her in school and would like if the department would permit him to keep her until he makes another effort along these lines. Hiram Ayokolah, the child's father, also called on me last night June 23rd to urge the same thing. He informed me that Mr. Suffield had received a letter from the Department requesting a report on the case and that Henry Kitchie had informed him that the Agent wanted to see him. He said he had not gone to see the Agent but promised me he would go today June 24th.\n\nThese people are trying to\ndo the best they can in my opinion in regard to getting this little girl to school. If their request meets with the approval of the Department I shall be pleased and I shall do all I can to assist them in carrying out their good intentions. But further, that from their new residence the child will be within full view of the school and the teacher's residence from the house her own door and also in full view of her own people until she enters the school-room.\n\nWould be pleased to have a personal reply from the Department concerning this child's case.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nT.J. Wallace\nTeacher\nOttawa June 26, 1911.\n\nSir-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to Isabell Ahyahba whom you recommend should be sent to an industrial school. In reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation and you may commit her to the Shingwauk Home under the regulations and after commitment she should be sent there in charge of a reliable person.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform the department that Jerry Ahnagoguet has not been in school since Christmas. He persistently refuses to attend school. The truant officer has called upon his guardians and friends, who signed the written promise that they would send him regularly, to no purpose. I refused to report him in the December quarter in the hope I could induce him to attend more or less regularly this winter. He did remarkably well in his studies up to December, being about ready to enter the 4th standard. In fact in order to encourage him I promoted him into the 3rd reader just before Christmas intending to give him special and individual attention as far as possible.\n\nI understand Elijah Wahbagon's two boys Peter and Andrew have been committed to an Industrial School. Neither of these two boys have been in school since Christmas. The father was notified of the commitment and informed that if the children were subsequently sent regularly to school, the...\norder of commitment would not be pressed. This was done with my approval. Instead of taking advantage of this offer, the parents closed up the house and I am informed went to the vicinity of Paisley. If the Department can find room in any one of our Institutes for these two boys, in my opinion, these two boys should be at once removed from the custody of the parents and placed in an Institute at the earliest possible moment regardless of cost. These boys, especially Peter the elder one, is incorrigible. They will be back in the spring, three months older and more confirmed than ever in their evil habits to sow the seeds of evil in the minds of other children. This will be nothing short of a calamity.\n\nAhmoquet is a big fellow now and will be 15 years old soon; hence little can be done for him by the Institute. These boys of Wabagno are still redeemable if placed under proper restraint apart from their home environment.\n\nPlease note \u2014 the utmost harmony exists between the teacher and Agent in this matter.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nP.S. Should it very pleased to have a personal reply.\n\nJ.J.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scofield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippewa Hill, Jan. 1st, 1913.\n\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to direct the attention of the Department to a Resolution passed by the Saugeen Indian Council of the Saugeen Agency in the matter of appointing Thomas Wahbeze to be Inward Officer for the French Bay Indian School of which I am the teacher in charge.\n\nJust when said Council passed said Resolution I knew not neither did I know that such a Resolution had been passed or the matter of a Inward Officer interfered with until this afternoon.\n\nI take this, my earliest opportunity, in order to protest against the appointment of Thomas Wahbeze as Inward Officer of the Indian School at French Bay for the following reasons viz:\n\n1st. Thomas Wahbeze cannot speak the English Language neither does he understand it when spoken by another, hence as a Inward Officer he is of no use as the teacher cannot communicate with him.\n\n2nd. He was Inward Officer of French Bay School for some time about four years ago or thereabouts.\nand his conduct was so detrimental to the best interests of the school that the late Mr. Scofield dismissed him. Every time he entered the schoolroom the teacher was compelled to cease work entirely until he was fit to leave owing to a habit he persisted in of running about the room talking to the pupils in the Indian Language, the confusion rendering work impossible. Both Mr. Scofield and the teacher instructed him not to do this. The Agent, on two different occasions, when complaint was made, sent for him to the school and with the aid of an interpreter gave him full instructions as to his duties the last time warning him that his prompt dismissal would follow any departure from the instructions then given. He still persisted in disobeying the warning and prompt dismissal followed.\n\n3rd, His advanced age renders him entirely unfit to discharge the duties of a Truant Officer.\n\n4th, He is a disagreeable, cantankerous, quarrelsome old man with whom no one can get along. His wife cannot live with him and has been separated from him for some years.\n\n5th, The teacher at French Bay (J.G. Wallace) did his utmost to try and get along with him.\nand did put up with him as long as it was possible to endure it; when endurance failed, Mr. Scuffield dismissed him and appointed David Root in his stead. David Root gave good satisfaction until total blindness about 12 months ago rendered him unfit to do the work. Mr. Scuffield and the teacher consulted and Joseph Mitchell was permitted to act as Inward Officer under David Root. The Agent and the teacher agreeing to let the matter so rest until we could ascertain from actual practice as to the wisdom of appointing Joseph Mitchell permanently. Joseph Mitchell has a white man's command of the English Language, is an intelligent, agreeable and active Indian and has proven himself after a long test to be the best Inward Officer I have ever had as yet. He is not treaty but his wife is treaty. Some of the Indians claim that being a non-treaty Indian bars him from holding the Office of Inward Officer. I fail to find this bar in the Indian Act or in the Compulsory Act. Had Mr. Scuffield been aware of what the Council were doing he would not have permitted it for one moment. He knew nothing of it as he was so unused his\nson kept all business away from him by his physician's advice. The Indians took advantage of this to get this Resolution slipped quietly through and sanctioned without the Agent's knowledge or mine, knowing full well that the Agent's son, who was doing the business for his poor sick father, would never detect it in time to prevent its sanction by the Department.\n\nFor the sake of the school, I humbly beg the Department to appoint Joseph Mitchell as Trust Officer and cancel the appointment of Thomas Wahbeze, as, after a long trial, I, as teacher, cannot get along with Thomas Wahbeze as my Trust Officer for the reasons above given.\n\nHoping to hear from the Department at its earliest convenience re this matter\u2014I am its humble servant,\n\nJ.G. Wallace\nTeacher.\nOttawa, January 10, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in reference to the appointment of Thomas Wahbezee as truant officer for the French Bay School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires to allow this matter to stand as it is until such time as the new Agent is appointed and I would ask you to bring it to the attention of the Department as soon as an appointment is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The wages of the three truant officers when taken individually are too small but if the total amount were paid to one man we could expect to get an official who would do the work satisfactorily for all concerned, instead of the old fellows who at present hold the offices.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSaugeen Agency,\nFeb. 4/18\n\n[Stamp: FEB 8 1918]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The new Agent is now in charge.\n\nFor particulars please refer to my communication of January 1, 1913.\n\nPermit me to add, that my average is lower this quarter, so far, than it has been for years. This is due to the fact that Mr. Joseph Mitchell a good and faithful tenant officer has been displaced by this poor old man Thomas Wohleger.\n\nThis old man, I am informed, has been presuming to act in the capacity of tenant officer since the first of the year. He has not been in my school since Jan. 1, 1913 or impact for years. He has not approached me in regard to school matters in any form since the late Mr. Scofield dismissed him some years ago, nor do I desire him to do so.\nI beg to inform the Department that a member of the Saguenay Indian Council, Mr. Levi Wesley, solicited me for my consent to the appointment of his brother, William Wesley, constable of the Reserve, to be truant officer for the entire Reserve, to have the salaries of the three schools as apportioned for truant officers, that is $72 a year.\n\nIn my opinion such appointment would be unwise and detrimental to the best interests of the schools. He resides near Elsinore some six or seven miles from my school at French Bay.\n\nMr. Scofield always allowed the teacher to name the truant officer for his or her school. He claimed the teacher bore the responsibility for the regular attendance of pupils and consequently should designate a truant officer who would act in harmony with the teacher.\n\nI beg to leave this matter in the hands of the Department. I shall do my best to carry out its wishes and ruling.\n\nI beg to refer the Department to page 7 Paragraph 5 of the Compulsory Regulations re appointment of truant officers. Indian Councils have no jurisdiction.\n\nYour humble servant,\nJ.J. Wallace, Teacher.\nOttawa, March 12, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Wallace, teacher of the French Bay School, has complained of the inefficiency and neglect of the present truant officer and suggests that he be removed and replaced by a competent man.\n\nThe Department would like you to go into this matter with Mr. Wallace and report the result of your inquiries with any recommendations that you may have to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As your agent has rectified this error we will soon have a marked improvement in the attendance. We have an Indian at French Bay named Peter Moses, non-treaty, with three children of school age and they have not been in school one day this winter. They live one quarter mile from the school. This Peter Moses is a lazy-good-for-nothing fellow whom the department put off the reserve but was later allowed to come on again without the sanction of the Department.

They will not attend school. Both children and parents are a thieving bunch, and all your agent and I can do we cannot get them to do better. They are a nuisance and a disgrace to the reserve and must be removed off the reserve to save the other little Indians from their baneful influences. One of these little boys went to Owen Sound last week, stole a pair of shoes and is now in jail. The youngest boy is aged 7, the eldest about 14.

If these non-treaty Indians have just recently come to the reserve it might be well to have them removed, but if they have been permitted to reside on the reserve for some years I do not think their removal would be the proper discipline for neglecting to send their children to school. I would proceed against them for whatever offence they have committed or whatever regulation they have violated.\n\nA.S.

So long as Moses remains on the reserve his children must be compelled to attend school regularly and you are hereby authorized to put the regulations in force.

I have but a limited Third Class Certificate valid in Ontario for two more years. I have had about fifteen years' experience in teaching, the last four in the province of Ontario. My last school was at Carson Mine near Sudbury where I had thirty-two pupils enrolled, one in Entrance Class who passed obtaining Honours. I was invited to remain for another year at a salary of $700.00 and superannuation paid, but as board was $35.00 per month and I had to\nwalk two miles night and morning. I refused the offer thinking I could get a school nearer home. So far I haven't found a school. I know my certificate is poor but I'm not a poor teacher. Inspector D.M. Christie of Sudbury will vouch for that also for the fact that I am an excellent disciplinarian.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\nMary McCallum.\n\nP.S. - My religion is Protestant-Presbyterian.\n\nM.M.C.\nIndian Affairs Office\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nAugust 21st, 1923\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been interested in trying to secure teachers for the schools at Cape Croker and Saugan Bay. I have heard from a friend who has received an application for a white school from a Miss McCallum of Wingham and she has told me about French Bay School.\n\nJudging from her experience and the fact that she might do for the school, I thought you might be interested in offering her a position as much as possible as much as possible.

Dr. Manning is at present in the West, and the records which I have been able to discover would indicate that your Department was to nominate a teacher for this school. I write to enquire whether this information is correct.\n\nI beg also to report that Miss Lillian Jessup has accepted work in connection with the Toronto Public School Board, and feels that she cannot undertake the work at Chemong. We were informed by Miss Brown that there was an Indian on the Reserve who had qualifications, and was willing to undertake this work.

Miss Mary McCallum of Wingham could not accept the French Bay School, which we offered her; but your other nominee, Mr. Thomas E. Little, of Owen Sound, has been engaged at a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months plus bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn McCool, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nWalkerton, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the FRENCH BAY School.\nJanuary 15, 1924.\n\nTeacher:- Thomas E. Little.\nSalary:- $800.00 and Bonus.\nQualifications.- III Professional Graduate from Collegiate Institute.- Passed Upper School.\nSuccess.- Rather youthful and lacking in experience.\nDoes not relish the work enough.\n\nThe problem in connection with this school is to secure a good teacher, satisfied with the whole situation and anxious to work for the welfare of the pupils. Mr. Little will not remain longer than June of this year and the Department would do well to endeavour, early in the vacation, to secure a teacher with some ability and experience. The inspector will be on the lookout and will be glad to help to get a teacher capable of doing good work. It is a pity for pupils 15 and 16 years of age to be in the first or second reader. There should be better work done in this school along educational lines. The parents need quite a stirring up in order to take more interest in the education of their children.\n\nJohn McCool, Insp.\nOttawa, January 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your recent report on your inspection of the French Bay Indian Day School. Your remarks regarding the services of the present teacher, Thos. E. Little, have been considered. We note that he does not intend to remain after the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next.\n\nWe shall be pleased if you will assist in the obtaining of the services of a properly qualified teacher for this school to begin duties after the summer holidays next. If you will be good enough to bear this matter in mind and recommend a suitable teacher the Department will be obliged. At the beginning of the present school year we had applications from a number of teachers, some of whom were fully qualified, but, upon the position being offered them, it was found that they had secured employment elsewhere. It is considered that Mr. Little should be allowed to remain and continue his duties for the balance of the present school year. It would, no doubt, be difficult to obtain a qualified teacher before the beginning of the next school year. Your interest and assistance towards obtaining a suitable teacher will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn McCool, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nWalkerton, Ont.\nWatkinton, January 30th, 1924\n\nMr. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou are very wise in proposing to keep Mr. Little at French Bay until June, as it would be difficult to find a teacher for the school next fall. Mr. Little will do as good work as a new teacher. He can teach fairly well, but his heart does not seem to be much in the work.\n\nWe shall be very glad to help to get a teacher, but I come, if you Department becomes more interested, it will be all the better.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McCoo\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be very glad to help you find a teacher.\n\nI had thought about advertising but after considering your letter, I believe we need a teacher approved and if I advertise for a teacher for French Bay school, there might be some confusion. If you advertise stating the term which you state in your letter to me, also that a good dwelling is beside the school, you should get plenty of applicants as qualified teachers are very plentiful this year. A man telephoned us two nights from Owen Sound on behalf of William Lindsay, a young man of 19 years of age with a district certificate. The great objection to Mr. Lindsay and James men like him is that they are anxious to get money for some\npurpose, and the only value which the Indian School has for them is the cheque that comes regularly. I may be over-sensitive, but it seems to me that Mr. Little has just kept the school until he was ready to go to university or something else that he had in mind. The college opens in October. He should have resigned French Bay School in June and joined the Indian Department a chance to get a teacher, and besides, the Indian Agent should be wide awake to these matters, and look out for the best interests of the school. I have known Mr. Paul Putnam for a good many years, and I should not put much faith in his judgment in choosing a teacher. He could probably choose a good house if such an occasion were needed for any of the schools.\n\nIf you care to advertise the French Bay School, keep all\nfavorable terms and seek applicants to apply either to the Indian Department at Ottawa or to me at Walkerton, I shall be very glad to help. Throughout the holidays, I have had 50 letters or more from qualified teachers, and I ought to have been able to recommend some of them, but the school has been thrown open, which it should not have been, as the little master does not know what he intended to do.\n\nThere must be, however, a great many teachers without schools, and you may be able to get a suitable person. A regular teacher who looks upon teaching, and especially teaching the Indians, as a serious business is the one to choose. I shall be on the look out as per letter requests.\n\nJohn McCool\n\nIndian Affairs.

As a residence is provided, it would no doubt be more satisfactory to obtain a married teacher. A teacher having at least 2nd class professional qualifications should be engaged, if possible. The salary allowed would be at the rate of $800 for the ten teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, which, during the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, is at the rate of $15 per month.

As you will see from the statement in a letter that attendance was falling off in Miss Roth's school, I thought better to see for myself. I am satisfied from my careful observation that Miss Roth's work in the summer has not sunk the work at all in the school. Both teacher and pupils are in the best of form.\n\nThe next school is Finch Bay. As the head nurse has expressed very much desire to join me that I was going to recommend Mr. Lee be sent there. Chester, holder of a Second Class certificate, also teacher although he asked me to advertise I thought that the expense might be saved, so I have had come to my office looking for a school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McDonald, M.P.P., of Cheltenham, who is not sure of the applicant's written qualifications but has known him personally. However, the Department would like an older person and next year, it might be wise to look about for a more suitable person for the French Bay school. I met Mr. Smith at the Indian Day in French Bay and he seemed interested and as he is from Portage Settlement and as he is from there, satisfied to take the school. He seems anxious enough to take the school and I gave him advice as to what I should like him to do.\n\nIf the Department be not satisfied, I can still advertise before October 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McCool\n31-1-1 Chesley, Ontario,\nSeptember 22, 1924.\n\nJ.

It was left to the inspector to employ this man, and he is strong on certificates, but this year in the Village school there were two pupils pass the entrance, and Mr. Melvor, the teacher, has only a district certificate.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

I consider that this should have been brought to the Department's attention some weeks ago, so that suitable notice could have been given to Mr. Green. In view of your recommendation, you may inform him that his services will not be required after the end of September. If Mr. Green does not wish to teach the month of September, he should so inform you at once, so that we can make arrangements for a suitable successor. You should communicate with Mr. Green immediately and also inform the Department without any delay what action you have taken. The Department has in mind a successor to Mr. Green, but we would like to know at the earliest possible date whether he should be engaged from the first of September or from the first of October. The gentleman in question is married with no children and has several years of successful Indian school experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The attendance is ridiculously small, and the outlay great. For less than half the present cost of this school the pupils could be driven to the Chippewa Hill school and such an arrangement could probably be made with Alex. Root, a Soldier Settler on the French Bay road. He has the necessary equipment and a contract to do this work would enable him to pay off his loan to the Department.\n\nC. C. Parker.\nInspector.\nFebruary 28th, 1931.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMR. MORRIS:\n\nFrom the formal reports of Nurse Cousins after her recent visit at Saugeen Agency, the following table has been prepared:\n\n| School          | Teacher       | Pupils examined | Unvaccinated | Pediculous | Skin trouble | T.B. glands |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Saugeen Village | Mr. Knetchel  | 27              | 3            | 4          | 1            | 4           |\n| Scotch Settlement | Mr. McIver   | 20              | 2            | 4          | 2            | 3           |\n| French Bay      | Mr. Gentleman | 14              | 8            | 9          | 4            | 6           |\n\nThe condition of the French Bay pupils is apparent. The proportion of the pupils unvaccinated; with skin trouble; or with lice, usually reflects the attitude of the teacher toward matters of health and cleanliness.\n\nE.L. Stone\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.\nDirector of Medical Services\nOttawa, March 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nNurse Cousins, who recently visited the French Bay Indian Day School and examined the pupils, states that, out of fourteen pupils examined by her, she found nine that were infested with lice and four with skin trouble. The Department would like you to take remedial action to overcome these conditions among the pupils. The Medical Officer could, no doubt, advise you in the matter.\n\nThe Nurse also stated that eight of the children were unvaccinated. Please state if you have discussed with the Agent and Medical Officer the question of vaccinating those pupils who have not yet received this treatment. The Department desires to have the conditions mentioned by the Nurse cleaned up, and I would like to be advised by you as to what steps you are taking in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. H. Gentlemen, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian Day School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir;\n\nI have to reply to your letter No31-1-1 of the 2nd inst regarding the conditions of the children at the French Bay School as reported by Nurse Cousins.\n\nI think I might say that I have not been unmindful of these matters, in fact when I came here five years ago I recall going into the subject with Agent Putman, and in my school reports I drew attention to the fact that these people are far from clean. They are much more dirty than the western Indians.\n\nWith regard to vaccinating the children, I would say that in 1927 Dr Laird of Southampton arrived at the school and vaccinated those pupils who happened to be present. I believe at the time Agent Putman was under notice of dismissal, for the parents had not been informed, and some resented it. Since then I have had several new pupils, but I have not pressed the vaccination need, apart from telling the parents that they ought to get them done, feeling that the subject might at some time be explained to the people at one of their meetings, which would be better than rousing their resentment to any action that might be taken. Nurse Cousins held a meeting at the Hall, and I expect spoke on the matter, and I also have since spoken to the parents, so that the children, I think, might be done at any time.\n\nWith regard to lice and skin trouble, I might say that when this prevails in country schools among white settlers, the usual custom is to send the children home to get cleaned up. Such results in the parents feeling somewhat of the disgrace, and there is an improvement at once; but in the case of Indians here, they have no feeling of disgrace, and very little self respect. If I sent any children home they would simply stop at home for a few days, and take no notice. I am able, however, to impress upon the children the importance of clean hands, faces, and brushed hair, and this is done. In addition to this, I have used some small health posters sent from time to time, as reading lessons, writing exercises, and drawing copies, so that the children have these matters brought to the minds.\n\nI would also like to say that one can do very little with the children along these lines, while their homes are so dirty. My wife and I have been on various reserves since 1911, and have never seen the conditions that prevail among these people. When the children of some families do have new clothes (seldom new) they simply wear them into holes. Some of them sleep in their clothes all winter, and I told that in some cases the women are just too lazy to clean up their homes. I am hopeful that the visits of Nurse Cousins, and the meetings of the Womens Institute will cause some improvement along these lines.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nI would also like to take this opportunity of pointing out the need of window screen, and screen door for the schoolhouse. I must say that I feel rather strongly upon this point. Of course the need is not a present one, but with the children's clothes so dirty, my schoolhouse in the fall of the year becomes very trying. I have never before been without screens, and I hope that this improvement might be granted to us before another fall comes round. I feel sure that if Nurse Cousins had paid us a visit in the fall she would see the need of this.\n\nThere is no regular Medical officer on this reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting the Department to supply fencing for the land around the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to the small attendance, the Department has been seriously considering the question of closing this school at the end of the present academic year, and, under these circumstances, we are not prepared to incur any expenditure at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian Day School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa Hill,\nSouthampton, Ont.\nApril 11, 1931.\n\nPersonal.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nArising out of my school report, in which I referred to the fencing of these buildings, I have letter No 31-1-1 of 10th inst signed by the Secretary stating owing to small attendance the question of closing the school has been seriously considered and no expenditure can be undertaken at the present time, etc.\n\nI am sorry that it should have been felt necessary to write in this way, because for the past couple of years my school has had a much larger attendance than when we first came here, and as far as I can see will remain a good school for some years to come. At the present time I have an enrolment of 17, with an average age of between 9-10, and more pupils coming on within the next twelve months. I checked back the register for the past nine years, when making up my quarterly report, and found that the past twelve months has been the best during this period. It has so happened however that in the Agent's monthly report, the attendance does not show high, mainly because his morning visits have occurred on dull mornings. This is one of the difficult points with Indian children. On a bright morning their parents are up, and out early, and on dull bad mornings they are not. But the Agent knows we are getting a good turn out for apart from his visits the Attendance officer has called in about twice a month all winter, and so far I have not had to request him to visit the parents.\n\nThe children are making good progress. I am aware of this, but some of the parents are also informing me of this fact. We have not been involved in any dispute with the parents over school or any other matter since Mr Putnam left some years ago. Neither have we been with the Agent. As far as I know everything has been going along satisfactorily and there does not seem to be any cause to comment upon the attendance.\n\nRegarding the fence, that is in very poor shape. The Dept. Inspector last fall asked the Agent and myself if anything was to be done as also the school steps, and approaches to the closets. The house also needs shingles. He agreed as to the need, and the Agent and myself felt that it was only proper for us to state these needs. They are not in that condition that would compel us to close owing to lack of funds to repair, but they are in poor shape.\n\nArising out of the report of Nurse Cousins, I stated \"This reserve has no regular Medical officer.\" I was not aware until today that Dr Volumns of Southampton is our Medical officer. I called at the Agency this afternoon, and this fact happened to be spoken of. The Agent and I have never had any occasion to refer to the subject otherwise I would have heard. As a whole the children are much the same as other Indian pupils; they could be cleaner, and they could be worse.\n\nAll things considered I cannot help thinking it would be a mistake to close; there is no doubt that the question of reopening would be brought up by the parents in a very few months.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Her late Father told me he would never consent to Elsie leaving home.\n\nSHE IS THE FIRST GIRL FROM THIS PLACE TO LEAVE THAT HAS NOT BEGAN AT ONCE TO LEAD AN ETHICAL LIFE AS SOON AS SHE WAS LEFT SCHOOL.\nShe is living at home, helping her mother.

Inside of a year well known in Southampton as an immoral girl. In 1927, or 8, gave birth to a child, and still unmarried.\n\nEthel Mitchell.\n\nLeft at September 1927 to go to Kuney Boarding school, and remained there a year. Refused to return. Within three months of her return this girl was \"running wild\" with the above girl in Southampton. For the past year or so she has been living with a young fellow, unmarried in her Grandfather's house, Jessie Root, who is a Counsellor.\n\nRuby, Ethel, and Elsie where in the 2nd book, when I came here in 1925. Elsie stayed and made fair progress considering that her home is entirely Indian in every respect. She is home now, and living respectfully, and I would consider this good work.\n\nWith the other two, I might have been able to do the same thing, but I did not have the chance. They did as they pleased, and their people backed them.\n\nThe following is of interest.\n\nIn September, 1925, when I took over, the school had three boys on the roll:\n\nOliver Kawcishig, Issac Nashkawa, and Percy Stevens, all down as 12 years of age, but more likely getting on for 15.\n\nOliver, and Issac could read with difficulty, the first reader, and Percy could hardly read the primer. None of them reached the second reader.\n\nThese are \"beginners\" I took over from Mr Green. They never did begin.\n\nIn January 1929, Mr McCool heard these three boys read in the Primer Ontario reader. They were a good deal bigger than the present three boys.\n\nMr McCool at the time said that Oliver, Issac and Percy should be more advanced, which I knew, but they had past the age of primer work long since.\nChippawa Hill,\nSouthampton, Ont.\nMay 8, 1931.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nWithin the past two weeks, or so, I have received three messages, regarding our work here, hence the need of writing. Agent Robertson told me of your intention of keeping the school open at any rate until June 30, 1932, without any change either regards my position, or repairs.\n\nThe Rev. E.F. Bishop of Southampton who called at your office tells me that we had no need to be concerned to any great degree with regards to our employment, and\n\nMr Inspector MacGowan (I may not have caught his name correctly) told me that, for some years the Department have been entirely dissatisfied with my work, and that unless there was a change, I would have to get out, and in a very few months, at the end of the year in fact.\n\nIn answer to my question, \"If this went at the end of the coming June, or June 1932?\" he did not know.\n\nHaving conveyed your message in this manner, he added a great deal more, from which I gathered that Mr Inspector MacCool of Walkerton is the cause of the difficulties.\n\nMr MacGowan, would listen to no reasoning, but added I was at liberty to take up the manner with you.\n\nI have therefore gone carefully over my school, and enclose a detailed list of what the children can do, together with the last examination that Mr MacCool gave the children as far as I can remember it. In fairness to myself and the children I would ask you to look this over.\n\nI might have informed you in 1926 that Mr MacCool has, from the first inspection given me the impression that he resented your making my appointment here, over his head so to speak. He, I am told, looks upon the appointments of teachers in his district as being something within his powers, and school trustees in French Bay white school, some seven miles down the lake told me that if Mr MacCool likes a teacher whom he has obtained, everything is alright, otherwise it is all wrong. I have been told this on several occasions.\n\nAt the last inspection Mr MacCool only took notes of the number in each grade. In the past he has noted details of the work, but this time he did not, was present from 9.40 till 10.55, with 15 children present. It seems to me that his judgement was formed beforehand, which is most unfair.\n\nThe statement that no progress has been made has caused me so much astonishment, that I took an unexpected opportunity to obtain the opinion of an entire stranger to myself, and the children, as to this being correct.\nThe Rev. Father Cadeau, Roman Catholic missionary for this and Cape Croker reserves, called to see me. Throughout Bruce he is well known and spoken of as being well informed upon local Indian matters, and he is one whom I felt that he would at least be fair. I have only met him once before, some years ago at Cape Croker, and then only for a minute or so. Also I should add that the children at this end are not of his faith.\n\nI requested him to examine the school in any manner he saw fit, either in English or Indian, or both, and he stayed with us the whole afternoon.\n\nAt four o'clock he informed me that the work, in his judgment was entirely satisfactory, and that I had reason to be proud of the progress and that whoever had informed the Dept. that no progress had been made was very much mistaken.\n\nI did not ask the Rev. Father to inform you this, or if you have any confidence in his judgement I do not know, nor can I say what he might tell you if you should ask. I might also say that Mr MacCool told the children that they were doing very nicely, and gave me no hint as to his dissatisfaction.\n\nAmong your instructions to me in 1925, you may recall these. \"Do not quarrel, or have discord with the parents if at all possible to avoid it.\" This has been avoided, but when I pointed this out to Mr MacGowan and that there was general satisfaction among the parents I was told that the Dept. took no notice whatever of the Indians likes or dislikes.\n\nIf the Provincial authorities maintain that the Indian children must conform to white standards, as Mr MacGowan claimed, I must state that the conditions under which these people live make such a thing impossible. Mr MacCool informed me some time ago that \"he had never been in an Indian house and would not care to go in\" thus showing that he knows nothing of their conditions, neither does he appear to grasp the fact that the only English they hear is from myself.\n\nThey live on a semi-starvation diet, often come to school without anything to eat at midday, and never more than two pieces of dry bread, and I am disposed to think that the Junior Red Cross would be very much astonished that they can do as much as they can.\n\nThey have made progress, and can continue to do so at the present rate, but I feel that the conditions conveyed by Mr MacGowan message (i.e. that there must be a great improvement to satisfy Mr MacCool) cannot be done, for nothing I could do would satisfy Mr MacCool, so I will, with your permission, communicate at once with the Bishop of Saskatchewan, or some other Anglican Bishop in the west with whom I trust you will permit me to undertake future school work.\n\nI must however express regret that we cannot reap the fruits of a good deal of real work in the school here, and that we should be put to the expense of moving, and a general upheaval, a regret, I think too, will be felt by a good many friends we have made during our stay in Bruce.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I asked Inspector McGookin to inform you that this school, under your management, would be given another year's trial, i.e., to June, 1932, but that the Department expected you would get better results than in the past. It is true that the reports received from the Provincial Inspector and from Indian Affairs officers have been far from satisfactory, and it was my duty to seriously consider either closing the school or arranging for a new incumbent. The present attendance and the prospects for pupils in the early future suggest that the school be kept open, and it has been decided to give you a further trial of one year. Mr. Indian Agent Robertson was so informed on the 23rd ultimo.\n\nThe Department hopes that you will bend every energy towards making your school a real success during the next academic year and that the institution will have a general civilizing influence on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have also taken a course in Book-keeping and business management from the L.C.S. schools so as to be qualified to handle the executive duties of a school Principal properly.\n\nI have also the honor to be a graduate of the new Two Year Normal School Course. I have had two years of Professional Training at the Normal School. I have had four years of successful experience as a teacher in Ontario Public Schools.

I am interested in music and teach singing in my schools at which I have made a great success.\n\nI am well acquainted with Indian characteristics and customs as I lived for twenty years near the Indian Reserve at Deseronto, and I have taught school for two years near the reserve at Southampton. I am also acquainted with Dr. Crow and some of the leading Indians in the Reserve and I can assure you that I would be able to live there with the best of harmony and sociability among the natives.\n\nI am sending you under special cover some testimonials and references.

At that time the Indian Agent was written and he reported that there were no grounds for such complaints.

You might draw this matter to the Department's attention early in December, at which time you should give full particulars concerning the number of children who would attend, the condition of the building and what repairs or cleaning would be required to the school building and teacher's residence. When the Department receives particulars at that time, as to the cost involved in the fitting up of the building and the amount that would be required for the salary of a teacher from the first of January to the end of the school year - June 30th, 1934, consideration will be given concerning whether funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill,\nOnt.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 3, 1933\n\nDr. McGill\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office has referred to the Superintendent General a further letter from Mr. P.H. Gentleman, a former teacher in the French Bay Indian School, from which the following is extracted:\n\n\"In June the Indian Department directed Mr. Agent Robertson to inform me that my services would not be required, and in the same letter directed him to communicate with the Public School Inspector of the county of Bruce with a view of obtaining another teacher, giving details of salary etc., etc. I saw that letter.\n\n\"Later in the month, the Indian Department informed me that the school is to be closed owing to lack of funds.\n\n\"In 1923 a Mr. Wallace retired from that same school after twenty years or so service on a pension of $300.00 a year, which he received until he died. Mrs. Wallace informed me of this at the end of June last.\n\n\"The Indian Department informed me almost the same week that Indian school teachers are not entitled to pensions.\"\n\nI wish you would let me have a memorandum which I can send to the Prime Minister's Office for incorporation in their reply.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nNovember 7, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your memo of the third instant, embodying an extract from a communication received by the Right Honourable The Prime Minister and referred to the Superintendent General, from P. H. Gentleman, former teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen Reserve, Chippawa Hill, Ont., I would state as follows:\n\nThe services of Mr. Gentleman were dispensed with as from June 30th, last, on the report of the Provincial Public School Inspector and Mr. Inspector McCookin of this Department. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum dated June 27th, last.\n\nNo successor has been appointed and the school, through poor attendance and lack of funds, has remained closed since Mr. Gentleman's services were terminated. At the time his services were dispensed with, it was intended to re-open the school at the beginning of the present academic year, viz.: September first, last; but, in the meantime, owing to a request for a further reduction in our Appropriation, it was decided not to re-open the school.\n\nMr. Gentleman refers to the case of Mr. Wallace, a former teacher, who was retired on superannuation. In this connection I would say that Mr. Wallace, who gave 28 years' service in our employ, was retired on account of ill health.\nill health and superannuated under the provisions of the Public Service Retirement Act, 1920, as amended in 1921 and 1922. This Act was better known as the Calder Retirement Act. Under its provisions, it was not required that contributions be made by the person retired. This Act has now expired. As teachers of Indian day schools are not appointed by the Civil Service Commission, they cannot be classed as permanent Civil Servants and are therefore ineligible for superannuation. Since the going out of the Calder Act, the only provision we can make, under the requirements of the Auditor General, upon the retirement of a teacher who has given lengthy service - 10 years or over - is two months' retiring gratuity, which was granted and paid in the case of Mr. Gentleman.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nNote: Walter superannuated by D.C. 88/1025.

Gentleman, formerly engaged as a teacher in the French Bay Indian Day School. Mr. Gentleman in the opening paragraph appears to be under a misapprehension that the Minister has asked for a special report on his case.\n\nWhat the Minister actually told Mr. Gentleman in his previous letter was that he had asked for such a report, at the same time advising him as to the substance of your memorandum of November 7th.\n\nPlease let me have, with the return of the latest letter, a draft reply for the Minister's signature.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, December 1, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Gentleman:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with further reference to your claim for superannuation.\n\nThe Public Service Retirement Act, generally known as the Calder Act, expired on July first, 1924. It was in effect for a period of four years only. Under its provisions, it was not required that contributions be made by the person retired. Teachers of Indian schools are exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned and are therefore classed as \"temporary\" civil servants. Only permanent civil servants are eligible for superannuation, it being required that 5% of their salary be contributed to the Superannuation Fund. Temporary civil servants do not contribute and are therefore not eligible for superannuation.\n\nNo further purpose can be served in continuing correspondence. The only provision that could be made upon the retirement of a teacher who has given lengthy service - 10 years or over - is two months' retiring gratuity, which has been paid in your case.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nKetcheson,\nB. C.\nDecember 1, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 29th ultimo, to which is attached a further communication from Mr. P. H. Gentleman, former teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Sauguen Reserve, I would state as follows:\n\nMr. Gentleman is under a misapprehension in regard to his being eligible for superannuation under the Public Service Retirement Act, 1920, better known as the Calder Act. In Section 8 of this Act, as amended, 1923, it is stated: \"No person shall be retired under the provisions of this Act after the first day of July, 1924.\" This Act expired on that date, being superseded by the present Superannuation Act, which went into effect as from July 19, 1924. Under the Calder Act, it was not required that contributions be made by the person retired. Three teachers, who had lengthy service, were retired under its provisions, although they had made no contribution to the Superannuation Fund during their period of service. Under the present Act, it is required that five per cent. of salary of permanent employees be contributed.\n\nTeachers in Indian day schools are exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned and are therefore classed as \"temporary\" civil servants. Only permanent civil servants are eligible for superannuation. Contributions to the Superannuation Fund cannot be accepted\n\n- in the case\nin the case of temporary civil servants, and, since the going out of force of the Calder Act, there is no provision for superannuation or pension to teachers of Indian schools.\n\nRegarding Mr. Gentleman's assertion that, upon his first appointment as teacher, he was informed by the late Honourable David Laird and Mr. Graham, former Indian Commissioners, that he would be entitled to pension, I would say both these former officials were well aware that no provision was made for the superannuation of teachers. Mr. Gentleman has never contributed to any superannuation or pension fund, and there is no Act or Regulation now in force under which he could be granted superannuation.\n\nWith reference to the reasons for dispensing with Mr. Gentleman's services, I would refer you to memorandum dated June 27th, last, embodying the reports of Mr. Inspector McCookin and Mr. J. M. Gane, Provincial Public School Inspector.\n\nI am enclosing, for the Minister's signature, a draft reply to Mr. Gentleman and am also returning herewith his letter, as requested.\n\nIn my opinion it will serve no purpose to continue correspondence with Mr. Gentleman. The Department's position, regarding his dismissal and his claim for superannuation, has been fully explained to him, and I would respectfully suggest that the matter be considered closed. From our past experience with him, he is a \"prolific letter writer\".\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDec. 1st, 1933.\n\nRe the closing of the French Bay Indian School on the Saugeen Reserve, it has been represented that it will be rather difficult, if not impossible, for the pupils of this school, which was recently closed, to attend one of the other schools on the Reserve.\n\nThe Minister would like some information as to the distance which the pupils of the former French Bay School will have to travel each day in order to continue their education.\n\nWill you be good enough to obtain this information from the Indian Agent and submit a report.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, [date]\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nOttawa, December 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the closing of the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen reserve, I have to inform you it has been represented to the Department that it is rather difficult, if not impossible, for the pupils of this school to attend one of the other day schools on the reserve.\n\nI would request that you inform the Department, at the earliest possible date, how many children of school age could attend the French Bay School if it was re-opened. I would request, also, that you state the distance which each of the pupils would have to travel each day in order to attend either the Saugeen Village or the Scotch Settlement School. Please state whether you would recommend that the French Bay School be re-opened as from the beginning of the new year. If so, you should state what work or repairs would be required in cleaning and fitting up the school and teacher's residence, giving an estimate of the cost involved. The Department desires as complete information as possible, in order that consideration can be given to the question of re-opening the French Bay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nD. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-I-1, dated December 6th, and previous correspondence, regarding the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to say, there are twelve children who could attend the French Bay School, three Nashkewa children would be eight miles from the Village school and five from the Scotch Settlement school, five Root children and one Kewaquom would be seven and a half miles from the Village and four and a half from Scotch Settlement, one Thompson, seven miles from the Village and four from Scotch Settlement, one Stevens and one Ahonoquot, five miles from the Village and four from the Scotch Settlement, this is the distance one way. As the Scotch Settlement is filled up it would be necessary for these children to attend the Village school.\n\nThe French Bay school would not require any repairs before the summer holidays but it should be reshingled then, the only requirements would be the usual class room requisition, The Teacher's residence would also do until summer holidays, at that time it would require some papering and painting inside. If the Department intended to supply the teacher with fuel and furniture this would have to be purchased as there is no fuel and the only furniture in the residence is one cook stove and one heater, the fuel would cost about $3.00 per cord but I cannot give an estimate on the furniture until I know what the Department would consider purchasing. The teacher's salary would be around $80.00 per month. I would recommend that the school be re-opened if possible.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 14, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memo of the first instant, regarding the re-opening of the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen reserve, in which you requested to be informed concerning the distance which the pupils of this school would have to travel in order to continue their education at one of the day schools on the reserve, I would say that, upon referring the matter to the local Indian Agent, he has supplied the following information:\n\nThere are 12 children who could attend the French Bay School. Of this number, three are 5 miles from the nearest school, six are 4\u00bd miles, and three are 4 miles. The Agent has recommended that this school be re-opened at the beginning of the new year. He states the school would not require any repairs before next summer holidays, when it should be reshingled. There is a teacher's residence in connection with this school, which does not require any repairs at the present time but will need some papering and painting inside, next summer. However, if the school is opened, it will be necessary to supply some furnishings for the teacher's residence at this time.\n\nI would recommend that this school be re-opened as from January first, next, and that the services of a teacher be engaged. The salary allowed the former teacher, Mr. Gentleman, was at the rate of $100 per teaching month, less 10%. It is considered that a fully qualified teacher could be obtained for not more than $80 per teaching month, less 10%. If you approve of the re-opening of the school, I would request that you advise me the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher who should receive the appointment.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDec. 16th, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe Minister this morning dealt with your memorandum of December 14th, your file 31-1-1, regarding the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen Reserve, and approved of your recommendation to have the school re-opened on January 1st next.\n\nYou will be advised in the course of a few days as to the teacher who is to be engaged.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, December 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the French Bay Indian Day School and stating the children who could attend and the distance they reside from other schools in the agency. I have also noted your recommendation that this school be re-opened.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that it is intended to re-open this school as from the first of January, next, and you will be advised in the course of a few days concerning the teacher who is to be engaged.\n\nI would request that you arrange to have the school building scrubbed and thoroughly cleaned and made ready for classroom activity. I note that the building will not require any repairs before the coming summer holidays.\n\nWith reference to the fitting up of the teacher's residence, this can stand over until the new teacher is appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I would request that you communicate with him and inform him definitely of the date on which you will be prepared to commence duties, which, it is hoped, will be on or about the third proximo, the date the schools re-open after the present Christmas holidays.\n\nThere is a teacher's residence in connection with this school, where you may reside. Mr. Robertson will give you full information regarding the residence or the obtaining of boarding accommodation. He is also being instructed to arrange with you for the preparing and forwarding of a requisition for any classroom equipment and furnishings for the residence, if required.\n\nWe understand there are some 12 children who could attend this school. It is hoped that you will meet with every success in the work. I would request that you immediately communicate with Mr. Robertson, informing him of the date you will begin duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Stead,\nWiarton, Ont.\nOttawa, December 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that it has been decided to re-open the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen reserve, as from January first, next. The appointment of Miss Winnifred Stead, of Warton, Ont., who holds a second class Ontario certificate, is being approved, to begin duties on or about the third proximo.

I would request that, when Miss Stead arrives, you will give her every assistance you can in her work.\n\nIt is noted, from your letter of the 11th instant, that the school will not require any repairs before the summer holidays and that the only supplies necessary will be the usual classroom material. An order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office for a quantity of classroom supplies. If any other articles are required, the teacher should prepare a requisition and forward same through your office.\n\nThe Department is not aware whether Miss Stead will occupy the teacher's residence or if she will be able to obtain board near the school. If she occupies the residence, it is noted that it will be necessary to supply fuel and a quantity of furniture. If she lives in the residence, you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of fuel required, which, it is noted, would cost about $3.00 per cord. At the earliest possible date, you should forward a list of the furnishings necessary, giving an estimate of the cost, if possible.\n\nI would request that you exert every effort to make conditions as satisfactory as possible for Miss Stead. You should also inform the parents that the school is being re-opened and see that their children attend regularly each school day. Miss Stead is being requested to communicate with you and inform you of the date she will begin duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD.

MacKenzie,\nSecy., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nWawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 30th did not reach me until the 1st inst. and being engaged I was unable to get away until the following noon. That afternoon in company with my father I drove to the school and then called on the agent, Mr. D. Robertson, of Chippewa Hill, who advised me that there was no furniture or furnishings in the house except a couple of stoves.\n\nOwing to this fact, and there being no other boarding house available, Mr. Robertson suggested that it would be in order for me to open the school on Monday morning next at 9 a.m.\n\nIn the meantime at his request\nI am sending him requisition for furniture for a kitchen, living-room, and bedroom.\n\nIn closing I wish to thank the Department for their great kindness in appointing me teacher of this school and assure you that I will do my utmost to merit the confidence that has been placed in me by putting forth my very best efforts to advance the interests of my pupils.\n\nThanking you and wishing you all the season's compliments, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippawa Hill, Ont., in which he states that Miss Winnifred A. Stead, the teacher, was married on August 26th, last, and is now Mrs. A. Martin. He states that the marriage was not reported to him until the third instant and that Mrs. Martin intends to continue teaching at the French Bay School.\n\nSection 36 (1) of the Civil Service Regulations provides as follows:-\n\n1. \"Hereafter, no married woman, whose husband is living, shall be eligible for appointment in the public service;\n\n2. \"provided that, when the supply of experienced help for any particular kind of work is not sufficient to meet the demands of the public service, a married woman may be certified for temporary employment;\n\n3. \"where it can be established by a married woman that her husband is unable, through illness or other cause, to contribute to her support, such married woman may be certified for permanent or temporary appointment.\"\n\nIn the public service, when a woman marries, she is required\nis required, under the regulations, to resign her position. It appears, therefore, that it will be necessary to dispense with Miss Stead's services.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised what action should be taken in the matter. In the event of your desiring her dismissed immediately, please let me know the name and address of the teacher whom you wish engaged, as the school year has already commenced and it is necessary to have a teacher at once.\n\nRegarding the appointment of Miss Stead, I beg to refer you to my memorandum dated December 14, 1933, and your reply dated December 30, 1933.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSouthampton Oct. 24th.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEP 26 1935\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn reference to our conversation today re the vacancy in the French Bay School, on the Langdon Reserve, I got in touch, by long distance, tonight, with Miss Beatrice McDowell of Woodsville, and she has consented to accept the position as teacher, if you decide to engage her services.\n\nShe will forward her application immediately.

During the past three and a half years I have been the School Inspector visiting this school and I have taken it upon myself to draw this impending vacancy to the attention of one of my former pupils, Mr. Armour Irwin, who is now seeking a position as teacher.\n\nI have known Mr. Irwin for fifteen years\u2014in fact I was his teacher during the last two years of his public school career (1920-1922), and I came to know him quite intimately. Always I found him to be reliable, studious and thoroughly conscientious. Just before he obtained his High School Entrance certificate I took him aside and advised him to direct himself to the teaching profession because I considered that he was of the right calibre for that work. Economic factors prevented Mr. Irwin from finishing his High School course at that time, but he never forgot my advice. After a number of years in other work he returned to High School after which he attended\nNormal School (term 1934-1935). His work at the Normal School was brilliant as was shown by the fact that he was not required to write any of the final examinations.\n\nSince Mr. Irwin was my pupil I have been more or less in touch with him and his career. He is now married and has two children. I have never had any occasion to change my opinion formed years ago concerning his excellent character. His presence in any community, white or Indian, would be a real asset. Moreover I have not the slightest doubt that he will make a success of his teaching career if conscientious endeavour can make it possible.\n\nIt might be worth while to add that Mr. Irwin, who now resides at 963 Ossington Avenue, Toronto, has been on relief for several years. During this time he finished his High School Course and attended Normal School under most difficult conditions because of the fact that for one, two or three days each week, (including Saturday-by special arrangement), he was engaged in relief work. Industry and ambition such as this require no comment.\n\nI quite believe that the Department of Indian Affairs would make no mistake in engaging this estimable young man as a teacher in French Bay Indian School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Game\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to apply for the position of teacher in the French Bay Settlement School. I have a permanent Second Class Certificate, a Grade \"K\" Certificate in Physical Training, and a Religious Instruction Certificate.\n\nI have eight years experience. I am enclosing a copy of a testimonial which I received from the last School Board for which I taught.\n\nHoping I may meet with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nVivian Mc Dougall\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis is to certify that Miss Vivian McDougall was a teacher in the Southampton Public School for the past six years. She proved her to be efficient, very capable and a good disciplinarian and are pleased to recommend her to any board wishing her services.\n\nDuring the six years that Miss McDougall was teaching in our school we had the most efficient staff we have had in many years. We are very sorry to lose such a valuable teacher.\n\nThe Southampton School Board\n\nL. N.

Irwin has made application for the position of teacher of a school at French Bay on the Saugeen Indian Reserve. Some few years ago I was a member of the Staff of Harbord Collegiate Institute of this city and Mr. Irwin was a pupil in attendance. He was a very conscientious, hard-working student who always did his best. Since that time he has attended the Normal School here, and the fact that he did not require to write on any of the Final Examinations at the end of the academic year on account of his work during the year, would seem to indicate that he was an outstanding student at the Normal School.\n\nMr. Irwin is a married man with two children, and I feel that he finds it necessary to secure a position if at all possible. I have no doubt that, if he can but have the opportunity of making a beginning in teaching, he will render very conscientious and efficient service. I have always found him most trustworthy, and I greatly regret that since he graduated there has not been one vacancy in which he might be given an opportunity to make a start in my inspectorate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPublic School Inspector.\nPERSONAL.\n\nOctober 1st, 1935.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have received a letter from a young man named John E. Robertson of Southampton who is anxious to secure the appointment at the French Bay Indian Day School. His letter is backed up by his minister, Rev. Mr. Newnham of Southampton, and by the Rev. D. A. Cowan of Port Elgin.\n\nOf course, I have told them all that the United Church has no authority in making nominations for the schools on the Saugeen Reserve, but I am sending on the information to you in the hope that Mr. Robertson's application may be favorably considered. I am quoting from his letter and this will give you the information concerning his case. I will suggest that he make regular application through the Indian Agent:\n\n\"I am a member of the United Church. In the Sunday School I have played in the orchestra. I also take part in Young People's work. I do not use tobacco or alcohol. I hold a First Class Teacher's Certificate, a Religious Instruction and Physical Education Certificate. Last year I attended the University of Western Ontario and succeeded in obtaining the first year of my B.A. degree. Having lived near the Reserve most of my life I am fairly well acquainted with the Indians and their ways. I would do my best to help these people to improve their habits of living and make the Indian children better Canadian citizens. Knowing that Indians are musical and having played a cornet in several bands and orchestras, I would try to develop this talent in them. At Normal and at Western I played on hockey and ball teams. I would play these games with the Indians and teach them to be true sportsmen. I would be pleased to help the missionary in any way I could with his work in the mission field.\"\n\nTrusting that you are well and with kindest regards,\n\nI remain, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:HEF\n\nIndian Affairs.

In our own church, we have Miss Jean Black, an estimable girl of highest character and ideals. Miss Black has her Normal certificate, and has made application. She is active in our Sunday School and Young People's work, and would give fine service there.\n\nThen we also have a young man, Jack Robertson. Jack has his Normal and, I believe, two years of his Arts work. He is quite musical and athletic, a teetotaler and non-smoker, and a member of our church. Jack would make an exceptionally fine teacher in the school, and would be a fine influence in the Reserve.\n\nMiss Winona DeLong has also asked me to write you in her behalf. Miss DeLong is a member of the local Baptist Church. She is a splendid girl, conscientious, earnest and able, and would also give a good account of herself there.\n\nI shall be glad if you are able to do anything for either of these three fine young people.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Gentleman, I beg to say that he was appointed teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School (Saugeen Reserve No. 29 - Electoral District of Bruce North), on October first, 1925, and his services were dispensed with as from June 30th, 1933.\n\nThe reports received from the Public School Inspector who visited this school during the period of his service showed that very little progress was being made. Mr. McCookin, Inspector of Indian Agencies, who visited the school in June, 1933, stated as follows:\n\n\"I have no hesitation in recommending a change of teacher at this school. I have done so in each report since 1929. The pupils are backward and compare unfavorably with the other two reserve day schools. There is an atmosphere of lifelessness and indolence about the whole classroom. The parents, in some cases, have changed their residence to allow the children to attend one of the two other schools on the reserve. This school is no credit to the Department.\"\n\nIn view of the adverse reports received regarding the work that was performed by Mr. Gentleman, the Department informed him that his services would not be required after the end of the academic year June 30, 1933. In consideration of his length of service, he was granted a retiring allowance equal to two months' salary.\n\nI may say that, since Mr. Gentleman left this school, he has, on many occasions, written the former Minister, the Department and other parties, regarding his dismissal and requesting reinstatement. I might add that Mr. Gentleman's services were dispensed with solely on his record, and the Department cannot recommend his re-engagement in the Indian school service.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSt. Marys, Ont., November 13th, 1935.\n\nMr. A.

H. Gentleman, I have to say that Mr. Gentleman is a white man. He was born in England.\n\nMr. Gentleman was appointed, by the Anglican Church authorities, as a teacher at the Old Sun Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot reserve, Alberta. We have no record of his length of service at this school. He was appointed teacher of the Indian Day School on the John Smith Reserve, Duck Lake agency, Sask., from July 1, 1913, and remained there until September 1, 1922, when he was transferred as teacher of the Grand Rapids Day School, at the northern end of Lake Manitoba.\n\nThrough lack of tact on his part with the church authorities and departmental officials, there was constant friction. It was considered if he was removed from church control and placed in an Indian school in the East, he would have a better opportunity for success. Therefore, he was appointed teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School (Saugeen Reserve, No. 29 - Electoral District of Bruce North) as from October 1, 1925, to the date of his dismissal, June 30, 1935, on account of unsatisfactory service.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, November 19, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sanderson:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, I am pleased to inform you that Kenneth E.

T. D. Pattullo,\nPremier of British Columbia,\nVICTORIA, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe morning paper reports your intention of going to Ottawa towards the end of the week, and if this should be correct I am taking the liberty of bringing the following to your notice, which may be of some help to you in dealing with Dominion authorities.\n\nAs briefly as possible - I have been in the employ of the Indian Department for some years. First in 1905, at the instance of Commissioner Hon. David Laird, who promised me promotion and a pension at the end of twenty years service, and later from 1911 till 1933, nearly 27 years, as school teacher and reserve overseer. Promises were repeated in 1912 by Mr. Inspector Chisholm, Mr. Commissioner Graham in 1919, and by the late Mr. R. T. Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education in Ottawa in 1925, who also told me that pensions for Indian school teachers had been done away with, but that as the promise was made, when the time came to retire, we would be taken care of; my wife also being on the staff.\n\nIn 1933, while in Ontario, I was discharged for no reason, and given a bonus of two months' salary.\n\nIn 1919, during the post office strike, or right after, our salary was doubled, as civil servants. In 1930, when all Dominion employees' salary was cut 10%, we also received the cut as civil servants. Our salary during this period has been on an average of $700 a year, and we have served in remote places in the western provinces and Ontario, spending over $4000 in expenses of moving, fixing departmental buildings and other items in connection with the schools. In my last school in Ontario the man who held the position a year before I was appointed was pensioned on $300 a year after 23 years' service.\n\nWe came to British Columbia in 1933, expecting to receive the retiring allowance, I can assure you long looked forward to. But owing to the attitude the Dominion Government has taken towards us, I have had to use my savings and my life insurance which has just about come to an end, and I shall in a couple of months have\nto apply to your Relief Department for assistance. I am over fifty years of age, my wife over sixty.\n\nOn my dismissal, I took up the subject with the Members of Parliament for the County of Bruce. Nothing could be done. Mr. R. T. Murphy knew nothing about it. Some friends in Victoria wrote to Mr. Bennett, with the same result.\n\nI have a letter from the Prime Minister agreeing to the following request I made to him on the matter:\n\n\"If an authority, or commission of any kind can hear my case in Victoria, I will abide by any decision reached provided that such an authority does not consist of officials of the Indian Department.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister agreed to this in a kind of a way after the election, but all I can get now from Ottawa is a letter from a Departmental Secretary saying \"contents of my letter is noted.\"\n\nI would have liked to have an interview with you regarding this subject, as it is clearly one case that is Dominion responsibility. We have lived on Dominion lands (Indian Reserves) for nearly 27 years.\n\nBelieve me, my dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"P. H. Gentleman\"\n14th April, 1936.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nRe - P. H. Gentleman.\n\nI am sending you herewith a letter from the Assistant Secretary to the Prime Minister of British Columbia which apparently relates to your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nHarold W.

Wardle, Deputy Minister of the Interior, has transferred to this Department your letter of the 8th instant, with copy of a communication received by the Prime Minister of British Columbia from P. H. Gentleman, of Metchosin, B. C., with reference to superannuation on his retirement as teacher in Indian schools.\n\nTeachers in Indian schools are exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act and are classed as \"temporary\" Civil Servants, and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. Mr. Gentleman has never contributed to any superannuation or pension fund, and there is no Act or Regulation now in force under which he could be granted superannuation.\n\nThe only provision made upon retirement of a teacher is a gratuity, equal to two months' salary, which Mr. Gentleman received. He appears to be under a misapprehension that he was promised superannuation upon retirement. The officials who, he states, made the promise were well aware that no provision was made for the superannuation of teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nC.

The local Indian Agent has been informed of the appointment of Miss McCulloch and she has also been written.\n\nWith reference to the second last paragraph of memorandum above mentioned, regarding the transfer of Mr. Kenneth B. McPherson to some other school, I have to say that there will be a vacancy for the coming school year for a teacher at the River Settlement Indian Day School, Caradoc Indian Agency, (Electoral District of Middlesex West). If you approve, Mr. McPherson could be appointed teacher of this school. I shall be pleased to have your direction in the matter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSuttonpton Oct.,\nApr. 6., 1936.\n\nTo whom It May Concern,\n\nI welcome the opportunity of writing in appreciation of the ability and pleasant qualities of Mr. Jack Robertson of this town.\n\nMr. Robertson is a splendid type of young man, charmingly, thoroughly dependable, with the highest ideals, and conscientious in all he undertakes. He would, I am confident, do his best to give satisfaction in any position he might be called upon to fill, and would be a real asset to the school and community in which he resides.\n\nMr. Robertson has won the highest respect of the people of Suttonpton. He is a very likable young man with a pleasing manner and a favorite among young and old alike. I anticipate a fine career for him in the teaching profession. He will be very successful in dealing with the children in his charge.\n\nMr. Robertson's application is one worthy of the most serious consideration from Board of Directors.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.E. Newton\nSourthampton, Ont.\nMay 30th 1936.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI am submitting my application for French Bay School.\n\nI hold a First Class certificate, the Lord Strathcona certificate in Physical Training and a certificate in Religious Instruction.\n\nI also have one half my B.A. degree obtained at Western University, London. This includes Philosophy and Psychology which is a great help in dealing with Indian children.\n\nI have no experience but my critic teacher at Stratford told our class I would go far in this profession. An experienced teacher is not always a good teacher.\n\nI am greatly interested in\nmusic. For years I have played the cornet in bands, namely Southampton, Port Elgin and Western University. Also played in Stratford Normal Orchestra and the Classical Orchestra at Western, and this winter conducted an orchestra. The Indians are nearly all musical and it would be a pleasure for me to form a band among them. I am now taking piano lessons and could play for anything required of me in the School or Community.\n\nEvery school should have some athletics because they develop the children's bodies, rest their minds and teach sportsmanship. I have played hockey and ball at both Stratford Normal and the Arts team at Western.\n\nI am willing to secure a certificate in Agriculture this summer if your school requires one.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a\ncommendation from Rev. B. Newsham of Southampton United Church. The agent thinks it wiser to have the teacher and preacher of the same denomination as they work better together as they have had trouble over this before. For the past year I have been President of the United Young People's Union, a Sunday school teacher and have given the address in the Church service twice.\n\nThe agent also says it is no place for a girl. I am six feet tall and am twenty-one years old.\n\nMy father had a stroke twelve years ago and has done nothing since so we are finding it rather hard. He died and my mother could live up there with me if you preferred it that way or I could motor home each night. I have lived near Chippewa reserve all my\nlife so am acquainted with\nthe ways of our Indian friends.\nIf my application receives your\nkind consideration my first\nvote will be a Liberal one\nalso a brother and sister\nwill be young Liberals.\nI applied for this school last\nyear but without success, but\nhope it will be better this\nyear.\n\nYours very truly,\nJ. E. Robertson,\nSouthampton, Ont.\nOttawa, June 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, applying for the position as teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School and stating the qualifications which you possess.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the services of a teacher for this school for the coming school year have already been engaged. There will therefore be no vacancy.\n\nI note you are a member of the United Church. I would suggest that you forward your application, giving full particulars regarding your qualifications and experience, to Rev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ont. There are a number of Indian day schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church, and the Department looks to the church authorities for the nomination of teachers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

She is now living on a farm about three miles from Wiarton and has one child. She stated that when she received a cheque at the end of January she thought the Department was paying her for another month and when she received the cheque at the end of February she thought that the Department was paying her until the end of June. Mrs. Martin would not commit herself regarding the refund of $480.00 but stated that she would write the Department direct regarding the matter.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to your request that I return the six months' salary I received as teacher on Saugan Reserve, I naturally thought this was a six months' bonus on my retirement and have spent the money. As you know I am now a farmer's wife and it is impossible for me to return it, but if I am liable to do so I might be able to repay it in dribs from time to time.\nbut think the department should forgo this claim.\n\nResp. Yours,\n\nMrs. J. A. Martin\n(H. Stead)\nOttawa, September 23, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the overpayment to the amount of $480.00, made to you after you had given up duties as teacher at the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nAs you were well aware, your services terminated at the end of December, last, and it was through error that monthly cheques were sent you for a six month period after that date. You should have been well aware that you were not entitled to the money and should have promptly returned the first cheque you received, as well as the subsequent cheques. At least, you should have made enquiry from Mr. Agent Robertson or the Department as to your being entitled to the cheques. I am sure you must have felt that, after only six months' service, you were not entitled to any superannuation or retiring allowance, and, to say the least, it is considered rather strange on your part that you retained and cashed the cheques. The Treasury Board and the Auditor General insist that you make early refund of the over-payments made you, to the amount of $480.00.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your serious consideration and make the refund. Your early reply, stating what you are prepared to do in the matter, is requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMrs. A. Martin,\nR. R.

No reply has been received from you.\n\nI now have to insist that you will state definitely what arrangements you are prepared to make in repayment of the above mentioned amount. Unless satisfactory arrangements are made by you, the Department will have no other recourse but to take action to collect the amount. The Department will expect to have your early reply, stating what you are prepared to do in making refund of the overpayment made you to the amount of $480.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

She was written on September 23rd, last, and requested to take the earliest possible steps to arrange for refunding the amount of the overpayment, and no reply has been received from her. I would request that you again interview Mrs. Martin, inform her of the necessity of making prompt arrangements for repayment, and advise the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEmel.\n\nA. F.

She stated that she had received your letter of November 24th, and would reply to it; she also stated that the only way she could make a refund of the money was to be engaged as a teacher and half her monthly salary be retained on the overpayment of salary. I told her that this would be hardly possible but no doubt she will explain her circumstances to you in her letter. Personally I do not think her circumstances are very good, she is living on a farm three miles west of Wiarton.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding your letter no. 31-1-1, of the 24th instant, I have as stated in a previous letter, spent the money.\n\nThe only way in which I can repay it, is to take back the French Bay School, Sangan Reserve, on the same terms as I had it before\u2014namely house, wood and furniture supplied, with a salary of $80.00 per month\u2014and let you deduct $30.00 per month of the aforesaid salary to go towards the payment of the $490.00 which you claim must be refunded.\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs. G. Martin.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 3, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the over-payment made to Mrs. A. Martin I have to say that possibly she could be proceeded against criminally for converting to her own use money that did not belong to her, but there is some doubt as to whether a conviction could be obtained, especially if the court should believe her story that she thought these payments were a bonus. I don't think the Department would be likely to take criminal proceedings in this matter, but even if it did that would not recover the money.\n\nThis woman apparently has no money and her husband is not responsible for the claim. Mrs. Martin states in one of her letters that she might be able to pay it in dribs but I do not imagine that there is much prospect of repayment. Beyond making a demand from time to time I do not see that there is anything the Department can do.\n\nDepartmental Solicitor.\nOttawa, February 4, 1937.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department received your letter of November 30th, last, with reference to the over-payment made to you. It is not possible to favourably consider the suggestion made in your letter.\n\nOur position was fully outlined to you in official letter of September 23rd, 1936, and it is expected that you will refund the amount over-paid to you at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

My plan would be to present in a simple way, the story and character of Christ, without any\nreference to sectarianism whatever.\n\nA time could be arranged to suit the convenience of the teacher in each school, for a half hour lesson each week.\n\nWe have developed, in our churches, a religious character, with low moral standards. The children are getting very little religious instruction of an ethical nature.

However, before taking such action, it is considered that you should consult the Indian Agent, in order that he can arrange with the teachers regarding the time at which this instruction should be given.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Robertson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Gentleman\n\nDear Mr. Chambers:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 18th and also copy of a communication received by you from Mr. J. T. Gawthrop, attached thereto.\n\nI can only state that Mr. Gentleman's claims for re-employment or for a superannuation allowance were carefully reviewed by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and by the departmental officials, immediately following his dismissal on June 30th, 1933. It was pointed out to Mr. Gentleman at that time that he had not been a member of the permanent Civil Service staff, nor had he at any time contributed to a superannuation fund, and consequently he had no claim for superannuation allowance. The decision was reached that Mr. Gentleman's request for re-employment could not be seriously entertained, in view of the unsatisfactory service he had been rendering over a period of years. The departmental files indicate that, if Mr. Gentleman had made any attempt whatever to follow the Inspectors' instructions during the last five years he was employed with the Department, or if he had made even a partial attempt to keep his school clean and in a sanitary condition, he would still be employed in an Indian day school.\n\nThis man steadfastly and persistently refused to accept advice from the Provincial School Inspector, the Indian Agent and the departmental Inspector for Ontario. Mr. Gentleman's letters indicate that he was always\n\nAlan Chambers, Esq.,\nNational Employment Commission,\nJackson Building,\nOttawa.\nalways right - the departmental officials always wrong. Mr. Gentleman was, naturally, disappointed at the refusal of the Department to consider his claims, with the result that he appealed again for reconsideration of his case. The files indicate that a very thorough enquiry was again instituted, in respect to his service with the Department and the reasons for dismissal, but the first decision was in no sense modified.\n\nImmediately following the return to power of the present administration, Mr. Gentleman appealed to the Department, on the grounds that he had been unfairly dealt with. His case was again considered, the facts carefully reviewed, the departmental officials consulted and a decision reached that, in view of all the circumstances, Mr. Gentleman had no claim whatever on the Department. In this connection I note that Mr. Gawthrop visited the Department of Indian Affairs on July 24th, last, and interviewed the Departmental Solicitor and the Chief of the Schools Branch on behalf of Mr. Gentleman. At that time, Mr. Gawthrop received a full explanation of Mr. Gentleman's case and the reasons that led to his dismissal.\n\nThe fourth paragraph of Mr. Gawthrop's letter, in which he refers to certain physical disabilities from which Mr. Gentleman is now suffering, is, in my judgment, worthy of comment. It is significant that Mr. Gentleman, when writing to the Department in August, 1925, from Leigh on Sea, Essex, England, where he was holidaying at that time, intimated: \"I would also say that on reaching England I placed my wife in the hands of one of the best medical men in London, who is attached to two of the largest missionary societies, and was informed that she had a very weak heart and required at least three months' rest.\"\n\nI think it is only fair to the Department and to the departmental officials that these facts should be known to you. May I further suggest that, if the time at your disposal will enable you to do so, you should call\n\n- at the\nat the Schools Branch and glance over the file on this case. If you do this, I feel confident you will be satisfied that the Department did not at any time treat this man harshly or unfairly but that he was kept in charge of schools for a number of years, largely on compassionate grounds, despite frequent requests for his dismissal from the field officials.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

Mar. 15.\nOttawa, March 22, 1937.\n\nDear Senator Green:\n\nI am directed by the Minister to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 15th, in which you ask for additional information with respect to the claim of Mr. P. H. Gentleman, that he had spent thousands of dollars during his period of service with the Department of Indian Affairs, on the understanding that these expenditures were made with the consent and approval of the Superintendent General and that he (Mr. Gentleman) would be reimbursed for the expenditures he had made.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that, immediately following a notice of dismissal received by Mr. Gentleman from the Department, early in June, 1933, he communicated with the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs in a letter dated June 6th, 1933. In this letter, Mr. Gentleman intimated that, over a period of years, he had spent \"$818 in moving expenses; $185 in other travelling expenses; $337 on repairs to departmental buildings; $442 on Christmas tree prizes; $127 in sports day prizes; $225 in kindergarten school material and music supplies; $407 on relief to destitute Indians (not including free meals and things given from his house for sick women and children); and various odd amounts totalling $664\".\n\nMr. Gentleman did not claim, in this letter, that these expenditures had been authorized by the Department, nor did he claim that he should be reimbursed for the expenditures made by him. His contention was that, in view of his generosity, he had a strong claim on the Government\n\nHonourable R. F. Green,\nThe Senate,\nOttawa, Ont.\nfor a superannuation allowance.\n\nThe Department has never at any time made an allowance to Indian day school teachers in lieu of travelling expenses. Supplies for Indian day schools are purchased by the Department, after they are authorized by Indian agents. There is not on file in the Department a vestige of evidence to indicate that Mr. Gentleman spent money on the repair of departmental buildings at any time, nor was it necessary that he should do so. Mr. Gentleman has been informed, on a number of occasions, that the two months' salary allowed him at the time of his dismissal is the maximum compensation to which he is entitled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

The departmental files indicate that, if Mr. Gentleman had made any attempt whatever to follow the Inspectors' instructions during the last five years he was employed by the Department, or if he had made even a partial attempt to keep his school clean and in a sanitary condition, he would still be employed as a teacher in an Indian day school.\n\nThis man steadfastly and persistently refused to accept advice from the Provincial School Inspector, the Indian Agent and the departmental Inspector for Ontario. Mr. Gentleman was, naturally, disappointed at the refusal of the Department to recognize his claims, with the result that he appealed\n\nW. R. Tomlinson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthat he appealed again for reconsideration of his case. The files indicate that a very thorough enquiry was again instituted, in respect to his service with the Department and the reasons for his dismissal, but the first decision was in no sense modified.\n\nImmediately following the return to power of the present administration, Mr. Gentleman appealed to the Department on the grounds that he had been unfairly dealt with and that certain promises made to him had been broken. His case was again considered, the facts carefully reviewed, the departmental officials consulted, and a decision reached that, in view of all the circumstances, Mr. Gentleman had no claim whatever on the Department. In this connection I may state that a Mr. Gawthrop, representing Mr. Gentleman, visited the Department of Indian Affairs on July 24th, last, and interviewed the departmental Solicitor and the Chief of the Schools Branch. At that time Mr. Gawthrop received a full explanation of Mr. Gentleman's case and the reasons that led to his dismissal.\n\nI have been unable to discover anything that would indicate that this man has been treated harshly or unfairly by the Department. As a matter of fact, the file indicates that he was kept in charge of schools for a number of years largely on compassionate grounds and in the hope that he would become more interested in his work, despite frequent and persistent requests for his dismissal from the field officials.\n\nIn view of these facts and others that might be submitted, I cannot think of any way whereby this case can be reopened and Mr. Gentleman's claim for work or for an allowance considered at this date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMr. Phelan\n\nWill you kindly write Miss Stead.\n\nW.A.

Gentleman\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nI am returning herewith correspondence attached to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of September 24th. It is somewhat difficult to supply additional information regarding the dismissal of Mr. Gentleman from the French Bay Indian Day School, in view of the large number of memoranda already sent forward with respect to the service of this man with the Department and the reasons for his dismissal.\n\nIt would appear, from the information contained in the second last paragraph of Mr. Gentleman's letter to Mr. Gathrop, that the departmental officials became dissatisfied with this teacher's work as far back as 1915. Mr. Gentleman at that time and since then seems to be obsessed with the thought that the officials, for some reason or other that he does not explain, were prejudiced against him and entered into a conspiracy to have him removed from the school in which he was then teaching. It is altogether likely that the Anglican Church authorities and the departmental officials, when they transferred Mr. Gentleman to an Indian day school in the province of Ontario, did so in the hope that his work under new officials and in new surroundings might prove more satisfactory. The records indicate, however,\nthat, just as soon as he took up his duties in Ontario, the old obsession still remained with him - that the officials were critical of his work, seeking to persecute him and for some reason or other seeking his dismissal. It is perhaps unfortunate that this man clings so tenaciously to imaginary grievances that seem to have multiplied from year to year. It would be too much to hope that any explanation sent forward to him by the Department or made to his friends would tend in any way to change his attitude.\n\nMr. Gentleman was never, in my judgment, qualified to teach in an Indian day school. He was employed, however, at a time when fully qualified teachers were exceedingly difficult to secure. It is just possible that a mistake was made by both the departmental officials and the church authorities in continuing him as a teacher when his unfitness was emphasized from time to time by Indian Agents and by Inspectors responsible for the inspection of his schools. I am inclined to think that he was kept for a number of years largely on compassionate grounds.\n\nDirector.\nNATIONAL EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION\n\nOttawa, October 2, 1937.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. F. H. Gentleman who apparently was for some time a school teacher and employee of the Indian Department. He resides in Victoria, B.C.

In this connection I may say that Mr. Wallace, who was in our employ as a teacher for twenty-three years, was retired on account of ill health in May 1923. He was superannuated under the provisions of the Public Service Retirement Act 1920, as amended in 1921 and 1922. This Act was better known as the Calder Act. Under its provisions it was not required that contributions be made by the person retired.

I understand that this amount compares favorably with the salaries paid in rural \"white\" schools situated comparatively close to the Saugus Reserve. No provision was made in the current year's appropriation for higher salary for the teacher at the French Bay School and it is not possible to favourably consider allowing her an increase.\n\nThe Department is writing to the Indian Agent with reference to the condition of the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.R. Tomlinson, Esq., M.P.,\nPort Elgin,\nOntario.\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that the subject of teaching of music (vocal) in the schools of the Saugeen Reserve may be considered by your department. If so, I would like to be an applicant for the position. I might mention that I hold the music supervisors certificate issued by the Department of Education at Toronto. I am also Organist & Choirmaster in the United Church at Southampton. I was music supervisor in the schools at Galt for 16 years. I am sure that Mr. Alex Edwards, the member for Galt, would be glad to tell you of my work there. I shall be glad to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours Truly,\nJohn L.

Nicol, Esq.,\nSouthampton, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn my work on the Saugesen Reserve, I see a great field of service, which no one has yet entered. The whole generation of young people are growing up without musical training. They have musical ability and many have such a desire for music that they are playing away the organ by ear.\n\nI understand that you have engaged a director of music for the schools of the Big Nation Reserve, at Brantford. I suggest that you explore the possibility of engaging a director of music for the three schools of the Saugesen Reserve.\n\nI have talked this matter over with the three teachers, and they all expressed their hearty approval of the proposition. The rural schools of the Province of Ontario are rapidly being organized under musical directors; and musical festivals are held in the various communities.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6124, File 388-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to teaching music to the pupils attending the schools on the Saugeen Reserve.\n\nNo provision was made in our current year's appropriation for the salary for music teacher and consequently your request cannot receive favourable consideration at the present time.\n\nYou refer in your letter to the appointment of a music teacher on the Six Nations Reserve. This is largely experimental. There happened to be an Indian girl on that Reserve who had graduated from the College of Music and she was willing to accept a comparatively small amount for teaching music at the eleven schools in the Six Nations Agency. In addition the Six Nations Band is providing half her salary from their funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C. W. McKenzie,\nSouthampton, Ont.\nR. W. Mayhew, Esq., M. P.\nVictoria\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBefore the recent by election I wrote to you calling your attention to the fact that my wife and I had been discharged by the late Bennett Government after many years service in the Indian Department, and that the present Government show no disposition to give us any opportunity to answer the charges brought against us.\n\nIn 1905 I was promised promotion and a pension by the late Hon. David Laird, Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, and in 1933 I was dismissed without reason and given a bonus of two months salary, and have only recently been informed that under the Calder Act of 1924 we are not entitled to the pension. Doubtless this is correct.\n\nHowever, every once in awhile one comes across such items in the paper, such as I have clipped this evening, and which I am taking the liberty of enclosing.\n\nIt would appear that these men were appointed to their positions in 1933 at a salary of $10,000 a year and are provided with a pension of $2500 after five years work. I expect too, they were provided with a comfortable office in Ottawa in which to do their work. In contrast to this I started working for the Dominion Government in 1905 at a salary of $300 a year, and my retiring allowance in 1933 was just $180 compelling us to go on relief. Our work too was not in a comfortable office, far from it.\n\nIt does not seem to have occurred to any Government at Ottawa that we have long since past the days when Political activity was rewarded with high salaries and large pensions, while those at the foot of the scale are just cast adrift in their old age. Such customs prevailed I believe in 1838, but it does not seem that official Ottawa has advanced much since.\n\nI trust you will understand that it is only by calling the attention of such things to Members of Parliament that any improvements can be obtained.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD) P. W. GENTLEMAN\nMay 16, 1938\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe enclosed letter from Mr. P. W. Gentleman. This gentleman has been bothering me considerably, personally, and also been writing letters in connection with his release from the Government.\n\nWill you kindly let me know the real reason why this gentleman was let out, or why the promises that he claims have been made, were not fulfilled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. W. Mayhew, M. P.\nEX'D.\n\nJune 6, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Mayhew:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 16 enclosing copy of letter received from Mr. P. W. Gentleman, former teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nWhile Mr. Gentleman did not possess the requisite qualifications for teaching in an Ontario school we employed him as long as his services were considered satisfactory. However, it was decided that it would be in the best interests of the pupils to make a change in the teaching services of this school and we, therefore, dispensed with Mr. Gentleman's services at the end of June, 1933.\n\nTeachers of Indian Day Schools do not contribute to superannuation fund and do not come under its provisions in any manner. The majority of Indian Day School teachers only remain in the work for a comparatively short time. In the few cases where teachers have been employed for several years we allow a gratuity of two months' salary on retirement. This payment was made to Mr. Gentleman at the time he was dismissed in 1933.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nR. W. Mayhew, Esq., M. P.,\nP.O. Box 940,\nVictoria, B.

It is scarcely necessary to state that the existence of an Entrance Class at your school is very gratifying to me and to the officials of this Branch.\n\nIt is my hope that the Entrance pupils will make steady progress and that they will all be successful in passing their tests at the end of the academic year. You might at that time write and let us know what the actual results of the Entrance tests are.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

The children are very musical also the teachers, the inspector Mr. J.M. Game is very anxious they should be given the same opportunity as other rural schools. I am supervisor of music in schools around these districts, and feel it would be a great advantage to the Indian children if they could be given musical instruction as part of their course of study. I have spoken to the Agents, but they don't seem to know much about it, one was going to write the department and let me know but I have had no word from him, would you advise me what your department would do in this matter or send word to the inspector Mr. J.M. Game at Walkerton. Hoping to hear from you soon.\n\nYours Truly,\nGeo. C. Thorne.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your recent letter with reference to teaching music to the Indian pupils attending the Indian day schools on the Saugeen and Cape Croker Reserves.

Thorne,\n356 - 2nd Ave. East,\nOwen Sound, Ont.\nAllenford Ont., Nov. 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a cheque amounting to $74.40 as salary for month of October for teaching in French Bay School on Saugeron Reserve.\n\nSince 2% is deducted, this would amount to $1.60 for Lent tax being deducted from $80.00 which should leave $78.40.\n\nI have a letter from the Dept. stating that I was hired for $80.00 a month so will you kindly look into this matter as I am afraid there is a mistake.\n\nThanking you for a speedy reply, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGladys Eldes.\n\nP.S. If there has been a mistake of $4.00 will you please just send me a cheque for this amount and then I will not need to return this one as I would like to cash it as soon as possible.\nOttawa, November 14, 1940.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant, regarding payment of your salary for October, at $74.40, I have to advise that the following deductions were required to be made:\n\nSalary ........................................... $80.00\nLess 5% for Retirement Fund ... $4.00\n\" 2% National Defence Tax ..... 1.60\n\n$74.40\n\nUnder Order-in-Council No.1/1569, dated April 19, 1940, 5% of the salary of employees appointed to temporary positions since September 1, 1939, is required to be withheld and deposited in the Retirement Fund to be paid upon retirement with interest at 4% per annum.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nMiss Gladys Elder,\nTeacher, French Bay Indian School,\nAllenford, Ont.\n\nEMCL/B\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the French Bay school was closed on March 17th and 18th due to storms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOntario\n\nDear Sir:\nAs teacher of Trend Bay School on the Saugan Reserve, I am coming to you with a request for a raise of Fifty Dollars on my salary.\n\nAt present I receive $44.40 each month which for only nine months of the year leaves me a very low salary for these times.\n\nWill you kindly give this your immediate attention.\n\nYours Truly,\nGladys Elder.\nOttawa, July 29, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to your salary as teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI regret that no provision was made in our current year's appropriation for an increased salary at your school, and consequently favourable consideration cannot be given to your request.\n\nIn connection with the amount which you are paid, I would refer you to official letter of November 14, 1940. You will note from that letter that 5% of your salary is placed in the retirement fund, and when you give up duties as teacher at the Indian day school it will be refunded to you with interest at 4%.\n\nThe deduction of $1.60 monthly is the payment of the National Defence tax, which practically all wage-earners must pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Gladys Elder,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian Day School,\nAllenford, Ont.\nChippewa Hill, Ont. February 2nd, 1943.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF JANUARY\n\nThe health was very good during the month although the weather was very cold and stormy, the schools were closed on account of storms for two days and the Scotch Settlement was closed another three days on account of the teacher, Mr. J.S. Wells, having to report to London for medical examination. There were no deaths or births reposted and no complaints received during the month.\n\nDon Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nJuly 3rd, 1943.\n\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nThe health was very good during the month there was two births and one death reported. The school attendance was very good, the Village and Scotch Settlement schools have very good gardens, the pupils of the French Bay School have their gardens at hom as the school garden usually grows up in weeds during the summer holidays, the other gardens look very good although they were late in planting due to so much rain and shortage of potatoes.\n\nDon Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nWalkerton, May 1st, 1943.\n\nTo the Rural School Secretaries:\n\nThere is a very definite shortage of teachers and this condition will probably continue throughout the period of the war and possibly for some time afterwards. In this Inspectorate at the present time there are 23 married women engaged as teachers. They are all qualified but under normal circumstances would not have returned to the profession. Five School Boards even found it necessary to engage teachers who had been granted Temporary Permits by the Department of Education for one year only. Contracts must not be signed with the latter teachers again before advertising several times for qualified teachers in a newspaper with a more or less province-wide circulation (e.g., The Globe and Mail). If this brings no results consult your local inspector who, if necessary, will recommend that Temporary Permits be granted to suitable persons.\n\nSchool Boards would be well advised not to dispense with the services of teachers who are giving satisfactory service as they are not easily replaced. However, if a contract is to be terminated the Board should notify the teacher to this effect, in writing, before June 1st. When engaging experienced teachers it always advisable to obtain confidential statements from their former inspectors.\n\nInquiries from teachers concerning vacancies come to my office at this time of year but I do not always know which schools require teachers. School Secretaries could frequently be put in touch with prospective teachers more readily if they advised this office promptly of their needs.\n\nIt might be of some assistance when considering the salary of your teacher for 1943-44 to know the present trend of salaries. Below is a list of the average salaries paid to rural teachers in this Inspectorate at the beginning of each school year since 1931.\n\n| Year | Salary |\n|------|--------|\n| 1931 | $915   |\n| 1932 | $614   |\n| 1933 | $664   |\n| 1934 | $625   |\n| 1935 | $601   |\n| 1936 | $623   |\n| 1937 | $654   |\n| 1938 | $704   |\n| 1939 | $753   |\n| 1940 | $768   |\n| 1941 | $837   |\n| 1942 | $955   |\n\nFrom this it is apparent that salaries are definitely on the up-grade. The average for the coming year will probably be $1,000 or over. Several School Boards are now paying $1,100. If a new teacher is required, the earlier the Board advertises the less likelihood there is of difficulty in obtaining the services of one.\n\nA questionnaire concerning your teacher for next year is enclosed. Contract forms will be mailed to each secretary this month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Game, I.P.S.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nParl. Bldg., Ottawa\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAs teacher of French Bay Indian School I take this opportunity of requesting a raise of fifty dollars in my salary for the coming school year.\n\nDue to the increase in living expenses and the fact that I never asked for a raise and didn't get any, I feel that the services I rendered at French Bay are worthy of this raise.\n\nI am enclosing a letter I received from our Inspector which will give you an idea of the amount paid in our Inspectorate. Trusting you will give this matter your serious consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGladys Elder.\n\n(Surgeon Reserve)\n\nIndian Affairs.

I presume that she refers to your school.\n\nPlease let me know if you have offered her a position and if at the time you realized that she was already in our employ.\n\nFor your personal information I may say that Miss Dean formerly taught at the Birtle Residential School and from information that we have received, the Presbyterian Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is operated, were well satisfied when she gave up duties with them.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOctober 1st, 1948.\n\nMr. Don Robertson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\n\nThe following letter has just been received from Miss Barbara Dean, teacher of the French Bay School:\n\n\"I can contain myself no longer re my position here.\n\n\"I know that I can serve more adequately and to better advantage in a residential school so I wish to accept the position offered to me in Brandon School.\n\n\"The living accommodation should be made suitable before employing anyone to teach here.

It is hoped that Miss Dean will continue in charge of the school until at least the end of December.\"\nI have noted particularly Miss Dean's statement that there are not many pupils.

I visited the school different times during the month and found no complaints, except she asked for a stove pipe damper, and elbow for the school and a quart of white paint for the house; this was purchased and delivered to her.\n\nOn the evening of September 29th, Miss Dean came to the Agency Residence and returned the keys of the school and teacher's residence to me stating she was leaving.\n\nDon.

His reply was rather vague & discouraging. He stated that the residence was partly furnished but didn't say what that included. He also said the school was five mile from the highway but didn't give anything further in that line either. By the time I would hear from him again so much time would have elapsed. I feel that I should dismiss the matter and allow you & contact other teachers. I know it is important & have the vacancy filled at once and I would rather not delay you longer.\n\nAlthough I was very interested when I heard of this vacancy I had decided to await further news from the Malpole Island School. I am hoping that my application for that position may be favourably considered in the near future. I have written &\nHi. Stallwood there, at the same time I sent in my application.\n\nI would have liked to be at Chippewa Hill but feel that it is quite a gamble & accept the position without more information. Of the five miles & the highway is closed all winter it would eliminate the possibility of my husband getting to work, and he had planned to find employment near there as soon as we were settled & he had rested a month or so.\n\nI trust that I have not inconvenienced you but I have written promptly & your to Mr. Robertson on Oct. 30th.\n\nThanking you very sincerely for contacting me about this school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBertha H.

Salary will be allowed at the rate of $100 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Gentleman's personal effects are in Western Canada, and he is arranging to ship them by freight to Southampton in your care. In a week or ten days, you should communicate with the freight agent at Southampton, asking him to inform you when these effects have arrived from Selkirk, Man. Upon receipt of notice concerning their arrival, you should make arrangements to accept shipment and arrange for storage either in Southampton or at the teacher's residence. Mr. Gentleman, himself, will reimburse you for your expenses in this connection.

The enclosed is their reply, from which I gather they require $10.34 for this privilege. I have never been behind in these payments, and the old loan mentioned I can take care of in September as the purpose for which this loan was made me in 1925 is returnable this year.\n\nI am making quarterly payments to London, but our expenses this time last year with Owen Sound Hospital, put me back all the year, and I had to manage a loan at the Bank for the September quarter, which I have just settled, and of course I don't want to fall down on the policy.\n\nUnder these circumstances could you make us an advance of $100 on our present quarters salary, or rather have this amount placed to my credit at the Bank of Commerce Southampton by Saturday the 25th, which would enable me to have this payment on hand at Winnipeg by the 29th.\n\nI am not entirely certain about the 30 days grace, but I think this is stated in the policy. The company however are holding the policy on the loan, which was originally $500. The loan interest I paid last year in August in a lump sum.\n\nI hope you will be able to make me an advance. I do not like to ask the Bank for another loan so early. It would cost much less than $10.34 if it becomes necessary, but I want to avoid it if it is possible to do so. Please let me have the attached back again.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nP.W. Eastman\n\nR.T. Ferrier, Esq.\nDept.

It was not quite finished until after my arrival at the Reserve, when the Agent told me he had instructed Henry Ritchie, the Contractor, to have it finished, as I was going to inspect it.\n\nThe teacher was absent from home and the door of the stable was locked, but I had a view of the inside through the window. I measured the dimensions and found them correct, and I made an estimate of the work, which after making what I consider ample allowance for everything, including workmanship, I found to be $102.58. The actual cost paid Ritchie is $118.50\n\nIn this connection, I may state that the Rev. W.B. Danard, in a communication to the Minister last Month, on File 59273/2, states that the Teacher at French Bay told him that he had to beard Henry Ritchie and to furnish the hinges for the doors in order to get it built, and that he got no pay for the same, and also that Ritchie built it as he thought best, it being left to him to do so by the Agent.\n\nOwing to the Teacher's absence, I am unable to verify this, but if it is true, the Agent should have made Ritchie pay for his beard and also the hinges, as the contract price included the whole work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have further to inform you that I did not buy the hinges for the doors as stated in Mr. McLean's letter. I beg to inform you further, that while I did board Henry Ritchie free of any monetary consideration, I was informed by Mr. Ritchie that certain very necessary and indispensable portions of the interior finishing would not be done by him as he could not afford to do them owing to the low figure for which he had taken the contract and were not included in his contract. To get him to do this work which he claimed was beyond his contract I boarded him free & cost, and it was in connection with this work that I purchased a couple of pair of small hinges. I beg to inform you further that I make no claim on the Department for Mr. Ritchie's board. I beg to inform you still further that this complaint to the Department did not come from me, I have yet to write my first complaint to the Indian Department concerning you or any other official of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Wallace\nTeacher French Bay\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge official letter of the 15th inst.

Wallace, Teacher of the School at French Bay, relating to the building of the Stable at that place, and in reply to inform you that Mr. Wallace fully admits the correctness of the representations made to the Department in this matter, insomuch as he states that he boarded Ritchie and bought the hinges, in order to get him to do the work. As the price paid Ritchie for building the Stable was largely in excess of the estimate you gave in the first instance and as the price paid was ample to pay for the proper completion of the work, the Teacher should not have been called upon to supplement the amount. Although Mr. Wallace did not complain to the Department nor ask payment, it is evident, notwithstanding his statements, that he felt aggrieved in the matter and you should have ascertained that everything was satisfactory before you settled with Ritchie.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nS.

Payment would be made from the interest money of the band. Before accepting either of these offers would it be necessary to obtain the sanction of His Excellency the Governor-in-Council?\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nE. L. Newcombe, Esq., K.C.,\nDeputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 28th ultimo -153978- in which you ask for an opinion as to whether under section 36 of the Public Works Act tenders received must be submitted to the Governor-in-Council in cases in which an agent of the department obtains prices for work, verbally or in writing, to be performed on Indian reserves and to be paid out of Indian funds or money not specially voted for that purpose. As a case in point you instance two closets which are required at an Indian school and in connection with which your agent has received two offers from responsible builders to put them up for stated sums.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that in my opinion whenever tenders are invited those received must be submitted to the Governor-in-Council before the contract is awarded, and that, whether the invitation is by advertisement or otherwise.\n\nWhere it is inconvenient to go to Council with tenders and the work comes within the definition of paragraph (c) of section 36 it is competent to the Minister to deal with the case under that paragraph.\n\nIt does not, I think, as a matter of law, make any difference that the payment for the work will be made from the interest money of the band in the instance to which you refer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nActing Deputy Minister of Justice\nOttawa, July 23, 1906.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Minister,\n\nOn March 19 Mr. Agent Scoffield was asked to obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting new closets for the French Bay and Scotch Settlement schools in accordance with the plans and specifications sent him. The Agent submitted the plans to builders and received two offers, one from an Indian of the band for the sum of $131.00, and another offer from the Chippawa Lumber Company for $130.00.\n\nYou will see there is only $1 difference and from the Agent's letter it would appear that he considers the Indian as competent to carry out the work.\n\nAs there was some doubt as to the application of Sec. 36, Chap. 39 An Act respecting the Public Works of Canada Revised Statutes '06 to this case, the Department of Justice was asked for its opinion and on the 11th inst. it replied that it was of opinion whenever tenders are invited those received must be submitted to the Governor in Council before the contract is awarded, whether the invitation is by advertisement or otherwise. In view of this opinion these tenders should be submitted to Council, but I think in the memorandum it would be only fair to state that one of the tenderers is an Indian and that he is competent to perform the work satisfactorily, the difference being so slight I think he should get the preference.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There has not been much rain since before harvest, and the supply of water has gradually got less in a number of wells. At the Scotch settlement there is hardly enough to supply the pupils and teachers family.\n\nAt French Bay School the well has failed to supply a sufficient quantity for three weeks or a month, and the last two weeks the well has been and is dry. The teacher has to carry all the water for the use of his family over a quarter of a mile. He notified me last Saturday that if I did not get a supply of water he would close the school.\n\nI was thinking that if we got a thaw in January the water would again return to the wells, but we are not likely to get a thaw or rain for some time now, and I hardly know what to advise the Dept. to do.\n\nThe new crib that was put in this well in 1935 had to be made about 4\" smaller so that it could go down inside the old crib. If I tried to deepen the well, there would have to be a new crib started from the bottom 4\" smaller than the present one, which would be too small for a man to work inside. The quicksand comes in so rapidly, we cannot deepen the well without cribbing it.\n\nThis leaves\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nThis leaves the present well useless unless we make a drive well of it; that is, drive a perforated pipe until we get a sufficient supply of water. In this way the old well would save us drilling about 24 feet and perhaps get a permanent supply of water. If we dig a new well we will have the same difficulty to contend with that we had before that is digging in quick-sand. I would therefore recommend the Drive well till the Dept advise me in regard to this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be sir your obedient servant,\nJohn Scoffield\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in which you reported the scarcity of water at the points mentioned on the Chippewa Reserve, and in reply I have to request that you will lose no time in reporting what the cost would be of drilling for water in the manner described.\n\nIf the present soft weather has not increased the supply in the wells mentioned and if it is still difficult to obtain drinking water for the children at the Schools, you should arrange to have a supply of water carried to the Schools; provided the children are not able to do the work themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Contents included circulars, etc. Shall follow your instructions to the best of my ability. Have been giving attention to this subject all along.\n\nDoing a little with the Catechismics. Have small ventilating fan. Shall give it full attention as soon as the season will permit of outside exercises.\n\nThe ventilation and the seating of my school-room at French Bay require immediate attention; a number of the seats are broken and I cannot seat all my pupils at times. New and modern seats should be installed as early as possible, single seats. The windows should be weighted so as to be easily raised at the bottom and lowered from the top as no other system could very well be installed here. I am convinced it was owing to the restricted air of my school-room that I fell a prey to Pneumonia on December 8th last. Pupils complain continually of head-ache. Two pupils left the school-room sick and are dead. As it is the school is in winter a pest hole and if not improved I shall, for the sake of my own life, be compelled to seek employment elsewhere. However, I have confidence that the Department will look carefully to improving conditions as I have suggested re ventilation and seating, etc.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJ. Wallace, Teacher\nOttawa, March 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. T. J. Wallace, teacher of the French Bay School, complains of the poor ventilation in the building and I have to ask you to be good enough to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether the windows can be fitted with weights and made to lower from the top. I would also ask you to state how this building is heated as the Department would like to consider the installation of some kind of ventilation system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to state re ventilation in French Bay School that when the building was erected it, and also the other school houses were fitted with weights, and made to lower from the top, but have never worked satisfactory in fact none of them are now working.\n\nA few years ago I had the window casing taken off, new ropes put in, and the weights adjusted, but they did not work for more than six months until they would not work at all.\n\nThe ventilation of the school rooms is of great importance and I am pleased that the matter is being considered by the Dept.\n\nThe school room at French Bay School is heated by wood stoves placed at the end of the rooms near the entrance. The pipe is about 10' from the floor, runs to the other end of the room, where it enters the chimney.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Duffield\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that this ranks among the best of our Ontario schools and if you can suggest any way in which we can improve the ventilation we might arrange to have the work done during the coming summer holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nMAR 24 1911\nARCHITECT.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 9, 1911.\n\nMemorandum\n\nChief Accountant,\n\nReferring to your memo. respecting ventilation of French Bay school, I have to say that I cannot offer any suggestions without either an inspection of the building or a definite plan of same.\n\nWith respect to the windows which will not work. It is possible that they may be made effective by the use of chains or tape instead of ropes, unless the trouble is with the pocket, in that case it might be necessary to make alterations to the frames and pulleys; or possibly what is required is a thin interfering strip.\n\nArchitect.\nSaugeen Indian Reserve\nChippewa Hill, May 6th, 1911.\n\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department, that owing to the large attendance of pupils at this school at present and for some time past I cannot seat comfortably all the pupils. I have seating capacity for 28 pupils, 14 boys and 14 girls. I have on my roll 32 pupils and two or three others who ought to be here. On the Roll I have 17 boys and 15 girls, so you will readily understand my difficulty. My average for the month of April is 28, my average for last week is 30.4.\n\nI also beg to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that in the event of the Department placing new single chairs or new seats of any kind in this school-room a new floor is an absolute necessity. The portion of the floor upon which the chairs and desks would sit is worn out. Originally a pine floor, under the seats where the children's feet rest is worn in places almost through but the pine knots in the floor did not wear, hence the old floor is so uneven that to place chairs and desks with any degree of regularity or solidity, would be practically impossible. More over, in tearing up the old seats, many of which\nare laid down by nails other than screw-nails, the old pine floor will of necessity receive more or less damage generally more. Will the Department pardon me if I offer a suggestion? To my mind, the proper thing to do would be to lay a new hard-wood floor over the entire room on top of the old one provided this is practicable. The room is very cold on wintry days in winter, and hence very uncomfortable and unhealthy for both teacher and pupils. The present floor is a single one and the ventilators (broken) being open renders the floor so cold that the feet are always cold. The double floor would largely remedy this defect. There has been a most excellent hard-wood single floor placed up the centre some few years ago I think probably five years ago.\n\nI am seating the pupils three in a seat at present. This I shall endeavour to get along with until the approaching mid-summer vacation and I hope the Department will then see that new single chairs and desks are installed in order to facilitate my work here and relieve the overcrowding.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. J. Wallace\nTeacher.\nChippawa Hill 9 May 1911\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the report of seating the school at Green Bay.\n\nI would say that an account of being ill, it was impossible for me to forward my report at the proper time.\n\nI enclose herewith a diagram of the plan proposed by Mr. Wallace.\n\nHe wishes to have 34 single seats:\n- 12 of the largest size\n- 14 of the medium size\n- 8 of the smallest size\n\nThe school room inside is 19'6\" x 29'8\"\n\nWe think the enclosed plan is the best division we can make of the space available, hoping it will be satisfactory to the Dept.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Seffield\nAgent.\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant reporting upon the needs of some seats for the French Bay School and also stating that certain repairs are necessary to put the building in good condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Agent will be written to regarding the repairs necessary to put the school in a sanitary and comfortable condition so that the work may be done during the approaching summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. J. Wallace, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFrench Bay Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, May 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 10th, last, in regard to the lack of ventilation in the French Bay school I beg to say that the Department would like you to consult a reliable builder with a view to having the windows fixed so that they will raise and lower properly. It is possible that this might be made effective by the use of chains or tape instead of rope, unless the trouble is with the pocket in which case it might be necessary to make alterations to the frame and pulleys, or it might be that a thin interfering strip is required, but a competent mechanic will no doubt be able to make some suggestions.\n\nAt the same time you should obtain an estimate of the cost of laying a hardwood floor.\n\nIn order to provide further for ventilation the Department thinks it would be well to have two tin, zinc, or galvanized iron pipes of sufficient size to allow air to be changed three times an hour (the ducts being about nine inches by twelve inches) extending on opposite sides from near the floor, connecting below with the class-room and running up through the ceiling beside the chimney, and so placed as to be well heated. If the pipe cannot be so placed, pipes of large diameter (a foot) with revolving cowl on the top of each will prove effective. Openings, with regulating\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nslides, should also be provided in these ducts near the ceiling for use only in warm weather or when the room is overheated. An estimate of the cost of this work should also be obtained.\n\nYou will kindly give this matter your early attention so that authority can be given to have the work done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge thereceipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that 34 single school desks with four rear seats for the French Bay school have been ordered from Mr. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6125, File 388-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nIt also requires each pulls and plates and some half pound weights to properly balance the wash and also new cords. To floor the room would require five hundred and fifty feet (550') of hard wood flooring and put two Yale locks on door of house & Remove all seats and re-seat it would cost fifty five Dollars ($55) and quarter cord floor strips.\n\nFrench Bay school also requires each pulls and plates on all windows.\nten, and I find there is not sufficient weights on to balance the windows. They will require to be fitted also, so as to make them slide up and down easily. Some of the east locks are broken. Seven hundred and twenty feet (720') of hard wood flooring to cover the room. This would cost seventy Dollars ($70.) I would recommend the two ventilating flues at each side of the room extending from twelve inches from the floor through the ceiling the same to be\nmade of galvanized iron about four inches by twelve (4\" x 12\") at the bottom and four by fourteen inches (4\" x 14\") at top end and to have a slide at bottom end to close them when required. Also one ventilator on top of ridge of roof about twelve inches (12\") in diameter and extend above the roof about thirty inches (30\") and to have a hood over the top. This ventilator to have a shut off valve. It can be worked by a rope and pulleys. The rope extending to the floor.\nThere is an opening in the ceiling which the bell rope passes through about fourteen by twenty inches (14\" x 20\"). By means of two pulleys this rope could be brought clear of this opening. The opening to have a trap door with hinges on and also to have a rope attached to the same passing through pulleys and extending down to the floor. This way of ventilating the room would cost about thirty-five dollars ($35.) This opening in the\nceiling is only a waste of heat in cold weather and when open in hot weather would be a benefit. The total cost of all material and labour removing all seats and desks and re-seating the seats to be furnished by the department delivered at the building put together would be one hundred and sixty dollars ($160.) Including wainscoting around the ventilating pipes. Fresh air can easily be obtained from the windows.\nI find in my experience there is no trouble in obtaining fresh air.\n\n[Signature]\nJno.

General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. McPharlin, Assistant Agricultural Representative of the Department, who recently visited the Sauguen Reserves, states that his attention was drawn by you to the condition of the ceiling in the school house at French Bay. About three square feet of the plaster is broken and fallen to the floor and several other parts are cracked and likely to fall at any time.\n\nYou should take the necessary steps to have the ceiling repaired. At any point where the plaster is broken and likely to fall it should be removed and replastered. You should have this work done as cheaply as possible and it should be performed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nMr. McPharlin states that the teacher's house is badly in need of a coat of paint.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to forward a report as to the cost of having the painting done. You should state the quantity of paint that would be required and the cost of the labour in having the painting done. If possible, you should obtain a price from several men competent to do this work and submit the prices received for the consideration of the Department. You should furnish these prices as soon as possible, in order that, if it is decided to have the work done, it can be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nYou may inform the teacher that the bonus is being continued during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. A. Stout, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\n\nAsst.

As metal ceiling is very expensive at the present time, it is possible that it would be much more economical to put the V-jointed sheeting on the ceiling with just as satisfactory results.

I did not figure the inside painting of the school but when I considered the matter I thought that it would be better to have it all done at the same time and then there would not be any repairs for some time now if the Dept. authorizes the expenditure.\n\nI would like to have an answer as soon as possible in order that I could have the work commenced at once if possible.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6125, File 388-5, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nAugust 6, 1920.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nIndian Agent Stout has reported that the French Bay teacher's residence and school house are badly in need of paint outside and in, also a new ceiling, and he was requested to obtain prices for the work and submit the same to the Department.

If this double building was erected now it would cost sixty or eighty dollars at the present rate of the material used.\n\nI presented this bill to the Indian Council at their last sitting. The Council seemed to think that the Department had paid me this bill or pretended to think so. The Council decided to leave it to a Band meeting. Knowing well what a lot of irresponsible fellows at a Band meeting would do I withdrew the bill. The Agent advised me to sell the building. This I refuse to do. I prefer to leave it to the Indians rather than do a shabby trick of that kind.\n\nI also, at my own expense, lined the two feed bins with tin sheeting to save the grain from rodents at an expense of $5.00.\n\nNow I have a proposition to make to the Department viz:\n\nWhen I came here over twenty-three years ago I brought with me a good store. I set\nI own store and used it for years until it was burned out. The department then bought a store which I have been using since. Twice since the department purchased said store I have bought at my own expense new linings for the fire-box. All stone-pipes belong to me.\n\nThe building I erected has been utilized to store the school-garden tools, 5-shovels, 5-hoes, 2 garden-rakes and a watering can. Also to store the storm-windows & storm-door. Here is stored also the extension ladder.\n\nIf this building were not here the department would be under the necessity of providing a building for the safe storage of these things.\n\nIn lieu of this building and losing the feed bins and burning out my own store here will the Department allow me to take this store with me when I leave at the end of June?\n\nIf the department considers my proposition fair and reasonable I ask it to grant it. If not then we will let the matter drop but under no circumstances will I allow the bill to be brought before the Indian Council again as I consider they grossly insulted me by insinuating that the department paid this bill at the time viz October 1908.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.J. Wallace\nSage Creek Agency\nOttawa, May 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing an account for the expenditure incurred by you in the erection of a hen house and driving shed at the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should have forwarded these accounts at the time the work was done, if it was intended that the Department would be called upon to pay the expenditure incurred. We have no information regarding this matter, and you should place your claim with the Indian Agent. The same applies to the question of the stove.

INSPECTOR McCOOL,\ndated September 27th, 1927, on his inspection of the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe walls of the school are much in need of being whitewashed, also, the closets. The whitewash in the closets has fallen and covers the floors pretty well. It should be swept clean out of the closets.\n\nThe cement steps at school entrance are badly broken, no doubt from frost.\nOttawa, October 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the French Bay Indian Day School, states that the walls of the school are much in need of being whitewashed. He says, further, that the whitewash in the closets has fallen down and covered the floors and that it should be swept out. He reports, also, that the cement steps at the school entrance are badly broken.\n\nPlease furnish a report at an early date as to whether you would advise that the walls of the classroom be whitewashed. If so, you should state the approximate cost of having the work done and whether it would be possible to have it performed without interfering with the regular classroom duties. It is thought that the teacher could have the older boys sweep out the closets. If they require whitewashing, I should be pleased to have a report from you relative to the cost, etc. Please state, also, what you would advise be done to repair the cement steps at the school entrance. The Department will expect an early reply regarding these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS.

The fallen whitewash in the closets can easily be swept out. The cement steps which have three sides to the entrance, two of which are chipped on the edges and the third is in as good repair as ever, and the pupils use this side. I took the matter of these steps up with the teacher the last time I visited the school and we both agreed that they could be held over until another year. My reason for doing this is that I am of the private opinion that this school will in a short time be closed as it is situated in the poorest part of the Reserve, and two families, Livingstone Ritchie and Alex Root are talking of buying property down near the Scotch Settlement portion. Mr. Parker on his last visit to the reserve was also of the same opinion.\n\nMr. McCool is apparently of the opinion that work done by the Government does not cost anything and as this Reserve has so many buildings to look after I don't care to spend any unnecessary money, and the schools in question are second to none in this vicinity.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the repairs, etc., which were recommended by the Public School Inspector at the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you consider the whitewashing of the walls and the repairs to the steps can be left over until next year.

C. Parker.\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Parker, who recently visited the Saugeen Agency, states that the French Bay Indian Day School building requires whitewashing.

If this school is to be maintained, a considerable expenditure will be necessary to put it in something like decent condition. The whole place looks like decay and neglect. The inside walls and woodwork need several coats of paint. All the outside woodwork around the windows, doors and belfry, needs painting. The cement steps at the front entrance are broken to pieces and new ones will have to be provided. The two closets are very dilapidated and past all repairing. New ones are badly needed. The chimney needs pointing and some bricks replaced. New wire and posts are needed for the fence enclosing the school grounds and residence. Some of the present posts might be used for the fence at the back end of the lot. The school grounds are very untidy and neglected looking.\n\nThos.

When I came here the number of children attending hardly seemed to justify any expense in connection with this, but their appearance now to be a first school in prospect for some years to come. Last year in August the heavy cows went through the house fence and ruined my parlor. The same applies to the screened approaches to the children closets. I have wired them up several times but there is nothing left to nail to. The school steps also need repairs badly.\n\nP.H. Guttman\n\nI doubt if the small attendance in past years did not do much to have these repairs kept up. The fence posts have done pretty fair but they will have to be renewed.\nOttawa, April 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting the Department to supply fencing for the land around the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to the small attendance, the Department has been seriously considering the question of closing this school at the end of the present academic year, and, under these circumstances, we are not prepared to incur any expenditure at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is not intended that any large expenditure be incurred, but only the work necessary to make the school and residence comfortable during the next school year is to be performed.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a list, in detail, showing the work which you consider urgent and necessary, and an estimate of the cost of the material, labour, etc., in having the repairs carried out.

You may arrange to purchase the shingles, nails, etc., required, obtaining same at the lowest possible price. A good grade of shingles should be obtained. You should employ Indian labour as far as possible in having the work carried out, keeping proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed. Certified accounts, in duplicate, should also be forwarded covering the cost of the shingles and other materials. You should arrange to have the shingling completed at an early date, keeping all expenditure as low as possible, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nThe repapering of the kitchen and the painting of the classroom will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If not, please let me know the name of a competent man.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that you may have the teacher's residence at the French Bay Indian Day School repaired. It is noted that the cost of papering and painting the interior and erecting cement steps will not exceed $86.00. This amount includes both material and labour.\n\nIt is noted, also, that this work will be done by Mr. Robert McVittie.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is regretted that the Department cannot authorize the shingling of the school. You may have some minor repairs made in order that the building may be habitable for another year. The cost of these repairs should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The cover would cost about $4.00 but I cannot give an estimate for the other repairs as I would have to have a plumber from Southampton come out to do the work.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDon.

Latch for boys' water closet door and drain pipe for the urinal. This building is very dirty and the boys have collected there a number of sticks and boards.\n\n\"2. A new down pipe and elbow from the eaves at the rear of the school. Water is now discharged against the foundation and this will ultimately cause a settling with a consequent costly repair job.\n\n\"3. Repairs to the eave trough at the front of the school.\n\n\"4. Brace for metal jacket around stove.\"\n\nAs the above repairs will not involve any large expenditure, you may arrange to have the necessary work done. It is considered that, when you visit the schools, you should ascertain the minor repairs that are required and advise the Department. These matters should not be left to the School Inspector to report.\n\nYou may inform the teacher that supplementary reading books for the junior classes will be sent to her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R.

Matheson, Southampton, Ont. ______________________\n\nfor supplies for the French Bay School ______________________\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 31-1-4, dated October 25th, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nSegeen Agency,\nFrench Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe walls and ceiling of the classroom are in a disgraceful state. The paint on the woodwork has peeled off in streaks. The plaster has fallen down in some places. The metal ceiling is rusting into holes.\n\nThe outside woodwork is in a similar condition.\n\nThe two closets are beyond repair. They have probably done service for the life of the school and should be replaced.\n\nA desk chair for the Teacher is needed, an old broken kitchen chair is in use at present.\n\nThe teacher asks to be supplied with a dozen desk ink wells. Small open bottles are being used and are constantly spilling. Similar wells to those supplied with new desks are what she wants.\n\nA map of Bruce County for classroom work is needed. The School Inspector has criticised neglect in providing each of the three Day Schools in the Agency with this map.\n\nTEACHER'S RESIDENCE.\n\nThe all metal siding is beginning to deteriorate, rust is causing damage and unless painted within a reasonable time the metal will decay beyond repair.\n\nThe inside plaster of the front porch is falling down, about half of it is already gone showing the bare laths.\n\nThe downstairs part - ceilings and walls - are giving way and need painting in the worst way.\n\nThe downstairs room used as a bedroom should have a congoelum rug on the floor. It is of soft boards, badly worn and splintered in places.\n\nThe teacher has to have a car but there is no accommodation for it at the school. The barn which is in fairly good repair could be used as a garage by building a plank entrance. The material is available at the Agency office and a handy Indian could do the job in a day or two at a total cost of $10.00 or less.\n\nThis whole school property in its present condition is not a good example to the Indians of how to take care of their own buildings.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\n1. A desk chair for classroom,\n2. 1 Dozen ink wells\n3. 1 map of Bruce County\n4. 1 Congoelum rug for bedroom floor.\n5. Alterations to barn to accommodate teacher's car.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6125, File 388-5, part 2)\nOttawa, January 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reporting regarding his recent inspection of the French Bay Indian Day School, Inspector McCookin states that the walls, ceiling and woodwork of the classroom require painting, also that the plaster and the metal ceiling should be repaired. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of doing the necessary work in the above regard.\n\nThe Inspector also mentions that new closets are needed. An estimate of the cost of erecting new closets should also be given.\n\nPlease let me know the name of the manufacturer of the desks for which the twelve (12) ink wells are required.\n\nThe teacher asked Mr. McCookin for a map of Bruce County. Owing to their cost, we do not usually supply county maps. You might let me know what maps are at present in this school and their condition.\n\nWith regard to the teacher's residence, Mr. McCookin writes:\n\n\"The all metal siding is beginning to deteriorate, rust is causing damage and unless painted within a reasonable time the metal will decay beyond repair.\n\n\"The inside plaster of the front porch is falling down, about half of it is already gone showing the bare laths.\n\n\"The downstairs part - ceilings and walls - are giving way and need painting in the worst way.\"\n\nPlease submit an estimate of the cost of making the above improvements.\n\nA request was also received from the teacher for repairs to the barn in order that he might use it as a garage. You should inform the teacher that the Department does not provide garages at Indian day schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDon. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-1-5, dated January 30th, regarding repairs to the French Bay Indian Day School and Teacher's Residence.\n\nI beg to say, repairing and re-decorating the classroom would cost about $150.00, the two closets about $25.00 each. The name on the desks is Snider, Waterloo, Ont. The following maps are at present in this school and in very good condition, America, British Isles, Canada, Africa, Asia, Ontario and Europe.\n\nRegarding the teacher's residence, it would cost about $200.00 to repair and re-decorate the interior and paint the metal siding outside, this would include at least two coats of paint.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 12, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, you may arrange for the erection of two new closets at the French Bay Indian Day School. It is noted that these will cost $25.00 each.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, it is considered that this school has sufficient maps.\n\nAn order will be placed with the Government Stationery Office for twelve (12) ink wells.\n\nRegarding the painting and redecorating of the classroom and teacher's residence, you should write again about July 1st, next, at which time the Department will be in a position to decide if funds for the purpose can be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nSchools.\n\nRe: French Bay Indian Day School,\nSaugeen Agency, Ontario.\n\nOn roll, 14; average attendance, 12.\n\nThe interior of the classroom is dingy and neglected looking. Plaster is broken in patches and the woodwork has become discoloured and dirty. If funds can be found, the classroom should be painted and cleaned up during the summer holidays.\n\nThere is an old dilapidated shed, 18'x12', on the school grounds, used as a chicken coop but useless now. I would suggest Agent Robertson be given permission to give it to an Indian to demolish and clean up the debris for the material. It is an eye-sore and useless for any purpose.\n\nThe double doors on the school shed are off. They should be patched and rehung. It looks careless to have them in the shape they are. An Indian could do this little job. The cost would not exceed $10.00. I would recommend Agent Robertson be instructed to have this done.\n\nThe teacher's residence needs redecorating inside and out. Nothing has been done to it for years and it is fast going to decay. It is a metal sheeted building and rust is beginning to show effects, several places the metal is eaten right through. The inside walls and ceilings are badly in need of redecorating.\n\nThe teacher complained that she had not got the school supplies requisitioned for in early September. I was there on the 25th October.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 29, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the French Bay Indian Day School, Inspector McGookin states that there is an old dilapidated shed on the school grounds. He suggests that you arrange with some Indian to demolish it and give him material for his work. This action is approved and you should make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Advice has been received in this office to the effect that the French Bay School is in a very bad state of repair and it has been suggested that practically all of the $300.00 should be spent on this School during the fiscal year.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor report.\n\nC.W. Jackson.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 it was found possible to include an amount of $300.00 only for repairs to the three schools in the Saugeen Agency. It has now been intimated to us that the French Bay School is in such bad state of repair that practically the whole amount should be spent on this school.\n\nI would appreciate your reporting fully regarding the condition of the school and teacher's residence. You might let me know the approximate cost of the repairs required to each. You might also state what it would cost to paint the interior of the teacher's residence. In official letter of November 29 last you were instructed to arrange for demolishing an old shed on the school grounds. Please let me know if this has been done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDon. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of March 22 with reference to repairing the French Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being written and requested to report regarding the repairs that are required. I might add that during the Christmas holidays the interior of the school was painted, Indians being employed to do the work.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6125, File 388-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter NO. 31-1-5, dated March 25th, regarding estimates for the three schools on the Sauguen Agency.\n\nI beg to say, the interior of the French Bay school was re-decorated during the Christmas holidays and is now in good condition, it would cost about $60.00 to paint the outside of the school. Regarding the residence, this house is in bad shape, it is a frame house covered with metal siding, this siding is badly rusted and I do not think it would do any good to paint it as the rust would show through, the interior is also in need of re-decorating, it would cost at least $300.00 to put this residence in good shape. Regarding demolishing an old shed on the grounds I may say that I made arrangements with Ed. Thompson, an Indian, to take this away and repair the stable to be used for a garage, the stable has been fixed up but he is waiting on better weather to remove the shed, this will be done in the near future.\n\nI would like to have the class room at the Scotch settlement school re-decorated this year as it is very dull, this would cost about $75.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant please let me have complete information regarding the metal siding that would be required for the teacher's residence at the French Bay School. Full particulars regarding the size of each piece of siding and the total quantity necessary should be given in order that the matter may be placed before the Purchasing Agent.\n\nYou should also let me know the kind and quantity of paint that will be needed to paint the interior of the teacher's residence.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of the labour required for placing the metal siding on the building and also of painting the interior.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 25th ultimo the Department has only $300.00 available for repairs and improvements at the three schools in the Saugeen Agency. Consequently, the cost of the repairs mentioned above for the French Bay School should be kept within the amount that has been provided. I regret that it is not possible to authorize at the present time the painting of the exterior of the French Bay School nor the interior of the Scotch Settlement School. Regarding the latter you might write again about the middle of July and the matter will receive further consideration at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.
