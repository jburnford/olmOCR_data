A statement of the cost should be given. I may add that the Department is not prepared, owing to the cost involved, to install escapes of the spiral chute type. When you have full information regarding the extension required to the present fire escapes and the cost involved consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out.

The buildings and equipment are in excellent condition. The interior of the school is kept tidy, sanitary and spotlessly clean. The pupils remaining in residence during holidays looked real well, healthy and happy. Six pupils passed entrance this term. Dr. Sheahan reports the health of the school very good.\n\nThe new fire escapes are a great improvement. Fire drill is regularly carried out. Some of the smaller pupils get frightened descending the steps. The backs of the steps are open and look dangerous to them. I would recommend that Agent Godfrey be authorized to purchase sufficient wire netting to cover the back part of the steps. The cost would be very small and it would add to the protection of the pupils.\n\nThe barn has not yet been completed to provide a hay mow and the management is handicapped in having to buy hay in small quantities. I reported upon this last year but lack of funds prevented the work being done. If funds are available it should be done this fall.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector MacGookin, who recently visited the Chapleau Indian Residential School, drew attention to the new fire escapes. He recommends that wire netting be installed at the back of the steps, which are open. He states that the younger pupils are frightened descending the steps. It is considered that, with small expense, wire netting could be installed at the back of the steps, and I have to request that you will arrange with the Principal to have this done as soon as possible. Any expenditure in connection with this work will be paid upon receipt of a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

GODFREY M.A.Q.,\nINDIAN AGENT,\nCHAPLEAU ONTARIO,\n\nDear Mr Godfrey:-\n\nWith further reference to our conversation in connection with the advisability of removing the rainstreaking from the school, I beg to report it is in very bad condition in some places and we should either have it repaired or all removed for as it is it is a menace. Much water runs from the leaks and breaks and forms large icicles in the winter of great weight and size. In addition, now in the summer, it runs down and spoils the walls. I write to see if the Department would agree to pay for a man to remove it. It is too high for the school boys to attempt alone. They could help so that one man only would be required to do the work.\n\nI shall be very glad if you will consult the Department on this matter as I would like it done before I go on my holidays next month.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau Augst 14th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby leave to enclose a communication received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Residential school relative to the cavelostroughing on the main building of the Chapleau Indian school.\n\nI have gone into this matter with the Principal and he as well as myself believe that it would be better if the troughing were removed altogether instead of having it repaired. From personal experience of over thirty-five years in this cold climate I have found that cavestroughing is not a success as the ice forms on them and then backs the water up on the roof causing the roof to leak during the day when the sun is warm enough to melt the ice, and in addition to this it forms ice in the trough and overflows down the side of the building freezing and thawing and causing the stucco to loosen and fall off.\n\nThe cost of repairs would be considerable as the troughs are damaged in many places and would be hard to repair, and the removal of them would cost very little as with the help of a plumber for one day and the assistance of some of the larger boys of the school the old troughs could be removed, and by their removal I believe much of the leaks would be stopped.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School in which it is recommended that the eaves troughing on the main building be entirely removed instead of having it repaired.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of having the eaves troughing removed, provided you consider that the drip from the roof would not injure the foundation of the building. I shall be pleased to have the views of the Principal and yourself regarding this. The services of a plumber for one day may be secured, and with the assistance of one or the larger boys of the school, it should be possible to carry out the work in removing the eaves troughing. The plumber engaged should be on the list to receive consideration. Any expenses will be paid upon receipt from you of a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52\n\nAgent\nSMITH & CHAPPLE, Limited\nDepartment Store\nC.

The Department believes that, if the refills had been secured from this firm, they could have been purchased more reasonably. Please advise why the refills were purchased from Smith & Chapple rather than the Pyrene Manufacturing Co., as instructed in the letter mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your request for recommendations as to how our Fire Escapes could be made more efficient, I would say I have carefully studied the matter. As they are now placed, they are by means of them in from the attic or third floor, where we have no children at all, other than four senior boys who attend the High School, thence to the second floor by an exposed pole to slide down to indoors of the Ground or main floor of the building inside and no connecting escape from there to the ground about twelve feet above the surface of the ground for we have a basement under what I have termed the ground floor, perhaps better designated as the main floor of the building.\n\nMy suggestion would be to drop these existing escapes to a position suitable for access from the second floor which is used for dormitories. By so doing with very little if any additional steps, would provide direct access from the Dormitories. This would entail services of competent labor to detach and attach the escapes in the new positions. The existing escapes would be utilized with the added protection of being wired in on the side and underneath so as to give the children confidence in using them. I feel we would then with small expense have an efficient Fire Escape and would feel great relief in the knowledge we have done our part to make them safe.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau Augst 27th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg leave to refer again to the matter of the Fire Escapes at the Chapleau Indian School, which in their present situation are practically useless, and I have gone into the matter thoroughly with the Rev. Principal and he thinks it me that to lower the escape one story bringing the entrance to them from the rain dormitories and thence to the ground adequate escapes would then be provided, and in addition to lowering the escape place the heavy netting placed on them to protect the smaller children.\n\nI have not gone into the cost of the change but from personal knowledge of the work entailed it would not amount to much as but one skilled mechanic would be required and assisted by the larger boys this work could be done at a minimum of cost, and would supply adequate protection to all the children sleeping in the dormitories.\n\nIf the Department would consider this change which both the Rev. Principal and myself strongly recommend I could if necessary secure a price on the change but the lowering them down would not entail much cost.\n\nMr. McGookin, of the Department looked over these escapes and could explain just their position or by looking up the blue prints of this school you would see how useless these escapes are at present in their present situation.\n\nI am enclosing the Rev' Principals letter to me written after we had looked the matter over.\n\nWaiting your instructions in the matter I beg to remain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School relative to the fire escapes.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of carrying out the recommendation of the Principal, viz., that the existing fire escapes be lowered to a position suitable for access from the second floor, which is used for dormitories. It is noted that this would entail the services of a skilled mechanic to attach the escapes from their present position and lower them in the new position. I would request that you secure a price on making the change, together with an estimate of the cost of having the escapes wired on the side and underneath, and forward same for the consideration of the Department. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau August 31st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge official letter #65-1-5 of August 24th, relative to my mistake in ordering the refills for the fire extinguishers for the Chapleau Indian school, and I can only explain the matter by acknowledging my oversight in ordering them as there were so many articles mentioned in the letter I failed to remember that it had mentioned in the letter that they were to be purchased from the firm at Toronto, and as I was placing the order for the other material at Messrs Smith & Chapple I also ordered this material from them at the same time.\n\nI am very sorry for my mistake, and if you will give me the price that they could have been secured at from the manufacturer I am quite sure if I were to take the matter up with Messrs Smith and Chapple that they would meet their prices plus the freight or possibly within a small percentage of their price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nDear Inspector McGookin:\n\nI am about to go off on a month's vacation.\n\nI had hoped it would be possible to have arranged to have the light at our gateway installed before I left. Have you had a chance to bring the matter before the Department Head? I also desire to report once again we were unable to store all our grain in the barn. It would perhaps be a good time to get the roof raised now, when wages are low and so many men needing work.\n\nI understand things may be a little out of gear in the office for a time succeeding the sudden death of Mr Ferrier.\n\nWith kindest regards I am yours sincerely\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin has drawn attention to your letter to him of the 31st ultimo, regarding the installing of a light at the gateway at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. In this connection, I would request that you forward, through the office of Mr. Agent Godfrey, an estimate of the cost of the wiring and fixtures required in the installation of the light. When this is received, consideration will be given as to whether the expenditure for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nI may add that it would not be possible for the Department to pay the fees charged by the Electric Light Co. for the operation of the light.\n\nRegarding the raising of the roof of the barn, I have to say that we will not have funds this year to provide the expenditure required for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

GODFREY ESQ.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing on your Instruction of this morning I had Mr. Ritchie an expert mechanic come out and look over our needs for the pump and emergency repairs for the Boiler. These he assures me are very necessary. The pump might carry on but not do its work properly and the boiler is positively dangerous if allowed to go much longer.\n\nMr. Ritchie came out and made a very thorough examination and finds we need the following repair parts for the Pump. These are best secured through Mr Geo Fife of Chapleau and are as follows:\n\nI set of 4 Valves and Springs.\nI set of 8 Leathers for the Plunger.\n\nFor Boiler 48 Fire Bricks at $1.00 each 6.00\nI bag of Fire Clay 50lbs at 1.50\nThis can be secured from Mr Pellow at above prices.\n\nMr Ritchie will come himself and bring one competent helper and get any other small repair parts needed and do the work for the sum of Thirty Dollars. He says he can only make a temporary job at present as the weather will not permit the boiler to be cooled off long enough to make a complete job. But this will carry through the winter with safety and the spring will need a complete repair to be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau Dec. 8th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nHaving learned that the pressure pump was not working satisfactorily at the Chapleau Indian school and that it was liable to continue working if not shut off by hand instead of depending on the automatic valves to operate I had a Boiler inspector and mechanic go out to the school and make an examination of the pump and while there had him examine the heating boilers and fire boxes of the low pressure boilers and he reported to me that the pump was in a dangerous condition, and that the fire boxes in the heating plant was in very bad shape, and owing to his report and the condition I authorized him to proceed at once to make the repairs as I was afraid after hearing his report on the condition to delay the work in case there might be an accident.\n\nI am enclosing the Rev. Principal's letter relative to the matter which explains the whole situation, and I hope my action in the ordering of immediate repairs will be approved by the Department owing to its urgency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the repairs required to the pressure pump and heating boilers at the Chapleau Indian Residential School and enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal, stating the work necessary and the cost in motion in having the repairs carried out is approved. Please send accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials supplied and the labour in having the repairs made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n104 Unipower Street,\nGatineau, Quebec, Nov. 25th, 1913.\n\nCentral Board of Religious Education,\nand Jarvis Street.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter dated 16th instant, for some unaccountable reason, reached me this morning.\n\nFrom what I know of the matter, the account is an old one and was brought up in the last days, so nothing was accomplished and the bill at Polyeye.\n\nAlthough you be not so clever, believe the account is a fine one. Yours, however, probably is demanded for some such literature.\n\nI imagine the whole matter with your \"editorial\" speech, and perhaps something like three years ago and if my memory serves me right, then about a little over thirty dollars.\n\nAnd from this point of the conversation at Polyeye, a young woman spoke up and said she had heard of the matter and took it upon herself to investigate the matter and take up the affair. Having no money, having no opportunity, paid nothing.\n\nOut of my own pocket and explained to the officers that I had found the situation in which things financially put in a class of denominations and I have never hesitated to say that there is not any way.\n\nThen we took over the work there, there was a nice little Sunday School with 17 pupils on the roll and two teachers. Within a very short time the whole school broke up and I understand that the literature continued to circulate and that they were kind of let out of the minute matter to the United Church School.\n\nAbout the same thing happened at St. Mary's Church. The Sunday School there went all to pieces. At both places we have reorganized with a membership of about 22 at Polyeye and about 18 at Rogers. In each case however, we are hardly able to take care of our current expenses.\n\nThe congregations though not slackening in numbers have been hit so hard through the closing down of lumbering operations and the laying off of men formerly employed on the railway, and in such shape financially that they are unable to take care of the insurance on the buildings, and that the finances do not bear current expenses. The situation is one of extreme urgency, there being so much to do in order that every center is ministered to our utmost ability as should be seen by our aid, and rather than the work should be hampered through lack of means, I am carrying on at considerable cost to myself.\n\nI am now very excited about the possibility of the church being able to continue its usefulness, but he must take charge by his own means that the church is kept in good repair and his requirements will be met by a worthy man on the part of any minister who has been faithful even as he goes along in a broken ministry.\n\nYou will be able to gather from the above that there is only little possibility of this account ever doing more than spoken in the interest of the congregation on the matter and the cause of God. It is not likely that I am willing to do anything myself.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nRev. Canon G. Prewer,\n104 Drinkwater Street,\nSudbury, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Prewer:\n\nWe have your letter of November 26th, regarding the old account for Foleyet.\n\nWe are very glad indeed that the people of Cogama have paid up their old account and they are now paying for their supplies regularly.\n\nWe notice also, that you paid $10.00 on the old account for Prayer Books, and that we gave a credit at that time for $4.40 from the old account of $14.40, so that that account is straightened up. The other account, however, is for publications which were used in the parish, and while we do not want to press for payment overmuch regarding this, we feel that in all fairness to all the other Sunday Schools, some effort ought to be made at least to pay small amounts on this account.\n\nHoping the time may come when your finances will be in such shape that you can send us some payments,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.B.

Such a thought never for one moment entered my mind. How the account came to be forwarded to you I cannot understand.\n\nEnclosed herewith, you will find two communications from this Board together with a copy of my letter to them, which I felt confident had fully dealt with the matter.\n\nI am forwarding your letter on to the General Board, together with a copy of this letter. It is possible there may be some explanation for its action.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeo.

Canon Prewer, 104 Drinkwater St., Sudbury, your letter to him of December 7th, and his reply to you dated, December 8th.\n\nIn view of the remark made in my letter to you of December 6th that we were not commenting on the propriety of this account, your letter of December 7th to Mr. Prewer is not a surprise to us. We think it is quite proper. We are, however, surprised at his letter of December 8th, and we are wondering if we might trouble your Department further to let us know when this account came first to you. If it is possible to supply us with a copy of the letter which accompanied the account originally, I shall be thankful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.B.

Mr. Prower did not accompany it with a letter.\n\nHe simply sent the statement of the account with a notation stating that he had no objection to the Department paying the account. This statement was forwarded to you with our letter of the 29th ultimo and was returned to us with your letter of the 2nd instant. It was then sent to Rev. Mr. Prower with our letter of the 7th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. B.

GODFREY,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014We had the expert out to adjust our Boiler and Pumps; we found that the Fire Pump was acting strangely and on a complete examination it proved to be an obstruction in the intake water pipe somewhere between the Dam and the School. We think it may be due to some obstruction having lodged on the Intake screen and preventing the water getting into the pipe. The pipe does not supply sufficient water to feed the Fire Pump but does keep the smaller pump supplied to give water to the School.\n\nWe had our man do the best he could to remove the trouble but he could not. Will you therefore please lay the matter before the government and make any suggestions you can as to how this condition may be overcome and the water supply brought up to normal in case of a fire breaking out.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau Dec. 27th, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian school relative to the water supply at the school, and when making the repairs to the pressure pump and tank it was discovered that the water supply while it would supply the needs of the school service it could not supply sufficient to work the Fire pump and this condition leaves the school without fire protection other than the protection afforded from the town a distance of two miles and owing to the urgency of the matter I authorized the securing of a man who did the other work on the boilers and pumps to see what he could do by reversing the pressure or any means he could suggest to try and clear the obstruction from the pipes but he has not succeeded as yet to secure the necessary supply, and if with reasonable efforts if the pipes can not be cleared I would recommend leaving the matter over until the frost goes out in the spring before digging up the water main as there is some 120 or 15 hundred feet of line to lift and at the present time it would be a costly proposition, and we could rely on the Town fire protection in case of fire for the few months when the main could be dug up and cleared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, regarding an obstruction in the intake water pipe, through which the supply of water for the use of the school and for fire purposes is obtained.\n\nIn this connection I would advise that steps be continued in an effort to try and clear the obstruction, which may be occasioned by sediment or other matter having lodged on the intake screen. If it is not possible, after reasonable efforts, to have the pipe cleared, the matter should be left until the frost goes out next spring. In the meantime, it is noted that the school could rely on the town fire protection for a few months, until the water main could be dug up and cleared. The Principal should take extra precautions to see that there is no danger of fire occurring. If it is not possible, at the present time, to remove the obstruction in the pipe, you should write the matter to the Department early next spring, stating what action you would recommend be taken and the approximate cost of carrying out the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A.J. Vail\u2014Principal\n\nT.J. Godfrey Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report a peculiar accident happened on Monday the 13th when we were using the power saw. It gradually slowed down and the engines turned on the carburettor a bit to give a little extra gas. We kept it going more quickly when suddenly it blew the cylinder part of the engine right off the frame. It broke the iron casting of the engine bed and ripped off the bolts holding it to the portable frame.\n\nOn examining the engine I find the following parts have been broken and will have to be replaced:\n\n1. Engine Bed casting, 2 D.A. 125.\n2. Magneto trip T. 37\n3. D.A. Guard, 162.\n4. Trip Rod Guard, 223.\n5. Exhaust valve Spring large one.\n6. Oilier Glass\n\nUnfortunately I cannot give the name or maker of this engine. I only know it was bought of the T.Eaton Co., Toronto through you and the Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa, I think about three years ago.\n\nI can assure you there was no neglect or rough handling of the machine. It was purely an accident while in operation.\n\nI hope this may receive immediate attention as we seriously need the machine to cut our wood for the school use.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau March 21st, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nAttached hereto is a letter I received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian School relative to their Wood Sawing outfit; and upon being notified of the trouble I went out to the school and looked the machine and found it damaged as stated but could not find any apparent cause other than that the Engine backfired and blew the head off the Engine breaking the Engine frame on both sides and more or less damaging the engine.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has asked me to take the matter up with the Department regarding repairs but I can give no estimate of the cost as I have no record or price list of parts of this Engine other than that as stated by the principal and also that it was shipped direct from the T.Eaton co.\n\nWill you kindly advise me whether the Department will stand the cost of the repairs required or whether this would be an account against the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School regarding the repairs required to the wood sawing outfit in use at the school, and stating the broken parts that will require replacement.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds to cover the cost of the repairs required and same should be undertaken by the school authorities from their per capita allowance or other school receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have gone carefully into the question of the usual Spring repair and cleaning work in connection with this school. We shall have to paint and repair in various parts to keep the building in good order. The Laundry Ceiling will require some new metal shingles, we shall have to have the paint and some brushes also some new Lumber for repair from time to time. I estimate we shall need at least the sum of Two Hundred Dollars to meet this outlay. Will you be good enough to ask the Department if they will allow me to spend up to that much and I will render a strict account for all expenditures and keep it within that sum.\n\nI am asking the different merchants to give me estimates on the cost of the various supplies and will be as economical as I can in the buying if allowed to do so.\n\nI am yours very si merely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nChapleau, Ont.,\nMay 2nd, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential school relative to repairs for the school the coming summer.\n\nHe has asked for the sum of $200.00 and I have gone into the matter of necessary repairs such as painting and other repairs and I find that the amount is very conservative if we wish to keep the buildings up to any state of repair, and not allow them to become dilapidated, and I would recommend the amount as asked be allowed for the necessary repairs for this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School requesting that the sum of $200 be authorized to carry out repairs and renovations.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation for the present fiscal year has been considerably reduced, no funds are available to carry out the work mentioned in the Principal's letter.

First we tried to clean it by doing this but it would not work as the refuse in the pipe would not go back through the screen then we cut the pipe and blew it out through the opening and the filth composed of old leaves, grass, rotten wood and such like was very bad and we were very lucky that there was not an epidemic of sickness at the school from this water supply. There is also the matter of the shut off valve which is out of commission and there is no way of shutting off the water and we had much difficulty in getting the pipe connected again with the water flowing but we managed to do so and as the shut off valve is situated cut in the river and some six or eight feet under water we could not remove it or shut it off.\n\nI have secured a new 5\" gate valve and am placing it back from the river and putting in a man hole large enough with 8\" plank to enable a man to get down to the valve so that it can be shut off when required, also putting in a flange joint in the pipe so that the pipe can be cleaned annually of refuse which gets through the screen at the intake, and also installing an overflow from the box to the river for wash out purposes which is easily done as the pipe is on a side hill and less than 10 feet to the face of the sidehill and the cost will not be very great as the labour is done by the school staff except for the services of a plumber to make the connections and the cost of the plank for the box and the Valve and Flange coupling.\n\nAfter cleaning out the pipe we find that only a small stream of water comes through the pipe which proves that the screen is blocked with rust and as it is under water ten feet the services of a Diver will be required to clean it as there is barely water enough going through the pipe to supply the school and not sufficient for fire purposes.\n\nI would recommend that a Diver be sent up from Ottawa and that screen be raised and cleaned and that a length of pipe be placed on the end of the intake with an\nSept. 5, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, advising me of the repairs required to the intake pipe of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, which you state will require the services of a diver.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise that the cost of sending a plumber with diving equipment, step from here would be almost prohibitive, and I would suggest as an alternative that you obtain locally an estimate of the cost of the installation of an entirely new intake pipe, from the shore line as far into the water as is necessary. This would ensure a reliable installation which could be so arranged as to allow for cleaning and inspection from time to time.

Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with Official letter #65-1-5, of Sept 8th, I beg leave to report that I have taken the matter up with the Chapleau Electric Light & Power Co and they object to having their Dam interfered with as the water main passes through the Core Wall or rather beneath the wall and they are afraid that were we to dig beneath the wall that the dam would be greatly damaged & as the Dam is situated on top of a hill I can also see the danger of interfering with it.\n\nI have drawn a rough sketch showing the Dam and also the water main to the school and you will readily see that it is impossible to install a new line without first lowering the water level some eight or ten feet and this the Power Co. will not do at this time of year as their reserve is very small and they are afraid of shortage of water, and the only other solution would be to have a Diver go down remove the old screen then place a longer piece of pipe where the line is marked in Red and then cleaning the old screen or replacing it with a new screen.\n\nThis work would have to be done by the Diver and the principal cost would be his railway fare To and from Ottawa, and the time he was at work as he would not require an assistant as I am personally familiar with Diver Tenders work and could attend him while down as I have had experience with this work owing to my Brother having been a Diver and having worked for him while diving.\n\nI have thought out every possible way of setting this repair aside but owing to the dam & its situation we can work out no other plan except the work to be done by a Diver.\n\nIn cleaning out the pipe it has increased the flow sufficient for domestic purposes but not for fire purposes if the fire hose has to be used as the pump drains the water faster than the supply and creates a vacuum thus there is no pressure but if you think fit it can lay over for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSept. 15, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Schools Branch,\n\nThe Department is advised that some repairs are required to the intake of the water supply system at the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nThe work would consist mainly in the cleaning of the intake pipe, the installation of an additional length of pipe and the replacing of the strainer by a new one. The work would have to be performed by an experienced plumber with a diving apparatus. The supply of water at present is sufficient for domestic purposes, but not as a means of fire protection.\n\nAs it is important that this building be adequately protected, I would recommend that the Indian Agent be asked to inquire as to whether the services of a diver could be obtained at Sudbury or the locality. Otherwise, a diver with necessary equipment will have to be sent from Ottawa. I believe that the services and travelling expenses of a man from here would not exceed $250.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n| DATE | ARTICLES          | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|------|-------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n|      | To Acct.

J. and Sons have been authorized an amount of $100.00.\n\nAs it is important that this work be proceeded with as early as possible, I beg to request, as recommended by the Indian Agent, that a diver who has had experience in this kind of work, be sent from here, with the necessary equipment which can be rented as is usually done.\n\nI personally know a plumber, Mr. Alwyn Leblanc of Bell, who has had many years of experience as a diver, and who is willing to undertake the work at a very reasonable charge, providing he is given all the necessary assistance on the site of the work, which, according to the Indian Agent, would be forthcoming. Mr. Leblanc has done similar work in Pembroke, Bancroft and other places with entire satisfaction, and would be prepared to proceed to Chapleau at a few days' notice. He would be willing to do the work for $10.00 per day plus travelling and living expenses and would look after the renting of the diving apparatus, the renting of which would cost around $2.00 per day from the time it leaves the storeroom to the day of its return.\n\nI estimate that the work could be performed within a week's time, and that the cost would not exceed the amount authorized.\n\nWould you please advise if the employment of Mr. Leblanc would be satisfactory to you, if not give me the name of another diver with the required experience to whom the work could be entrusted.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL OFFICE.\nOctober 17th, 1936.\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nIt has been found necessary to make some repairs to the intake of the water supply system at the Chapleau Residential School, and this work would have to be performed by an experienced plumber with a diving apparatus.\n\nThe Indian agent was asked for information as to whether the services of a diver could be obtained at Sudbury or vicinity. The agent states that it is not possible to secure such services at Sudbury or anywhere in the locality and it will, therefore, be necessary to send a diver from Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing memorandum from Mr. Chene in this connection and I should be glad to have direction as to whether Mr. Alyre LeBlanc or null, que., may be employed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nOctober 21, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 19th ultimo with regard to the repairs required to the intake of the water supply system at the Chapleau Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that a diver, who is also a plumber, will proceed to Chapleau the beginning of next week, with diving suit and equipment, also necessary piping to undertake on behalf of this Department the above mentioned repairs. It is understood that you will supply him with all necessary assistance in order that he might perform his work in an absolutely safe and speedy manner.

You will recall we have one length attached now to each Hydrant but that is so short it would not give us a chance to fight from the outside of the building in case of need.\n\nI shall feel very much more safe if I have this apparatus on hand. I think then we can make a real effort in case of need until the Town apparatus can reach us.\n\nI wish to thank you and through you the Department for sending up the Diver to put our intake pipe in good shape.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School and which will explain the situation relative to the Fire hose question.\n\nAt present there is not sufficient hose to reach outside the building unless taken from the different outlets, and should an emergency arise this would be dangerous, and I would recommend that three more lengths of hose be supplied of fifty feet each, and another nozzle of 3/8\" size so that water could be thrown on top of the building as the nozzles in use are too large an outlet to force the water to the top of the building.\n\nWe were able with the assistance of the Diver Mr. Leblanc to put the water main in such shape that it should never again give any such trouble as it can be lifted now and the intake screen or foot valve cleaned without the necessity of a Diver.\n\nMr. Leblanc found the foot valve more than half buried in the sand on the bottom from not being properly installed but now we have the foot valve about four feet off the bottom and in such shape to allow it to be raised and lowered when necessary.\n\nMr. Leblanc recommended that an air chamber or short length of pipe be placed on the intake close to the pump to allow any air that may accumulate be drawn off as the style of pump used does not work successfully if air reaches it and I am having this done immediately, and will forward all accounts for settlement immediately the work is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nNovember 13, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. PARKER,\n\nPlease arrange for the purchase and delivery of three lengths of Fire Hose, each 50 ft., also nozzle, 3/4\" size, for use at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. The Agent does not state, in his letter hereunder, if couplings and nozzles are required with each length of hose; but, no doubt, some are required in addition to the nozzle of the size mentioned above.\n\nConsiderable fire hose for use at Indian residential schools has been obtained from the Gutta Percha Rubber Company, here. If you phone Mr. P. M. Willing, the manager, he will be able to furnish you with particulars, as there are a number of different grades of hose on the market. However, this is only a suggestion.

If the Department will furnish the necessary blackboards and seats the assembly room could readily be fitted up without other cost. I understand that the Anglican Church is willing to co-operate and that Miss Donald, a graduate of the school and of the Normal School, is ready and willing to begin duties as teacher at any time. I would urge that the necessary blackboard and seats be supplied as soon as possible. If this is done the children will have covered a greater part of the course before they begin the half-day system and their practical training.\n\nAbout 20 ft. of blackboard and 10 seats of medium size are urgently required for the assembly room.\nChapleau April 26th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School relative to necessary repairs to the school.\n\nI also enclose prices for paints Oils, etc., to supply sufficient to give the buildings at least one coat of paint, and in some places two coats as the buildings have had no paint now for two years and are commencing to deteriorate badly for want of being protected by painting.\n\nIn addition to the painting costs I would like to ask for an additional hundred dollars to supply such articles as Lumber, Locks, Door Nobs, Glass, Putty, and many other small articles that should be repaired and put in shape again as many of these articles become lost or broken with the constant use and if not replaced allow the necessary repairs to the buildings to become extensive.\n\nWaiting your instructions in the matter I beg to remain;\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nApril 20, 1934\n\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nREV.

GOODFREY, M.C.,\nINDIAN AGENT,\nCHAPLEAU ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to our conversation the other day in connection with the need for paint to preserve the School Buildings I beg to say I have made out what I consider a very conservative estimate of what it will take in the way of materials to put them in such a condition that they will withstand the weather, on the outside and clean up the interior parts.\n\nI hope respectfully to draw to your attention we were not able to do anything to them last year as no funds were available, and the decreased per capita grant made it impossible to get it there.\n\nIf something is not done soon it will be a much more costly operation in the future to replace the damage done. I think Inspector Looookin, if appealed to will corroborate this statement from his own observation on his last visit.\n\nWe take a pride in trying to keep our buildings in good condition but cannot do so without some help from the Department. We will supply the labor if they will give us the materials to do it with.\n\nI enclose quotations for paint given by the two local firms, and trust the Department will be good enough to let us have what we need to preserve both the appearance and condition of the buildings.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nRev.

There is no outlet for the water which has to be bailed out by hand after each flushin. The Government inspector complains that the boilers are not flushed frequently enough for safety. 225 feet of tile is required to eliminate the condition, placing the tile can be done by the school.

I had a man estimate the amount of lumber required and have secured the best figures I could locally for the material.\n\nIt is as follows:\n5200 feet shiplap #1/2 culls $119.60\n500 = rough lumber #1&2 cull $11.50\n100 pieces 2 x 6 x 12 $27.50\n100 = 2 x 6 x 14 $32.80\n20 = 2 x 4 x 12 $3.52\nTotal $194.42\nLess 2 per cent $3.89\n$190.53\nPlus 6 per cent war tax $11.43\nTotal $201.96\n\nRoofing needed is:\n60 rolls of 5 ply Fibre roofing at $2.80 per roll $168.00\nNails estimated at 3 kegs at 6.50 per keg $11.00\nTotal $179.00\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. A. J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 15, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, stating the quantities of materials required and an estimate of the cost, in connection with raising the roof of the barn at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. It is noted that the total cost for materials, as per your estimate, is $880.00.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will state if you consider it too late in the season to have this work carried out. We have certain funds available, and, if the work could be done satisfactorily during the present fall or winter season, the Department would favourably consider authorising part of the expenditure. You should state, also, how you would propose having the labour performed. Would it be necessary to engage outside help? If so, an estimate of the cost of labour should be given.\n\nIf you believe it is too late to have the work done this fall, we would endeavour to have the funds provided in the Estimates for the next fiscal year, and the work could be held over until next spring. We request, further, that you consult Mr. Agent Godfrey in the matter. Your early reply is requested, and the matter will be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Canon A. J.

Both he and I think it is too late to do the work this Fall.\n\nI have asked him to get in touch with the man who gave me the figures and see if he would be able to supply an estimate as to the cost of the labor in connection with the job in Spring.\n\nI saw Mr. Godfrey yesterday and he said he would do this. I could not quote the date of your letter as he has it with him in his office in Town and I could not get access to it just at present as he was not in.\n\nI thank you for this interest and hope we may at long last be able to have this necessary work done in the Spring.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. A. J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 27, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the purchase of the materials required to raise the roof of the barn at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that both the Indian Agent and yourself believe it is now too late to carry out the work this fall.\n\nThe providing of funds to cover the cost of materials for this work is being noted for the Estimates for the next fiscal year. I am not in a position to state whether this item will be allowed or not. However, I would suggest that you bring the matter to the attention of the Department, through the office of the local Indian Agent, about the middle of April next - after the beginning of the new fiscal year. You should state definitely, at that time, the materials required, the approximate cost and also what outside labour, if any, would be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

On reviewing the account, it is found that it includes an item on January 17th of $1.00 for express. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to secure an express receipt for this amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau February 28th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 19th, # 65-1-5, I herewith beg leave to enclose the necessary express receipt for $1.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont., Indian Agent.\nI would, therefore, again earnestly commend this suggestion to your careful and sympathetic consideration, as I feel confident the school work at many of the schools, such as the one at Chapleau, and the others I have mentioned, cannot be carried on to the best advantage until the additional facilities for vocational training, class-room, and recreational purposes, have been provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, N.S.C.C.\nThe Principal of our Chapleau School has informed me that this school was visited by the Public School Inspector on the 6th inst., and that in his report to your Department, he is again directing attention to the need of an additional class-room, and an additional room for recreation purposes. As the need of these improvements, is, I believe, fully understood by your Department, I sincerely trust some effort may be made to provide them during the coming summer.\n\nAs this is not the only school which stands in need of the very same improvements, may I commend to your careful and sympathetic consideration, the recommendation by our Commission and submitted annually with their list of requirements for the Elkhorn, Onion Lake, Lac la Ronge and other schools, that the additional space required be provided through the erection of a building quite separate from the main school building, with class-room facilities in the upper story, and facilities for vocational training in the basement underneath. The class-room could be separated by folding doors which, when opened, would convert all the class-room space into an assembly room. Facilities for vocational training are essential in our system of Indian education is to fit the pupils for the place they will be expected to take in the modern world, and these facilities can be provided at a minimum of cost in the way suggested. The removal of the class-room to a detached building, would leave space in the main school building for the additional recreational purposes required, and it would also, I venture to think, be a great help in maintaining the health of both staff and pupils.\nOttawa, March 21, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, requesting the erection of a building to provide classroom accommodation and facilities for vocational training, separate from the main school building, at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds available in its Appropriation for the coming fiscal year to erect a separate building for classrooms. Owing to the fact that, during the past three years, there was only a limited amount available for repairs and equipment at residential schools, there are now many demands, and it was not possible to provide the funds required in the erection of a building for classrooms at the residential schools under the auspices of your Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Vale\nPrincipal.\nChapleau April 6th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg leave to submit to the Department requisition for necessary repairs and some new work at the Chapleau Indian school.\n\nFirst there is the matter of the raising of the roof of the barn and estimate of $240.00 has been given but going into this very carefully and taking into consideration the increased cost of material since this estimate was given I feel an additional 20% should be added to this cost.\n\nSecond there is the matter of the necessary painting of all the buildings inside and out which should be done this year, the work to be done by the school staff, and boys.\n\nThird there is the matter of a suitable drain from the Boiler room this was never installed and as the boilers have to be washed out often there is absolutely no way to get rid of the water other than by letting it soak away in the ground through the cement and this is very detrimental to the foundation of the building as well as very unhealthy. I went into this fully with the Inspector Mr. McEachin on his last trip here and he agreed with me that this should be attended too, and we thought possibly we might be able to do it last year with our allowance for repairs but were unable to do so.\n\nThere is also the matter of repairs to the cooking ranges, also the Bake ovens are also in very bad repair through constant use.\n\nThere is also the matter of one dozen Mattresses which should be renewed as the old ones are becoming very badly worn.\n\nI am enclosing for your information the Rev. Principals letters to me which gives fully all requirements which were fully gone into by the Principal and myself before submitting, and I am enclosing tenders on all material required.\n\nWaiting your instructions in the matter I remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nIndian Agent.\nApril 12, 1905.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nIt is proposed to carry out certain repairs and painting at the Indian Residential School at Chapleau, Ont.

To install a drain from the boiler room, at an estimated cost, for material, only, of - 166. It is understood the school staff will perform the labour.\n\nThere is at present no drain from the boiler room and no way to get rid of the water after washing out the boilers, other than by letting it soak away in the ground, through the cement - which is detrimental to the foundation of the building.\n\nMr. T. J. Godfrey, the Indian Agent, forwards the quotations of William MacLeod, a competent builder, of Chapleau, for the supplying of the lumber and other materials required and for the labour in carrying out the work to be undertaken in connection with the raising of the barn roof and the other repairs, to the amount of $460.86.\n\nThe Agent also received quotations for the supplying of the quantity of paint required from the following firms in Chapleau:\n- Smith & Chapleau, Limited,\n- Collins & Batter, Ltd.,\n- E.

He should supply all lumber and other materials required and perform the labour, as per his estimate of the cost, including labour over and above the help that can be given him by the staff and older boys of the school. It is noted that his estimate for material and labour is approximately $49.98, and the entire cost of the work should not exceed, approximately, that figure. The Principal of the school and yourself should inform Mr. McLeod of the work to be undertaken in the raising of the roof of the barn.\n\nConcerning the painting of the interior and exterior of the school building - the work to be done by the school staff and boys - I have to say that you may purchase the paint, shingle stain, oil, etc., from Smith & Chapple Limited, Chapleau, as per their quotation of $64.38 to the Principal, dated March 11th, last, which you forwarded under cover of your letter.\n\nWith reference to the installing of a drain from the boiler room, I have to request that you will obtain prices for the supplying of the quantity of tile pipe required, from Smith & Chapple Limited, Collins & Matters Limited, and E.

You should state, further, how you would recommend the work be carried out and what portion, if any, could be done by the school staff and older boys. The Department would like to have an estimate of the cost of any pipe and any outside labour required in placing the water supply in good condition. Please give this information, if possible. If outside labour is required, could you arrange for same, from persons on the approved list?\n\nPrices are being obtained here for the supplying of twelve mattresses for institution beds, which will be sent the Principal.

Principal, and since asking for these repairs for the Extractor it has gone completely out of commission.\n\nHe is asking for new belting for the machines which has become so badly used that it is hard to carry on and new material should be supplied, also new grate for the Jacket heater and a new steam Gauge for this heater boiler.\n\nHe is also asking for a Duplicating machine for the class room, and has one in view for which he has given a price of $25.00.\n\nI am enclosing the Rev. Principal's letter to me relative to the Duplicating machine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 6, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your two letters of the third instant, with attached communications from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, in which he requests that certain repair parts be supplied for the extractor in the laundry, also new grate for jacket heater and a steam gauge for this heater boiler.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Principal or yourself may order the repair parts required for the extractor, from the Canadian Laundry Company, Toronto. It is considered the Principal could place the order, giving full particulars as to the parts required. He should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, with receipt attached for any express charges. The account should be handed to you, to be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the new belting for the machinery in the laundry and also for the supplying of a fire grate for the jacket heater and a steam gauge for the heater boiler.

The buildings and equipment are in good condition. The interior of the School is well ventilated, tidy and spotlessly clean. The pupils remaining in school for the holidays look happy, neat, and well cared for. Dr. Sheehan reports the health condition in the School very good.\n\nThe recently finished barn is a great improvement to the appearance of the School property, and provides much needed accommodation for feed, etc.\n\nThe stucco on the front walls of the School has cracked badly, the severe winter frosts are damaging a larger area each year. It would be well spent money to have repairs made before the winter sets in. A cement wash has been suggested at a cost of $475.00 for a guaranteed job.\n\nThos. McCookin\n(Signed)\nInspector.\n\nA.

(a) The Four Imperial Extinguishers have been recharged with Sodium and Sulphuric Acid and are in good working order.\n(b) Four Thermene Chemical recharges are required to recharge the Four Thermene Fire Extinguishers.\n\n2. Out of the eight Hand Pumps (Johns-Manville Type only two are in a dependable operating condition.\nFive out of the remaining six have pumps that will not function; both plungers and valves are corroded and deteriorated. One plunger rod is broken.\n\nAll six have their nozzles and nozzle mechanisms corroded. They are either stuck or plugged. One leaks when turned off. Two of the containers have the extinguishing liquid concealed in them. One container is broken inside.\n\nThe threads at the opening of three containers are corroded so that the pumps will not screw into place.\nChapleau August 25th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to report that while making an inspection of the Fire Fighting apparatus at the Chapleau residential school a few days ago I found the fire extinguishers in a very bad state of repair being so badly corroded that they are practically beyond repair and the cost of repairs would be far too great to be worth while, and I would beg leave to recommend the six new extinguishers as asked by the Rev.

I have examined it and find the wooden part is so far gone that it would not hold new pieces if we inserted them.\n\nWe shall need a complete new machine, in so far as the actual washer is concerned. The iron work and rotor are in good condition with the exception of the outlet valve. That leaks badly and ought to be replaced. We have at different times tried to get it repaired but never succeeded in this.\n\nOur washer at present is of the Glahe washer type size, 36\" x 54\" made of wood. That is the cylinder size. We need also the outer casing for it has been soft and repaired until it is now past that. It is made by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., 47-79 Sterling Road Toronto Ontario.\n\nWhile Inspector McCook was here he suggested we ought to have a metal type. We should be very glad to have either but would prefer the metal type as being more permanent.\n\nMay I also report we need a new sewing machine for the Instruction room. The present one is badly out of repair and worn out. It is of the Singer Type.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nChapleau Augst 25th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nWhile making an inspection of the school equipment at the Chapleau Residential school recently I found the Power washer in such a state of disrepair that the machine is simply useless as both the Drum and casing being of wooden structure and so badly decayed that they are beyond repair; the only parts of the machine that would be of any use is the metal parts of the machine and were new wooden parts supplied the cost would be high as it would be necessary to send the machine to the factory to have it rebuilt, and I would strongly recommend that a complete new metal machine be supplied, the motor which is under repair at the present time will be in first class shape to carry on, but a new Washer is urgently required.\n\nI am enclosing the Rev.

It is noted that both the drum and the casing are so badly decayed that they are beyond repair and that the Principal and you recommend the supplying of a new metal washer.\n\nIn this connection I would refer to your letter of the 8th instant, forwarding a quotation for the supplying of an ironer. As our funds are extremely limited and no special provision was made to supply laundry equipment, it will not be possible to furnish both the washer and the ironer this year. I would request that you take up the matter with the Principal and advise the Department which of these machines is the more urgent. Consideration will then be given to placing the order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nA. D.

I have had men examine the line to try to secure information as to why this line gives away. No one seems to be able to explain why it breaks. It is the tremendous pressure on top of the pipe line forcing the pipe down until the joints give away as there is considerable weight of sand over the pipe & the pipe being laid along the side of a hill it apparently seems to slip then the joints give away.\n\nI propose building bents under the bad section then filling in with cinders so that there will be less weight on the line; I can secure cinders from the Railway at no cost only the hauling which can be done by truck, and I believe this will overcome the trouble if not I am at a loss to know what to do.\n\nI will have the repairs carried out at little cost as possible but an experienced man will be required to repair the pipe the other work can be done at by the older boys at the school except the cost of the truck.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the water main at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Godfrey, your Agent at Chapleau, all of which material has been gone over very carefully by ourselves.\n\nChecking over our records, we find that on December 1st, 1920, we sold your Department for the account of this Residential School at Chapleau, one 36\" x 48\" Globe Wood Washer in every way similar (except for improvements naturally taking place since) to that which we sold you recently, but the washer No.1215 M 7104 was arranged, along with other equipment, into what is known as \"a Group Drive\" of machines embodying supports, hangars, pulleys, belts, motor, etc. This was almost sixteen years ago.\n\nYour Requisition Form No.221 dated Ottawa, September 30th, 1936, Req.No. 319, asked us to quote one \"1 wooden washer,\" 36\"x48\", without motor, belt driven of the type as manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. of Toronto; cuts and specifications should be submitted on the washer on which you are quoting.\n\nWith our quotation made on your original Requisition Form No.221, we attached cut and specification D-5, similar to the one attached hereto, and drawing your attention to the fact that the header of the machine would be of the end type instead of the elevated type as shown.\n\nYour subsequent Order No.2382, dated October 15th, 1936, awarding us this Contract, was filled as requested and as quoted and as ordered, shipment of the machine ultimately having been made on November 19th, 1936.\n\nIt is quite evident now, but nothing had been mentioned to us previously, to the effect that this washer was to take place of a similar machine, but \"group driven\" which had been furnished sixteen years previously.\n1-tie rod,\n1-drive shaft,\n4-special studs,\n36-screws, cups or dowel pins.\n\nThe total cost of the above material would be approximately $138.00 f.o.b.\nour factory, Toronto, Sales Tax included.\n\nThe factory expense of operating this change on your washer would be on a time\nand material basis and would have to be charged over and above the cost of the\nparts.\n\nShould you have at Chapleau, Group Drive parts which used to belong to the pre-\nvious washer, some of which we could undoubtedly use now on this machine, it\nwould be to the Department's advantage to let us have them along with the mach-\nine, if you decide to send it back here for refitting, as a credit would be\nallowed to you for them in the form of proportional reductions from the total\nprice of $138.00 quoted you above for new parts necessary.\n\nIt therefore evidently follows that, if you had all the necessary parts man-\naged to effect this change, this charge of $138.00 would disappear, but, as a\nfew of them will undoubtedly be missing, the best way to do would be to send\nall the old parts here, with the washer, and we would make the selection of\nsuitable and non-suitable parts, allowing deductions for all parts used.\n\nIn conclusion, we condense this by stating that:\n\n1st.- You may have the machine shipped back here with old parts formerly belong-\ning to the worn out machine and reshipped to Chapleau outfitted for transport-\nation costs of approximately $45.00 to $60.00 here and back, you purchase the\nnew parts necessary, amounting to approximately $138.00 sales tax included, from\nwhich amount we deduct the cost of old usable parts, and we charge you the\nbare cost of time and material used here in our shop, for about two or three\ndays to effect this change.\n\n2nd.- Or, you order the new parts at $138.00; send us order for mechanic to\nproceed to Chapleau on a time, material, travelling and hotel expense basis, to\ndo this work, no deduction being then allowable for return of old parts or of\nnew ones if they are not wanted, and you also pay the transportation charges\nof about $3.00 or $10.00 for to ship these new parts to Chapleau by freight.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nThe Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Limited.\n\nSales Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.G.,\noo-PCM\nSGD\nDecember 1st, 1936.\n\nMr. A.P. MacKenzie, Sec'y.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our letter of yesterday, there are two different ways in which the washer recently shipped to Chapleau can be made to fit in the Group Drive that you have at this school, and they are:\n\n1st: To ship this machine back here and have our factory fit it with the necessary parts, including those that you now have at Chapleau, to make this machine suitable to be incorporated in your present Group Drive, final connections and attachment only remaining to be done by your mechanic at Chapleau.\n\n2nd: To order the necessary parts to make the change, have them shipped to Chapleau from our factory here, and, once they have arrived, have order issued to have one of our mechanics go to Chapleau from Toronto and do this work, as it requires the services of an experienced mechanic to perform this work. You should figure one day travelling to Chapleau, two days' work at Chapleau and one day's travelling back to Toronto; man's wages or labour at $10.00 per day plus railroad fares and hotel expenses.\n\nThe cost of shipping the machines back to factory and back again to Chapleau would be approximately $45.00 to $50.00 for transportation charges only.\n\nHere is a list of the parts required to change this machine suitable to be driven in your present group drives:\n\n- Support bracket, motor side,\n- Motor support bracket,\n- Motor support bracket,\n- Bracket for Belt Mto.Dr.,\n- Caps for brackets,\n- Switch bracket,\n- Motor bracket,\n- Locking clamps,\n- Gear lock bracket,\n- Gear cover bracket,\n- Motor plate,\n- Motor pulley,\n- Transmission pulley,\n- Header pulley,\n- 28\" pulley,\n- Gear lock,\n- Shaft for gear lock,\n- Gear lock handle,\n- L.H. drive frame,\n- Set screws,\nforwarded. If not, would it be possible to obtain the services of a man competent to do the work in Chapleau?\n\nFurther, I have to request that you will state the size of the extractor in use, the horse power of the motor used in operating the laundry equipment and, if possible, submit a sketch of the set-up of the laundry equipment. Please give this matter prompt attention and advise the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn checking our records, we find that the machine now supplied was in every way similar to the washer supplied the school in December, 1920.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nOttawa, December 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the Globe wood washer supplied for use at the Chapleau Indian Residential School and the fixtures that will be required to connect up with the group drive of the other laundry equipment, I have to request that you will state, if possible, the extra parts that will be required to change this machine in order to make it suitable to be driven in the present group drive of the laundry equipment.\n\nThe following is a list of the parts that may be required:\n\n- Support bracket, meter side,\n- R.H. Motor support bracket,\n- L.H. Motor support bracket,\n- Bracket for Belt Mto. Dr.,\n- Caps for brackets,\n- Switch bracket,\n- Motor bracket,\n- Condensate clamps,\n- Gear lock bracket,\n- Gear cover bracket,\n- Tie rod,\n- Drive shaft,\n- Special studs,\n- Screws, caps or dowel pins.\n\nPlease state, also, if there is a member on the staff who would be able to install the parts required, if they are forwarded.\n\nT. J. Geoffrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nTORONTO, ONTARIO, December 4th, 1936.\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie, Sec'y.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding, through yourself, to Mr. Sutherland with whom I personally discussed the matter of washer and drive equipment in Tuesday, the 3rd.\n\nOur plan No.374, as per copy attached, together with the requisition in our files shows that the equipment furnished was a 36\"x54\" washer and a 20\" extractor, both belt driven types and group driven from the motor and transmission equipment fitted to the washer.\n\nAccordingly, there should be enough material and proper driving equipment on the present washer with which to fit the new machine, and the equipment in question should consist of the list outlined in our letter of December 1st.\n\nOur final recommendation is therefore is that if your people at Chapleau feel that they are not capable of attaching this driving equipment on to the new washer, then you issue an order to have us send one of our experienced mechanics to do this work for them, this to be done on a time, material and travel and hotel expense basis. Under these circumstances, if there was any material missing, he would know it immediately and he would have us despatch same to him on the job and we would notify you accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nThe Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSGD/ABO.\nPPN\nSGD\nI beg leave to acknowledge receipt of Official letter No.65-1-5, of December 5th, in connection with the Globe wood washer supplied for use at the Chapleau Indian Residential School, and to report that I secured the assistance of an Engineer to again look over the equipment with me and we have I believe arrived at a way that the washer supplied can be connected up without having to dismantle the new machine and save considerable cost as to use the new washer and install it in the same way as the old one it would be necessary to take down the washer completely to install the new parts necessary to carry the group drive equipment of the old machine, and as there is no one in this community capable of doing this kind of work it would be necessary to have a man sent from the factory.\n\nthat we remove the old groups drive equipment a couple of feet then place the new washer directly in front of this equipment using longer belts, and by doing this very little new equipment will be required just the belting and anchor bolts for securing equipment to the concrete, and the only difficulty there will be or disadvantage will be the belts taken up, but there is sufficient room to do this still have plenty of room around the machine.\n\nI am enclosing a rough sketch showing we propose installing the machine, and the cost be much less and a suitable man can be secured here at Chapleau to make this change, and the belting bolts secured here.\n\nIf this proposal is satisfactory and meet with your approval kindly advise and I will proceed with the installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the alterations required to the Globe wood washer supplied for use at the Chapleau Indian Residential School in order that it can be installed and satisfactorily operated. I have, also, the sketch which you enclosed showing how it is proposed to install the machine.\n\nI note that you obtained the assistance of an engineer, who has suggested that the new washer be placed directly in front of the old washer which is to be removed and that, by using longer bolts, little new equipment would be required. The Department will approve of you arranging with a suitable man, whose services you state can be secured in Chapleau, to make the change and you may purchase the quantity of extra bolting and bolts to secure the equipment to the cement. Should it be necessary to install any guard railing or other device around the washer in order to prevent any of the persons operating the machine incurring danger, you should also see that this is done. Please keep all costs as low as possible and, when the washer is installed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of installing the machine and the new parts required and, at the same time, you should submit the account of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Limited in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the washer.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of satisfactorily installing the washer in your hands with the request that you will see that the work is carried out as soon as possible and it is hoped that, as a result of carrying out the suggestions made by yourself and the engineer, the washer can be satisfactorily installed and operated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nOttawa, December 15, 1936.\n\nGentlemen,-\n\nI have your Mr. Dabner's letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the alterations required to the washer supplied by your firm for use at the Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont., in order that it can be group driven. In this connection, I have to say that our local Indian Agent at Chapleau now reports that he secured the assistance of an engineer and arrived at a solution of the manner in which to connect up the washer. He states as follows:\n\n\"The arrangement the engineer suggested was that we remove the old washer complete from the group drive equipment and then set back this part couple of feet than place the new washer directly in front of this equipment using longer belts, and by doing this very little new equipment will be required, just the belting and anchor bolts for securing equipment to the cement; and the only difficulty there will be or disadvantage will be the extra room taken up, but there is sufficient room to do this and still have plenty of room around the machine.\"\n\nWe are instructing our Agent to make the arrangements as mentioned. He states that he can obtain the services of a suitable man in Chapleau to make the change and that the belting and bolts can be secured there. It is hoped, therefore, that it will not be necessary to take up the matter with you any further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nThe Canadian Laundry Machinery Co.

August 14-1937\n\nREV. A. J. VALE Principal\n\nT.J. GODFREY ESQ.,\nINDIAN AGENT\nCHAPELLE ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you the flange on the water intake pipe in the dam that supplies water for the school is broken off completely.\n\nWhen lifting the pipe for the Fire Brigade to clean the pipe, the Tripod that kept the pipe off the bottom got misplaced by coming apart at the place where it was joined.\n\nThe boys dove down into the water the other day and got it up so we repaired it and today tried to put it back. We had left a rope tied to the pipe to make it easy to get up again. When we raised the pipe today we found it was completely off. I told the men to pull it ashore to see what the trouble was and found as reported above the flange had broken off. There were only two bolts in the flange and the break took place in each case just at the bolts.\n\nI am sending the broken flange in so you can get another to replace it. I fear we cannot make the repair under the water. I suppose it will mean getting the DIVER again. In the meantime we shall have to go on using the water without a sleeve covering over the end of the pipe and take a chance on not getting dirt in it.\n\nI shall be glad to have your advice in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to report that the intake pipe which supplies water to the Chapleau Indian Residential School has broken apart, and that it will be necessary to have Diver and equipment to make the connection where being about ten feet of water over this intake pipe.\n\nThere was difficulty with this intake pipe in 1933 it became blocked allowing very little water to be secured through the pipe and on October 26th, 1933 the Department sent Diver Leblanc from Ottawa to make repairs and the repairs have been satisfactory since that time until July 26th when having the Chapleau Fire Engine & Fire Department blow out the Intake pipe which they kindly do once a year & when raising the pipe to clean the foot valve the pipe came disconnected displacing the Tripod which holds the Pipe off the bed of the river, and now the pipe is lying on the bottom with no screening or foot valve on the open pipe to prevent sediment or dirt blocking the pipe and the situation is very dangerous as there is a great quantity of refuse floating in the river where the intake lies.\n\nOttawa is the only place I believe that Diver and his equipment can be secured at the present time as there is no Divers located near this District.\n\nIt will be necessary to have him bring a 3\" Flange Coupling and a 3\" Elbo to make the connection anything else necessary to make the repairs can be purchased locally.\n\nThe repairs are very urgent as blocking of the pipe would be serious as it would be hard to clear as there is over 1000 feet of pipe from River to the School.\n\nI am enclosing the Rev. Principals letter to me and I have looked over the situation and find it impossible to make the repairs without assistance of Diver & Equipment.\n\nThe Secretary, Your obedient servant,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTimian Agent.\nOttawa, Ont.,\nAugust 15th, 1937.\n\nMr. Killin,\n\nReferring to Mr. Yardle's memorandum herewith dealing with the question of repairs required to the water supply system at the Indian Residential School at Chapleau, Ontario, I would advise that similar work was performed at the instance of the above mentioned system in the fall of 1936 by a plumber, Mr. Alphonse Leblanc, of Hull, Quebec, who is a reliable diver and has performed satisfactorily several duties for the Indian Affairs Branch in the past years under my direction.\n\nIn the present instance, I would again recommend that the services of this plumber be engaged to carry out the necessary repairs which are considered urgent, there being no diver in the vicinity of Chapleau.\n\nI believe that we could obtain the necessary diving equipment from the Department of Public Works here as was done in the previous season. If not, we would have to rent the apparatus from a firm in Montreal.\n\nIt would be understood by Mr. Leblanc that his wages and other expenses would not exceed those allowed him in 1936, that is; $10.00 per day plus travelling and living expenses.\n\nIf you approve of this arrangement, I could get in touch with Mr. Leblanc at a day's notice.\n\nEngineer.\nSTATEMENT OF COST OF REPAIRS MADE TO\nWATER PIPE LINK CHAPELON INDIAN\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN\n1935.\n\nTravelling expenses.......................... $11.70\nReturn ticket Ottawa to Chapleau............. $30.95\nBerth - both ways.................................. 7.70\nExpress on diving apparatus, plastic cement,\noil, etc., in connection with diving apparatus $4.09\n6\u00bd days work at $10.00 per day.................. $65.00\nAssistant - 2 days at $3.50 per day.............. $7.00\nMaterials required................................. $1.00\n\nTotal.................................................. $175.09\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to refer to my letter to Department of the 14th, inst., relative to the intake water main at the Chapleau Indian school, and to ask what action is being taken as the condition of the water supply is very serious matter owing to the position the pipe lies on the bottom of the river where all the sediment above the dam gathers and this condition and the use of water drawn off with no filtering plant is very liable to be dangerous to the health of those using the water, and I have asked the Principal to have all drinking water boiled before using.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau August 25th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to Official letter No. 65-I-5, of August 8th, I beg leave to enclose list of requirements and repairs to be carried out at the Chapleau Indian School for this year.\n\nThere is also the matter of the repairs to the water supply main which will no doubt be a heavy expenditure but which has not been included in the expenditures.\n\nRegret the delay in getting this information, but as the Rev.

LeBlanc, Plumbing Contractor of Hull, authorizing certain repairs to the water supply system at the Indian Residential School at Chapleau, Ontario, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe repairs carried out consisted mainly in the replacing of the three inch flanged union at the intake pipe, which was located at a depth of ten feet in the lake - which had been broken. The work was performed as speedily as possible with the assistance of Mr. Godfrey, the Indian Agent, and the Engineer in charge of the heating, plumbing and water supply system at the school.\n\nThe diving apparatus used was borrowed by us from the Federal Department of Public Works here and shipped to Chapleau and back by freight. It was returned to the storehouse by Mr. LeBlanc in the same condition as when taken away.\n\nThe whole water supply system of the School was carefully tested and left in a good working order before Mr. LeBlanc went away. The cost of the aforementioned inspection and repairs performed by Mr. LeBlanc may be given as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Wages to LeBlanc                    | $63.75 |\n| Materials, fittings, etc.            | $8.00  |\n| Travelling and other miscellaneous expenses as per accompanying detailed statement | $21.15 |\n\n$152.90\n\nI might say that there will be, in addition to the above, a few small accounts to come for expenditures incurred by Indian Agent Godfrey in connection with this work. I presume that they will be paid directly by the Indian Affairs Branch, where they will be sent.\n\nAs Mr. LeBlanc arrived at Chapleau before delivery of the diving equipment, tools, etc., the Rev. Principal Canoe Yale took advantage of his visit to have him make an inspection of the steam heating and plumbing system at the School which were defective or in need of improvement.\n\nS. S.

It leaks very badly and requires a complete overhaul. The walls need to be replastered with new roofing, the laundry roof requires a coating of tar and gravel. This will make it practically as good as new but it leaks very badly as it is.\n\nThere is considerable of the stucco on the building to be replaced as well as much of the water table which will have to be replaced to place the building in good repair.

My reason for this is the fact that I recall your saying they ought to be made early. I happen to know this would be a convenient time for the contractor as he has just finished another job and would be free to undertake our work at once. This would be a very great help to me as I am anxious to get the other work of painting and whitewashing done while we have the hopes of the school free to do it. You will see it would be foolish of me to undertake this work until the other is done.\n\nThe cleaning work if done ahead of the other work will have to be done over again and I would like, if possible, to avoid this.\n\nI am pleased to be able to report the work of the dentist is going along nicely also the work in connection with the need for glasses to aid the sight of five of the children.\n\nI am, Yours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.J.

Then you very kindly advised me to try and see what could be done in the way of getting a used outfit. I tried but could not find a suitable one.\n\nI have now gone thoroughly into the matter, and have a scheme approved by the Indian Agent, after consulting the best experts here, whereby we can still use a spare motor we have on hand.\n\nIf you will permit him to expend not more than sixty dollar we can have connection made to our Electric System and install this motor to run the saw we have on hand.\n\nI trust you may be able to allow us this amount and so overcome our need for a new outfit next year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nChapleau November 29th, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School relative to a Power Motor for cutting wood at the School.\n\nThe use of the Spare Motor which they have on hand at the school will do the work nicely, but the cost of putting in the extra wiring and switch box will entail some costs and the Engineer of the Power company here advizes me that this can be done at a cost slightly less than $60.00 and I would like to reccomend that this work be done, and by using this motor considerable costs would be saved when the cost of a new machine for the sawing machine is considered. At the present time they have no machine to cut wood and it is very unsatisfactory and they need a power plant very badly and by using this spare motor they would have ample power and could use the old sawing machine as it is in good order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo you may expend an amount not exceeding $60.00 in repairing the motor at the Chapleau Indian Residential School in order that it may be used for cutting wood.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I would therefore respectfully request your assistance in asking the Department to furnish us with a new ONE horse Power Electric Motor to drive our water supply pump.\n\nMay I ask this be arranged as soon as possible to avoid serious inconvenience in case it gives out definitely at any time now.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont.

Dr. Westgate, our Secretary, I am sending him at this time a list of our requirements for the ensuing year. I give you a copy herewith of same.\n\nWe shall require, as formerly asked for, more recreation room both for boys and girls. This is a pressing need.\n\nWe need some strong wire protection for the windows of our recreation rooms. Sixteen windows. We can get a reasonably priced wire if we attach same by wooden frame instead of getting the regulation iron bound kind. I would be very glad to have the cheaper kind. It would meet our need.\n\nWe need a new Electric Motor, of one horse power to drive our water pump. This is urgent.\n\nWe need a pumping station or house to give us a larger water supply in case of fire. Present supply will not feed the pump. We are without fire protection until the Town can get out here and the best they can do in the summer is TEN MINUTES TIME.\n\nI understand arrangements are being made to have an Engineer of the Department visit us in the near future and see what can be done. I trust this may be accomplished in time to permit the new water supply be given us this Fall.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nenclose two letters from the Chapleau Indian school relative to the school, the Motor that was used.\n\nI have assured that through Chapleau he would stop off but as the conditions are not very good I am unable to make any arrangements at this time.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\n[Signature]\n\nAUG 28 1939\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa,\nSeptember 5, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo I am requesting the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have Mr. McKnight visit the Chapleau residential school and inspect the water supply system.\n\nWith regard to the 1 H.P. electric motor requested by the Principal please let me have more detailed information regarding what is required in order that the purchasing Agent may secure it.

This one, as reported yesterday, is badly rusted on inside and small holes appeared. We have mended same but it is not safe to carry on.\n\nSize of Tank is as follows.\n\nHeight of Tank, 60 inches, with stand of 19 inches in addition to the height given making a total of 79\".\n\nDiameter of Tank 22\".\n\nFittings on top of tank are 3-4 of an inch pipes.\nCirculating pipe fittings at side are 1\".\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will get in touch with the Department at once lest this tank give out entirely and leave us without hot water in the kitchen.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature] Principal.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo you may purchase a hot water tank for the kitchen at the Chapleau Indian residential school. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T. J. Godfrey,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter enclosing a copy of your circular letter of Feb. 10, 1938 regarding fire prevention and drill. I will do my best to carry out the instructions therein.\n\nI note at bottom of page a note asking us to report any improvement needed in this matter. In this connection I would respectfully remind you of our former request for improved water supply for our fire pump.\n\nAn Inspector was sent here some weeks ago to look over the situation. Since then we have had no word. The weather is getting colder and snow is on the ground. If outdoor work is to be done this Fall it should be commenced at the earliest possible date as severe weather may set in at any time.\n\nI trust this is in accord with your wishes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO\nGENERAL TREASURER\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA,\nADDRESS\nTHE GRACE HURON,\n604 JARVIS STREET,\nTORONTO 5 ONT.\n\nDATE\nSERVICE\nAMOUNT\n\n1939.

H. McNaught\nwhile a short trestle has been built under the pipe where the above mentioned breaks occur it is liable to be a source of trouble in future.\n\nFrom rough tests made as to flow through the pipe it would average about 1,000 gallons per hour. The school contains up to a maximum of 100 pupils with probably 25 teachers and helpers. There are baths, laundry, toilets, etc., and it is also supplied to the barn for watering stock and to the Principal's residence. From what I could learn the present capacity is capable of supplying maximum present needs for domestic purposes.\n\nI would point out that this water supply provides entirely inadequate fire protection. There is a special electric pump intended to be used for fire purposes which can if necessary pump direct from the gravity pipe line. Further with all the pumping equipment in the boiler room it might easily be rendered useless in case of fire.\n\nThe location of the source of supply of water is considered the most suitable to obtain good water and if taken from the river on Indian Reserve lands is very liable to be contaminated and is subject to contamination.\n\nFuture trouble can be anticipated especially where breaks have occurred in the present galvanized pipe which is now practically worn out and in a short while will have to be replaced. I would suggest placing the proposed new pipe line farther away from the bank of river and the General Manager of the Power Company informed me there would be no objection to the proposed line about as indicated on the plan. It would appear desirable to obtain an agreement from the Power Company to lay and maintain the pipe line. I should suggest replacing the pipe line by a Universal 4 inch cast iron pipe located as shown on sketch or closer to the windmill as the Power Company will admit, to avoid extra digging. The cast iron pipe should not scale like the present pipe and should last considerably longer and it is easy to install. For a distance of about 800 feet from the lake the trench will have to be dug from 12 to 18 feet and the remaining distance to a depth of approximately 6\u00bd feet to be below frost. I was informed the digging would all be through a very fine sandy soil and surface indications would bear this out. The intake should be laid on boulders or rock to keep it well above the mud bed of the stream. These can easily be obtained.\n\nIt would be very desirable and would recommend the pumping equipment be installed in a small separate building approximately 12 x 12 feet situated a short distance from the school which could operate with ease even in case of fire. The present machinery in the building could be used and transferred at very little expense. There should also be a nearby outside hydrant. Shut-off valves should also be provided at intake end near the school.\n\nIt is only possible without taking levels, digging test pits, etc., to make more than an approximate estimate of the cost.........\nOctober 26, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills\n\nRe: Water Supply System, Chapleau Residential School, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of September 13th, I beg to submit the following report on the water supply system for the above noted school. The water supply for this school is obtained above a dam in the Chapleau river by a gravity system through a 3 inch galvanized iron pipe as shown on accompanying sketch plan. The water is then stored in a horizontal cylindrical tank 4 ft x 15 ft. in the boiler room section of building and by air pressure water is forced through the mains in the building. The town of Chapleau obtains its domestic water supply farther up stream on the same river and I am informed that tests made each year show the water fit to drink.\n\nThe dam and surrounding land is owned by the Chapleau Light and Power Company who apparently have allowed the school to obtain water without any written agreement. The intake pipe goes through the wing wall of their dam. I understand when the pipe line was installed in 1920 the former dam was of wood construction and about 10 years ago this dam was washed out and a modern concrete dam is now installed raising the water level over 2 feet over previous height. The wing wall of the dam is through very fine loose sand and the Power Company do not wish it disturbed in any way.\n\nThe shut off valve is now about 8 feet in the lake and end of intake pipe about 40 feet farther on now on a bed of stone about 4 feet above the bottom of the river. This intake valve will now neither open or shut and was informed the end of the intake pipe was formerly on the bed of the river where silt could get in.\n\nI am informed the pipe first broke in 1923 and other breaks occurred in 1927 all about 225 feet from dam and are apparently caused by the pipe line being too close to the edge of bank of river and underground springs coming out at foot of bank have caused the earth to settle and pipe to break and also there was considerable bend in pipe line at this point. The Indian Agent stated there was a large amount of scale and some silt in the pipe where the breaks were repaired which he doubt is stopping the flow in the pipe and will likely in a short time make flow less than the requirements for domestic use. In my opinion while a short.....\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n4th November, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School water supply.\n\nWe have now the report of Mr. McKnight who visited the above school and made an investigation into the water supply. A copy of the Engineer's report is attached together with a blueprint plan showing the present pipeline and the one which is proposed. It is noted that the existing pipeline, although it supplies the present domestic needs, is filled in with scale and silt and is quite inadequate for fire protection and will have to be replaced very soon. Breaks are occurring apparently due to underground springs causing the earth to settle. There is further the danger of the electric pumps, which are in the boiler room section, being rendered useless through short circuiting.\n\nMr. McKnight's recommendation for the installation of new pipeline with hydrant, shut-off valves etc., pump-house, wiring and changing machinery, engineering and other incidental expenses would cost an estimated amount of $2,600. There would seem to be no other alternative in the matter of supplying a new line as the present one passes through the wall of the dam.\n\nDirector.\nCopy sent to Mr. Godfrey\n\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the water supply at the Chapleau Indian residential school.\n\nI have just received the report of the engineers of the Survey's Engineering Branch who visited the Chapleau residential school. This report recommends the installation of a new pipe line with hydrants, shut-off valves, pump-house, wiring etc., at an estimated cost of $2600.00.\n\nIt is impossible for us to incur this expenditure at the present time as no provision was made in the current year's appropriation. I will endeavour to secure the amount required in our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 but at the present time I am not in a position to state definitely whether or not this item will be allowed.\n\nIn the meantime you should impress on all members of the staff the necessity of taking every possible precaution in order to avoid any outbreak of fire in the school.\n\nNo doubt Indian Agent Godfrey will give you every possible co-operation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

There is no objection to dealing with this firm, and I do not wish to delay purchase of the order, but the prices for some of the items, particularly the five point crutches and the 20 lb. lines of lumber 1\" x 10\" look appear high.\n\nAs indicated in our telephone conversation of even date, I would therefore suggest that the new Indian Agent, Mr. F. Butterworth, Chippewa, Ont., be asked to ascertain if less expensive material could be obtained elsewhere, and to advise us of the kind and quality of the 1\" x 10\" lumber required.\n\nIf it is possible for Mr. Butterworth to secure a downward revision of quotation from Collins & Walters, by securing a discount for quantity purchased, or otherwise, it will assist us in obtaining approval for the purchase.

There is no objection to dealing with this firm, and I do not wish to delay placing of the order, but the prices for some of the items, particularly the three paint brushes and the 500 lineal feet of lumber 1\" x 10\" D4S appears high.\n\nAs intimated in our telephone conversation of even date, I would therefore suggest that the new Indian Agent, Mr. F.McCarter, Chapleau, Ont., be asked to ascertain if less expensive paint brushes would answer the purpose, and to advise as to the kind and quality of the 1\" x 10\" lumber required.\n\nIf it is possible for Mr. Matters to secure a downward revision of quotation from Collins & Matters, by securing a discount for quantity purchase, or otherwise, it would assist us in obtaining approval for the purchase.

Our appropriation is so limited that we could not consider allowing more than $1000.00 toward the cost of this work.\n\nI shall await your reply with interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1940.\n\nL.T.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome weeks ago when I visited Chapleau the Principal of the residential school, Canon Vale, brought to my attention the serious situation existing in connection with the water system.\n\nAt that time I informed him that the delay in improving the water system was due to lack of funds. This opinion was based on a report received from our engineer last October at which time he estimated the cost of the work as follows:\n\n1500 lin. ft. Universal cast iron pipe ........................................ $850.00\nHydrant, shut-off valves and other incidentals .................. 250.00\nExcavation .................................................. 550.00\nBackfilling .................................................. 125.00\nPump house .................................................. 400.00\nWiring and changing machinery ....... 75.00\nEngineering, freight and unforeseen expenses ................. 350.00\n\n$2,600.00\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would discuss this matter fully with Canon Vale at the earliest possible date and let me know if this work could be done for a much smaller cost. We were unable to provide any specific amount in the current year's appropriation for improving the water system at the Chapleau School but if the school management is willing to co-operate with us it might be possible.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter as above.\n\nI have gone into the matter fully with the Rev. Canon Vale and he is willing to co-operate in every possible way.\n\nThe amount could be reduced considerably by using the boys at the school to do most of the excavating and back filling; by doing this a saving of $675.00 could be made on these two items alone.\n\nThe engineer at the school could assist with wiring and changing over of machinery and part of the engineering of the whole job, and thus reduce this part of the cost.\n\nWe thought the best scheme would be for the department to provide the pipe this year, which with the assistance of the school engineer could be laid this fall and by plugging both ends of the pipe, it could be left in a safe condition until next year, when the other incidental parts could be supplied, and installed.\n\nThe pipe is the main cost, and the length of this cannot be reduced, but they would be responsible for the laying, providing a list of pipe joints, with pipe sizes and levels, of the pipe could be specified, although both at what the pipe would stand at the dam, and where it would enter the school, these could be secured from Mr. McKnight, the engineer who inspected the job.\n\nBy doing it this way I estimate the entire job could be done for about $1,850.00 which could be spread over the year or next, without a complete list of the valves etc., that would be needed it is impossible to estimate this any closer, but I would see that any incidentals were kept to the minimum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nF. Matters Indian Agent\nthought the best scheme would be for the Department to provide the pipe this year, which, with the assistance of the school engineer, could be laid this fall. By placing both ends of the pipe it could be left in a safe condition until next year, when the other incidental parts could be supplied and installed.\n\n\"The pipe is the main cost and the length of this cannot be reduced, but we would be responsible for the laying of the pipe, provided a copy of the blue prints with pipe sizes and levels could be supplied, also a statement of the depth at which the pipe should start at the dam and where it should enter the school. These could be secured from Mr. McKnight, who inspected the job.\"\n\nI regret to state that it was not possible to make provision in the estimates of this year for the amount necessary for the installation of an adequate water system at the Chapleau School. In view of the urgency of the matter, however, it has been possible for us to transfer from the other appropriations a sum of approximately $1,000 to make a start on this work. I should like to have an expression of opinion from you with respect to the suggestion made in the last paragraph of the Indian agent's letter. Could it be possible to secure this information from Mr. McKnight and thus enable a certain amount of the preliminary work to be undertaken under the direction of the Indian agent and the school engineer?\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 23, 1940.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nMINISTRY OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School\nWater Supply.\n\nMay I refer to your memorandum dated November 4, 1939, relating to the above noted subject?\n\nTwo representatives of the Department who have visited the Chapleau School recently express the opinion that the water supply at the Institution is now less than the normal requirements of the school for domestic purposes.\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from Mr. P. Matters, Indian Agent at Chapleau, dated August 19, 1940, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I have gone into this matter fully with the Principal of the School, the Reverend Canon Vela, and he is willing to cooperate with us in every possible way. The estimated cost of this work could be reduced considerably by using the senior boys at the school to do most of the excavating and back filling. By doing this a saving of $475 could be made in these two items alone. The engineer at the school could assist with wiring and the changing over of machinery and thus reduce that part of the cost.

Canon Vale, Principle of the St. John's Indian Residential School here, that a night watchman be provided for the seven months Oct. to April inclusive as has been done in the past.\n\nThe salary paid in the past has been $40.00 per month; someone should be awake in a building of this nature when fires are kept going during the cold weather, therefore I would recommend that permission be granted for one to be employed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nF.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 65-1-5 of Sept. 12th., re the appointment of a night watchman at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nAs an alternative to this, but not a gravity system, the small pump house shown on the sketch near the canal might be placed at the lake shore and the water supply pumped through the barn. This would involve the erection of a power line distance of some 1,500 feet, with automatic or manual control at the reservoir. A small heater would also be necessary for use in the winter. In this case the trench for the pipe line would only have to be dug to a depth of 7 feet, for the entire distance, to provide protection against frost, etc., levels would not be necessary for the trench.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\nSeptember 5th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School Water Supply.\n\nWith regard to your memorandum of August 29th in connection with the above, I would first point out that, due to the war, the prices of materials generally have increased and the estimate given in our Engineer McKnight's report, attached to our memorandum of October 20th, 1939, would have to be increased about 15% for 6\" Universal cast iron pipe.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of the letter from the Indian Agent at Chapleau, Engineer McKnight took only a few levels along the proposed main line to obtain information as to depth of trench as given in his report, and obtain an estimate of cost as he considered that if and when the proposed pipe line was approved, the route would be finally located and staked out and levels given. In his report of October 26th, 1939, he points out that the surrounding land and dam at the intake belong to the Chapleau Light and Power Company and that it was desirable to obtain an easement from the Company for the new pipe line or other necessary buildings.\n\nAs to depth of trench for the pipe, a minimum cover of 4\u00bd feet over the pipe is necessary owing to frost conditions. The depth at lake level at the intake and also below the ground level at the school would be 7 feet with a fairly uniform slope between these two points as it is a gravity system for water supply.\n\nThe general layout for a gravity system is indicated on the attached sketch. This involves digging a trench for a distance of about 300 feet at the lake end to a depth of from 15 to over 20 feet which is too dangerous for semi-skilled school to undertake. However, the Power Company might allow the pipe line to come near the end of the wing wall as indicated in red on the sketch plan, where there probably would not be an excessive depth for necessary excavation by senior boys under supervision. A gravity line would have to be properly staked on the ground by an engineer before operations commenced.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe first step would apparently be the securing of an easement from the Power Company and which should not be difficult in view of the fact that the 3\" main is already located across the Company's property.\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum that $1,000 might be made available this year and in such case, we would recommend that the pipe be purchased as soon as it is certain an easement can be obtained. The 1,300 feet of pipe required will, under present prices, cost between $950 and $1,000.\n\nMr. Mills, in his memorandum, refers to an alternative plan under which the water would be pumped directly from the lake to the school building and which would have the advantage of lighter excavation for the pipeline. This method, however, is not recommended as it is not as satisfactory or economical in the long run as a gravity line to a pump house located near the school, at which point pressure can be boosted to the extent necessary.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Chapleau Indian Residential School Water Supply.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 23rd ultimo, I am forwarding herewith a memorandum, dated September 5th, from the Chief Engineer with attached blue print of a sketch plan on which are shown suggested locations of a new pipeline for the above school.\n\nIn his report of October 26th, 1939, which was forwarded under cover of my memorandum of November 4th, Engineer McKnight recommended the installation of a new pipeline and the moving of the pumping equipment to a separate building a short distance from the School, so that pumping operations would not be stopped in case of a fire in the main building. These recommendations still stand insofar as this Branch is concerned.\n\nIn regard to the enclosed memorandum from the Chief Engineer, you will note that the excavation required in the line originally suggested by Mr. McKnight will be fairly heavy and much too dangerous to be handled by senior boys of the school. The red line on the blue print indicates a location that would involve lighter excavation and it is possible that an Engineer on the ground could so locate the line that the trench would not need to be deeper than 7 or 8 feet. In any case, further levels should be run and the line properly staked out before any excavation work is done.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nSeptember 21\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Chapleau Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 09-483\n\nSHIP TO Mr. F.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont. Oct. 28, 1940.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale, Principal\n\nThe Secretary,\nWelfare Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am anxious to overcome the drafts coming down through the ceiling of my house, which is a menace to our health in the winter. The cold winds have started and we need some protection this winter.\n\nLast winter we had a lot of trouble from the ice forming on the roof and the water backing up under the shingles and leaking through.\n\nI talked this matter over with the Indian Agent. He advised me to write and see if you would provide insulation to put over the ceiling. He assures me that would do away with all that trouble. I have measured the ceiling of my house and find it is 23 feet by 25 feet space that would need to be covered.\n\nI have taken up the matter of cost with the local merchants and find the material could be supplied for not more than forty dollars. We can do the work of putting it in place if you will meet the first cost of material.\n\nI might explain this is an old house, brought here from the former school site. In my opinion it would be economy to have this repair done now before greater damage is caused to the roof by accumulation of the ice during the coming winter.\n\nI trust this request may receive your favourable consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. J. Vale, Principal.\nChapleau Ont.\nOct. 29th, 1940\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter I have received from the Rev. Canon Vale, Principle of The St. John's Indian Residential School, Chapleau, in which he requests that insulation be provided for the attic of his house at the school.\n\nOn my last visit to the school, he drew my attention to the fact that the roof leaked in the spring due to ice forming and backing up under the roofing, when it was melted, also the edges of the roof were marked due to chopping the ice away. If the roof could be protected by Rock Wool then it would serve for a few years yet, but if left it will probably mean that a new roof will be needed next year; therefore I would suggest that the Rock Wool be supplied to him, his staff doing the work of installation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nP. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo you may purchase rock wool for the Principal's residence at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. It is noted that the cost of the quantity required will not exceed $40.00.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being forwarded copy of purchase order covering the Universal cast iron pipe required for the new water supply system at the Chapleau School. When this pipe arrives you should arrange with the Principal of the Chapleau School to store it in a suitable place in order that it may be available when required next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nCharlevoix, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your instructions to make out a list of our repair needs for the ensuing year, I submit the following.\n\nYou will recall I asked for bedsprings and mattresses last year. These are now more urgently needed than ever. We require 20 beds 28\" from centre of frame head in width and 5' and 1-2\" long, or if measured from outside of the iron frame work they are 32\" wide and 7' long.\n\n20 beds 28\" wide from centre of frame head and 6' and 1-2\" long or from outside of the frame they are 30\" wide and 7' long.\n\nWe shall need straw mattresses for the above as we cannot obtain straw here to make them.\n\nOther needs are as follows:\n100 lbs of Murocoid for wall dressing (cream color)\n500 feet of planed lumber.\n400 lineal feet of lumber 2\"x1x1-2\" thick for making frames for window coverings of wire.\n2 bags of hard wall plaster\n2 lbs Lime for whitewashing.\n2 rolls of chicken wire 6 feet high.\n1 roll of chicken wire fence 6 feet high, 2\" mesh.\nNecessary staples to attach same in each case.\n50 lbs of 4\" nails.\n5 lbs of 3\" coated nails\n5 \"o\" 2\" finishing nails.\n2 \" \" 1/1-2\" \"\n6 gals Silver Grey outside paint.\n2 \" Outside White paint.\n2 \" Inside white paint.\n5 Gals. of Turpentine.\n5 \" Floor varnish\n5 \" Regular \"\n\nI only Cream Separator small size.\n\nYou will recall I pointed out to you the condition of my house which really should be repaired on the outside by imitation brick siding or similar covering. The old shingles are breaking and curling up and are not weather proof any longer. I give size of walls, 2 walls 25 feet long\nAll off walls 13 feet high to eaves\ngable ends are 7 feet from eaves. One end will not be needed below the verandah about 5 feet from eaves.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will place these needs before the Department and hope for a favourable consideration.\n\nI understand they are undertaking to make good our water supply this year. I have not given any details of this as it was supplied last year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nG.J. Vale\nPrincipal.\n\nThese supplies can be obtained from approved local sources at competitive prices.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nChapleau Ont.\nApril 26th, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a list of supplies needed for general repairs at the St. John's Indian Residential School, Chapleau, which I will attach.\n\nThe Bed Springs and Mattresses are very badly needed, as at the present time they are held together with wire and the centre of each bed is sagged away down, so that it is not in a good position for restful sleep.\n\nWith regard to the Principle's residence the outside shingles are finished, and it will have to be re-covered with something. I would recommend Insul-Brite siding, this has been found to be about the best type of outside finish in this part of the country; it keeps the place warm, saving fuel, and gives a permanent finish that does not need to be painted, due to the extremes of heat and cold paint does not last so long here as it would do in a milder part of the country; from the measurements given I would estimate that it would cost about $285.00 to cover the house with this material, this would include the skilled labour necessary to direct the applying.\n\nRepairs are also needed for the Fire Box of the Heating boiler, the fire was going and it was too hot to make a thorough examination when I was there last, but I could see that some of the Fire Brick had broken out, I will get a fuller report on this and send to you as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant enclosing list of supplies requested by the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been reduced and we have endeavored to allot the amount available as fairly as possible among all the Indian residential schools in Canada.\n\nIn the case of the Chapleau Residential School it was considered that one of the first requisites this year was to complete the water supply system and consequently an amount of $1600.00 is available for that purpose. This is the cost estimated by the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nIn addition to this amount it was only found possible to include a sum of $200.00 for repairs and painting. Until the water supply system is completed it is considered that other purchases should be deferred as we have to make certain that we have sufficient funds to complete the water system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has provided funds in the current year's appropriation for the completion of the new water supply for the Chapleau Indian Residential School. You already have the pipe on hand. Do you consider it necessary to have the work completed under the direction of one of the engineers of the Surveys & Engineering Branch or can you handle the matter? In the latter event you should let me know if Indians could be employed exclusively or if white labour would be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

In the current year's appropriation an amount of $1500.00 has been included to complete this work. This amount was based on Mr. Knight's estimate forwarded with your memorandum of November 4, 1939.\n\nIn addition to the water supply system we have a request from the Principal for rather extensive repairs that are necessary at this school this year. Consequently it is most desirable that the work be completed for less than $1500.00 if at all possible. With this end in view I recently wrote to the Indian Agent and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his reply.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1941.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nIndian agent Matters, in his letter of April 26, enclosed a list of supplies required for general repairs at the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nHe was advised in official letter of April 29 that these repairs would have to stand until we had completed the water system. An amount of $1600.00 is included in the current year's appropriation for the latter work but it is hoped that it can be done for $1000.00.\n\nIf funds are available later in the year to provide the supplies required for the repairs we should communicate with Mr. Pratt before incurring any expenditure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPyrene Manufacturing Company\nOF CANADA LIMITED\n91 DON ROADWAY\nToronto\n\nMAY 6TH\n1941\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe acknowledge and thank you for your letter of May 5th, and would advise that our invoices were mailed on May 5th to the Principal of the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nWe trust he will find these satisfactory, and remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"BUY WAR SAVINGS CERTIFICATES\"\n| Date | Description     | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------|\n|      | Lead Trap       | 1        | $1.25      | $1.25   |\n|      | Lead Trap       | 1        | $2.75      | $2.75   |\n|      | Holder          | 1        | $1.00      | $1.00   |\n|      | Valves          | 3        | $6.00      | $18.00  |\n\nTotal: $11.00\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 508\n\nVoucher No.: \n\nDate: \n\nTotal: \n\n13-5-41\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 28\n\nOffice of the Chaplain Indian Agency,\n\nMay 10, 1941\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 28, amounting to $11.25, in favour of Charles W.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant regarding the Chapleau School you may expend an amount of $10.00 in the purchase of a roll of fence wire.\n\nI note that you consider the springs and mattresses should be supplied before making any repairs. As pointed out in my letter of the 29th ultimo the Department does not consider it advisable to make any expenditures at the Chapleau School until the new water system is completed. If there are any funds remaining at that time consideration will be given to the manner in which they can be expended.\n\nIn your letter of April 26 you enclosed a list of requests from the Principal of the Chapleau School in which he stated that some of the beds in the school are 3' x 5' and that the dimensions of others are 2' x 6'. You might make certain that these dimensions are correct in order that we may have proper information if it is possible to order the springs and mattresses. The usual widths for beds are 2' and 3' and the usual lengths are 5', 5' and 6'.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

As it is understood that only $1,000.00 will be available for work on the water supply, it is felt that these two items could be omitted for the present and carried out when funds were available.\n\nIt is suggested that one of our engineers proceed to Chapleau to stake out the excavation for the pipe line, prepare a list of materials and fittings required, and after starting the work instruct the local staff how it should be continued. A subsequent inspection might be necessary when the work is nearing completion.\n\nOur engineer can leave for Chapleau at any time but we should be glad to know when it would be convenient for the Indian Affairs Branch to have him go.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

I just returned from Matagami and Kapuskasing Reserves after paying treaty late that evening, but got in touch with him, and today we have marked out the line the pipe will take and taken levels etc.\n\nWe have prepared a list of material necessary and to expedite the work I am taking the liberty of ordering this from the same firm as the pipe was bought from, as it will be necessary to get the same type of fitting as the pipe. From estimates made of the cost of the work and material we feel certain that the job can be completed inside of the $1,000 allowed, and I would ask your authority to continue with this without any delay, as at the present time I can get some Indians who want work, in fact I hired two today to help dig test pits along the line.\n\nIt will also be necessary to have some appropriation made for wages of Indians working on the line and I would ask that $500.00 be made available for wages; I hired these men at 25\u00a2 per hour, and may have to get a foreman and pay him 30\u00a2, but I will be on the job most of the time myself except for the time taken up in the office.\n\nWe find that when a direct line was taken that there will be a considerable amount of pipe left over, and the return value of this will be much more than the cost of the other material needed, so we can eliminate any cost for extra material.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nChapleau Ont.\nJune 13th. 1941\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: June 18, 1941.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES\u2014\n\n| CHEQUE NO | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n|           | Chapleau Indian Agency Trust Account | $500.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. F.

We got a man who has had a lot of experience\nwith The C.P.R. Bridge & Building department and he is\nbeing paid 50\u00a2 an hour, all the rest of the men are\nIndians, and as soon as the intake is complete we will\nneed only the Indians and myself, with the help of the\nengineer from the school.\n\nWhen Mr. Sparks of the Engineering and\nSurveys Branch was here, we checked over all the\ndetails closely, and from his instructions I am sat-\nisfied that I can carry on until the job is about com-\npleted, then I would prefer to have either he or another\nengineer come back to check the work, and the part\nwhere it connects to the present school system.\nOttawa,\nJune 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was very pleased to receive your letter of the 23rd instant reporting on the progress you are making in connection with the new water supply system at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nYou should forward a voucher for the lumber and other articles that it was necessary to purchase.

Metters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChapleau Ont.\nJuly 17th, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe situation at the local Indian Residential school with regard to Fire has been a thing constantly in my mind.\n\nThe distance from the school to the nearest point that water could be taken from the river is such that only one line of hose could be used by the town fire pump.\n\nWhen working on the new water system at the same school, I got the boys of the school with horses to scoop out and make a roadway about 200 feet long to a point in the river about halfway between the bridge (where water would be taken in the past, and at which point, there is a direct lift of ten feet to the pump) and the school, they also made a platform, cribbed in and filled with stone, on which the truck could stand when pumping.\n\nThis means that from the new point two lines of hose, with considerably more pressure can be operated, as it is down to water level with no initial lift.\n\nTo make a good job of this, and make it safe for the truck to go down, it should have a coating of gravel the whole length, as it is all through soft sand, and I would ask your authority to hire a truck and a driver for two days, at a cost of $25.00 to do this, the boys from the school can load and spread the gravel, at no cost, and so far the whole job has not cost us one cent.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nF. Matters, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $85.00 in connection with the roadway which you are constructing between the river and the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

The surplus material will be disposed of in hollows near the end of the wing wall. The average cut for more than half the entire trench will be under seven feet.\n\nThe soil throughout is light and sandy. Three test pits were sunk at points along the line to a depth of six feet. It was found that the banks of the pits stood solidly to this depth, and under the circumstances it is considered sheeting may not be required at any point.\n\nAfter emergence into the lake, the intake pipe will be supported on a bed of hand laid rock. This work, as well as the first part of the trench, will be done behind a sheet pile coffer dam. One of the local C. P. R. bridge construction men, experienced in this work, has offered to take charge of installing the intake when the work is ready to proceed and the Indian Agent has arranged to employ him for this purpose.\n\nAttached hereto is a list of additional material and pipe specials which have been ordered by the Indian Agent. One gate valve will be installed in a concrete box at the intake, and one near the school at the location proposed for the outside pumphouse.\n\nA hydrant has not been provided for at the present time, as there would be no gravity pressure, and I was advised by the local fire chief that such a hydrant would not supply enough water to keep the town fire pumper working. A crib landing place has been constructed by the school at the pool in the river below the Power House, where the pumper can operate its own suction hose.\n\nAttached hereto is a set of five photographs, showing views taken at various points along the line of the new 4\" supply pipe.\n\nEnclos.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nJune 23rd, 1941\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School Water Supply\n\nIn accordance with instructions given in your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to report that I proceeded to Chapleau, Ontario, on the 18th instant, and spent part of the 12th and all of the 13th, 14th and 16th instants at the above school, in connection with preparations for the installation of the new 4\" gravity water supply pipe.\n\nMr. Fife, Manager of the Chapleau Power Company, which owns the dam near the school, indicated on the ground the minimum distance from the end of the wing wall that the Company would allow the pipe line to pass. With this restriction, a line was run and staked on the ground as shown on the attached blueprint. Levels were taken on this line, a profile was prepared and cuts required for trenching indicated as required on the ground. The line was carried to the rear of the Power Company's house, as shown on the plan, requiring a small sweep which can be taken up easily in the Universal pipe joints. At Mr. Fife's request, a 4\" x 4\" x 1\" tee is being placed opposite this house to provide for future connection.\n\nThe total distance between the junction with the existing 3\" main near the school building and the point of emergence of the pipe into the lake is 1070 feet. As 1500 lineal feet of 4\" pipe was purchased for the job, there will be some 200 lineal feet surplus after providing for the intake lengths and a few lengths to be held for emergencies. It is considered that at present the 3\" main leading into the building, which passes under the laundry wing, need not be replaced, as it is in good condition and has been adequate until pump house be constructed outside the school, as previously suggested by Mr. McKeight and the pumping equipment be transferred to this location. To provide for this, a 4\" x 4\" x 4\" tee is being placed approximately 100 feet from the school in the new line.\n\nAs the line is a gravity one, a continuous fall has been provided for in the grades laid out. This involves a heavy cut through a sandy knoll for a distance of about 300 feet from the intake, - the maximum cut being 15.8'. In this distance it is proposed to reduce........\n\nTo S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Water Supply, Chapleau Indian Residential Schools\n\nWith further reference to your notation of the 4th instant on Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of June 3rd in regard to the above matter, I am attaching hereto for your information duplicate copies of a report submitted by Mr. H.A. Sparks covering his recent visit to this School.\n\nIn this connection it might be noted that after discussion on the ground with an officer of the Power Company, permission was secured to utilize a more direct route for the pipe line with a consequent shortening of the latter by approximately 800 feet.\n\nUnder this arrangement, a line suitable to all parties concerned was staked out and levels for the pipe line marked on the ground. The Indian Agent has also ordered necessary lumber, pipe specials and jointing material required. The installation was fully discussed on the ground with Indian Agent Matters and School Engineer Mayo who were satisfied that necessary excavation, pipe-laying and testing could be carried out without further supervision for the present.\n\nYou will note that provision has been made for connection close to the School to the existing 3\" main which passes under the laundry wing. Tunnelling under this wing would be required to carry the 6\" main to the pump room. This added expense is not considered necessary as it is recommended that as soon as possible the pumping equipment be moved from the School to a small pump house to be erected outside the main building, as already recommended in previous reports.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOctober, July 29th., 1941.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Water Supply System - Charlevoix School,\n\nI wish to refer to your credit voucher No. 176 covering work done on the above project. In the examination of the return of labour which accompanied this voucher for the week ending July 29th., you show a total of $135.00 and the correct total should be $111.80. In combining the two pay-lists there is another mistake of $1.00 making a net difference of $11.00 and it was necessary to reduce your voucher by this amount. Therefore the voucher submitted at $145.00 will be accepted at $124.00.\n\nYou should take this into account when making further returns in connection with this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.F.

It will take another \u00a3300 to be on the safe side, but I am having them continue as quickly as possible and will pay them when it is possible to get the extra money needed.\n\nIf you desire to have one of the Departmental engineers check the work when the connection is made to the existing system at the school, I would suggest that he come up here on August 13th, by which time we are sure to be ready to make the change over, personally I hardly think it is necessary, as all the tests so far have been good but if you wish it to be done, please have him advise me when he will arrive and I will arrange to meet him and take him out to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $600.00 is provided for repairs and $400.00 for the purchase of new beds and mattresses at the Chapleau Indian Residential School. Please discuss this matter with the Principal at once and let me have your recommendations regarding the manner in which the amount should be expended, if necessary.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThe following is a list of material required for the general upkeep of the buildings:\n\n- 17 Gallons Paint @ 4.75 Gall.\n- 5 Gallons Varnish @ 4.75 Gall.\n- 5 Gallons Turpentine @ 2.35 Gall.\n- 5 Gallons Boiled Oil @ 1.60 Gall.\n- 5 Gallons Floor Oil @ 1.00 Gall.\n- 1 Roll Screen Wire for 16.75\n- 1 Roll Poultry netting for 9.50\n- 10 lb. Staples @ 15\u00a2 lb.\n\nI have procured the above prices locally; from the same approved source as supplied the goods last year; they may be procured there again or can be shipped from Ottawa, whichever is the cheaper or most satisfactory; the above totals about 156.00 and should I think be sufficient for the general maintenance for the year; I would recommend that these be supplied to the school, and the work of doing the painting etc., can be done by the staff there.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau Ont.\nJune 25th, 1942\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of the above letter, I have made a survey at the St John's Indian Residential School, and the following are my observations.\n\nThe roof of the school needs repairing in several places, and shingles fastened down in others. I had a carpenter look over this work and he gave me an estimate of $30.00 for the labour and materials.\n\nThe 20 new beds provided for in the estimates should be provided if possible to secure, I made enquiry from the same source I purchased last year and was advised that it was still possible to get them if ordered soon; this is 20 new beds and Mattresses complete with Springs; the condition of the old beds is such, that we ought to make every effort to replace this number each year until all are changed.\n\nThe residence of the Principle is in very bad shape, originally it was a shingled building and these are peeling and curling off; to make a more or less permanent job of it, I would recommend that it be covered with heavy Insul-Bric Siding; this will last for a long time, and cut down on any or most of the painting and repairs for this next ten years, the estimated cost of this job is about $300.00 to $350.00 depending upon where the material is available.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\nOttawa, July 26th, 1942.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\nChapleau Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-415\nSHIP TO Reverend Canon A.

Principle of the above school that the supplies and material requested at the start of the year be provided as soon as possible.\n\nThey consisted of the following:\n\n- 17 Gallons Paint,\n- 5 Gallons Floor Varnish\n- 5 Gallons Turpentine\n- 5 Gallons Boiled Oil\n- 5 Gallons Floor Oil\n- 500 Ft. B.M. Lumber\n\n10 lbs. Staples, 1\"\n1 Roll Screen Wire, 36\" wide.\n1 Roll Poultry Netting, 6 ft.\nEnough Rock Wool for Insulation in the Assembly Hall, to cover 1,200 sq.ft. 4\" thick.\n\nThe paint and varnish are for the inside and outside of the school, the lumber is to be used for general repairs to the buildings during the year.\n\nI recommend the provision of Rock wool in my annual estimate, as the Assembly Hall, which is set off from the main building is very cold in the winter and almost impossible to heat, by covering the ceiling with Rock wool, I believe that it will be made reasonably comfortable; the work will be done by the school staff.\n\nI would recommend that arrangements be made with the Purchasing Agent to supply the above material so that work may be started during the fine weather.\n\n[Signature]\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\n\nA week or so ago the principle of the Chapleau Indian Residential School reported to me that the lower part of the heater, used to provide hot water for the school had cracked.\n\nI examined the heater along with the school engineer, and thought it possible to have the jacket heater repaired, and subsequently got a plumber to look it over and provide me with an estimate of the cost of repairs.\n\nWe found that the lower part of the heater being all in one piece that it would be necessary to get a new part including grates, and with the cost of installation of the parts his quotation was $100.00.\n\nThis appeared to me to be about the price of a new heater, so I made further enquiries and find that a similar jacket heater may be purchased for $100.00 installed.\n\nWhen there I overlooked getting the name of the heater, but no doubt you will have it on file, but I would recommend that a new jacket heater be supplied either by local or direct purchase in the near future.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 10, 1943.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, please let me know the name and address of the firm from whom you obtained the quotation of $100.00 for a new jacket heater for the Chapleau School. When replying you should give full information regarding the type of heater required.\n\nI am also in receipt of your other letter of the 7th instant, requesting supplies and material for repairs at the school. In the current year's appropriation an amount of $750.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. We have already expended $625.40 and consequently, if we provide a new jacket heater as well as the materials requested in your letter, it will mean expenditure of a larger amount than that specifically provided in our current year's appropriation. The Principal should, therefore, understand that further requests during the current fiscal year cannot be considered.\n\nIn your letter of the 7th instant you request 800 ft. B.M. lumber. Before submitting this request to the Purchasing Branch, I will have to know exactly what kind of lumber is required. Can this be obtained locally and if so, at what price? Your letter also requests 17 gallons of paint, but you do not state the colour required. On receipt of a reply to this letter the articles requested in your two letters of August 7 will be ordered.\n\nR.A.

Crichton, heating engineer, Chapleau. I have not been able to see him for a few days as he is out of town, but on his return I will get the desired details regarding the type and size of the heater quoted upon, which turns out to be of the same capacity as the present heater.\n\nIn connection with paragraph two, I have pointed out to the Rev. Principle that no more repairs or alterations can be considered during the present fiscal year, and unless something extraordinary turns up I am satisfied that the school is in good enough repair not to need further expenditure this year.\n\nThe lumber required will be 250 F.B.M. 1\" tongue and grooved lumber, and 250 F.B.M. of 1\" boards, dressed, assorted widths, for general use in repairs etc., this may be secured from Fellows Supply Stores here in Chapleau at a cost of $32.50.\n\nWith regard to the paint, the following variety is required, 10 gallons Silver Grey, 5 gallons Outside Gloss white, 1 gallon Inside Gloss white and 1 gallon Green outside trim.\n\nF.

Matters.\n\nI am pleased to be able to inform you he was able to be up for a short time and so was able to attend to the work of signing the report which I then forwarded to you by post.\n\nI also discussed with him the matter of our having one BILLY goat here all the summer and no word yet of the females that were to be sent. This animal by himself is of no use to us. He makes extra work and no returns. May I ask you what plans you have in the matter of sending us the females or do you wish this animal sent somewhere to be of use.\n\nI also pointed out to Mr. Matters, we received the paint asked for, but to date no word has come in regard to the rock wool Insulation asked for. This would be a great saving of fuel to us if it can be given us. It will relieve the situation in regard to shortage of fuel this winter.\n\nI beg to report we have secured a nightwatchman for the Winter months and he started on his work October 1st.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October, 1943.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale, Principal, Indian Residential School,\nCHAPLEAU, Ontario.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReplying to your letter of October 16th, in connection with the paragraph concerning the billy goat I wish to inform you that we are making every effort to obtain at least five female Saanen goats for your school.\n\nIt may not be possible to supply these female goats this winter. In that event, if you consider that the billy goat is too much trouble please advise and arrangements will be made to have his sent to some other location. I might point out, however, that this billy is only a young animal and should not be used for breeding purposes until he is at least eighteen months old, which would be sometime next summer. The intention is to obtain Saanen female goats that are already bred so that it will not be necessary to use your billy goat until next breeding season. You will be advised at a later date if it is possible for us to obtain the five females.\n\nR. A.

In the opinion of both the Fire Chief and myself another ten or fifteen minutes would probably have meant that the fire would have spread and got out of control entirely.\n\nI had made arrangements to leave here on Thursday, February 3rd., to escort a sick Indian from Sudbury to Manitowaning hospital, and had intended to go right through, but I will try to have Mr. Johnston from Manitowaning meet me at Little Current, then I will be able to turn back from there, and will be in Chapleau again either on February 5th. or 6th.\n\nI visited the school again today, and left the school engineer to take up a list of material that will be required to repair the building; and I have also asked a local contractor to do the same with an estimate on the labour costs; when I return I will check the results with my own and advise you more fully as to repairs; I would estimate off-hand that the damage would amount to about $300.00.\n\nIf you think it desirable to send someone from the Branch to report on the school, please advise and I will arrange to meet him; also if any other information is needed I will get it for you.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 4, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the fire at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nOur experience is that whenever a fire, no matter how small at first, occurs at an Indian residential school every possible endeavour should be made to see that it is fully extinguished. Apparently this was not done at the Chapleau School and I am inclined to feel a more thorough examination of the building at the time the chimney fire occurred would have resulted in saving considerable expense and trouble later. However, we are glad to note that, as a result of the splendid efforts of the Chapleau fire brigade, the second blaze was brought under control in a short time. It would be appreciated if you could extend to the Chapleau Volunteer Fire Brigade our appreciation for their services.\n\nI presume that you will communicate with me again when the extent of the damage has been finally determined.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 4, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter dated February 8 from Indian Agent Matters, with reference to a fire that occurred at the Indian residential school at Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nThis building was erected during the fiscal year 1920-21.

The warped sheets of beaver board in the boys' dormitory, staff dining room and sewing room should be replaced.

I had the contractors' estimates with me, and checked all the parts where work was proposed, and had these submitted in sections, so that parts that had to be done would be done first and others omitted if it was thought necessary.\n\nThere is only one contractor here at the present time who has the material and labour available; they could start with the papering and decorating at once, and with the carpenter work in two weeks.\n\nI can imagine that it will be rather difficult for you to determine from the above report just what ought to be done, without seeing the building itself; however, if there is any other information you require I will be pleased to procure it for you.\n\nPossibly the best solution would be for you to place whatever funds are available for this job at my disposal, and I will see that the most urgent parts are repaired first, and that the money is used to the best advantage; I have had some experience in this type of supervision as when in business we did a good deal of this work.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nIf finances are available there are several other parts of the building that could be improved at the same time, to put everything into good shape for some years; these are not due to the fire.\n\n**Principal Office:** It is rather run down with regard to appearance, and could do with a general redecoration, this would be the walls and ceiling done with one coat of washable Duro paint, one coat of varnish on the woodwork, and the floors sanded and finished with two coats of varnish, total cost of $62.60\n\n**Main Hall:** The walls need to painted again due to smoke marking, this can be done by the school staff, the ceiling which is of Beaver board is warped, this type of construction is dangerous in case of a fire, in my opinion all the ceilings ought to be of gyproc or other fire resisting materials, especially in a case like the hall, which extends from one stairway to the other, the estimated cost of this change would be $37.50\n\n**Attic Floors:** There are four sections of the attic, which are used as store rooms, where the floor is not finished, the joists being exposed, consequently the goods stored are not piled up neatly and are hard to move in case of a fire, if the joists were covered with softwood flooring it would be safer and cleaner, it would take 2,000 feet B.M. of tongue and grooved flooring to do this, the lumber at the present time is selling at $75.00 per thousand, the work could be done by the school staff.\n\nThis far exceeds my original estimate made the day after the fire, but is governed by the damage that became more apparent when the Beaver board dried out and began to warp, most of the repairs are proposed to be made with gyproc instead of Beaver board, I found that the latter material had carried the fire along the back of the board and thus created a dangerous fire hazard.\n\nIn several places I have suggested that Beaver board be used again to effect repairs, this is more of a temporary expedient to keep the expense down at the present time, if and when it is possible to get the necessary appropriation I would recommend that all the ceilings be made safer by changing to gyproc.\nSewing room. 6 sheets of Beaver board are needed here repaired, and I think this also could be done by the staff of the school.\n\nGirls recreation room. The ceiling of this room in the basement is damaged by water, 50% of it will have to be renewed; I would recommend that the whole ceiling be replaced with gyproc, rather than replace half of the Beaver board, a price of $90.00 is quoted for the complete job, removing old material and recovering.\n\nMain dining Room. This also is in the basement, and the entire ceiling will need to be renewed, due to water damage, the tender price for this is $104.00 for materials and labour, using gyproc instead of Beaver board.\n\nReception room. The ceiling and one wall of this room, which is papered is damaged and the paper hanging loose, it is suggested that the ceiling be painted and the walls papered, a price of $59.3c is quoted to do this and also sand and finish the floor with two coats of varnish, the latter part is not essential but would be an improvement, the ceiling and walls will have to be done and if finances are available I would recommend that it all be done.\n\nCeiling of Entrance vestibule. This hall damaged and hanging in places, it could be replaced with gyproc at a total cost of $10.50, and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nCloak room. The ceiling of this room, which is upstairs needs to be replaced and can be done for a cost of $11.80, using gyproc, this I recommend.\n\nFire protection equipment. One length of hose was found to be defective, and I would recommend that it be replaced with one of the following:\n- 50 feet, Goodyear or Dunlop fire hose, complete with couplings, 1\u00be\" single lap rubber lined = $35.00\n- 50 feet, as above double wall = $60.00\n\nPaint to cover new work, and other smoked portions.\n350 lb. bbl. Cold water paint at 17\u00a2 lb.\nChapleau Ontario  \nFebruary 8th, 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Fire damage at Chapleau School.\n\nOn February 7th, I went through the whole school building checking on damage done and repairs needed, and found as follows:\n\nAt starting point of fire, Attic floor. The ceiling of the second storey and the floor of the attic are burnt through completely, to repair new joists, sub floor, hardwood floor, galvanized ventilator shaft, V joint for walls and moulding are needed, the burnt area covers about 100 square feet, I have a quotation from Smith and Chapple Ltd of $147.00 for the job, material and labour, and recommend that it be accepted.\n\nGirls Dormitory and toilets, East side. The entire ceiling needs to be renewed, covering an area of about 320 square feet; I have an estimate from the same firm of $100.00 to remove burnt material and balance of damaged ceiling, replace burnt sub ceiling of lumber and cover with gyproc, new strap ing on the joints, this is below where the fire started and is necessary.\n\nGirls Dormitory, West side. The ceiling on this side is warped through the effects of water and smoke, it could be replaced with gyproc at a cost of $56.65 for material and labour.\n\nBoys Dormitory. 10 sheets of Beaver Board are needed to replace warped sheets, I think this work could be done by the school staff if the material were supplied.\n\nStaff Dining Room. 8 sheets of Beaver board are needed to replace damaged ceiling, work could be done by school staff.\n**SMITH & CHAPPLE, Limited**\n\n**Department Store**\n\nChapleau, Ont.

However, should our price be satisfactory, we will be notified within two weeks.\n\nCurrently, due to the fact that we have a carload of brick materials coming from Toronto within three weeks time, and we have based our price on materials coming in this car on account of heavy L.C.L. Freight. Further, we have managed to contact a skilled chimney builder who has only a limited time to spend on this work this summer in Chapleau.\n\nWe quote you on a new chimney, using #1 Pressed hard brick, 70 feet high, on a cement base. This chimney to be of two flues each 8 X 12\" with flue lining. It is to be three wall chimney up to 35' on account of its height and double wall from that point up to the top. 2 cleanouts a bottom and two 8\" thimbles.\n\nThe entire job, including necessary carpenter work on roofs, base construction, scaffolding, flashing and all materials at a cost of $1,286.00\n\nIf the work is to be done and you find our price satisfactory we guarantee a first class job, we will appreciate an early advice on the matter.\n\nYrs truly,\n\nSmith and Chapple Ltd.\n\nPer; A. J. Grout.\nChapleau Ontario\nJune 28th, 1944\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\n\nSome months ago we had a fire at the Chapleau Residential School, which was started by a faulty and overheated chimney.\n\nWhen other repairs were being made I tried to get a price on the rebuilding of the present chimney, which is of single brick construction and entirely unsafe.\n\nAt that time I was not successful due to lack of material and skilled labour, but now have a quotation from the only people who will be able to do the work this year and theirs is a restricted tender with regard to time for acceptance.\n\nAfter the fire I thoroughly examined the chimney, and there is no doubt that it needs to be rebuilt; the brick is of poor quality, and being of only single thickness constitutes a fire hazard any time that a fire is going in either the cook stove or the bake ovens.\n\nI propose, and the tender is based on the building of a chimney outside the building, in the corner on the North side formed by the girls entrance and the bakery, this will mean a little longer pipe to the chimney from the cook stove, but shorter from the bake oven and all exposed where they can be watched, the chimney will be carried up through the eave and be properly flaged and finished.\n\nAttached is a copy of the tender, I have not had any experience in the building of chimneys so cannot offer any opinion as to the reasonableness of the price, it will be higher here than in Ottawa or other points where the freight on material is less and skilled labour can be found, this man had to be brought in for other work and his expenses are consequently higher. If it is found satisfactory and money is available I would recommend that the work be done as soon as possible.\n\nP.

Indian Agent Matters reports definitely that the cause of the fire was a defective chimney. He has thoroughly examined this chimney and states there is no doubt it needs to be rebuilt, as the brick is of poor quality and only single thickness. For your information I enclose a copy of tender which Mr. Matters has received from Smith and Chapleau Limited, Chapleau, Ontario. As Mr. Matters points out, the price is higher than could be obtained at more accessible points, but all the brick has to be freighted to Chapleau and skilled labour has also to be brought in from outside.\n\nFrom all the reports we have received it appears essential that a new chimney should be built at this school and I should, therefore, appreciate receiving your approval to accept the tender of Smith and Chapleau, who offer to do the entire job, including carpenter work on roofs, base construction, scaffolding, flashing and all materials, at a cost of $1850.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School,\nChapleau Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Algoma West.\n\nSome months ago there was a fire at this school and only the strenuous efforts on the part of the Principal, staff and pupils saved the building.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nDuring the summer holidays the engineer at the Chapleau Residential School has been making repairs to the fireboxes of the furnace and Bake ovens.\n\nThis morning I received a call to visit the school and examine the condition of the firebox of the Bake oven, and found it in very bad condition; the heating chambers at both sides of the firebox had been completely burnt out at one end of each, also the angle iron strips across the casing for the purpose of holding the firebrick in place was gone in some places on each strip.\n\nBoth Mr. Arnell who was with me at the time and myself agreed that nothing short of new parts were necessary to get the oven into working condition again, and I have taken the liberty of ordering the parts from the manufacturer.\n\nIt is going to take a little time in any case to get them, and although they were going to try to make temporary repairs they would be for a very short time, due to the ends of the chambers being burnt out completely. I trust that you will endorse my action in thus going ahead without your permission which would have been requested in the ordinary course of events.\n\nF.

Matters  \nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 3, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing plan of a hen-house with a sufficient capacity to provide space for raising 200 hens.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. Roy this morning, and before giving further consideration to the Principal's request it would be appreciated if you would talk the matter over fully with him.\n\nWhile the cost of eggs is probably high at the present time, there are often periods when eggs can be procured quite reasonably, and at such times the expense of raising hens is not profitable. There is the further fact that it is doubtful if the food required for the hens could be raised on the Chapleau School property and, if not, it would have to be brought in at considerable cost. Again, it is not exactly a simple matter to raise 200 hens. It will be necessary to have someone on the staff who knows how to properly raise them. Possibly there is such a member, but at the present time the Department has no information to that effect.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFeb. 25/48\n\nTo supplying 3 white closet tanks\nfor Indian School and three white closet\nseats as per File No. 56, 562-15-2.\n$8.00\n\nInstalling charges\n$10.50.\n\nPlus $1.50 each toilet seat as\nstandard seats had to be used as Competitive\nseats no longer available\n$4.05.\n\nTotal\n$22.55\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nOttawa Jan. 25/48\n\nTO Viner Brothers,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\n3 White Toilet tanks - with white enamel closed front seat, toilet tanks to include inside fittings, trip action and flush elbow, less supply but with flapper.\nCloset seats to be 1/2\" bar hinge type\n\nInstalling the above\n\nTotal: $79.80\n\nSignature:\n\nTO BE RETURNED TO HEAD OF BRANCH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to REV.

A. J. Vale on Saturday afternoon, March 17th, regarding it.\n\nHe has kept accurate records of cost of keeping the hens and the value of the eggs and fowl produced, on a monthly basis, and these were a great help in reaching a conclusion on the matter.\n\nBased on the 50 hens they have been in the habit of keeping, I find that the cost for feed, chicks etc., without any labour charge amounted to $124.62, and the value of eggs produced, at current market prices, was $150.13, plus about 150 lbs. of chicken and fowl used in place of meat, to the value of $42.00.\n\nThe present farm instructor is qualified to and has had enough experience to look after more, and on the basis that 200 hens would produce a sufficient number of eggs, it is reasonable to assume that a saving as against buying them, would be affected to the extent of about $260.00.\n\nAlong with this advantage, the boys would get more experience in looking after chickens, but I doubt if this would benefit more than about 10% of the boys who did the work.\n\nAgainst the initial cost and maintenance, which I would estimate at $2,500.00 with 5% for repairs etc., per year, can be placed the expected saving of $250.00.\n\nThe report as prepared by the Red Cross indicated a definite lack of eggs in the diet, and I was probably looking at the necessary objective, rather than at the best way to reach that goal.\n\nOn a straight economic analysis, the expenditure of so much capital, in view of the limited returns, is not sound, but is there any other alternative to ensure the provision of a more adequate diet.\n\nI have in mind now the matter of Children's Allowances, if the schools are to be paid all or part of this as guardians of the children, then I think this will cover the all round expanded diet as recommended, and all schools should then be able to raise the standard of their meals to a point, that would compare favourably with one set out by the Branch as being adequate.\n\nAs I see it School conditions in general will have to be dramatically improved, to induce Indian parents to allow their children to go to school, as each child going to school will mean the loss of the allowance, and this is going to appear as a very large sacrifice to the Indians.\n\nF.

The soil pipe from one toilet needs either repair or replacing.\n2. The blowoff pipe from the main boiler is leaking, the latter passes through a brick wall and it is beyond this where the leak has occurred. It will be necessary to take out a small section of the brick work before being able to ascertain just how bad the leak is.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is essential to have the repairs done during mild weather I have advised the principal to get in touch with the local plumber and have the necessary repairs made as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting this action meets with your approval,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19, 1945.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, you may arrange for the repairs required to the plumbing and heating system at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Fergus, Ont.\n\nMessrs Smith & Chapple Ltd., who quoted and received the order for it, now advise that they will be unable to make delivery until well after the New Year. I wonder if you would endeavour, through the Purchasing Agent, to get earlier delivery than this.\n\nIt is important that we get it as soon as possible as in the meantime more of the boys' time is spent on the moving of litter than should be necessary, consequently they will lose out on some of their studies.\n\nThe description we have from the merchant's order was for one manure carrier to run on track, $50.40 list, as ordered on form A937 on Aug. 27th/45 by Smith & Chapple Ltd.\n\nF.

Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nTown.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with your request for a\nquotation in bringing the electric wiring and equip-\nment at the Indian Residential School at Chapleau,\nthe Principal's residence and the outbuildings as\ncovered by the Hydro Inspection Report of Sept.\n19th 1945 up to standard,\n\nWe have gone into the matter and are\nprepared to supply all materials, labour etc. to\nbring the building up to standard as pointed out\nin the Inspector's report for a total of $725.40.\nWe will go at the work if the price meets your app-\nroval, at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSmith & Chapple Ltd.\nPer (Signed) A.J. Grout.\nMr. F. Matters,\n\nBASMENT LAUNDRY.\n\nBranch circuit cutouts are heavily overfused.\nThe floor of this section is of a concrete mix nature and the operators using the hand electric irons are liable to severe shock should the metal parts of the irons become alive through faulty cords etc. We would recommend that mats of rubber or wood be supplied for the operators.\n\nWall receptacles are supplied for the connection of the electric hand irons. Should the operator leave the room without first disconnecting the cord from the receptacle, there would be a possibility of fire originating in the cloth cover or board. We would suggest that a switch and pilot light be added to each receptacle.\n\nELECTRIC MOTORS, General.\n\nAll motors should be grounded to conduit supply or water pipe.\nFuses in motor switches should be reduced to the lowest possible for adequate protection of each motor.\nThe present method of control of motors meets the requirements but we would strongly recommend the installation of thermal type controls in order to provide the maximum protection should minor grounds or motor winding faults appear.\n\nOUTBUILDINGS.\n\nRemove added extension cords from circuits in residence and install wall receptacles where required for portable devices.\nGround all conduit in stable, also Armoured Cable in chicken coops etc., to driven ground rods.\nRemove armoured cable from hay mow and replace with rigid conduit and dust-tite type hub fitting.\nRemove sub-standard wiring from root cellar and replace with lead covered wiring in conduit.\nOverhaul wood cutting wiring and equipment in yard and drive rods for grounding of same.\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent, Chapleau.\n\nSubject: St. John's Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nMAIN SERVICE and DISTRIBUTION.\n\nMain wire shows evidence of overheating; Resolder wire into copper lug.\nGround main neutral wire and metal parts to water pipe.\nAll stored materials to be kept clear of service equipment.\nReduce all sub-feeder cartridge fuses to not more than maximum capacity of wire.\n\nBRANCH CIRCUIT DISTRIBUTION CENTRES.\n\nThe branch circuit distribution centres consist of obsolete type open cutouts built into partitions throughout the building. We would strongly recommend that these assemblies be replaced with standard dead front, solid neutral, type panels.\nThe majority of the branch circuit cutouts are heavily overfused. All branch circuit fuses to be reduced to not more than 15 amps. Check load on each circuit and if overloaded, split into two or more circuits.\nThe branch circuit wiring is of rigid conduit type. All circuits should be tested individually and if grounds are indicated, circuit wires should be replaced.\n\nCONVENIENCE OUTLETS.\n\nAt the time that this building was originally wired very few wall convenience receptacles were installed. Due to the absence of these devices we find that there is a large amount of sub-standard cord extensions now in use throughout the building. These are secured to woodwork and walls by means of staples etc. This practice constitutes a very serious fire hazard and we would request that all added cord be immediately removed and that wall receptacles be installed for use of added equipment, where necessary.\n\nFIXTURES and CORDS.\n\nFixtures throughout building require to be overhauled. Where defective wire or sockets are found these should be replaced with standard material.\nCord drops containing joints should be replaced with new cord.\nAll sockets to be supplied with socket bushings where cord enters socket cap.\nRemove cord drops which are within reach of bathtubs and control same outlets with wall switches.\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nSubject: Electric wiring and equipment,\nSt. John's Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe are attaching a report of our findings following our recent general inspection of the electric wiring and equipment in the above named premises.\n\nWe trust that the defects which were found to be in evidence in the buildings will receive your early attention. There are certain defects which constitute definite fire hazards.\n\nShould you require further information in connection with this matter, kindly advise us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVB/B.\nDistrict Electrical Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Wiring the Chapleau School.\n\nIn September the District Electrical Inspector examined the wiring in the Chapleau School, and attached is a copy of his report which explains itself.\n\nOn receipt of this report, I requested Messrs Smith & Chappis, Ltd., who are the only people equipped to do electrical repair work in this district, for a quotation for labour and material to bring it up to standard.\n\nAttached also is a copy of that quotation in the amount of $725.40. The price appears high to me, but we are in the unfortunate position of not having any local competition. It is possible that we might get someone from Sudbury to do the work but it is hardly likely that they would be able to come to Chapleau just for an examination and to be able to quote a price on the work.\n\nI think the work should be done as soon as possible and would recommend that, if it is not possible to get any other contractor for the job, the enclosed tender be accepted, as it is most important to my mind to have the electric wiring rendered safe from fire hazard.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease accept my very best thanks for the 12 yards of rubber sheeting received a few days ago.

Both sides of the building need more room. Perhaps now that there will be spare Gymnasia outfits left over from the war work athletic places the Department may be in a position to supply us with both space and Outfits for our Girls and Boys.\n\n(2) Manual Training. This also has been brought before the Department at several times. I would like to institute this and are ready to do so if they will provide space and Equipment.\n\n(3) I had a garage put here to store my car. This was done at my own expense. I am leaving the work this year. I would be glad to dispose of this garage for the benefit of the man who succeeds me in this work. The price I would ask for the garage is $95.00. I trust the Department will be able to refund this to me.\n\nPerhaps I might state my resignation is due to age. I am due for Pension, and consider it my duty to make room for a younger man to take over the work.\n\n(4) Repairs are urgently needed to put the Stannions in the barn in good shape. I would like to see this done as soon as possible. The cattle now get out almost at will. We have had to use Hay Wire to make temporary repairs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 21, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nEnc.\n\nThe attached account has just been received from Denny Brothers.

I had in mind that this might be included in or with a suitable manual training room, they have the tools for manual training but have been unable to find room to teach this subject.\n\nOne of the main reasons for having a poor staff at the residential school is the lack of accommodation for married people, and I think that if small cottages were built for a couple of these then more reliable and stable staff could be secured.\n\nI do not know whether the tractor and truck come under our liability or not, but they would be valuable assets to the school in speeding up some outside jobs that now take a long time with horses.\n\nF. Matters, Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe File 65-1-5, May 7th.\n\nI am attaching copies of three tenders received for the re-roofing of the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nI am satisfied that any one of the three would do a satisfactory job. The highest priced tender (judging by quality of workmanship) would be the best, but is not absolutely essential, and I would leave the choice to be made by you from either of the other two, pointing out that C. W. Collins Stores have already had an order for a little over $1000.00 for this year.\n\nAlthough these tender prices are higher than what I estimated, I still think that it is absolutely necessary to put on a new roof this year, and that it be put on as described in the tenders, a built-up roof on the top where there is very little pitch and the most shrinking.

I beg to explain this was due to the former parts of the pump ordered having come without the stuffing box.

Forward, visited this school on April 16th and his report caused considerable unrest in the minds of members of our Commission. Mr. Forward specially commented on the run-down state of the building, the poor condition of the dining tables and benches and the rough cement floors in the dining room, kitchen and store rooms. He also reported that new stoves were required and the kitchen was very much in need of painting and being equipped with cupboards.\n\nI can fully confirm these criticisms and have reported the conditions on several occasions. This particular school building appears to have been neglected for some years and is now one of the poorest of all that we administer. I am not forgetting that a considerable outlay was incurred by your branch in constructing a new chimney after a fire had demonstrated that the previous structure in the centre of the building was unsafe. I am sure, however, that it is not your desire that the building should run-down to the point when it will require very costly repairs to bring it up to standard.\n\nI am asked to request that an official inspection of this building should be carried out and that necessary improvements should be effected as soon as I am able to get them in hand. May I specially stress again the condition of the cement floors. It is of dark and rough cement, exceedingly hard on the feet of our women workers and never looks clean however often it is washed. I hope that consideration may be given to providing some more suitable flooring especially for the kitchen and dining room. We expect to have a full staff of male workers during the summer with a new Principal, Engineer and Farm Instructor taking over in the fall and shall do our utmost to co-operate in carrying out any improvements that are decided upon.\n\nCommending this matter to your usual kind consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHAA/HR\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 16, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Colonel Henry, is communicating with our Indian Agent with a view to obtaining further information regarding the repairs required. As soon as his reply is received the matter will have further careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhillip Thomas,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

However, we desire to keep the school in as good a condition as our funds will permit.\n\nI would therefore appreciate it if you would let me have a report regarding the repairs that you consider absolutely essential, and, when supplying this information, you should let me have an estimate of the cost.

I expect the pipes will have to be procured locally.\n\nThe school is about two miles from the freight shed, we will have to get a truck and some men to handle this, also to get it into the school.

Drinking fountain in the boy's recreation room to be moved into the same section as the wash basins.\n\nTotal price for the above materials and labour $1487.00.\n\nWe have materials for cement work, flooring and flashing in stock, and expect to be able to get linoleum without much delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSmith & Chapple Ltd.,\nper (signed)\nA. J. Grout.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nWhen Mr. Arneil was here last week, we made a very thorough inspection of all the floors of the basement of the above school and agreed that the following repairs and alterations should be made:\n\n1st. The floors of the girl's recreation room and the bakery should have hardwood floors laid over a subfloor and galvanized iron should be flashed around the walls of the bakery to prevent mice getting in.\n\n2nd. The boy's recreation room and the dairy should be covered with a good layer of cement to a minimum of 2\u00bd inches, later to be painted. The drinking fountain in the boy's recreation room should be moved into the section containing the wash basins. This would keep all the water together and by raising the cement at the step, would stop it from running over the floor.\n\n3rd. The dining room and passageways and kitchen should be covered with heavy battleship linoleum. The floors would have to be prepared for this as they are not even and then the linoleum cemented down.\n\nThis would leave a good surface in the whole basement most suitable for the usage of the different rooms, and one that could be kept clean and made attractive.\n\nI would recommend that if at all possible this work be done and to that end I am enclosing a copy of a tender for the complete job from Smith & Chapple Ltd., and would suggest that you get in touch with Mr. Arneil for any further information which you may require.\n\nFor Mr. Littler, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, September 6, 1945.\n\nMr. P.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nLast month telephone communication with the Chapleau School was disrupted due to a break in the line.\n\nThis has been a continuous source of trouble as the line was strung on trees through the bush taking a short cut rather than go around by way of the road.\n\nIt was decided, in consultation with the telephone company, that the line should go around the highway. The school supplied the necessary poles and they were erected and the line carried through by the company.\n\nThere will be an account of a little under $46.00 for labour and material on this change and I would request your authority to put this through when it is received.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

His letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Additional shelves in the clockroom and a dozen sound beds with springs and mattresses for the staff would be most acceptable.\"\n\nPlease let us know exactly what is required to carry out the Bishop's recommendation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Bishop Wright:\n\nI have received your letter of the 5th instant with reference to your recent visit to the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is our intention to communicate with the Indian Agent regarding the springs and mattresses which you recommend for the staff bedrooms.\n\nYour other recommendations will receive consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector\n\nRt. Rev. W.L. Wright, D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nTimiskaming,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOntario.\nIt was pointed out by members of the staff that after a day on duty, involving, in most cases, a good deal of going up and down stairs, that a really comfortable bed would be very much appreciated to provide a better rest. At the present time the springs are too weak for an adult and it is not possible to get into a comfortable position for sleep.\n\nI trust that the above information covers all the points needed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. Atters,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 65-1-5(WT-1) letter Nov. 16th/46.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of the above letter regarding the Chapleau School and the recommendations made by the Rt. Rev. William L. Wright, D.D., Bishop of Algoma.\n\nI accompanied the Bishop when he went through the school, which is being reorganized at the present time under a new principal. One of the things pointed out by the staff was the very awkward layout in the upstairs clothing storage rooms.\n\nThere are two narrow rooms with a very high ceiling and the shelves for storage start about five feet from the floor, and it is necessary for the staff to use a stepladder almost continually when putting away or getting out clean clothing for the children. It was suggested that if the shelves on the floor were started from the floor and built up, and on the other side a piece of pipe hung underneath the present shelving so that clothing could be hung on hangers, it would be much easier to handle the clothing. This applies to both the boys and the girls storage cloak rooms.\n\nWith regard to the beds, the staff are using the same springs and mattresses as were got for the children, and although they are strong enough for a child, they are not strong enough to make a comfortable bed for an adult. I think that the beds themselves are all right but would agree that better quality springs and mattresses are needed for the staff. I would recommend that, if it is possible, twelve 3'3\" size and two 4'6\" size slat springs and spring filled mattresses to match the above springs be purchased.\nOttawa, 20 November 1946.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nCHAPLEAU, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the Chapleau School.\n\nWith regard to the proposed change in the storage rooms you should let us know the approximate cost of material and labour required.\n\nIs it possible for you to secure a quotation on the cost of the springs and mattresses required for the staff bedrooms. If so, you should forward the quotation for our consideration. If not, it will be necessary to let us know the length of the beds. In your letter you only state the width.\n\nBernard J.

Is that amount sufficient to cover the floors of the rooms mentioned and does the word \"passageways\" refer to the halls? If not, what additional linoleum would be required for the halls?\n\nAre the floors in the Girls' recreation room and bakery in sufficiently good condition to permit linoleum being used on them? If so, you should let me know the area of each room.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let us have a reply by return mail as War Assets Corporation only hold items for a few days.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nChapleau Ontario\nDecember 14th, 1946\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 65-1-5 (W.T. 1.)\n\nIn reply to your letter as above regarding the basement floors in the Chapleau School.\n\nThe word \"passageways\" refers to the halls. I interviewed Messrs Smith & Chapple regarding the area, and they advise that 215 square yards is a very close estimate as there will be some waste in laying, and they were going to order 220 yards if the contract were awarded to them; therefore I would recommend getting that amount to be sure of having enough.\n\nThe floors in the girls recreation room and the bakery are the same as the others we are going to cover; they will need some levelling up, as will have to be done all round; we had considered the laying of wood floors on these on account of the expense, but if the linoleum can be got from War Assets at a reasonable price then this would be preferable, the area of the girls recreation room is 90 square yards and that of the bakery 32 square yards.\n\nTrusting this is enough information to allow you to proceed, I will try to get this letter on the train tonight.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Eight were finished and are now occupied. Six others are all finished outside and the majority of the inside work done, and it will not take long to complete these when we start operations next summer.\n\nThe new roof was completed on the Chapleau School in the early part of the quarter, and a new stove is here and will be installed in the next week or so. Alterations were made in the storage rooms. In general I would say that the atmosphere around the school and the morale of the children is considerably improved under the new principal. In connection with this school I think the next thing that ought to be done is the replacement of the tables and benches used in the dining room. As reported before, they have been in use since the school was opened and, as the tops are of wood covered with a cheap linoleum during the course of time due to the linoleum breaking or the edges opening, a certain amount of water has seeped underneath, which creates both an offensive odor and a breeding place for worms under the cover. The condition of these tables was noted by Mr. Arneil last year, and while I am fully aware that a considerable amount of money has been spent this year and the available funds are apt to be getting low, I would still recommend that a serious effort be made either to secure enough tables, etc., from discarded military equipment or enough money be provided to have them built locally.\n\nApplication has been made for an educational trapping license in the name of the principal of the school, so that the older boys can be taught how to trap and properly dress the pelts. The township of Chapleau has been reserved for this purpose.\n\nOn the Constance Lake Reserve, near the school, the underbrush and most of the trees have been removed to eliminate fire hazard to the school and other buildings.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 3rd reporting on the Chapleau Residential School, you are aware that the end of the fiscal year is approaching and nearly all our funds are assigned. However, you might let me know what it would cost to have the tables built locally.\n\nIn applying you might state the cost per table so that if funds are not available for all that are needed, we could authorize some of them.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApart from the loss of tools and damage to the wiring there was not much damage; we will have to build another door and frame to replace the one that was burnt, and replace the electrical equipment that was damaged or destroyed.\n\nThis fire in the furnace room brings up a matter that was discussed some considerable time ago, namely the danger of having the fire pump in the building where it could be rendered useless by a power breakdown; when the new water main was installed in 1941 provision was made by leaving a shut off valve outside the school so that the pump could be moved outside, and another small building erected to house it, and I think that it would be advisable to have this done as soon as possible.\n\nWhen I arrived with the local fire brigade I found that the school staff had everything well in hand, the children outside in good order and all the staff quite calm and doing anything that could be done to contain the fire, and I would say that this saved the whole building.\n\nPlease advise if you desire to have the accounts for repairs to the wiring etc., put through during the present fiscal year or held until 1947-48, I would also recommend that the doors leading from the furnace room be fireproofed by being covered with galvanised iron.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI have to report that we had a small fire in the Chapleau Residential School yesterday afternoon about 4 p.m.\n\nThe fire occurred in the furnace room in the basement of the school, destroying a cupboard which contained a quantity of tools, the door leading up to the passage way between the kitchen and laundry, and some of the electric wiring.\n\nThe fire was first noticed by the engineer who immediately got some of the fire hose with which the school is equipped working, whilst the children were being led out of the building by the members of the staff, by the time the local fire brigade got down the fire was almost out and it was only necessary for them to use some of their portable equipment to ensure that the fire was dead between the walls.\n\nIt would appear that the fire was due to some electrical defect, as the motor for the pump was burnt out, one fuse box was entirely destroyed and another one damaged, as the wiring had been very recently brought up to standard and examined by the Hydro inspector. I thought it advisable to have him come up as soon as possible to investigate and if possible find the reason for future protection, I called him by long distance at Sault Ste. Marie but he is not able to come here until some time in April, however I am holding the motor, along with the damaged fuse boxes and other equipment for his inspection.\n\nIn the meantime I have authorized the only available electrician, from Collins Stores Ltd., to make what repairs are necessary to get light and power going again.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th inst., with reference to the small fire at the Chapleau Residential School. We are pleased to know that there were no serious results. We note your recommendation that the fire pump should be removed outside and a small building erected to cover it. Authority is granted for moving this pump as soon as conditions permit. It is expected, of course, that you will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the doors leading from the furnace room fire proofed by being covered by galvanised iron.\n\nPlease submit the account for the repairs to the wiring. If we have funds available we will pay it this month. If not, it will have to be held until next month.\n\nBernard T. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChapleau Ontario\nMarch 7th, 1947\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 65-1-5 (WT 1)\nLetter March 5th, 1947\n\nIn reply to your letter as above regarding the tables at the Chapleau Residential School,\n\nI have made enquiry in Chapleau and find that although there are men available to make the tables, there is no suitable lumber in the town; it is all very poor quality and it would be a waste of money to make them of such material.\n\nThe best chance appeared to be at Hearst, where, with the assistance of Mr. Larson I have been able to get good lumber for our Constance Lake project, and I have written him asking for a quotation on the tables; he is a very good carpenter and I am sure his work will be satisfactory, but it will be too late to get much done before the end of the month, as it will take a week to get a reply, then by the time I write you and again advise him two weeks will be gone; however if you want to allocate any sum of money for this purpose and advise me of the amount, as soon as I receive his quotation, if it appears satisfactory, I can advise him to make enough tables to use up the money allotted.\n\nF. Latters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. P.

Fir and advises that if the tables were made of this the cost would be $20.00 each.\n\nHe is in a position to make these tables if he can start soon, but as soon as the weather improves he has some outside work waiting that he would like to start work on before we require him for the Constance Lake reserve building.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. P. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, and previous correspondence regarding tables for the dining room at the Chapleau Residential School, we are advised by War Assets Corporation that they have tables available. These were used in Army Camps and are seventy-two inches long and thirty inches wide. They have folding legs. We can secure these for $7.00 each, plus cost of transportation.\n\nPlease let me know if these would be suitable and if so how many are required.\n\nBernard F.

School,\nChapleau Ont...................\n\nNOTE: This order completed.\n\n\"Ottawa's Most Popular Sports Centre\"\nthe greater part of the walls and ceilings are still beaver board. Having had two fires start in this school in the past six years, I feel that we should make every possible provision to make the building as fire resistant as possible.\n\nWith regard to the amount of $1500.00 which has been left in the appropriations, this is about the amount of the tender made at that time by Smith & Chapple Ltd. to repair the basement floors and put them in decent shape by covering them with battleship linoleum or wood in the different rooms. Under date of December 13th/46 you wrote requesting information regarding the amount of battleship linoleum required for these floors and on Dec. 14th I replied that a minimum of 226 yds. was necessary with the possibility of using 122 yds. extra if it could be procured at a reasonable price. To date nothing further has been heard of this. As soon as I know the situation with regard to this linoleum, I will be in a better position to decide how the amount will be spent to best advantage. As all the work should be done during the summer holidays, I would appreciate early advice on the matter.\n\nTo sum up, I would say that the amount allowed is entirely inadequate. The basement floors have been condemned by everyone who has seen them as being unsatisfactory. The present principal is very dissatisfied with his living accommodation, which, with a family of two boys and one girl, the girl has to sleep in their bedroom. I personally do not want to accept the responsibility for the safety of the children in the school unless every effort is made to reduce the fire hazard.\n\nI trust you will find it possible to, if necessary, apply for a supplementary appropriation to cover these things which are definitely essential.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau, Ont.,\nJune 10th/47.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: File 65-1-5, (WT-1)\nLetter June 3rd/47.\n\nIn reply to your letter as above I must express my disappointment in the amount appropriated for the coming year at the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nI had included $3000.00 as accommodation for farm instructor, who at the present time is living with his wife and infant child in the attic of the school and these quarters are not protected by a fire escape. Since the sending in of the estimates the principle has been appointed and he is living with his wife and three children in a very small cottage which has only two bedrooms and they are definitely overcrowded. I had had in mind the building of the new cottage for the Principle and allowing the Farm Instructor to take over the present cottage.\n\nThe danger from fire is real and I think every effort should be made to provide accommodation so that the attic may be vacated.\n\nAlso included was a sum to cover the erection of a building so that manual training could be carried out and reasonable recreation facilities be provided indoors. In my opinion these two items, manual training and recreation, are badly needed at this school.\n\nAn amount of $1500.00 was included for the purpose of replacing paper wallboard, which has proven itself to be a definite fire hazard, with gyproc. A certain amount of this was done a few years ago, but\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWe have received your letter of June 10th, with reference to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nDepartmental officials realize that there are many improvements that can be made to buildings at all our residential schools and when preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year we had very numerous requests, the total of which was so large that all of them could not receive favourable consideration in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe amount of $1,500 provided for the Chapleau school compares very favourably with the amounts provided at other residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nIt was our first intention to provide an amount which would enable us to erect manual training buildings at several residential schools but this item was deleted from our estimates and consequently we have no funds this year for that particular purpose, and as you have been previously advised, the amount of $1,500 is all that we can provide for repairs and improvements at the Chapleau school.\n\nI note from your letter that as soon as you have additional information from Smith & Chapple Ltd., regarding the battleship linoleum that you consider necessary, you will write to us again.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nChapleau, Ont.,\nJuly 7th/47.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 65-1-5, (WT-1)\nLetter July 3rd/47.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter as above regarding repairs for the Chapleau Residential School, and before making any decision as to how the $1800.00 should be spent, I would like to have the matter of the linoleum cleared up from your office.\n\nI would refer you to your letter of the same file, dated December 13th/46, where it was intimated that you were in a position to procure this linoleum from the War Assets Corporation. Will you kindly advise if this linoleum was procured or is available so that I can make some decision regarding expenditure. The only information which I needed to get from Smith & Chapple, and which I gave you in my letter of December 14th, was the amount of linoleum required.\n\nIf no linoleum is available, the amount appropriated will not cover the cost of repairing the basement floors and it would appear to me that this will have to be left for another year in the deplorable condition they are now in.\n\nPlease advise as soon as possible so that this matter may be cleared up.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant\nwith reference to previous correspondence regarding\nlinoleum for the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nPrevious to writing to you on December\n13th, 1946, we were advised by one of the officials\nin the office of the M.S.C.O., that he thought he\ncould secure linoleum from War Assets Corporation.\n\nSubsequently he advised us that linoleum\ncould not be secured from the Corporation.\n\nWe can purchase linoleum for approximately\n$2.00 a square yard.\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MOD\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SUPERINTENDENT\nREV CANON H.A. ALDERWOOD DD\n\nJuly 9, 1947\n\nColonel B. F. Neary, Superintendent,\nWelfare & Training Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary: Re: St. John's Indian School, Chapleau,\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the above school and desire at once to express my strong feeling in regard to the state of the building. I have on several occasions reported in similar terms to the Branch and understand that your Inspector and Agent have made many suggestions along similar lines. My discouragement arises from the fact that practically nothing appears to have been done in the past two or three years to make this building fit for the purpose for which it is being used.\n\nIn few words, this school is at the present time a disgrace both to the Government that owns it and our Church, which has been made responsible for the administration. It would seem that very little has been spent for years to maintain the building and it is in need of repair, plastering and painting from end to end. The whole basement area, in which the working quarters of the school are located, is almost beyond description. The floors are of a rough and dark cement which cannot appear clean, no matter how often they are scrubbed. In the children's dining room the floor has been broken up to allow access to the main below and unsightly holes have been left. The so-called boys' play-room floor has been so badly broken that it is really beyond description. The dining room has been given new tables recently which have come from some army camp and are not ideal but are a tremendous advance on the terrible tables formerly used. The benches, however, are beyond repair and the same condition prevails in the sewing room where the tables and benches are altogether unfit for use.\n\nThe Agent tells me that his repeated requests have been refused and that only a small item has been placed in the appropriation for the current year which will probably provide\nfloor covering for the basement rooms. My final impression is that this building ought not to be used until very considerable changes have been effected. I tremble to think of the effect that would be produced upon the members of the present Parliamentary Committee if they should visit this school in its present state and do not feel that we should be left in the position of taking the blame for what is really not our responsibility.\n\nOur Principal is prepared to do what is possible during the summer months with the limited help available to brighten up parts of the building with paint if this is supplied, but I feel that when a school is so badly run down it calls for nothing less than a complete renewal, and this is altogether beyond our capacity.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will look into this question and I am confident that you will find on your files plenty of evidence in support of what is written above. I can say without hesitation that this building is now in worse condition than any other administered by our Church.\n\nThanking you for your consideration, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\n\nHAA/BP\nOttawa, July 15th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nI desire to refer to recent correspondence with regard to the Chapleau Residential School. Today I received another letter on similar lines to your own from Reverend Canon H.A. Alderwood, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C.\n\nYou stated in your letter of June 10th that you expected to receive a tender from Smith and Chapple Ltd., with reference to repairing the basement floors. We will give this immediate consideration when received.\n\nDoctor Alderwood points out that while the new tables are reasonably satisfactory, the benches in the dining room are beyond repair. He also states that new tables and benches are required in the sewing rooms. Would it not be possible to purchase material and have new benches and tables made.\n\nDoctor Alderwood states that the staff is prepared to give some help in brightening up various parts of the building if paint is supplied. Authority is granted for the purchase of paint not to exceed $75.00.\n\nLeonard F.

G.A.Crawley,\nPrincipal of the school does not lend itself to any addi-\ntion of a room or rooms, and we think it might be well\nbe left as it is for the use of some other member of the\nstaff who is married and has a smaller family, and a six\nor seven roomed house built as a Principal's residence\nat the earliest possible date.\n\nMr. Arneil has read over this letter and agrees\nwith the recommendations, he will discuss any phase you\nwish on his return to Ottawa.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nRe: Chapleau Residential School\n\nOn July 14th & 15th, Mr. Arneil and myself made an extensive survey of the condition of the buildings at the above school, and found that the following needed to be done to bring the school into reasonable repair:\n\n1. There was a leak in the laundry roof where it joined on to the main building, needs to be repaired before more damage was occasioned to the ceilings inside.\n\n2. The floors in the basement needed to be repaired and renovated as per the tender enclosed with my estimates sent in to you in August 1946; there will be a change in the price quoted due to the price of labour and material quoted and used in the tender.\n\n3. All existing Paper wall board should be removed from the rooms and passageways and replaced with Gyproc to reduce the fire hazard and improve the appearance.\n\n4. The present Ice box system of refrigeration is inadequate, and an electric refrigerator is necessary to keep food for over 100 people; the old ice box has been repaired as a temporary measure but we recommend that a walk-in box be built utilizing the space next to the present Dairy which appears to have been intended.\n\n5. The fire-pump upon which we depend in case of a fire is located in the furnace room which is the most likely spot for fire to start, and in a very short while after a fire started the pump would be useless; when the new water main was installed some years ago, I made provision for such a change by leaving a shut-off valve a short distance away from the building; this pump should now be moved outside where we could depend upon a continuous water supply in case of need.\n\n6. A triple sink should be installed in the old pantry which is...\nOttawa, July 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nFollowing his return to Ottawa, we have discussed with Inspector Arnell your letter of July 16th regarding the repairs that you consider necessary at the Chapleau Residential School. We are prepared to favourably consider the following:\n\n- Repairs to Laundry Roof..............$250.00\n- Renovate and improve Basement Floor..$750.00\n- Move existing Hall Board and substitute Gyproc..................$1000.00\n- Minor Repairs..........................$250.00\n\nWe understand from your communication that the above mentioned figures are approximate and as we have to submit the matter for the Minister's approval, we will require a tender from some firm. Tenderer should state the price at which they are prepared to do the work and the extent of the work for which the price is quoted. The name and address of the firm should also be given.\n\nI presume that item 5 of your letter, namely removal of the pump outside will not involve any heavy expenditure and you may arrange for this.\n\nIf possible, let us have a quotation for the sink which you consider should be installed in the pantry.\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe 3 H.P. 110 volt single phase motor which is used as an auxiliary supply would also be changed to 220 volts and the magnetic switch for it would be manually controlled.\n\nWe trust that the authorities whom you will consult regarding this matter will see fit to have these changes made as soon as possible as at the present time no adequate protection is provided on this motor circuit.\n\nWe were sorry that during our recent visit we were unable to contact you but each time we were near your establishment we tried your door but were unable to locate you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsigned Val. B. Bizley\nDistrict Electrical Inspector.\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring our recent inspection trip to Chapleau we visited the Residential School and made an inspection of the motor work installed by Charles W. Colline Stores Ltd., this work being the replacement or equipment damaged in the fire. The electrician explained to us the condition of the conduit after the fire and we are of the opinion that this damage would be caused through the equipment being surrounded by fire rather than the cause of the fire. We arrived at this conclusion due to the fact that the parts of the conduit were found to be in a melted condition. This condition is quite often found to exist when wire in conduit is subjected to sufficient heat to destroy the insulation on the wire at which time an arc is drawn between the copper wire and the grounded metal conduit. In a case of grounding of the wires directly to the conduit the fuses protecting the circuit would open.\n\nIn this pump room there is at present a three H.P., 110 volt single phase motor, temporarily installed as understood, pending the arrival of the original motor. This motor is operated by a pressure switch; the fuses in the main switch of this device have been removed and the motor is, therefore, protected only by the main 60 amp fuses.\n\nIn order to supply adequate protection for this motor we would suggest that an enclosed type switch be provided for starting the motor, the existing pressure switch being used only for the operation of this magnetic switch. The motor should be reconnected to 220 volts instead of 110 volts.\nChapleau, Ont.,\nJuly 30th/47.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed please find the report of Mr. Val. B. Bizley, District Electrical Inspector, on the electrical repairs in the pump room following the recent fire in the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information and any necessary action.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing copy of a report received from the District Electric Inspector with reference to the electric repairs in the pump room at the Chapleau School. In view of his report the following changes are approved:\n\nIn order to supply adequate protection for this motor we would suggest that an enclosed type switch be provided for starting the motor, the existing pressure switch being used only for the operation of this magnetic switch. The motor would be reconnected to 220 volts instead of 110 volts.\n\nThe 3 H.P., 110 volt single phase motor which is used as an auxiliary supply would also be changed to 220 volts and the magnetic switch for it would be manually controlled.\n\nYou may arrange to have the work done at as low a cost as possible.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. McNeil and his wife and child is living in an apartment in the attic of the school, which in the summer is terribly hot, the temperature in the apartment last night at nine o'clock being 92 degrees, and in the winter it is unsafe, with no fire escape available.\n\nMr. Youngman and his wife are occupying space in the school which is needed for other members of the staff. He appears to be a very efficient engineer, something which has been required at this school for a long time, and they cannot continue to occupy their present quarters much longer.\n\nBoth these men have expressed their willingness to sacrifice their own spare time and holidays to assist in building other accommodation. They propose building either one large log house or two small ones. A rough plan of the small house is enclosed, and I think this latter would be preferable. They are prepared to get the logs and build the walls themselves, if we will provide materials and help to finish off the inside.\n\nThis matter is so urgent for the efficient operation of the school that I would strongly urge that every assistance be given them immediately.

Part of the reason for this was to reduce the amount of labour performed by the older girls. At the present time the pupils are being instructed in baking in small quantities along the home baking lines.\n\nIt is desired to use the room known as the bakery as the staff dining room, this being handier to the kitchen, making for less work and a closer contact between the staff and the children. To enable this to be done we will have to move out the portable oven.\n\nAs it is surplus to their requirements and so old and also in need of repairs, I would recommend that it be disposed of to Mr. Ken Faught, of the Central Bakery, Chapleau, who has seen the oven and made an offer of $40.00 as it now stands.\n\nIn view of the above, I would recommend that this tender be accepted unless you have another school to which it may be shipped.\n\nF.

We will do what we can to utilize existing escapes but I feel it is my duty to make this report to you of the dangers of the situation as I see it.\n\nThis building has been standing for 25 years and has never had any general repairs done to it. The present Agent has struggled along to put what has really amounted to necessities; for example new water main, new chimney when the old one set the place on fire, and new roof after the water had come in and ruined all the ceilings in the place. He now has got permission to have the ceilings repaired and new floors laid downstairs.\n\nI wish you could look over this building yourself, for to describe it is impossible. We have now three rooms in decent appearance with the new paint; however, the local contractor was in last evening and, after marvelling at the changed appearance, said, \"If you're going to get any sort of paint to do this building,\" What is really needed here is an experienced builder to examine the whole place and really have it renovated. I feel that there is need for a very heavy expenditure to bring it up to standard and that this is more than an inexperienced mind can be expected to accomplish.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDING\n\nThe front steps are rotting to pieces and the top bricks of the high furnace chimney are commencing to fall apart.\n\nThere has to be a residence for the Principal next summer or I am afraid I will have to look for better lodgings elsewhere. We are at present living with four of us in one bedroom that is not large enough for any self-respecting couple to occupy. There would not be room enough for a small bedroom suite in it and the walls are only 3 feet high at the sides.\n\nThe barn needs very considerable repairs if we continue with cattle or large conversion plans if we change it to a recreation center for the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt., Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Refrigeration, Chapleau School\n\nThis morning in your office we discussed refrigeration and I mentioned that, as a result of a recent farm report indicating that milk had spoiled, I had written for a report on the refrigeration facilities there. The place in question was Chapleau and when I returned to my office I found the undermentioned report, dated 1st October, from the Principal of that school.\n\n\"During August when we had only a few children, there was more milk than we could use and we arranged for the local dairy to take one milking a day. However the remainder was frequently spoiled before the next meal due to no facilities for proper cooling and no refrigeration.\n\n\"This matter has been under discussion with the Dept. and the local Agent over the past two years but so far there has been no action in the matter. Inspector Arnell was here during the summer and when I took him to see our refrigeration plant, his only comment was \"disgusting.\" And it was, but that is what we have had to use to keep our food and milk. It consisted of two old ice boxes that were in such poor condition that the water from the melting ice ran down into the milk and food and then through onto the floor of the dairy. That was bad enough but the we packed sufficient ice last winter to last us the summer, the old ice house is in such bad condition that half of it melted and before the end of August we had no ice left.\n\n\"In one day not long ago I had to throw out some 50 lbs. of meat and all the morning's milk as it had all spoiled. The agent here has repeatedly asked for all these things.\"\n\nI am sure you will agree that, under conditions as described, the preservation of foodstuffs that require\nrefrigeration becomes difficult if not impossible. We would be very glad, therefore, of any action you can take to remedy the situation.\n\nObviously, a new installation is required and I suggest for consideration a large or \"walk-in\" type in which a reasonably large quantity of meat could be stored so that we could take advantage of purchase by the quarter, side or carcass.\n\nAt your convenience, will you please advise what you will be able to do in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. R. Turner\nFor Superintendent\n\nGRT/6E\n(b) For some time we had continual troubles with the irons in the laundry until we found there was a short that was putting just twice the current through the irons that they were supposed to be carrying.\n\n(c) The wiring in the pump room entirely burned through the insulation and had to be replaced.\n\n\"None of the above caused any serious trouble but it is very disturbing to everyone who knows the danger.\n\n\"What chance would anybody have to escape in case of fire? The entire building except the upper part of the walls of the rooms and hall are of wood or other combustible material and once fire started it would spread rapidly. The stair wells extend from the basement to the attic and would make a natural chimney. The fire that we had demonstrated the rapidity with which smoke and fire would rush up the stairs and fill the building. The connecting main hall would give added draft and would effectively seal off both ways of escape in a matter of minutes. We actually saw how the smoke did fill the whole building to a point where it was almost impassable even in the middle of the day.\n\n\"What of the fire escapes? There is a steel stairway from each of the junior dormitories. This is a stair about 30\" wide built close to the eaves of the building so that every snow during the winter melts and forms a load of ice on the fire escape. On the boys' side there is also a section of roof to climb over that would be a very long step for a man; this is a metal roof and in winter is very slippery so that the only way to get a smaller boy over it is for an adult to stand by and shove them over. On each side of the building are the senior dormitories which have 20 pupils each, and their only access to a fire escape is out into the hallway, then through the washroom and the junior dormitory, or down the hall past the head of the stairs and into the junior dormitory. Either of these routes could very rapidly become impossible through smoke or flames. One staff member would have to cross the hall while two would have to pass the length of the hall and across the head of the stairs. On the boys' side there would still be several people on the next floor that would have to get down the stairs and out by the boys' escape. The boys' fire escape has been condemned by the Agent as entirely unsafe but until such time as new construction of cottages removes the necessity of using this part of the building, we have no other accommodation. As I see the situation, there is a possibility that, if a fire had a few minutes start, some forty children and six or eight staff members would be trapped without access to fire escapes some 25 feet above the ground and beyond the reach of any ladders we are able to get here. I do not know if there is much we can do to improve matters unless it is the erecting of additional...\"\nOctober 3rd, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. G. R. Turner\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt.

It could happen again.\n\n\"During the past three months we have had three shorts in our electric system as follows:\n\n(a) The sewing room light shorted and would not switch off so we had to remove the fuse from that corner of the building for a week until we were able to locate the short.\"\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nMr. F.

Henry\nSupt. of Welfare Training.\nThere is no question but that a considerable amount of money will need to be spent on this school and I think that if we can depend upon competent people being put in charge of the installation and maintenance, it will be worth while.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nthat, if funds are available, a contractor be hired to paint the rooms and passageways affected.\n\nSchool Building:\nI find that all the front steps need is a few hours work by a carpenter and a couple of coats of paint. Next year the top of the furnace chimney should be repaired and the plaster pointed.\n\nPrincipal's residence:\nThis has been dealt with in previous letters and recommendations and I hope it will be possible to build a new house next year.\n\nBarn:\nThe cattle are being dispensed with as it is cheaper to buy milk than to produce it here and by next spring they should all be removed.\n\nThis building could be converted into an excellent recreation room suitable for games etc., but a small stable would have to be built to accommodate the three horses it is proposed to keep.\n\nRefrigeration:\nFunds were included in the 1948-49 estimates for the installation of a walk-in refrigerator. There is no question of the need, both from the point of view of economy and health. I trust it will be possible to have this installed next year.\n\nGeneral:\nWork will be started on the basement floors in the near future. Material is now being accumulated for the job. The linoleum, cement and gravel for the floors, and the gypsum for the ceilings have all been delivered to the school.\n\nThe plumbing and heating system in the school has been in continuous use now for 23 years and during most of this time the engineers in charge have not been very competent. This is something about which I know very little and I would ask that, if possible, a heating engineer be sent by the Board to make a thorough inspection and report on its condition. We are having some trouble at the present time, but expect to be able to get through this winter.\nIndian Affairs Branch, O. Lava.\n\nRes: File 65-1-5 (W.T.-1)\nLetter October 10th/47.\n\nIn reply to your letter as above and the attached letter from the Office of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, which I will deal with by paragraphs.\n\nFire Hazard:\nThere is no doubt that there is a fire hazard due to the age of the electrical installation. The sewing room light referred to has been repaired, also the wiring in the laundry and the pump room. There is no doubt that in time all the wiring should be replaced. My policy during the last few years is to have one major repair or replacement made each year, and in the meantime keep other parts of the installation going with temporary repairs.\n\nWith regard to fire escapes. They are inadequate and there should be some installed at the front of the building to obviate crossing the passageway referred to in the letter. Those at the back are inadequate, but awkward. I have no doubt that they would serve in an emergency.\n\nIt is expected that the family will be moved out of the attic when the new cottage is completed.\n\nMain Building:\nThis is gradually being improved, and with the replacement of a good deal of the wallboard with gyproc the appearance will be very much improved, and the fire hazard reduced. More paint will be required when the gyproc is applied and I would recommend in this regard\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File-65-1-5 (W.T. 1)\nLetter October 1st/47.\n\nIn reply to your letter as above regarding progress made to provide living accommodation for the Farm Instructor and the Engineer at the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nTo date all the necessary logs have been hauled to the site, enough rough lumber and gyproc has been purchased in sufficient quantity for both cottages. The walls of one cottage and most of the rafters have been erected, but at the present rate it would not be finished before the weather turns too cold, as both men are busy at this time of year.\n\nThey have tried hard to achieve their objective, but have to acknowledge now that it is a physical impossibility. Therefore, I have secured the services of William Moore, an Indian who is a competent carpenter, to assist for a couple of weeks, which should ensure the completion of one cottage for use this winter. I might add that the water has been laid from the school to the vicinity of the cottages.\n\nI have on hand at the present time $385.93 and have yet to purchase roofing, doors and windows, sinks and pay for the carpenter. This will be very close, but I think we will have one cottage completed this year with a good deal of the material for the other on hand.\n\nJ.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No. 97 (65) Date 31/7/67\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nAt Noon on Mar. 2nd a fire was reported at the above school and I went down immediately with the Chapleau Fire Brigade.\n\nOn arrival we found that it had been extinguished by the school staff. The outbreak consisted of a fire on the outside of the building just above the stone foundation. The floor inside was quite hot and the walls were warm. Part of the cement trim and some stucco had been pulled off to get at the seat of the fire, and, to insure that there was no fire in the walls and between the floors, a small area in the ceiling of the basement storeroom was pulled off.\n\nThere are no electric wires, stove pipes or chimneys at the location of the fire, and, after a careful examination by the chief of the local Fire Brigade and myself, we arrived at the conclusion that it had been caused by a spark from the laundry chimney dropping down into a very narrow crack, where the cement had been forced away from the building by the action of frost.\n\nAs the wall was broken through, and to prevent any danger of frozen pipes, I had a carpenter go down at once to make the necessary repairs. The total amount of damage would be between $25.00 and $50.00. There appeared to be no doubt that the fire was purely accidental, and the school staff did well to kill it before it had the opportunity to spread.\n\nF. Matters,\nSuperintendent,\nChapleau Indian Agency.\nOttawa, March 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDirector, Land and Development Services Branch,\nChapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above residential school was erected after the first war and has never been a particularly satisfactory building. Mr. Indian Superintendent Butten recently visited the Department and requested that one of your engineers visit this school and render a detailed report as to its present physical condition. From the information which he provided, it would seem evident that we are going to have major repairs at this school in the near future and that therefore we should now have a report concerning requirements, so that we can include an amount for this work in our next year's estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nFile: 65-1-5\nDate: March 6, 1948\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTo: Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nOn his recent visit to the Department Superintendent, Matters suggested the following improvements that he considers are urgently required at the Chapleau Indian Residential School:\n\n(1) Refrigeration Unit - $1,500.00\n\n(2) Remodel Barn\n\nMr. Matters states that the barn is no longer being used and suggests remodelling it to be used as a manual training room and play room for the boys.\n\n(3) New Principal's Residence\n\nA new principal's residence is urgently required. The principal is a married man with a wife and three children.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMarch 4th, 1948\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThis office letter of 3rd October, 1947, to you submitting services for inclusion in your 1948-49 Estimates in respect of the above-mentioned school contained a lengthy extract from the Principal's report on the fire hazards and lack of fire escapes there.\n\nI now have received a letter dated 2nd March from the Principal which reads as follows:\n\n\"When we arrived back from the station we found everything in excitement as the building was on fire from the chimney. It was not anything serious from a damage point of view but as it is the second time we have had a fire start in less than a year, I wish to again emphasize the fire hazard that we have here and refer to the report I put in last October; briefly, that in case of a fire getting a head start during the night, half of the occupants of the building, both staff and children, would be trapped some 50 feet from the ground without any means of escape. This is the third time a fire has started from reasons beyond our control, which is a most disturbing situation for those who live in the building especially.\n\n\"We can be again most thankful that the present fire occurred during the daytime and was quickly extinguished. The conduct of all was splendid and the action of Mr. McNeill and the boys in bringing the fire fighting equipment into action received high commendation from the town fire department.\"\n\nWill you please advise me of what action is being taken to reduce the fire hazards to which the Indian children and staff at this school are exposed as described in this office letter of 3rd October, 1947, and in the foregoing quotation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nMarch 10, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Chapleau, Ontario,\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a letter just received from the M.S.C.C. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of October 11th with which we forwarded to you a copy of a letter from the M.S.C.C. dated October 3rd. You replied in your letter of November 1st, 1947.\n\nAt that time you wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"With regard to fire escapes, they are inadequate and there should be some installed at the front of the building to obviate crossing the passage-way referred to in the letter. Those at the back are awkward but I have no doubt that they would serve in an emergency.\"\n\nIn view of the contents of letter of March 4th enclosed, we would appreciate having further comments from you regarding what could be done to improve the fire escapes.\n\nBernard F.

Masters\nSuperintendent\nChapleau Indian Agency.\nChapleau, Ontario\nApril 24th, 1948\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRef: File 65-1-5(E)\nLetter March 10th, 1948\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter as above with the copy of the letter attached from the Superintendent of the M.S.C.C.\n\nI was out to the school yesterday again to examine the matter of the fire escape; I found that the fire escape on the girls' side of the building in good order and the door leading to it unlocked, but on the boys' side the door to the fire escape was locked, this escape leads from the junior boys dormitory; the senior boys are on the front of the building and have to pass the top of the stairway which would be the danger point in case of fire, but their room door is locked also at night which means they would have to both doors opened before even reaching the fire escape.\n\nExtra fire escapes on the front of the building would be an asset and provide the maximum of safety for the children and staff but they would be useless unless this idea of locking doors at night is discarded, but the staff appear to be reluctant to do this.\n\nThe question boils down to a matter of funds available, the most pressing need at the present time is for some provision of refrigeration, and quotations are being asked for to provide a walk-in refrigerator, if money is available for both jobs then I would recommend that they be done, but if a choice has to be made I think the refrigerator should be first, and that the present fire escapes properly locked after and made available for instant use would suffice for the time being.\n\nThere is one other......\nMay 1st, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th ultimo, file 76-2-34 (65), with reference to the Chapleau Residential School. In view of the information contained in your letter, we do not consider it necessary to erect a new fire escape at the present time. If you consider it advisable you may have the door cut through the wall as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nHowever, you should point out to the principal of the school that at frequent intervals in the past years, the Department has insisted that doors leading to the fire escapes be kept unlocked. We must insist that this procedure be also adopted at the Chapleau School. If the principal refuses to carry out our instructions, you should advise us at once so that we can take up the matter with the head office of the M.S.C.C.\n\nIf you consider it necessary you may purchase and install panic bolts on the doors leading to the fire escapes.\n\nBernard F.

ADY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Chapleau Indian Residential School\n\nThis is to inform you that the above named school is now closed and the keys to the building are in my possession. Rev. Crawley has packed and shipped all materials belonging to the Church to several schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nAt present there is one room in the school which contains desks and some school supplies which are to be used in the new Mountbatten Day School when it is completed. This room also contains bedding and other welfare goods which will be distributed among the Indians of this agency as the need arises. The above material is being stored there as there is no storage space to be had in Chapleau.\n\nAs you know, this school is somewhat over a mile from Chapleau in an isolated position. It has already been entered illegally twice during July while Mr. Crawley was still on the premises and something of value was stolen both times. I feel sure that within a very short time vandals will have caused a very considerable amount of damage to the building and to the plumbing and heating equipment which it contains.\n\nIn view of the above, I do not wish to be held responsible for the condition of this building and installations without the assistance of a watchman. I would appreciate it if you would let me have your comments on this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. L.

Our Assets Corporation can then decide as to its future use.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 13, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L.

I have been unable to find any blueprints or detailed sketches of the school building on file. Blueprints and specifications of actual buildings located on other plans were not kept on file but were filed away in a large plan cabinet in the administration. To the best of my recollection these were removed to the Engineering Branch in the Normal School building, now the Lands and Development Survey Branch.\n\n2. There are no formal descriptions of the building on file which can be found in the Storage File. This school was constructed during the years 1919 and 1920.\n\n3. Tenders for the construction of a building for the purpose of an Indian boarding school at Chippewa were called for, receivable up to the 15th day of September, and the contract was awarded to the lowest tenderers, Messrs. Gurney & Son, by O.C. dated 15th Oct. 1919, for the amount of their tender, namely, $59,000.00, the same to be charged to vote No. 505.\n\nI may add that all the correspondence regarding the purchase of the various parcels of land for the site of this school together with a blueprint drawn in a file found on file No. 65-1919 in the Storage File.\n\nC.S.

I wish that you would have this hurried along as much as possible because if we do not put the matter up to War Assets right away we may have the responsibility for supervision of the building on our hands for the winter.\n\nI believe War Assets would first have to circularize Dominion Government departments. If there is no Dominion Government department interested they would then communicate with the Provincial Governments or other organizations entitled to preferred consideration, and lastly offer the property to the general public. This does not leave very much time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector,\nAdministration and Personnel.\nFurther to our telephone conversation this morning, may we have a memorandum prepared for my signature to Mr. Jackson re disposal of the Indian residential school property at Chapleau.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY DIRECTOR\n\nChapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for answer your memorandum of September 13 concerning a submission to War Assets Corporation declaring the above school as surplus to our requirements.\n\nI am advised by our Superintendent of Education that immediately upon receipt of the Departmental Purchasing Agent's memorandum concerning this school, he took the following action:\n\n(1) He wrote to both Mr. Regional Supervisor Matters, formerly Indian Superintendent at Chapleau and now at Caradoc Agency, and to Mr. J. L. Whitney, Clerk in charge of the Chapleau Agency. He requested information concerning the points raised in Mr. Vincent's memorandum.\n\n(2) He made a request to our Archivist to search the old Chapleau files in an attempt to locate the blueprints and land survey drawings required. Our Archivist has since reported that these are not on our files and were probably among the plans sent to Lands and Development Services Branch on the re-organization of the department in 1936.\n\nTherefore, a further request has been made to this other branch in the hope that they can locate these blueprints in their files.\n\nYou can rest assured that every endeavour will be made to supply the information required by the Departmental Purchasing Agent as soon as answers are received from the other parties concerned.\n\nActing Director.\nSeptember 11, 1948,\n\nMr. J. L. Whitney,\nClerk in Charge,\nIndian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nChapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nThe matter of disposing of the Chapleau Residential School was referred to the Minister's office and we have now received, from the Departmental Purchasing Agent, a reply requesting the following additional information:\n\n1. Blue print or detailed sketch of the school building.\n2. General description of the building, when constructed or purchased.\n3. Cost of valuation placed on same and what would be a fair estimate for sale purposes in its present condition.\n4. Area of land which it is proposed to sell with the building.\n5. Location in respect to the town of Chapleau.\n\nWould you please advise with regard to points 3 and 4 above. A copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Mattes at Munsey, as he will probably wish to express his opinion regarding these matters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIt is suggested that War Assets Corporation contact the Provincial Government with regard to this suggestion.\n\nIt is presumed that a nominal value of $25,000 to $30,000 could be placed on the building, depending entirely on its intended use by a possible purchaser.\n\n(4) Mr. Matters has suggested that an area of five to ten acres could be disposed of with the building. Here, again, this decision could be reached by negotiation with a potential purchaser. For your information I may add that the total acreage owned is between 600 and 800 acres. Our Reserves and Trusts Division are now considering the further use of this other land.\n\n(5) The school is situated two miles to the south east of Chapleau on a fairly good road.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, September 23, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nChapleau Indian Residential School\n\nReference your SS I.A.

The farmer's cottage is situated some distance from the main building.\n\n(3) The contract for this building was let at the sum of $100,000.00. Today it is very difficult to place a valuation on the plant. The building is not in good condition and will require a considerable expenditure before it can be put to any practical use. I understand from Mr. Regional Supervisor matters that there has been some local discussion concerning the use of this building as an old people's home.\nIt is suggested that Far Anoka Corporation contact the Provincial Government with regard to this recommendation.\n\nIt is presumed that a nominal value of $25,000 to $30,000 could be placed on the building, depending entirely on its intended use by a possible purchaser.\n\n(4) Mr. Hattera has suggested that an area of five to ten acres could be disposed of with the building. Once again, this decision could be reached by negotiation with a potential purchaser. For your information I may add that the total acreage owned is between 600 and 800 acres.

The farmer's cottage is situated some distance from the main building.\n\n(3) The contract for this building was let at the sum of $15,000.00. Today it is very difficult to place a valuation on this plant. The building is not in good condition and will require considerable expenditure before it can be put to any practical use.

I sent you a cheque for five hundred dollars and I am prepared to pay five thousand dollars cash for the Indian School. It was understood the Indian School was on a bid.\n\nUpon my inspection of the school, I found all electric fixtures and plumbing fixtures have been removed and very few sinks are left standing. The majority of the windows have been broken and the outside walls of the building are cracked and the cement is falling.\n\nThe building itself has not much value to me as there will be a considerable amount spent on repairs alone. There are people from town going there and saying they have received permission to remove fixtures and up until now even the glass doors have been taken. The property itself now is the only value. If you will consider my bid of $5,000 cash, please let me know as soon as possible as I will come to Ottawa personally to settle.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Mr. Nicolas Clonet,\nQueen's Hotel,\nChapleau, Ontario.\nSeptember 9th, 1949.\n\nMr. F.

If the information contained in this letter is correct, it is felt that it has been a waste of money to employ Mr. Albert Kinney as watchman.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of these two communications to Superintendent Whitney,\n\nMajor MacKay would like to receive a complete report from both of you at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nAlbert King\nSeptember 16th, 1949.\n\nMr. J. Whitney,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nMr. Albert Kinney, caretaker at the former Chapleau Indian Residential School, has written to us requesting that his wages be increased from $60.00 to $80.00 a month. It is not possible to consider such an increase, as we hope to be successful in selling the property at an early date, and once the sale has been made, we will not require Mr. Kinney's services.\n\nWe are still waiting for an answer to our letter of September 9th with which we enclosed a copy of a letter which we had received from Mr. Nicholas Gionet. Please let us hear from you by return mail.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\nSeptember 16th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 462-5\nLetter September 9th, 1949,\nChapleau Indian Residential School\n\nOn receipt of the above letter I arranged to make a quick trip to Chapleau. I knew that Mr. Whitney was away at the Mattagami reserve but as I am expecting to leave for the western part of the region on Sept. 20th, I could not delay. Mr. Watt of The V.L.A., who has his headquarters here had received a similar letter. Inasmuch as he had been present when the initial appraisal was made we decided to go together.\n\nWe found that the letter from Mr. Gionet was entirely contrary to the facts. All plumbing fixtures, sinks, toilets etc. were exactly as they were when the appraisal was made. None of them had been removed since the school closed. We found that four electric receptacle boxes, wall type, had been removed at some time. Mr. Watt advised me that they had been missing at the time of the appraisal. There were very few electric light fixtures in use when the building was occupied. These still remained, the balance of the lighting was from plain drop cords.\n\nThe only door missing was the screen door from the front of the building. This is in use at the cottage occupied by the watchman. There are several more windows broken which can be attributed to normal wear and tear. In almost every case of a broken window we found the carcasses or one or more birds on the floor. Undoubtedly they were the cause of the damage.\n\nI suppose that Mr. Gionet is anxious to have the deal closed as quickly as possible. He did not mention the one thing that is causing and will soon be responsible for more damage to the fabric of the building. The roof is leaking in a couple of places and water has dripped through the ceilings to the basement.\nThere was no evidence of any material having been removed. I would say that the watchman has done a good job. All doors except the front are nailed securely. Some water was coming into the basement from the water main. I showed him where it could be shut off before it reached the school.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that quoting the upset price in the advertisement militated against a larger number of bids. People thought that this was the minimum that would be acceptable. For tender of Mr. Gionet is the only one received I would suggest that it be readvertised omitting the upset price, and that the highest tender received be accepted without delay.\n\nThe location of the property tends to reduce its value. It is costing $40 per month to protect it against pilfering, therefore should be disposed of as quickly as possible. The watchman complained about the amount he was receiving. I had to agree that it is very meagre considering that he has to be around the place at all times and cannot do any other work. When the school was in operation he received most of his meals there. His salary should be increased by about $15.00 per month to ensure proper protection for the buildings until they are disposed of.\n\n(sgd) P. Matters\n\nP.

Matters.\n\nRe: File 462-5(S.1) Sept. 9/49.\nChapleau Residential School.\n\nThe above noted letter was in the mail when I returned from my trip to Mattagami Reserve yesterday. In view of the contents of the attached letter from Mr. Nicholas Gionet, an immediate inspection of the school was made by myself.\n\nThe information concerning vandalism contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Mr. Gionet's letter, are entirely false. With regard to electrical fixtures; several sets of electrical plugs had been removed from this building by unauthorized persons during August 1948, before the watchman was employed. Since that time no electrical fixtures have been removed from the building. All switches, plugs, ceiling fixtures, drop cords etc., are still in place and could be put into immediate use, by reconnecting the service with the powerline.\n\nRegarding the plumbing fixtures; the only plumbing fixtures which have been removed from the building were the sinks and washing machines, dryer etc. from the school laundry, which were removed by Rev. Cramley before the school closed and were shipped to an Indian Residential School out west. At present in the building, there are 5 complete bathroom outfits in good working order, six separate bath tubs, 20 wash basins, 6 utility sinks and 6 toilets. All of this equipment could be put into immediate use by turning on the water in the building. I would like to point out here, that at my request, the caretaker Mr. Kinney, bailed out and drained all these plumbing fixtures in the fall of 1948.\nto insure that there would be no water left in the traps that might freeze and split any of the equipment.\n\nRegarding the windows at the school. I would venture to say that 50 panes of glass of various sizes would complete repairs on all the windows in this building. Most of the windows cracked or broken were in this condition when the school was closed. I would say that there have been less than a dozen panes of glass broken in this building, during the past year. This in itself is remarkable, as the school is more than a mile from town and the surroundings are convenient play spots for children of this locality.\n\nConcerning the outside walls of the building. These walls are in essentially the same condition today, as they were at the time of the closing of the school. There are quite a few cracks in the outside stucco coat and in two or three places some pieces of this stucco have fallen away completely.\n\nI might say that no one from Chapleau or anywhere else that I know of, have been to Mr. Kinney with the story that they had authority to remove anything from the building, and since Mr. Kinney took over, I can find no trace of any fixtures, plumbing, glass doors etc. having been removed. The only gates, formerly used from the school, were taken in August 1948 before Mr. Kinney took over as watchman. In fact it was because of this, along with removal of a few electric plugs, that this office requested a caretaker.\n\nI feel that having had a caretaker in this building for the past year, has not been a waste of money. There is no change in the condition of this building or its contents, since it was valued this summer.\n\nJ.L. Whitney,\nSuperintendent,\nChapleau Agency.\nChapleau, September 23, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Albert Kinney, Watchman\nChapleau School Building\n\nThe above named man, who is a cripple, was in today to see me to advise that he has no fuelwood left at the school and is unable to get out and cut any himself.\n\nHe is asking that the Department supply him with fuelwood as long as he remains as watchman on this site.\n\nHe advised that if the Department cannot supply fuelwood, he intends to give up the job of watchman effective September 30th this year.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is a possibility of an early sale of the school property, I think it would be wise to supply Mr. Kinney with some fuel in order to keep him until the building is sold. I feel it would be a waste of money to have kept these buildings under surveillance this long and then have them damaged or stripped of fixtures, with a possible sale in view.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you concerning this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nJLW/CB\n\nJ.

McLean Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nAltaire, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested, accompanied by\nthe Rev. Mr. Banting, I inspected\nthe site of the proposed school at\nChapleau and was able to report as\nfollows:\n\nThe present school is situated\non a piece of land - an ideal\nlocation in every particular. It\nfronts on the River Kagebesquashin\nand has an imposing appearance\nfrom Chapleau which lies across the\nstream about one half mile distant.\nThere is plenty of room for a new\nbuilding on this site beside the\npresent school and still leave plenty\nof space between them. The new\nbuilding could easily be drained\nof present site water. The water\nis secured from a spring about two\nhundred yards away, but there is not\nenough within sixty feet which, with very\nI was sorry to find the Commissioner of Crown Lands absent from the City, and is not expected home until the 22nd. However, I have interviewed the Deputy who assures me that there will be no difficulty in obtaining the land needed, but that only ten acres will be allowed for school purposes. The balance of the claim we shall have to pay for, at so much per acre. Will you be willing to take the trouble to his return. I pointed out that on the Reserve there is no agriculture land, and that our only chance of education...\nThe Schoolhouse Farm was to be up the only available land near Chapleau, also that we had already paid $250.00 for claim. Of course, that was not the government. I also pointed out that the land was very poor at its best, and could require much fertilizing to make it capable of productivity. After all, hoping in that case, that the price would be very reasonable.\n\nI am forwarding you the slip of paper which the contractor who is building our Church placed his estimate for the Kitchen, but I think it is inclusive of Township of materials from the Station & the School, which must be paid, so we have no house of our own.\nI think that of the Kitchen is to be built this fall. I must endeavor to purchase the lumber on my way home. I shall see how we can possibly keep the present number of school rooms we are able to erect the Kitchen. Will let you know as soon as I hear from the Commissioner of Crown Lands.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Woodside\n\nP.S. I am leaving here on Friday morning.\nOttawa, September 24, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 18th inst., with reference to the title of the site on which the new boarding school at Chapleau is built and stating that, after an interview with the Deputy Commissioner of Crown Lands, you have his assurance that there will be no difficulty in obtaining the homestead but that only ten acres will be allowed for school purposes.\n\nIn view of this assurance you are hereby authorised to proceed with the erection of the kitchen extension to the main building at once, on the understanding that the estimate furnished will not be appreciably exceeded.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

We have been visited by small-pox in the Village\nduring the last month several cases but all are improving\nbut so far no Indians have taken it.

Cleen, Esq.,\nSec Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen in Toronto some weeks ago I tried to learn something definite about the deed of the school land, Mr. Benson was speaking to me about it when in Ottawa I could not learn very much except that there had been a transfer of some land for that purpose to the English Church Bishop and that I would be able to get the details from Him, Bishop Anderson and He says they have a deed of but 10 acres at present and that He explained the matter to Mr. Scott in Ottawa. This He says He is prepared to give the Department at any time and will also see what can be done regarding the balance of the land needed. Regarding the talk Mr. Benson had with the Indians on the reserve down the river in getting them a horse or mule ox for plowing, I am somewhat at a loss as to advise, the Indians are never on the reserve in winter and who is going to look after any animals is a mystery to me. This has been an excuse given by Mr. Benson and all the Indians are in the bush hunting back for some time yet so you could do nothing for some months yet in that line.\nOttawa, June 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of February 22nd, last, and I have to ask you to be good enough to again take up with His Lordship, Bishop Anderson, the question of obtaining a deed of the site for the Chapleau Boarding School building. In your communication you state that the Church has a deed for but ten acres at present and that the Bishop tried to see what could be done in regard to obtaining the balance of the land needed.\n\nMr. Ogilvie, who recently visited the school, states that a short distance from the present site of the building and on the school property is a level stretch of land, probably five or six acres, which appears suitable for a school and garden site, with ample facilities for drainage and accessible to the town water supply and the Electric Company's transmission line for electric light. The Department wishes to know whether this five or six acres referred to is a portion of the ten of which the Church now has a deed. In any event His Lordship should try to obtain a deed for at least 100 acres of land, which can then be transferred to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. A.

I went at once and interviewed the Bishop, getting the following information.\n\nHe says he has a deed from the Ontario government for 165 acres, he showed me the deeds of same, this takes in the land Mr. Gilvie speaks off.\n\nHis Lordship wants to know if the department requires the whole of the land, he says he is prepared to give all or any part at any time, but was under the impression, from the conversation he had with Mr. Scott, the department only wanted a portion of the land.\n\nAs soon as we get this information a transfer of the land will be made according to instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is of opinion that the whole of the land in question, viz., 165 acres, should be attached to the boarding school for school purposes. I have, therefore, to ask you to be good enough to obtain a transfer of this property from the Church to His Majesty the King as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The Department will reimburse the Church for the expenditure incurred in the purchase of this land from the Ontario Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You will note we have no attorney and in any case will be compelled to send these papers to Sudbury to have them properly adjusted, so I thought the easiest way would be to send direct to the department and have deeds made out and forwarded to me and I will have satisfaction at hand. You will notice there is one hundred and sixty-five acres at 50\u00a2 per acre whereas the receipt only calls for one hundred and fifty acres, the cause of this is that they gave the extra fifteen acres free, on account of having already paid the Indian Micawash for the land whose title was no good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature] Clerk\nReferring to your conversation of yesterday in which you state that the sum of money authorized by the Department for the improving of the road to the Chapleau Boarding School ($20.00) was not sufficient, owing to the fact that a bridge has to be constructed over a marshy piece of ground.

This is an ideal. You will be aware that this scheme has been tried at the site this agency is now working on, and I understand, successfully. You will agree with me that one of the most encouraging results is the fact that our students have had no rain breaks or opportunity of attending our classes to the same extent as in the past. They need some encouragement to continue their studies.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nBISHOP\nRIGHT REV JOHN G. ANDERSON\n\nCHAPLEAU, ONT\n\nSince such scheme as the above seems the only\ndirection in which we can carry out the objects of\nour schools and at the same time be helpful\nto develop our country.\n\nReferring to where and how to obtain the land?\nWill the Department itself not be so? somewhere on\nthe C.H.R. or R.R. would be suitable and\ncentral - a supply possible. A location near C.H.\nR. due north Chapleau seems to very good for\nan Indian reserve at Matawinia, Wapizagonke,\nKawartha, Chapleau. It presents me for a majority\nour appeal from the Christian & Roman Catholic bands.\n\nI heard a few days ago that two prominent\nbusiness men in Chapleau who are most interested\nin obtaining a school at Chapleau said that on\na land buying expedition they had seen property\nfor sale there but, said Mr. Christian, now suppose\nit was too near the forest to be better developed.\nBut where was it better and along the C.H.R.\nrailway has no much sooner what we want on the\nC.H.R. something more is needed. There itself is\nbetter now and therefore, to become a reserve\nwould be a good idea, but it's rather too near the\nforest school, not. Would you bring it there,\nconsidering the Indians lives within our land as\nwell as the new names and new reserves.\n\nNow its present and all the further promptly settled\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nBISHOP\nRIGHT REV JOHN G.

We within ourselves in fact\naccommodation and especially from musical\nthis family present it is not entirely under\npresent conditions.\n\nI think it would be better to move the same to more\nfrom Chapleau. It is quite central for the northern\nmissions and we can command 40 or less Spanish\nwith a little effort. We also could secure the\ntwo persons who have been doing the\nwork there. If we could get a house there\nwould be a mile or two from the town. Would it not\nbe inclined to remain there for several reasons.\nBut I cannot see it is entirely as the mission\nas a unit, say and work we concerned\nwe had a proper kind of work, we could\nnot at all appointments or settle her properly since\nwe have been frequently speaking the word\nwe is no more that of new scheme in the ideal\nwe not only in accord in the composition of the\npupil, but as we are not bound by the rules\nand regulations and trusting that we shall be able to\ndecide these matters down in the interests of the school\nin the best manner possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nFebruary 4th, 1874.\n\nRight Rev. Sir -\n\nI have read with interest Your Lordship's communication of the 24th ultimo, in reference to a site for the proposed new boarding school for the Chapleau district. I myself was instrumental in having this school established, as I see the need of it, for taking care of the children of Indians in Chapleau and other towns along the line of the C.P.R., and I am not in favour of any plan which could entail the removal of the school from the line of railway.\n\nThe pupils of this school are for the most part the children of working men or of Indians engaged in hunting and trapping and this institution is the head-quarters from which pupils should and no doubt do obtain such training as will fit them for house-makers, and the boys an education that will enable them to better perform the duties which will fall to their lot in the lines of activity that they will follow in after life.\n\nRight Rev. J. G. Anderson,\nBishop of Neepawa,\nOscana, Ont.\nWhile there should be sufficient land for the purpose of the school and for the training of the pupils in gardening, etc., which is no doubt desirable, I could not be in favour, as I said before, of removing from Simcoe. It should be possible for us to make provision for the housing of the Principal and his family.\n\nAs I have now placed my views before Your Lordship I should be pleased to hear from you further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI regret that owing to my absence from home I have delayed so long in applying to you of the Diocese of Moose Cree for the proposed new Boarding School for the northern district of the Diocese.\n\nIn view of your decision, I feel that I cannot press the matter further at this juncture. The plan I proposed in my letter was the result of a very careful consultation with the Principal, Mr. Stone, and the question of financing a large building is not one to be taken lightly. However, I think it will be possible to proceed with the building of the new school as early as possible, and provide a suitable living arrangement for the principal and his family.\n\nMy chief concern will now be the supply of fuel. If the wood on the lot is exhausted, we have to buy from the town. The cost will be increased by the Department's own estimate. It would be a great hardship to have to pay for the wood from town, but it should be of little consequence.\n\nI am enclosing a communication from Mr. Stone, which will enable you to see why we made the proposal as it is. We hope you will be able to meet our decision. They give clearly the difficulties we have to meet with under present conditions. So you will understand why our proposal was made. Let us consider the best interests of the school for the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDiocese of Moose Cree\n\nMarch 6th, 1914\nIndian Boarding School\nChapleau - Ont\nDec 28th 1914\n\nMy Dear Lad Bishop,\n\nI have your favor of the 15th inst. with the enclosed communication from Mr. D.C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. As to his objections to the removal of the Indian Boarding School from this center to mine, what we intended was not a total locality. I fully appreciate the interest he has taken in the matter and believe that the School has done all he hopes it could do, and results have fully justified its establishment. But when a new building is to be erected, and considerable expenses incurred not only to the Department but also to the Church, it appears to me a desirable matter to consider some more suitable locality in which to build. I shall try and give you my views as briefly as possible.\n\nIn the first place perhaps Mr. Scott has not kept pace exactly with modern Railway development. At the time the Chapleau Boarding School was erected neither of the two Railways to the north of us were in course of construction. Now both the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific run through the very centre of the country in which the Indians, from the families of which we draw our supply of children. I do not know that we have not asked in the last fifteen or sixteen years for a new building near along the line of the C.P.R., where we stand now the Chapleau Boarding School. But although quite a few times we have been told by the Indians they very rarely reside on their own land. However, opposite the town of Chapleau, but not too far from the river around where the C.T.R. and the G.T.P. have been built, this country remains as there, and it is there they tell me they plant their families in the most part. A school located there would meet their every wish as they have practically wished for such a move on our part.\n\nSecondly, the land is practically all cleared up on the school lot, and it will be simply impossible for us to buy by the acre. There is neither sufficient land for Agriculture nor even for pasturage, nor will there be occupation in a time of peace, all the year round until at least three years are needed to make an improvement, and when improved the prices are such that it would almost cripple us to pay them. When we will wish to have these difficulties borne by us, but not by us. Added to this is the excessive price...\nof supplies, and the restriction placed upon the wholesale houses by the merchants of the town, preventing them from supplying us in bulk, because they wish to secure our custom.\n\nThe condition of the road after crossing the Bridge is such that during summer between it and the School it is impossible to freight our supplies away to the left condition in some places, and the very bad state at others. It is such that Mr. Chapple, one of the principal merchants previously refused to deliver goods to us last autumn.\n\nAnd most important. All the sewers from Chipman flow into the River just at the Bridge and the water which flows past the school is badly polluted. And since the town has been connected by the Bridge, the Chipman sewage for the purpose of the schoolhouse has been collected along the river, and the result of every description is noticeable along the river. The school building, while we are compelled to pass all the time. The school building, while we are compelled to pass all the time. The school building, while we are compelled to pass all the time. The school building, while we are compelled to pass all the time.\n\nIn conclusion I feel that I must express myself as deeply regretting the decision of the Deputy Superintendent regarding this matter, although I consider only into it with sincerity and perhaps the Indian Agent and some few of the principal Indians. Below me my Lord Bishop\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeo. Prince\nMarch 24th, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson -\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant in further reference to the new boarding school building at Stephen. Our Architects' Branch proposes to take up the work of completing the plans at a very early date. Provision will be made in the building for the residence of the Principal and his family,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. J. G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosejaw,\nSaskatoon, Ont.\nSandy nation, and in the latter part of the year the buildings are often flooded with water or very damp, unless these matters are carefully guarded against. The difficulty in our case would be a serious one.\n\nSupposing that the accommodation is limited to 45 pupils then I fear that it shall be for the most part overcrowded, no attempt has been made to build so far as I am aware at the present time upon building more light more applications in. You can help us by going away to one very limited accommodation and we suspect that even the knowledge that the building is being contemplated by the department, has attracted material shape, take further fully 20 more applications if so we shall still have the overcrowding problem to contend with. It will prove the success of the work if the building is kept full, and should more accommodation be called for will certainly justify the work made in the welfare of these people.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery faithfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nChaplain Indian School\nMay 8th 1914\n\nD.C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the plans for the new Indian Boarding School at this place, I have to state that before taking up the matter fully with you, I felt the necessity of communicating with his Lordship, the Bishop, whom I am sure you will agree is the best person to consult in such matters. I have written him a letter regarding the plans and have received his reply, which he states that he has written you in the effect that the plans are acceptable to him. However, I have not been able to reach Mr. Michael Agent McLeary as you requested, and have come to this conclusion. Yet there are one or two alterations which might perhaps be made which would somewhat improve the present plan without materially changing it. For instance, the top floor might be reduced to make more dormitory accommodation and to also heighten the pitch. The builder could quite easily be instructed as to these objects.\n\nChanges have again in the case of the Principal's Apartments. The living and bath rooms appear to belong to the girls' dormitory, and there are some alterations to the Principal's Apartments which can only well be discussed with. But I would suspect that the size of the girls' dormitory is reduced and the extra bath and lavatory be added. Nothing has been mentioned either as to site or building. Most of the persons who have seen the present site except where the school building now stands is very low and damp, and drainage would be affected with great difficulty, owing to the outcroppings of rock towards the water side. And a slight hill somewhat closer to the town across the valley, in a south-eastly direction from the present building, would appear more suitable as it would admit of better drainage. In regard to the town for the laying of water and electric light connection and would obviate the difficulties of travel to a great extent. Should he also suggest that the basement plan is as much above the ground as possible so as to avoid dampness. The soil in this locality is of a light...\nMost of the ground which forms the present site except where the school building now stands is very low and damp and drainage could be affected with great difficulty, owing to the outcroppings of rock towards the water's edge and a site somewhat nearer to the town across the gully in a South Easterly direction from the present building would appear more suitable, as it would admit of better drainage, be nearer to the town for the laying on of water and Electric Light Connection, and would obviate the difficulty of travel to a great extent. You will note from this that Mr. Prever recommends a change of site and this leaves us now with two suggestions before us and I could not propose to proceed with the erection of a valuable building on the present site if a more suitable one readily available can be had.\n\nWe will be ready to call for tenders in the near future.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from Your Lordship by return mail if possible and if considered advisable I shall send an officer of the Department to Chapleau with a view to reaching a final decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 16th, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson -\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, in reference to the plans for the new Boarding School building at Chapleau. By making some interior alterations, which will not depreciate the utility of the building nor increase its size, provision can be made for sixty pupils and our architect is now having these changes made. The building is to be steam heated. I am aware that the heating is a heavy item of expenses and it is for this reason that I could not consider it advisable to increase the size. I am sure, however, that the plan will be satisfactory.\n\nA very important matter has been brought to my attention within the past few days, namely, the site. I understood that if we were to remain in Chapleau the present site or its vicinity was the only one available, but just the other day I learned from outside sources that a more suitable property could be had adjoining the river, just across the C.P.R. bridge on the west side. I am not quite sure as to the name of the occupant but he is a French Canadian called Joe Routhier, or a name similar to that. I have no doubt that Your Lordship will know the party to whom reference is made, as when you were resident in Chapleau you were not far from this locality. This morning I received a letter from Mr. Prever in which he states as follows:\n\nRight Rev. J. A.

I am not, however, able to state anything definite in the matter at the present time, but will at a later date communicate with you again, if necessary. In the meantime, I should be pleased to know what land your Company has for disposal at Chapleau and where it is situated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. S.

Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nGoderich, Ont.\nJune 4th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. R. H.

Kindly\nadvise Mr. Prowse on receipt of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Melood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleas, Ont.\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th ultimo to Mr. Drummond.\n\nI enclose herewith a plan showing the only land we have available for your purpose at Chapleau. I understand from Mr. Drummond that this is in close proximity to the Indian Settlements at this place, and would be a very suitable site for the proposed school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nIndians profitably engaged, but with the present stagnation the Indians will be in a more or less destitute condition, and he suggests that they might well be engaged in the doing of this work, and I would recommend for your consideration that the clearing of land and the building of roads, as far as possible, be done in this way.\n\nIn the visiting of the site I was accompanied by both the School Principal and the Indian Agent, who agree with me in the approval of this site, although the Principal expressed a preference for the site across the river and nearer the town, providing the restrictions with respect to barn and stables had not been incorporated in their offer, his reason being, accessibility of site to schools and churches in the town. The Agent, however, agrees with me in the opinion that the site recommended as the most satisfactory for your consideration is undoubtedly the most suitable for the purpose.\n\nAs the land is owned by the Crown and its reported value is 50\u00a2 per acre, the cost of the site is a comparatively reasonable one.\n\nIt has been suggested that the site of the present building might be utilized by the Corporation of Chapleau for one of the town's public buildings, but owing to the monetary stringency, no further outlay will be made by the town at this time.\n\nThe building and will, however, prove remunerative to the Department after the building of the new school and can be fitted up to use as a truck garden with residence, or fitted for an Indian hospital, for which it is stated there is a necessity. Providing the town continues to grow, there is every probability that the site will considerably increase in value, and should be retained.\n\nArchitect.\nThis site is situated about one mile from the town of Chapleau on the East side of the river, and has a frontage thereon extending the full length of the two lots. The land is considerably diversified, but generally free from stone, and will, after clearing a considerable portion, make valuable farm land suitable for all agricultural purposes, particularly hay and root crops. Other portions are higher land, and possess all of the requirements for a good school site, admitting of excellent drainage facilities, and an abundance of water can be had, either from the river or in sinking a well near the school.\n\nThe site to a great extent is free from rock, and while the soil is light and of a sandy nature, and may prove unproductive for agricultural purposes in places, the poor land can be utilized as wood lots for fuel purposes.\n\nThis site is within a very short distance of the Electric Light Company's power line, and there is no doubt but satisfactory arrangements can be entered into with this Company for the necessary energy required for the lighting of the buildings and operating their machinery.\n\nIn connection with this site it will be necessary to build about one mile of roadway, connecting with road leading to the present building, near the bridge recently erected by the Department for crossing the river there. The estimated cost of this road will be about $300.00.\n\nIt will also be necessary to clear some of the land which is now covered with bush, probably 25 or 30 acres at about $20.00 per acre, which would be partly offset by the value of the wood obtained in the clearing.\n\nIn connection with this work it has been suggested by Indian Agent MacLeod, that as there is practically no demand for labour in Chapleau or in that neighbourhood, and which has been plentiful in former years and the Indians\nOttawa, June 13, 1914.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to report that I have again thoroughly examined the present site of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School with a view of locating a suitable site for the proposed new building thereon, and am of the opinion that there is no land suitable for this purpose on this lot.\n\nAs soon as I had determined this, I examined all of the available sites within a reasonable distance of Chapleau, and while several have more or less desirable features as a school site, notably one immediately North of and across the river from the town, where ex-Mayor Nicholson would grant six acres for a school site for a small consideration ($400), in addition to 1/4 acres a short distance therefrom, at the nominal cost of surveys and transfer ($300), but, as there are certain restrictions regarding the building of barn or stable on this site which offset any advantages which it possesses over others, and after mature consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the most satisfactory site, in the interests of the school and this Department, is certain Crown Lands owned by the province of Ontario, and adjacent to the Indian Reserve on the East and Southerly boundaries, and known as Lots 1 and 2 on the 4th and 5th concession of the township of Chapleau.\n\nThis\na credit to the locality, and it is for the reason that we are ready now to call for tenders that I am making for a speedy reply.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 15th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. White,\n\nWe are contemplating the erection of a new Indian boarding school building at Chapleau, Ontario, and the present location owned by this Department is not suitable.

I am enclosing map showing these four lots marked with blue pencil. As this is the only map of the district the Department has, I should be obliged if you would send me two or three copies if available.

You should appoint a reliable and experienced foreman to take charge and report to you during your absence.\n\nDepartment will send you an accountable cheque from which you will make the necessary payments to the workmen, and for which receipts in duplicate must be taken.

I don't think it could cost much less than $300. I will have the Indians chopping out the road until I hear from the Department about the team.
