We congratulate him upon his appointment.\n\nCom. Stewart, who is engaged extensively in the mining business, lost his horse while driving from the range last fall from Moose, J. R.

As a member of the Manitoba Legislature, and latterly as Attorney-General of that province and subsequently as a member of the Dominion Parliament, he has always worked strenuously to further the interests of his adopted Province. In Mr. Royal's case there has always been a strong bond between him and others who had him appointed with pleasure. An abiding prejudice appears to exist in the minds of some people against Mr. Royal because of his use of French nationally. It should be borne in mind that the Lieutenant-Governor does not possess absolute power, and even if so inclined can do nothing more than he will be governed solely by the advice of the Executive Council; the members of which will be all English, as there is not one Frenchman elected to the Legislative Assembly. We predict that Mr. Royal will be very popular as Lieutenant-Governor, because he will attend to his high office impartially and to the advantage of the Territories and the benefit of the people over whom he has been called to rule. We do not believe in the principle of condemn- ing a man before he has been heard, and therefore urge our readers to ask of our friend Mr. Royal a fair trial, confident that at the end of his term there will be a unanimous verdict given in his favor.\n\nThe office of Lieutenant-Governor of the Territories is not by any means a sinecure. There are many things to do and no more permits, and there is probably no office in Canada requiring the same amount of statesmanship than the administration of our affairs, but Mr. Royal will we believe through his ability, and the goodwill of the country-side equal to the occasion.\n\nNORTHWEST ASSEMBLY.\n\nThe elections being over and all returns made, it is now definitely known who constitutes the first Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. All the representatives of Saskatchewan are good men, and we believe that the interests of the District will be closely watched by them. It is true none of them have had any experience in Legisative work, but they are all men of sound sense and capable of learning, and as they all have the interests of their constituents at heart, the lack of experience will not be a great detriment. Eleven of the Western members have here- tofore held seats in the Northwest Council. Politically the character of the present Assembly is strongly Conservative. There are eighteen Conservatives elected out of forty Liberal seats. It is true the elections were not conducted on party lines, but if the question of party should unfortu- nately creep into the Assembly, the result will certainly be a large Conservative majority. We trust that at the end of three years our members will have secured many benefits for the District, and that Saskatchewan will have so advanced in population and importance as to entitle it to a full Provincial responsible Government.\n\nWe are pleased to be able to announce that the banquet given to D. H. Macdonald, M.P. for Saskatchewan, under the auspices of the Liberal Conservative Association of Prince Albert, was a most gratifying success in every particular. The number present was very large, and included not only not only Conservatives, but Liberals as well, some of whom expressed their satisfaction at Mr. Macdonald's conduct as their representative. We shall publish an extended account of the banquet in our next.\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 20, 1898.\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo.

Any person who kindles or places or is a party to kindling or placing fire in the forest, or any part thereof, the Territories, except for the purpose of domestic purposes, or clearing land in the month of December, January, February or March, except in the case of a fire caused by lightning, shall be liable on conviction thereof to pay a fine not exceeding $200, with costs of prosecution, and shall be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months. Provided always that a person may be convicted under this Ordinance present during the whole time of the burning six persons with proper appliances for putting out fire, or without such assistance, having a ploughing team not less than ten feet wide.\n\n2. Any person who kindles or is a party to kindling or placing fire in the forest, except for the purpose allowed in the next preceding section, and allows such fire to escape, shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding $200, with costs of prosecution; and in default of payment, be imprisoned for a term not exceeding three months.\n\n3. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be or prevent the owner of private property from removing fire, or from any of the fences against the first and second sections of this Ordinance.\n\n4. Prosecutions under this Ordinance shall be in a summary manner.\n\n5. The Lieut.-Governor may appoint fire guardians having the power to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance, who, together with all peace officers, have the power to call out any male person within five miles of prairie fires, to proceed at once, and help to extinguish said fires, and to arrest any person doing so, and shall be liable to a fine of $10.\n\n6. It shall be the duty of all peace officers, and of every person who has any of the enactments of this Ordinance forthwith to arrest the offender, and without warrant bring him before a Justice of the Peace to be dealt with according to law.\n\n7. Ordinance No. 21 of 1885 and No. 18 of 1886 are hereby repealed.\n\nMARKING OF STOCK.\n\nAn Ordinance to Amend and Consolidate as Amended the Marking of Stock Ordinance, 1886.\n\n(Passed Nov. 19th, 1887.)\n\nBe it enacted by the Lieut.-Governor of the Northwest Territories, in Council, as follows:\n\n1. In this Ordinance the word \"brand\" shall mean brand or mark or vent brand, and the word \"record\" shall include any horse, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, dogs, as well as any cattle or animal of the same description.\n\n2. The Lieut.-Governor may, whenever he thinks it desirable that the provisions of this Ordinance should apply to any part of the Northwest Territories, set apart by proclamation such portions thereof as he may designate, and designate the same as a stock district, and designate by a number, commencing with \"1\" and so on, as many different districts as are set apart.\n\n3. The Lieut.-Governor may designate persons to be the recorders of brands for the district so formed, whose offices shall be kept at a place to be designated by the Lieut.-Governor.\n\n4. The Lieut.-Governor shall name two suitable persons, who, together with the recorder, shall form a Brand Committee for the district.\n\n5. The Brand Committee shall meet at the office of the Recorder of Brands at least twice in each year to consider applications for recorded brands according to priority to application to the recorder, and shall designate the number of brands to be used by any applicant, and define the place and position it shall occupy on the hide or other part of the animal, or convenience of marking, so far as may be, without interfering with previously recorded brands.\n\n6. The recorder shall keep a record of all brands with a facsimile of the same, the name and residence of the person owning the animal, and the date of the brand for which the book shall be paid for by the Lieut.-Governor out of the General Revenue of the Northwest Terri- tories, and shall be the property of the\n\nNorthwest Government, and shall be free to the inspection of all persons interested, and shall furnish to any person, on application, a certified copy of any brand deemed necessary in the case.\n\n7. Any person using a like brand in any part of the province recorded by another, or attempting to alter or obliterate a recorded brand of any other person, shall be liable on conviction in a summary manner to a fine not exceeding $100, and in default of payment of such fine to imprison- ment not exceeding forty days for each offence.\n\n8. It shall be the duty of every person purchasing or selling to the public by retail any stock which is branded, without such stock being marked or stamped, to cause the brand to be placed in such position as to obliterate or efface the same, and if any such animal or vent brand shall have been branded as above, it shall be prima facie evidence of the same.\n\n9. Every person recording a brand shall also at the same record and register his name.\n\n10. If any person hereafter sell brand or cause to be branded any stock without the owner's consent, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding three times the value of the animal so branded, and any such person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $100, and in default of payment, to imprisonment for thirty days.\n\n11. The owner of any recorded brand may, by writing, transfer the same to another person, and record the transfer, and the transferee shall have thereafter all the rights of the person who first recorded the brand.\n\n12. The presence of a recorded brand on any animal shall be prima facie evi- dence of the ownership of such animal by the owner of such brand.\n\n13. The following fees shall be payable to the recorder for recording each brand: 25\u00a2 for each certified copy of every recorded brand; 50\u00a2 for every search for brand.\n\n14. The Recorder shall, on the last day of the month of January and July in each year, make a return to the Lieut.-Governor, written on forms before Judge of the Supreme Court, showing the enrolments of his office during the six months ending June 30th.\n\n15. All brands or marks recorded by Charles E. Wood, acting as Recorder for Markham District No. 1, shall be ratified and confirmed as officially recorded under Ordinance No. 14 of 1884.\n\n16. Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 is hereby repealed.\n\n17. This Ordinance may be cited as \"The Brand Ordinance, 1887.\"\n\n---\n\nA Dead Drop!\n\nON PRICES\n\nAT\n\nJ. M.
