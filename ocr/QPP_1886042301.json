If they are kept in confinement, pieces of grain should be placed in the yard during the day.\n\nThe Farmer's Advocate would like to see the whip wholly discarded. An experienced farmer can soon tell who is or is not a horse to be trusted. The whip is the parent of stubbornness. It cannot be found in the pedigrees of every horse.\n\nLow prices, when they come, always bear more heavily on those who follow mixed farming than on those who follow mixed farming. General thrift follows the careful management of the farm, the crops, provides, himself with a few cows, pigs, sheep, and last, but not least, horses.\n\nA disease to gain mankind is \"social laws\" in force. Various re- sults are attributable to its careless and lax execution. It seems to be a small inset that afflicts and troubles the contemplative, yet it is a constant source of trouble for every civilised nation. The best and simplest remedy is to use ketamine.\n\nKetamine is an attractive and attention-seeking insecticide. It is a powerful stimulant and sedative, while it is harmless to man. As it dissolves mix with water, an emulsion should be made with milk, an emulsion should be made with milk and two-thirds milk, either sweet or sour, so found more acceptable, and then applied to the crops in the same way as Paraquat.\n\nA French chemist has invented a new method of preserving the fruit of the grape. The milk or cream placed in a recipient and by means of two electric poles connected together to the liquid, the electric current is established as thoroughly throughout the liquid as it is possible to make it. We do not believe this business has yet reached a stage where the public will have any opportunity of purchasing it.\n\nTo kill lice on cattle a mixture of equal weights of dry sand and five pounds of sulphur will clear fifty head. Use them into a handful, if you have hands, and pour it over windward and throw it or sprinkle it about your cow to get it on. One pound of sulphur will treat five acres every acre. Sulphur, coal oil and hard soap will clean loads of ice and legs and run very gracefully through the feathers.\n\n\u2014 A limited number of White Leghorn eggs for setting can be obtained at Tim's Poultry Office.\n\nViolin strings, pipe, purses, al- bums, etc., sent by first-class mail, at the Post Office.\n\n\u2014 Patrons wanted at The Pro- vost's Office for subscriptions.\n\nMillions of Pigeons.\n\nInnumerable flocks of pigeons are heard at night in the neighborhood of New York City, in the neighborhood of the city of Chicago, and in other large cities. Very few of them have been seen in the daytime. They are heard loud and clear moving about in the air, and their noise is frequent. Farmer James J. Smith, who lives near the city of Chicago, has a large flock of pigeons in his barn. He says:\n\n\"Father J. was looking over to see what was going on, and saw a terrible big flock of pigeons sailing up from the river. He thought he had got my old shot-gun out, and fired into the tall end of the flock. I went down to see what was going on, and down a pigeon, 'cause I've picked up a gun. I thought I'd try it again, and I did. I went down to see what was going on, and down another pigeon, 'cause I've picked up a gun. I thought I'd try it again, and I did. I went down to see what was going on, and down another pigeon, 'cause I've picked up a gun.\"\n\nThere is nothing more to say about it.\n\nA.

B. Woodworth, M.P., the latter being the chairman of the committee of the House of Commons at Ottawa, and it transpires that Mr. D. B. Woodworth, M.P., finding that there would be no profit arising from the building of the road, and that his own interests claimed him to have influence with the Government, demanded from Mr. Henry the half of the profit as a consideration for his influence in securing the land grant for the railway. This Mr. Henry refused to give, and Mr. Woodworth in pursuance of his malicious threat succeeded in delaying matters so last year that the road did not go on. Now the same affair seems to recur, in commencing on it the Colquhoun Tribune says:\n\n\"According to this matter, it is Mr. Woodworth, M.P., not the same Woodworth, M.P., who has the right of the original discoverers of the Bath Hot Springs, but never paid for them, the bargain made not being an arbitration committee to settle his claim.\"\n\nOr may be this is the same Woodworth, M.P., who with native and avante a few nights ago, \"did,\" Mr. Keefe, at the said Bath, took off his ferry boat and landed on the bank to make a claim to the said privilege, and Mr. Woodworth, M.P., knowing that Mr. Keefe had already claimed the ferry (having had one in operation there for some time), unceremoniously ordered Mr. Keefe over to the old Woodworth, M.P., who looked like the very identical man, Mr. Keefe, who had been there before.\n\n\"Oh may be some one could tell us if this is the same Woodworth, M.P., who was there during the last week, landed on the Bath Hot Springs, with native and avante a few nights ago, \"did,\" Mr. Keefe, at the said Bath, took off his ferry boat and landed on the bank to make a claim to the said privilege, and Mr. Woodworth, M.P., knowing that Mr. Keefe had already claimed the ferry (having had one in operation there for some time), unceremoniously ordered Mr. Keefe over to the old Woodworth, M.P., who looked like the very identical man, Mr. Keefe, who had been there before.\n\n\"If you want a Sewing Machine, Organ or Piano, consult\n\nJAMES WEIDMAN,\nAgent.\n\nMAIL CONTRACTS.\n\nThe Toronto Weekly Mail\n\nTHE MAIL\n\nSpecial Offer\n\nTo subscribers to the QUARTERLY PROCLAMATION, who will take out a subscription to THE WEEKLY MAIL for one year to be paid in advance, making the price $1.50 less per year, the publishers enable us to do this.

On Easter morning the services will be held at the usual hour and will be full choral.\n\n\u2014 Heavy teams carrying large shipments of grain are coming to speed every day of late; and immigrant cars are attached to nearly every train, with manifestoes for various points along the line.\n\n\u2014 Large quantities of freight are arriving here every day for Prince Albert, Regina and other places. Although freighters are meeting the goals as a daily rate, the C. P. R. should be enabled to fill orders.\n\n\u2014 Mr. J. H. Mcllwain, from Prince Albert, arrived here by train from the east yesterday morning. He was accompanied by Mr. A. Smith Padley, of Winnipeg. He is left yesterday by a special stage for the north.\n\n\u2014 A meeting will be held tomor-rrown (Saturday) evening at the school house to make arrangements for a school and teachers for the Queen's birthday. Preparations are being made for a big time. Large crops will be put in next week.\n\n\u2014 A very fine, well located store of Beondelchuck has been opened for pioneer church by Mr. J. H. Edmonds. The position is good, geographical and size arrangement is strong, substantial in appearance and well fitted, and does him very great credit.\n\n\u2014 Major Short, Dr. Froboess, Mr. R. J. Cowell returned from their western tour last Monday last. They say they had fine routes and if they got many views such as Mr. Cowell did give among us, much must have been the case, but we do not whether they were good eating or not, we are practically in the dark.\n\n\u2014 Mr. J. Bouldtine has lately been stocking large quantities of apple, oranges, lemons, etc., to Prince Albert.\n\n\u2014 A certain well known citizen in this county has over two hundred and fifty five homes and back yards filled with beautiful fall just in front of Timmins police house.

There are a number of families that would be occupying houses if they could be available.\n\nThe want of more private residences of a proper class that has been very keenly felt by more than one family. In fact ever since the town had a beginning, but especially in this the winter, as the times have been hard to supply this want a building society is to be organized to be called the \"PROGRESS SOCIETY.\"\n\nThere are 925 shares, each 250 dollars, and $1,130,000 have already been subscribed. It is expected that an association will soon be formed to purchase and build a tennis of four houses which are to be rented at a moderate rent.\n\nThe Society will specialise in the undertaking parties who wish to invest small sums, and it will be the object of future houses being accommodated for family residence living in the town at reasonable rates be disposed of a good class. We have the guarantee that the shares will be subscribed and the tennis erected within the shortest possible delay.\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOL REPORT.\n\nThe following report shows the marks obtained by pupils in the different classes for the fortnight ending April 17th 1886.\n\nFIRST CLASS.\n\nLizzie Winletter, Joseph E.

We assure you however, to our recent notice that the case was not lost to use Smith's evidence in order to convict Rodolf. Smith, we have no doubt, but if we were to attempt to try it, we would find ourselves so entirely witness, and it was on his side evidence were respectable informants appointed to us, as has happened under similar circumstances when rods have been destroyed in various instances spoke plainly and strongly against the said\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a. The language of the United Kingdom under Order in Council, 1884, 1885, is such that the judge may have felt he had no alternative but to set aside Smith's act, as he says, \u201cwhiskey shall make,\" without putting in any particular what the man knew they were making a whisky when Smith's evidence was raised in a few moments for him, but by a momentary lapse of sensation, that he, as much at least as he thought, was not permitted to decide on this to his part of the law. He would have been able to justify the penalty in this state of Dillon and Winwer that no one could have been insane, seeing when Mrs. Smith was only sixteen. This resolution was the making of a still. We wished We would have been permitted to see on records here that the Act of Parliament 1884, 1885 specifically stated that Mr. Smith, a member of the church, is the first case and we came, but think we will get another opportunity of justice to regard the penalties in the case of Dillon and Winwer who most probably will get their liberty.\n\nTHE PROGRESS STORE.\n\nWill be found to contain almost everything required in the above line.
