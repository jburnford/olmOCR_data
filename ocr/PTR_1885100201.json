Medals were given, it is true, to the British soldiers who took part in the suppression of the Indian mutiny and the Maori and Kaiser revolts; but these latter were not comparable to the task which has been laid upon our own troops.\n\nGratifying this, what of it? There is no precedent simply because there has been no parallel. The medal is the first tangible instance of the fact that a rebellion has been suppressed by citizen soldiers, and this fact is doubtless regarded by the War Office as of sufficient importance to justify its issue.\n\nIt is an excellent moment. It is wrong doing, and so to whom, in giving each voter a token of his Sovereign's appreciation of his patriotism? The Medals were given to the men who did not flinch from the task that was set them, and they are not likely to be forgotten.\n\nInformation has been received by the Militia Department that Imperial silver medals have been issued to the troops recently engaged in the suppression of the North West Rebellion.\n\nKINGSTON.\n\nSeptember 21st. \u2014 B.

Murray was seen running away from the scene of the shooting.\n\nAn interesting experiment has not been made in England which proves beyond a doubt the exceptional strength and quality of the wheat grown in the Canadian North West.\n\nOn Saturday 27th July last, a sample of No. 1 hard red winter wheat from the Canadian Pacific Railway Dormitory Experiment Farm in the Canadian North West was forwarded by Mr. Alexander Macdonald, Superintendent Canadian Pacific Railway in Europe, to Mr. J. H. Dunham, of the \"Miller\" at a former Colchester, Essex, England, and there seen in what was but partly opened when the sample was gathered on August 12th. Threshing showed to be well developed very sound, and in every respect an excellent sample.\n\nOn the London market the quota price for grain was fixed from 34 to 36 shillings per quarter of 60 lbs, while the best Red wheat was fetching only 32 to 33 shillings, in other words two Canadian North West samples stood up well against English, and obtained a better price.\n\nThe general expression of English millers and dealers was that the wheat was unquestionably a very fine sample, and almost any quantity will be had without difficulty and shipped will find a profitable market in Great Britain.\n\nGuelph.\n\nGuelph, Sept. 21. \u2014 Clippers beat the Maple Leafs by 7 to 4.\n\nLondon.\n\nLondon, Sept. 21. \u2014 London, 9, Leeds.\n\nNotice of Dissolution.\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership existing between the undersigned as \"Stewart Brothers,\" in Prince Albert, in the North West Territories,\n\nGEORGE MERCHANTS\n\nfor the day following the death of William Stewart, the balance of the Partnership is to be paid to Mr. John Stewart who will carry on the same business under the style of \"George Stewart Brothers and Co.\" and will pay all debts due.\n\nDated at Prince Albert, this 21st day of October, 1885.\n\n(Signed) WILLIAM STEWART,\nby his administrator John Stewart.\n\nJOHN STEWART.\n\nPrince Albert.\n\nReferring to the above we beg to submit that the said Partnership is hereby dissolved.\n\nSTEWART BROTHERS.\n\nPrince Albert, Oct. 21, 1885.\n\nJAMES SIMCLAIR\n\nMerchant Tailor,\n\nAND DEALER IN\n\nGENTS' FURNISHINGS.\n\nAt T.

MACDONALD,\n\nSuperintendent General, Indian Affairs\nTHE SWITCH-TENDER.\n\nA Thrilling Precious Story.\n\nA little white house seems asleep among the blossoming apple trees. It is early morning, and all is light and fresh. In a little room, a man and woman sit by the threshold, a man with a quiet face and an expectant look in his eyes. There is a movement outside the front door\u2014a tree\u2014The man opens the window broader, and from the tree, like a sylvan rustler, comes a smiling little fair-haired girl, who throws herself, with a burst of laughter, into his arms.\n\n\"May I take the little one, Celine?\" asks the father. At these words a lovely blush overspreads the child, much to her appearance.\n\n\"Again!\" she said with a shade of annoyance.\n\n\"Yes, we share her very fairly,\" said the man with the kindest and most paternal smile. \"If you knew,\" he resumed, \"how much the child has been going through. Don't you think me too hard when I find them up long in her absence? Anne grows more restless, more troublesome every day. It is dangerous to let her go with you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said the man, turning pale.\n\n\"I mean that I am afraid of your rail-road, sir, where you are so accustomed.\"\n\n\"You are very foolish.\"\n\n\"Leave her here. I can hardly breathe while a little girl is down there. It is frightful to think how she might get away and be killed.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so, Celine.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, she is always away while you are at the switch, and if you looked to after her, you would fail in your duty, and might be responsible for her death.\"\n\n\"Oh, Celine, you don't,\" cried Laurence, who had rushed in at the moment.\n\nThe child was familiar with the passage of the train, it is true, but she is too young to comprehend the danger.\" And his appearance seemed to have vanished.\n\nOne evening, however, when he went home to dinner he had been preceded by the rumor of an accident which had occurred at a neighboring station. A brake man named Simon had been killed by a train. Celine questioned her husband while they were at supper. \"It is true then, the little girl killed Simon?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Laurence, \"he was in great danger, but he escaped, thanks to his wonderful presence of mind.\"\n\n\"There he is now,\" said Celine.\n\n\"No; and yet the whole town went over him. When Simon saw it too late to save himself, he seized the brake lever of the engine, and when the train passed by he got up again and again and again, until he was made free. At last, as he fell, there came a crash, and he was very warm, after that the time seemed long. That was not killed, but Simon was not really frightened. He is ready to go to work again,\" added Laurence, tranquilly.\n\nBut Celine's anxieties were aroused afresh. Some time after that the hour of service came round, and Celine took the sign section. He could no longer think of taking Anne with him on the evening hours, a poem about the village was inscribed on it. The doc tor who came wrote a prescription, and it is the physicians who find them. They cannot see the child in the town, and you must not wait for them. Let me go on to the railway station where we shall stop and ask the station master on my account for a little lameness. That will quiet the child down. We shall go back and fetch the doctor.\"\n\n\"Celine! Celine!\" cried several times. It was certain that the station master would not hesitate to lend them a hand.\n\nThe young woman thought at first of leaving Anne alone, as she had particu larly restless all day, Celine concluded to take her. They had to pass Lamont's store on their way, and they heard Anne now coming, and as soon as they were within hearing, began to question them.\n\n\"Old Gratehouse is very ill, and I am going to the station for medicine.\"\n\n\"That's right. We have Anne.\"\n\nCeline lifted the sign over the head of his father, who took the precious burden on his shoulders and returned with her mother, before whom she lay.\n\nSuddenly the engine appeared, the smoke curling, the darkness gathering, the noise coming, the children stopped. Anne did not stop, however, but travelled faster than her companions. He realized that the child regarded everything as duty. He saw in the station the frightful accident he would have caused, and heard the cries of the wounded, the last gasps of the dying. The problem was before him\u2014his daughter or others? It was no alternative between the two. With a feeling prompting the sentiment of duty became most powerful, and he saw not merely in his hands the lives of two children, but a thousand more, perhaps the future of a nation. He paused, finally knowing what he did, and went to meet the child.\n\n\"Oh, on it went, and he could see it pass the station, going by as if it were happy and carefree. He turned back, into the darkness. Duty had been strongest. Staggered, staggered, Anne, Laurence came to the house where they had helped him kill his child.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"it is my turn to die.\"\n\nThe other train was about to pass. He stepped forward, crossed his arms, and waited. The child stood still, hesitating, hesitating, hesitating, thinking of nothing, there he stood.\n\nBut that instant a burst of laughter sounded behind him. He turned, wild with hope.\n\n\"Oh, naughty papa! he won't play with Anne,\" said the most beloved of voices.\n\nThe child was clinging to him. Laurence bent not to see, but to hear. His feet came then alike. He raised her and fed with his treasure into his little cabin. Then he put her on the ground before the fire, and Anne laughed, and Anne bore so much joy and felt fainting beside her daughter, who, in her turn, screamed with delight.\n\nAt this moment Celine arrived. She heard Anne's voice, and hastened her steps. Anne's stepping inspired her also. Anne! Anne! Anne! She ran to Anne, crying, \"Mamma, mamma, I am frightfully hurt.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Papa has fallen down.\"\n\nCeline rushed toward the nearby bench. Anne stood there completely in silence, stretched on the ground. She went for help, and the doctor, who had been called by Anne, restored the poor man to consciousness. The next day when Laurence rose his wife, Anne, came to the window, and looked out toward the east, where she had exhibited a corpse like pillar which never left him to the sight of man. Laurence proceeded to tell them all. When he had finished, the poor father turned to Anne and said:\n\n\"Bah, darling, why weren't you quicker?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the child, \"I did what Simon did.\"\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nPlanning Mills and\n\nSash and Door Factory\n\nCor.
