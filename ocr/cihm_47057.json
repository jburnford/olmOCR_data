compliance with the Resolution of the Board, communicated to me by the Secretary, on the 8th February last, I have prepared a Report on the Railways of Canada, for the past two years, (1859 and 1860,) which I have now the honor to submit for your consideration.\n\nThe delay which has occurred in its production, was occasioned chiefly by the time occupied in collecting from the Companies the necessary fiscal and statistical information, which it was attempted this year (for the first time) to elicit. The call being new, and the Companies unprepared to furnish such details, many of these returns had to be sent back for correction and explanation,\u2014some are still imperfect, and others altogether wanting. After the Secretary had collected this information, as far as he could, my public duties in another Department, prevented me from giving my undivided attention to the subject.\n\nNow, however, that a commencement has been made, it is to be hoped that the same difficulties and delays will not be experienced in the preparation of future Reports.\n\nThe information embodied in this Report will be found of public interest. It shows the progress made in these two years in the substitution of permanent for temporary works on the old lines; the number of miles of new road constructed, inspected, and opened in each of these two years. It contains the Official Reports of the Accidents which have occurred, made in conformity to the requirements of the Act 20 Vic., Cap. 12. These are tabulated, arranged and classified under their different causes, and such general observations and suggestions added, as the Inspector considered it his duty to offer.\n\nThe Report also furnishes a statement of the cost and operations of the Railways for the year 1860,\u2014derived from official returns \u2014so far, at least, as these returns enable me to give them. The statistical information contained in the abstracts, furnishes a general idea of the Railway economy of Canada for that year, but it is to be regretted that the incompleteness of the returns has rendered it impossible, at this time, to present a more perfect exposition of it.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nSAMUEL KEEFER,\nInspector of Railways.\n\nHon. A. T. Galt,\nChairman, Board Railway Comm'rs.,\n&c., &c., Quebec.\nREPORT ON THE RAILWAYS OF CANADA, FOR THE YEARS 1859 AND 1860.\n\nI.\u2014RAILWAYS CONSTRUCTED.\n\nThe Statement No. 1, of Appendix contains a list of sixteen Railways in operation in Canada, on the 1st January, 1861, with the dates of the openings of the several sections, and their lengths corrected according to the most recent returns.\n\nReferring to the Report for 1858, and making the corrections according to these returns, it will be seen that, up to the close of that year, there had been constructed, in Canada, (instead of 1612 miles) 1614.15 miles of Railway; but the Preston and Berlin, 11 miles, and the Cobourg and Peterborough, 28 \"closed at that time, in all\" 39 being deducted, left 1575.15 in operation at the close of 1858, since which time, however, the Cobourg and Peterboro' was re-opened in 1859 28 and other new lines having been completed, inspected and opened within these past two years, as follows, viz:\u2014\n\nIn 1859, according to Statement No. 3 248.79 In 1860, according to Statement No. 4 29.02\n\nMaking in all, according to Statement No. 2 1880.96 miles of Railway in operation, in Canada, on the 1st January, 1861, under sixteen different corporations.\n\nThe following abstract, derived from Statement No. 1, shews the number of miles of Railway constructed, in each year, since the period of the Census taken on the 12th January, 1852.\n\nRailways constructed up to the period of the Census,\n\n| Date       | Miles |\n|------------|-------|\n| 12th January, 1852 | 91.76 |\n| In the year 1852     | 98    |\n| \" 1853            | 212   |\n| \" 1854            | 329.75|\n| \" 1855            | 236.14|\n| \" 1856            | 487   |\n| \" 1857            | 69    |\n| \" 1858            | 140.50|\n| \" 1859            | 248.79|\n| \" 1860            | 29.02 |\n\nDeducting Preston and Berlin, not open 1891.98\n\nLines in operation, 1st January, 1861 1880.96 Miles.\nFor fiscal purposes, in connection with the cost, the earnings and working expenses of these lines, it becomes indispensable to take account of those connections in the United States, which are owned and managed by the same Corporations, and which are as follows:\n\n1. By the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\n\nThe Portland Division, from the Canada Boundary to Portland... 106 miles\nThe Detroit extension, from Port Huron to Detroit............. 50 \" \n\n2. By the Montreal and Champlain Railway Company.\n\nFrom the Canada Boundary to Rouse's Point.................... 2 miles\n\nIn the United States ........................................... 227\nIn Canada.......................................................... 1880.96\n\nIncluding Branches, Total........................................ 2107.96\n\nThere is no double track upon any of these lines, but they are provided, in the aggregate, with 218.93 miles of sidings, equal to 10\u00bd per cent of the length of the main lines.\n\nII.\u2014IN PROGRESS.\n\nAccording to Statement No. 5, there were 111\u00bd miles of Railway in course of construction, on the 1st January, 1861, of which it is expected that 52\u00bd miles will be completed this year.\n\nOf the new lines opened in 1859 and 1860, 131\u00bd miles were inspected, previously to opening, by the Hon. H. H. Killaly, and the Assistant Inspector, Mr. A. DeGrassl. The remaining 149 miles, including the Victoria Bridge, were inspected by the undersigned. (See Statements Nos. 3 and 4, and the Inspectors' Report No. 1, on the testing of the Bridge.)\n\nIII.\u2014BRIDGING.\n\nSome progress has been made, during the past two years, towards increasing the permanency and efficiency of the existing lines; more especially on the Great Western, the Grand Trunk, the Buffalo and Lake Huron, the Northern, the Port Hope and Lindsay, and the Montreal and Champlain Railways.\n\nWithin this time twenty Tressel Bridges have been replaced by permanent Culverts and Embankments, and eight Wooden Bridges, 1223 feet in aggregate length, have given place to permanent Bridges of Iron or Stone. Thus temporary works measuring upwards of a mile in length have been replaced by permanent structures; and ten Wooden Bridges, 1313 feet in total length, have been rebuilt during the same time. (See Statement No. 6.)\n\nA description of all the Bridging existing on the Railways in Canada, upon the 1st January last, is given in Statements Nos. 7 and 8. Upon the 1880.96 miles then in operation, there were 840 Bridges, having in all 3169 tspan, and measuring, altogether, 94,361 feet, or a little short of 18 miles. Of these, 672 are of Wood, 147 of Iron, 11 of Brick or Stone, and 10 are Swing Bridges, 7 of which are of Wood, and 3 of Iron.\nThe 672 Wooden Bridges measure ........................................... 62,432 feet.\nThe 147 Iron \" \" ......................................................... 29,934 \" \"\nThe 11 Stone or Brick \" \" .................................................. 1,848 \" \"\nThe 10 Swing Bridges \" \" .................................................... 1,047 \" \"\n\nIn all, 840 Bridges, measuring ............................................. 94,361 feet.\n\nThe average distance between Bridges is 2.24 miles, and the average Bridging per mile, fifty feet: showing a material improvement since the first Report in 1858.\n\nComparing the two years, ....................... 1858 and 1860.\nThe average distance between Bridges ...... 2.00 miles. 2.24 miles.\nAverage Bridging per mile ...................... 59\u00bd feet. 50 feet.\n\nIV.\u2014ACCIDENTS IN 1859.\n\nNo accident, by which any person was injured, has occurred, during this year, upon any of the following seven lines of Railway:\n\n- The Erie and Ontario.\n- The Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton.\n- The St. Lawrence and Industry.\n- The Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly.\n- The Prescott and Ottawa.\n- The Cobourg and Peterborough.\n- The Peterborough and Chemung Lake.\n\nUpon the other nine Railways, the official returns from the several Companies, made in compliance with the Act, show an aggregate of 53 persons killed, and 47 injured, during the same period. Of these, there were 9 passengers killed and 27 injured; 25 employees killed and 10 injured, and 19 others killed and 10 injured.\n\nThe causes which have led to these accidents may be classified under the eleven following heads:\n\n| SUMMARY OF ACCIDENTS IN 1859. | PASSENGERS | EMPLOYEES | OTHERS | TOTAL |\n|-------------------------------|------------|-----------|--------|-------|\n|                               | K. | I. | K. | I. | K. | I. | K. | I. |\n| 1.

(See Report No. 17.) Two others on the same Railway, returned as passengers, but more properly trespassers, (because endeavouring to ride outside without paying fare)\u2014one of whom, in attempting to ride on the platform of the baggage car, was burned to death by his clothes having taken fire; the other in trying to get on a similar platform, at a station, while the train was in motion, fell and was run over. A passenger in endeavoring to embark on a train at Point Levi, while it was moving, fell, and the train passed over him; two others fell between the cars, while the train was in transit, one of whom was reported to have been intoxicated at the time. From these facts it appears that five out of the nine passengers who were killed by the trains during this year, came to their end from their own fault or imprudence.\n\nThe twenty-five employ\u00e9s of the Railway Companies were killed under the following circumstances, viz:\u2014\n\nThe Engine-driver, Fireman and Brakeman of the Train, at the accident on the Great Western Railway, near Dundas, before referred to; a Conductor and Engine-driver, by a collision on the Grand Trunk Railway, at Arthabaska. (See Return No. 18.) Five Brakemen crushed to death in coupling or uncoupling cars; seven Trackmen run over in hand-cars; four getting on or off Trains when in motion; one loading spars at a Station, killed by the fall of a spar; one (intoxicated) walking on the track; one found dead, supposed to have been walking on the track; and one run over while lying insensible on the track, supposed to have had sun-stroke.\n\nOf the nineteen other persons killed, fourteen were walking on the track, where they had no right to be; two committed suicide by throwing themselves upon the track in front of an approaching Train; and the other three were found dead upon the track. It is painful to add that seven of these are reported as having been intoxicated; two were deaf, and one supposed to have been a lunatic.\n\nINJURED.\n\nOf the twenty-seven passengers injured in 1859, twenty-five received their injuries in the accident on the Great Western Railway, near Dundas, above referred to. (See Official Return No. 17.) One was injured by a collision, occasioned by the detention of a Train in a snow-drift, and one by jumping off a Train while in motion.\n\nOf the ten employ\u00e9s injured, three struck against bridges; three were coupling or uncoupling cars; one by the breaking of a bridge; two getting on or off Trains in motion; and one travelling in a hand-car after dark.\n\nOf the ten others injured, three were attempting to cross the track in the face of advancing Trains; four were walking on the track; one riding in a hand-car; one thrown off the track by the cow-catcher; and one had an arm broken at a Station.\n\nV.\u2014ACCIDENTS IN 1860.\n\nThe Official Returns shew that, during this year, on the following lines of Railway, no personal injuries of any kind have been sustained:\u2014\nThe St. Lawrence and Industry.\nThe London and Port Stanley.\nThe Cobourg and Peterborough.\nThe Peterborough and Chemung Lake.\n\nBut upon the other twelve lines, the Returns show an aggregate of fifty-four persons killed, and fifty-four injured during the same period. Of these, it appears that there were four passengers killed and three injured; twenty-one employ\u00e9s killed and forty injured; and twenty-nine others killed and eleven injured.\n\n| SUMMARY OF ACCIDENTS IN 1860. | PASSENGERS | EMPLOYEES | OTHERS | TOTAL |\n|-------------------------------|------------|-----------|--------|-------|\n|                               | K.         | L.        | K.     | I.    |\n| 1.

One passenger, being intoxicated, tried to get on the Train after it had started; one was riding on the platform of a car, fell off and was crushed; one reported \"unknown,\" was \"supposed to have fallen from the Mail Train;\" and the fourth, whose fate may be considered as an admonition to all travellers by rail, is thus referred to in the Report. \"This man was at the Station before the Train was due to leave; purchased his ticket, but neglected to take his seat in the proper way. Attempting to get on the Train after it had started, he fell between the cars, &c.\"\n\nOf the twenty-one employ\u00e9s killed, eight were in the service of the Grand Trunk Railway; six in that of the Great Western; three in that of the Northern; two, the Buffalo and Lake Huron; one, the Montreal and Champlain; and one, the Stanstead, Shefford and Chamby Railway.\n\nTwo of those killed on the Grand Trunk were brakemen, in the act of coupling cars; one by Train off track, caused by a broken rail; one run over by a snow-plough; one by striking against a bridge; one, a trackman, walking on the track; and two, a laborer and a fireman, by the collision which took place at Stratford on the 17th April, 1860, between a tie train and a freight train, (and\nin which sixteen other laborers are reported as injured.) In this case, the verdict of the Coroner's Jury alleged neglect on the part of Ludlaw, the Conductor, and Baxter, the Engineman, in not attending to the Company's rules. These parties were accordingly arrested and indicted for manslaughter at the Stratford Assizes, were tried and acquitted.\n\nFour of the employ\u00e9s killed on the Great Western, were brakesmen\u2014one in coupling cars\u2014one attempting to pass under a car whilst it was in motion\u2014one trying to catch a platform car in motion\u2014and one in the act of signalling the Engineman, lost his balance and fell from the roof of the car. The fifth was a yardsman, run over by the Engine at Suspension Bridge, and the sixth a trackman, found dead on the track, having been run over by the train. No verdict given.\n\nOne of the employ\u00e9s killed on the Northern Railway was a Conductor, in the act of coupling cars; one whose remains were found upon the track, was supposed to have been killed by the mail train, and another, who had been intoxicated, was found dead upon the track.\n\nOne of the employ\u00e9s killed on the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway, by striking against a bridge, was a brakeman. The other, the car Inspector, Mr. Thomas Grey, of the Great Western Railway at Paris Station, was killed on duty there, while examining the wheels of the Great Western Emigrant train, going West. This train, being then at a stand, was run into, at the crossing, by a special freight train of the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway, on the 11th October, 1860, going East, by which a car was thrown upon the Inspector, and caused his death. For Report of this accident, the Verdict at the Inquest, and the Company's demur thereto, see Return No. 29.\n\nOn the Montreal and Champlain Railway, one employ\u00e9 was run over and killed by a train\u2014he was supposed to have been asleep at the time.\n\nOn the Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly Railway, a fireman engaged in oiling his engine while it was in motion, slipped and fell, and the engine passed over him. Of the 29 others killed, 26 may be set down as trespassers on the Railway enclosures; 15 of these are represented as intoxicated, and in that state, to have been either walking, standing, or lying on the track when run over by the trains. One unknown person, lying on the track, was supposed to have been insane; four were deaf, and one deaf and dumb; two were the children of the trackmen; two were boys trying to get on the cars at Stations; one unknown person found dead near the track, (death not accounted for,) and another killed trying to cross the track. A woman, trying to cross the track while the train was under way, fell, and was instantly killed; a farmer, who, with his wife, attempted to drive across the track in front of an approaching train, had his waggon struck by the engine: the horses took fright and ran away and he was thrown out and killed.\n\n**INJURED.**\n\nOf the three passengers injured, two were on the Grand Trunk, and one on the Great Western; two met with their misfortunes from attempting to get on the trains when under way, and the third, by a train being thrown off the track, in consequence of running over four horses.\n\nA very large proportion of employ\u00e9s, (no less than 40,) have received injuries of a more or less serious nature by the operations of the past year. Sixteen of these\nwere laborers in the service of the Contractors for the maintenance of way on the Grand Trunk Railway, and received their injuries in the collision which took place near Stratford, referred to at page 12. These men, having finished their day's work, were proceeding homeward in the \"Caboose\" of the \"tie train,\" which was attached next the engine, and several platform cars in rear of it. As this car, which contained about 30 men, was utterly demolished in the collision which ensued, it is only surprising the casualties were not more fatal. Eleven of the employ\u00e9s have received injuries in coupling or uncoupling cars; two in getting on or off the train, and one by falling from the train in motion; one, a trackman, in a hand car, on the time of the Express Train; one standing on the track; three, by striking against bridges; two, by the bursting of a Locomotive Boiler on the Great Western Railway; two by the breaking down of a wood car on the Grand Trunk Railway, and one, a Conductor, on the Northern Railway, by the breaking of an axle.\n\nOf the eleven other persons injured, who were neither passengers or employ\u00e9s, four, who are reported to have been tipsy, were walking or lying on the track; one was struck by a snow-plough; one deaf and infirm; one driving across the track at a road crossing; one going under an engine; one lying between the rails when the train passed over him; one walking on the track of the Great Western Railway, and having his attention engrossed by a train passing on the Welland Railway, did not see the approaching train, or hear the whistle in time to avoid it; and one, in attempting to get on an engine. Nine of these persons were trespassers on the railway enclosures.\n\nIt is further to be observed of the accidents of 1860, that no less than 23 persons, or about 22 per cent of the whole number who have suffered death or injury by the Railway operations of that year, are reported to have been under the influence of liquor. These are classified as follows:\n\nOne \"passenger,\" two \"employ\u00e9s\" and fifteen \"others\" killed, and five \"others\" injured.\n\nThe following list of Companys' servants will serve to shew upon what class of persons in railway service the casualties of 1860 have most heavily fallen.\n\n| Service          | Killed | Injured |\n|------------------|--------|---------|\n| Conductors       | 1      | 4       |\n| Brakemen         | 10     | 14      |\n| Car Inspectors   | 1      | 0       |\n| Firemen          | 2      | 0       |\n| Switchmen        | 0      | 1       |\n| Yardsmen         | 1      | 0       |\n| Trackmen         | 5      | 1       |\n| Porters          | 0      | 1       |\n| Labourers        | 1      | 18      |\n\nTotal .............. 21 39\n\nOf this list, it is reported that disobedience of rules has occasioned the death of four brakemen, one fireman, and one car inspector.\n\nOf the whole number of persons killed in 1860, 7 per cent were passengers, 40 per cent employ\u00e9s, and 53 per cent neither passengers nor employ\u00e9s.\n\nOne half of the deaths have been occasioned by persons being improperly on the track, or attempting to cross it when a train was approaching.\nIn 1860, one passenger was killed for every 26,847,305 miles travelled, and one was either killed or injured for every 15,341,317 miles travelled.\n\nVI.\u2014GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE ACCIDENTS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.\n\nThe following abstract furnishes a comparative statement of the accidents which have happened in these three years, on all the railways in Canada, to the three classes denominated passengers, employ\u00e9s and others.\n\n| Classification | 1858 | 1859 | 1860 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Passengers     | 7    | 4    | 9    |\n|                | 27   | 4    | 3    |\n| Employ\u00e9s       | 19   | 17   | 25   |\n|                | 10   | 21   | 40   |\n| Others         | 25   | 6    | 19   |\n|                | 10   | 29   | 11   |\n| Totals         | 51   | 27   | 53   |\n|                | 47   | 54   | 54   |\n| Miles open     |      |      |      |\n|                | 1575 | 1852 | 1881 |\n\nMiles travelled by passengers: 91,027,299\nMiles travelled for one passenger killed: 13,003,900\nMiles travelled for one passenger killed or injured: 8,275,209\n\nStriking an average for these three years, it is found that one passenger was killed for every 14,995,150 miles travelled, which is equal to travelling 600 times the circuit of the earth; and one has met with an accident in which he was either killed or injured, for every 5,551,907 miles travelled. Considering that all the business is done upon a single track, these results shew a favorable degree of safety in the working of the Railways, so far at least, as the welfare of the passengers is concerned. But the persons who have suffered most from the introduction of Railways, are not those who make use of them, to travel by them, nor yet those engaged in working them, but \u201cothers\u201d who have no connexion with them whatever, and who, without any right, and entirely by their own imprudence, make use of the track as a convenience for going from place to place.\n\nThe Companies\u2019 Rules forbid this practice, but as every individual feels confident of being able to take care of himself, and avoid the trains, it is a most difficult matter to enforce their observance. Considerably more than one-third of those who have been killed were of this class. Of 158 killed and 128 injured in these three years, 63 of the killed and 18 of the injured, were \u201cwalking, standing, or lying on the track.\u201d The same kind of imprudence has led to the death of 16 of the Companies\u2019 employ\u00e9s during the same period.\n\nIt is difficult to suggest any course that shall tend to diminish this class of casualties, unless it be that the several Companies should adopt more stringent means to prevent the public making use of their track.\n\nThere is one class of accidents, however, to which the attention of the Companies might be advantageously directed, with a view of adopting measures to avoid a recurrence of them; that is, the fatal results attending the coupling of cars. 14 of the Companies\u2019 servants have been killed, and 19 injured in this service during the last three years, facts which appear to indicate some mechanical defect in the existing modes.\nIn my Report for 1858, at pages 18 and 19, the dangers to which the Railway servants were exposed in the performance of this simple duty, were clearly pointed out, and a remedy, (tending, at least, to reduce the risk) suggested. No action having been taken upon it, I venture to revert to the subject, as one demanding the earnest attention of all Railway Managers, hoping yet to see the difficulty overcome by the mechanical skill and ingenuity at their command.\n\nAmongst the various devices for self couplers, designed to obviate the risk of coupling by hand, no one has yet proved to be of such practical value as to find favor with the Companies, and come into general use. The single bunters now in use on the Northern Railway, being placed in the line of traction, would, from their form, and the few casualties attending them, seem to be the best; while the double headed bunters reaching out horizontally eighteen inches from the centre of the coupling, being the kind most generally in use, would seem to require some modification of form or position to render them more safe. In addition, therefore, to the suggestions thrown out in the former Report, I would now propose for consideration, whether the coupling might not be effected with greater ease and safety, by merely changing the double headed bunters from a horizontal to a vertical position.\n\nI would also again respectfully call attention to the other subjects adverted to in that Report.\n\n1. Level crossings of Railways.\n2. Level crossings of common roads with Railways.\n3. Clearing the extra width.\n4. Ballasting.\n5. Signal switches.\n6. Assimilation of Signals.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to repeat the statements and recommendations contained in that Report, in reference to these subjects; but as nothing has been effected since the date of it, either by the Legislature, or the Companies, for the improvement of the Railway system in these particulars, and considering them of the same importance as I did then; and entertaining the same views in regard to them, I would again respectfully urge, for the consideration of the Board, whether some action might not be taken by it to bring these subjects under the notice of the proper authorities.\n\nVII.\u2014FISCAL AND STATISTICAL RETURNS.\n\nAn attempt has been made, for the first time, to collect and arrange in a concise form, information of a reliable character in reference to the cost and operation of the Railways of Canada.\n\nWith this view, printed forms of Returns were sent to the Secretaries of the several Railway Companies, with a request to have them filled up; and at the same time to transmit copies of their accounts for the year 1860, giving:\n\n1. A Statement of Receipts and Expenditures on \u201cCapital Account,\u201d up to the end of the year.\n2. Revenue Account, Receipts and Expenditures for the year.\n3. A General Balance Sheet for the year.\n\nIn order not to trouble the Companies with too many details at first, the form was made as concise as possible, consistent with the object of bringing out the\nleading facts intended to present a general view of the Financial position of these important enterprises; and to show the business they were doing, and at what expense. Further details may be elicited in future Returns.\n\nWith few exceptions, the Companies have responded to this request, and furnished the desired information so far as they were able; but owing, doubtless, to the call being new, many of the facts called for, have not been supplied; thereby, unfortunately rendering it a matter of impossibility to present aggregate results, or to strike averages upon the operations of the year.\n\nSuch facts as are contained in these Returns, will be found arranged in a tabular form, in Tables Nos. 11 to 16 inclusive; which, although incomplete as far as relates to the aggregate results, will be found well worthy of attentive consideration.\n\nWhen taking a general view of the cost and working of these lines, and giving an account of their Receipts and Expenditures, it becomes necessary to take account also of the connecting lines in the United States, which are owned and managed by the same corporations, and therefore the whole length of main line and branches is taken at 2107.96 miles, while the whole length in Canada alone is 1880.96 miles.\n\nFrom these Tables then, we learn that upon the 1974.46 miles of Railway, of the ten lines for which we have Returns, the total amount expended upon the Road and its equipment, up to the end of 1860, was $97,179,641.75, making the average cost per mile $49,218.\n\nThe amount of Capital Stock paid in is $38,278,986.19, equal to $19,387 per mile.\n\nOn 9 lines.\u2014The Funded Debt\u20141st Preference Bonds........$21,743,005.66\n\" 8 \" \" 2nd \"

STOCK.\n\n1. Locomotive Engines.\n\nThe Official Returns of the several Companies, giving the number, description, and general condition of the Locomotive Engines employed by them, during the past two years, together with the number of miles run by them up to the end of each year, cannot fail to be of special interest to the Mechanical Engineer, and to the Railway Managers generally, and therefore their publication is continued. They will be found in the Appendix No. 63 to 99 inclusive.\n\nAbstracts of these Returns have been prepared, from which we learn, (See Appendix No. 62;) that at the end of the year 1859, there were 384 Locomotive Engines on all the Railways, 54 of which were made in Canada, 221 in the United States, and 109 in Great Britain. The relative performances of these engines, since the time they were placed in service, may readily be ascertained by reference to these returns. At the end of the year 1860, there were 394 Engines on all the Railways, 268 of which were reported in good order, 56 requiring slight repairs, and 72 requiring heavy repairs.\n\nAs regards their place of manufacture, 57 were built in Canada, 229 in the United States, and 109 in Great Britain. It may here be remarked, that the oldest Engine in Canada, is the Dorchester, now in the service of the St. Lawrence and Industry Railway, where it ran 4,300 miles last year. It is a 10 Ton Engine; 10 inch cylinder, inside connections; one pair 4 feet drivers, built by George Stephenson & Son, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. It was put in use in 1849, and has run altogether 66,000 miles, and is still serviceable.\n\nThe most work has been performed by the Portland Engine, No. 108, of the Grand Trunk Railway; put in service, January, 1851. It has run since that time to the end of 1860, 193,635 miles; and in 1860, 25,348 miles, and is reported still in good order. The weight of this Engine and Tender, with wood and water, is 42.8 Tons.\n\n2\u2014Rolling Stock.\n\nAccording to Abstracts No. 62 and 81, of the Official Returns of Rolling Stock in use on all Roads at the close of each of the past two years, it appears that there were in\n\n| Class                        | 1859 | 1860 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n| 1st Class Passenger Cars     |      |      |\n| 16 wheels                    | 1    |      |\n| 12 wheels                    | 26   | 25   |\n| 8 wheels                     | 208  | 223  |\n| 4 wheels                     | 1    | 1    |\n| 2nd Class Passenger and Emigration Cars | 121 | 119 |\n| 8 wheels                     |      |      |\n| 4 wheels                     | 4    | 3    |\n| Baggage, Mail, and Express   |      |      |\n| 12 wheels                    | 13   | 12   |\n| 8 wheels                     | 106  | 104  |\n| 4 wheels                     | 2    | 2    |\n| Box, Freight, and Cattle     |      |      |\n| 8 wheels                     | 2,703| 3,180|\n| 4 wheels                     | 104  | 101  |\n| Conductors, Cars             |      |      |\n| 8 wheels                     | 33   | 40   |\n| Description                          | Quantity |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|\n| Platform Cars, 12 wheels            | 4        |\n| \" 8 wheels                         |          |\n| Grain Cars                          | 50       |\n| Refrigerator Cars                   | 1        |\n| Gravel Cars, 8 wheels               | 100      |\n| \" 4 wheels                         | 294      |\n| Timber Cars, 16 wheels              | 6        |\n| \" 4 wheels                         |          |\n| Spar Trucks, 4 wheels              | 25       |\n| Hand Cars                           | 89       |\n| Snow Ploughs, large size            | 42       |\n\n**SAMUEL KEEFER,**\n\n*Inspector of Railways.*\n\nQUEBEC, 16th September, 1861\nAPPENDIX, No. 1.\n\nBROOKVILLE, December 19, 1859.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report, that in compliance with the instructions from the Honorable the Receiver General, acting Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners, conveyed to me in your letter of the 14th instant, I left Quebec on the 15th, and made my examination of the Victoria Bridge on the 16th, and of the Branch leading to it from the main line at Charon Station, on the 17th instant, and finding both Bridge and Branch perfectly safe for public use, the new line across the Bridge was this day opened for public traffic.\n\nThe test applied to the tubes of the Victoria Bridge, consisted of a train of 18 platform cars loaded with stones as heavily as they would bear, and drawn by two Locomotive Engines coupled. This train was long enough to reach over two spans at one time, and weighed, as nearly as could be ascertained without platform scales to weigh the cars, about one ton to the lineal foot. In passing this train over the Bridge, a load of 242 tons was laid on each of the side spans, and 330 tons upon the central span.\n\nThe side tubes being in pairs reaching from the abutment to the second pier, from the second to the fourth, and so on;\u2014they were submitted to a different test from the central one. The load, or forward part of the train was brought upon the first half, then the whole train covered the whole tube, and lastly, the rear part of the train rested upon the second half, and the effect noted each time, both at the middle of each half, and at points midway between the middle and the bearings, making six observations upon the tube each time of marking.\n\nThe tubes covering the 14th and 15th spans being yet unfinished and unconnected over the 14th pier, were, of course, on this occasion treated like the central one as independent tubes.\n\nA remarkable uniformity was observed in the effect of this load upon all the side tubes that were completed. When both halves of the tube were loaded, the deflection in each span was five eighths (\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)) of an inch, but when it rested on one half only, that half sunk three quarters (\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) to seven eighths (\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)) of an inch. The central and separate tubes deflected one inch and a quarter under a load of a ton to the foot.\n\nWhen the train was sent over at speed, the observed deflections did not exceed those just stated, more than the eighth part of an inch, and in all cases when the load was removed, the tubes returned immediately to their former position, thus proving in the most satisfactory manner, that they were entirely unaffected by the passing of a load which was double that of the heaviest freight train that will ever cross the Bridge.\n\nIt may be here remarked that the tubes of this Bridge were designed to sustain practically, a load of one ton per lineal foot throughout their length, in addition to their own weight; under which load, the horizontal strain was not to exceed five tons of tension to the square inch on the bottom, or five tons of compression to the square inch on the top. The test load applied was as near the intended load as it well could be.\nThese tubes present the finest specimen of Engineering skill and workmanship to be seen in any part of the world, and the public may have entire confidence in their strength and durability.\n\nThe preparations for testing the tubes in the manner before described, had been made by the Contractors Agent, Mr. Hodges, at the instance of Messrs. J. D. Bruce and B. P. Stockman, Engineers from the late Robert Stephenson's office, in London, who had been sent out from England to examine and report on the Bridge. The testing was commenced by them on the 15th instant, accompanied by Mr. A. M. Ross, (the Engineer in charge,) and by Mr. James Hodges, and was completed in my presence on the 16th instant. In reporting my entire satisfaction with the test applied and the sufficiency of the tubes, I desire at the same time to express my admiration of the simplicity and accuracy of the means adopted for observing the effect of these weights upon the Bridge, and of that perfection of workmanship in the tubes themselves, which are thus made to show so slight a deflection, under such heavy loads.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSAMUEL KEEFER,\nInspector of Railways.\n\nJ.

Vigil King, and Thomas Fawcett, came to their deaths in the manner following, that is to say:\n\n\"That on the morning of the 16th day of March instant, a certain Locomotive Steam Engine named the \"Elk,\" with a certain tender and baggage car attached thereto, and worked therewith; and also with drivers, to wit, four cars used for the conveyance of passengers for hire, (and forming the 'Express' train going East,) on a certain Railway called the Great Western Railway, and which said cars respectively were then attached and fastened together, and to the said Tender, and were then propelled or drawn by the said Locomotive Steam Engine, and were moving and travelling along the said Railway, towards the City of Hamilton\u2014and the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further say, that whilst and during the time the said Locomotive, Tender and Cars, were so moving and travelling along said Railway, they were suddenly precipitated into a breach, which, during a severe storm then raging, had been formed in a certain embankment, forming part of said Railway, and situated about two miles from the town of Dundas, by means whereof the said William Milne, Alexander Braid, George Morgan, and a person said to be Hans Peter Jochinson, there received divers mortal wounds, bruises, and concussions, of which the said William Milne, Alexander Braid, George Morgan, and a person said to be Hans Peter Jochinson, instantly died; That the said Charles Vigil King and Thomas Fawcett have subsequently died, and so the jurors aforesaid upon their oaths do say, that the said William Milne, Alexander Braid, George Morgan, a person said to be Hans Peter Jochinson, Charles Vigil King and Thomas Fawcett, in manner and by means aforesaid, came to their death, and not otherwise.\n\n\"They further say, that from a personal survey of the scene of said disaster and a careful examination of the immediate and adjacent grounds made in company with the Provincial Inspector of Railroads, they find that the said embankment has been formed on a slope of the mountain which rises above one hundred feet in height above it, at an angle of about 35 degrees; that the base of said embankment is a continuation of said slopes, though it may not fall at quite so great an angle; that it has been comprised of sand and gravel covering a trestle work, and is about sixty feet in perpendicular height on the south side, and about twenty-five on the north, or side next to the mountain; they further find that the point at which the breach has occurred, seems to be one of conveyance of a large portion of the surface water which is discharged from about sixty acres of the high table land to the northward of the Railway; they also find that the means which have been employed for conducting this converging flow of water from the natural basin, which it seems to have formed for itself at the base of the Railway embankment, have not been sufficient to prevent the water from penetrating it, and thus, no doubt, directly causing the breach which has occurred. They find that at the point of the breach there is no culvert, or drains of any kind through the embankment; and while there is a culvert at the distance of four hundred and fifty feet to the Eastward, of quite a sufficient capacity and strength to convey all the water which might, under any circumstances, drain towards it, and a sufficient decline for such drainage, yet the only channel for the intervening distance is formed simply by the angle of depression...\"\nof the mountain on one side, and the Railway embankment on the other. That\nthe natural drainage of about one thousand feet westward, is towards the said\nculvert, but the water instead of running down the said channel, has usually\npercolated through the embankment, except on the occasion of heavy rains,\nwhen a considerable portion of it, no doubt, has found its way to the culvert;\nthey also find that the decline towards the culvert is very irregular, for, accord-\ning to levels taken by the Government Inspector between the breach and the\nculvert, the greater portion of descent is within fifty feet of the culvert, and the\nhighest point is at the distance of about 350 feet, where the rise is 1,277 feet,\nwhile immediately opposite the breach, the rise is only 1,046, showing a basin\nof 2 feet 4 inches opposite the breach, which, of course, in cases of heavy rains,\nwould cause a body of water of upwards of two feet in depth to lie at this point\nor find its way through the loose stones at their base, through or under the\nembankment itself. Further, it is the unanimous opinion of said jurors, that\nhad there been either a culvert at the point of breach, or an efficient drain\nconstructed, communicating with the existing culvert, the disaster would not\nhave occurred. The said jurors would further add, that the Railway Company,\nnevertheless, seemed to have taken every reasonable precaution to provide\nagainst all the ordinary contingencies, and that their general arrangements are\nsuch as are well adapted for the security of passengers, and it is only to be\nregretted that their watchfulness has not been adequate to guard against the\neffects of a storm so severe as that lately experienced. The only suggestion the\nsaid jurors would be disposed to offer in the matter of such arrangements is,\nthat a watchman should be required on occasions of violent rains occurring\nduring the night, to pass frequently over embankments of such magnitude.\nThe said jurors would further add, that no culpability nor negligence can be\nattributed to the Conductor or other employ\u00e9s of the Company in charge of the\nill-fated train, but, on the contrary, their conduct has been characterized by all\npossible care and efficiency, and every assistance possible under the circum-\nstances, was rendered to the wounded.\n\nThe said jurors would, in conclusion, remark that they would fail in their\nduty, were they not to record their high approbation of the conduct of Mr.\nBrydges, the Managing Director, and other prominent officers of the Railway\nCompany, on the occasion of the sad accident. Their untiring efforts to alleviate\nthe distress, by the furnishing of medical and other attendance, the opening\nup of communication with the friends of the wounded, and the facilities which\nthey have in all respects, unsolicited, furnished for satisfactorily conducting\nthis investigation, have been such as to call for the thanks of the said jurors and\nall interested.\"\n\n(Signed,) JAMES McMILLAN,\nCoroner.\n\nA correct copy of the Verdict.\n\n(Signed,) W.

Sheppard, News Vendor.\u2014on the day of St. George\u2019s Society\u2019s Special Train, became intoxicated, and disregarding the injunctions of the Conductor to remain still in the cars, endeavored to pass from one to the other while in motion, and fell between them and was injured so that he died in a few days after. The Coroner\u2019s Jury exonerated the Company from blame. Accommodation South came in contact with a waggon at \u201cDavenport Road.\u201d At the above-mentioned place is a gravel pit; the track, from which crosses the highway, is parallel with the track. The horse and waggon referred to were standing between the two tracks. The horse, frightened by the Gravel Engine, backed up, and waggon was hit by the passing Train and badly broken. The occupants were not materially injured. A suit was brought by him which was decided in favor of the Company. Ran over a cow in the night, half a mile north of Lefroy. Threw tender and four box-cars off the track, completely destroying two of the cars; the fence was in good order at the above place. Was found near Long Bridge, after Train had passed, very much intoxicated, with his foot cut off; he was (according to his own statement) on the track, very much intoxicated, and did not hear the Train in time to save himself. |\n\n(Signed) J.

Railway on the 22nd September, 1860.\" |\n| Neither Passenger or Employ\u00e9 of this Company | Struck by cars and Fr't while standing at the crossing behind Gr't Western Train | About $2,000. | The Engineman Dean, being partially misled by the density of the fog prevailing, and not using sufficient caution, allowed the train to gain too great an impetus in descending the grade towards the station, so that when he became aware of its proximity to the crossing, the reversing of his Engine, (the brakes being previously applied) was insufficient to prevent the collision with Great Western Trains on the crossing. Enginemen dismissed for neglect of rules. | \"That deceased Thomas Grey, came to his death caused by injuries received from the Special Train on the B. & L. H. Railway running into the Emigrant train on the G. W. Railway, which seemed to be unavoidable, under the circumstances of the case. They also find from the evidence produced, that a sufficient force of brakemen were not employed on the B. & L. H. Train to govern its speed; also find that the Enginemen on the G. W. & Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway were not in the practice of attending to the rules of the Companies, viz.: to come to a dead stand before passing over the crossing where the accident occurred; and would recommend that this rule in future be regularly enforced.\" |\n| Two horses killed | Both legs crushed and otherwise injured by train passing over him | None | Density of fog and neglect of extra-precaution on the part of Bridge Watchman. The train was proceeding slowly, having, one mile west, been partially stopped, in order that the Engineman might ascertain their whereabouts. The fog so dense that the signal light was not discovered until the train was close upon it. Engine hit the bridge which was open, and moved it from its centre; injury to property slight, cars being all in condition to run to terminus. Incautious driving and inattention to signals; the person driving the team, admitted hearing the signal from the Engine, but drove too near the crossing before bringing the team to a stand; just as the Engine passed, the horses began plunging, and were knocked down by the Tender and killed. This man was at the Station before the train was due to leave, purchased his ticket, but neglected to take his seat in the proper way; attempting to get on the train after it had started, he fell between the cars and sustained injuries such as to cause death in a few hours. | \"That the deceased came to his death through his own carelessness.
