His Excellency Sir Edward Thornton, the Honourable Carl Schurz, Secretary of the Interior, and the Honourable E. A. Hayt, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, secured for me every facility for becoming acquainted with the establishment, cost and practical value of industrial schools among the Indian populations of the United States.\n\nThe industrial school is the principal feature of the policy known as that of \"aggressive civilization.\" This policy was inaugurated by President Grant in 1869. But, as will be seen, the utility of industrial schools had long evinced that time been amply tested. Acting on the suggestion of the President, Congress passed a law early in 1869, providing for the appointment of the Peace Commission. This Commission recommended that the Indians should, as far as practicable, be consolidated on few reservations, and provided with \"permanent individual homes\"; that the tribal relation should be abolished; that lands should be allotted in severalty and not in common; that the Indian should specially become a citizen of the United States, enjoy the protection of the law, and be made amenable thereto; that, finally, it was the duty of the Government to afford the Indians all reasonable aid in their preparation for citizenship by educating them in industry and in the arts of civilization. After eight years' experience of the partial carrying out of these recommendations, the Board pressed for a still more thorough policy; they urged, among other things, that titles to land should be inalienable from the family of the holder for at least three generations. From 1869 vigorous efforts in an educational direction were put forward. But it was found that the day school did not work, because the influence of the wigwam was stronger than the influence of the school. Industrial Boarding Schools were therefore established, and these are now numerous and will soon be universal. The cry from the Agencies where no boarding industrial schools have been established is persistent and earnest to have the want supplied.\nThe experience of the United States is the same as our own as far as the adult Indian is concerned. Little can be done with him. He can be taught to do a little at farming, and at stock-raising, and to dress in a more civilized manner, but that is all. The child, again, who goes to a day school learns little, and what little he learns is soon forgotten, while his tastes are fashioned at home, and his inherited aversion to toil is in no way combated.\n\nThere are two ways of conducting the industrial boarding schools. In the one, the Government carries on the school through the Agency; in the other, by contract. A contract is made, for instance, with the Episcopal Church authorities, or the Roman Catholic Church authorities, or with the authorities of any other body of Christians, to carry on an industrial boarding school among the Indians. One hundred and twenty-five dollars a year is paid for each pupil boarder, when the attendance at the school does not exceed thirty; in larger schools, one hundred dollars; and even less when the school is of considerable size. The Honourable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs is not in favour of the contract system, because the children at schools under contract do not, as a rule, get a sufficient quantity of food. The contractor, in addition to supplying the food, prepares the clothing, the raw material of which is found by the Government. The Commissioner was emphatic in his testimony as to the happy results which had attended the industrial schools wherever established. Experience has demonstrated that it is better to have the dormitory separated from the school. The school is now, therefore, always erected about ten rods from the dormitory. Thus the children are kept from spoiling the building.\n\nThe accompanying plan (Appendix A, Nos. 1 & 2), is a design for one of the schools of the cheapest kind. The cost of erecting such a structure does not exceed $1,000. In Canada, where, as a rule, we have plenty of timber, a building of the same class could be erected for eight hundred dollars or thereabouts. At the industrial school, in addition to the elements of an English education, the boys are instructed in cattle-raising and agriculture; the girls in sewing, breadmaking, and other employments suitable for a farmer's wife. In the case of the boys, agriculture is principally aimed at, cattle-raising requiring but few hands. Very many of the schools raise herds of cattle. Thus, at the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency there is a large herd belonging to the school. The stock, which is constantly increasing in number and value, is as follows:\n\n| Value |\n|-------|\n| On hand in 1877, 211 head of all kinds | $1,882.00 |\n| On hand in 1878, 359 head | 3,332.00 |\n| Increase of 148 head | $1,450.00 |\n\nDerived as follows:\n- By increase in value by growth | $560.00\n- \" stock, 100 calves | 500.00\nBy donations ........................................... $142.00\n\" earnings of school and sale of pork ............ $442.00\n\" value of ponies bought ......................... $110.00\n\nTotal .................................................. $81,694.00\n\nLess 6 head died and 10 turned over to boys leaving school ......................... $224.00\n\n$81,470.00\n\nOf the 359 head of stock of all kinds, 53 head belong to individual school children. The balance is common property. It is confidently expected that this school will be self-supporting in a few years. It is obvious that with such a stock, the yearly increase must be considerable, with commensurate profits.\n\nThe Industrial Boarding School is conducted by a Principal, who has one or more assistants in proportion to the number of scholars. What religion shall be taught in the school is generally easily settled, as the rule is to permit but one sect on an Agency. There is an exception to this rule, as will be seen, and the wisdom of it may be questioned.\n\nThe Friends, the Orthodox Friends, the Methodists, the Roman Catholics, the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the United Presbyterians, the Congregationalists, the Protestant Episcopalians, the Reformed Episcopalians, the Unitarians, the Christian Union, and the Evangelical Lutherans, have one or more of the seventy-four agencies allotted to them.\n\nWhen an agent is to be appointed, the candidate is chosen on the recommendation of a representative of one or other of these religious bodies. His, I was assured, worked well, and secured a superior class of agents. Appointing men for political services had proved a failure.\n\nAt Hampton (Virginia) there are fifty Government pupils, for each of whom one hundred and sixty-seven dollars, yearly, is paid, for board and tuition. This school is of a high grade, and the pupils sent there are intended for interpreters. The present Indian interpreter, as a rule, belongs to a degraded class, and translates the dialects very inefficiently.\n\nAt the ordinary industrial boarding school, managed by the Government through the Agency, each pupil costs, on an average, one hundred dollars a year. The yearly outlay on an industrial school for fifty children would therefore be about five thousand dollars a year. But for the first year the expense would certainly be more. The aim, however, would be to make these schools self-supporting, and when the same properly chargeable to capital account had been spread over a number of years, the school meanwhile being conducted on economical and profitable principles, even less than five thousand dollars might be found to meet every demand. The items are as below:\u2014\n| Item Description | Cost |\n|------------------|------|\n| School           | $800.00 |\n| Dormitory        | $800.00 |\n| Furniture        | $600.00 |\n| Salary of Principal, $800, or say | $1,000.00 |\n| Assistant, $500, \" | $700.00 |\n| Matron, $25 per month for 10 months | $250.00 |\n| Cook, $20 \" | $200.00 |\n| Laundress, $20 \" | $200.00 |\n| Seamstress, $20 \" | $200.00 |\n| 3 wagons, at $54 each | $162.00 |\n| 6 sets of double harness, at $22 each | $132.00 |\n| 7 breaking ploughs, at $15.90 | $111.30 |\n| 10 string \" | $285.00 |\n| 3 harrow \" | $15.50 |\n| 1 drill | $20.00 |\n| 2 sewing machines, at $30 each | $60.00 |\n| Clothing material for fifty children | $750.00 |\n| 1 organ | $86.00 |\n| Cattle, a few head | $100.00 |\n| Sheep and pigs, if sheep and pigs can be raised | $50.00 |\n| Horses | $200.00 |\n| Flour, 375 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at $\\frac{1}{3}$ cts. per lb | $282.19 |\n| Corn meal, 125 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at $\\frac{3}{4}$ cts. per lb | $187.91 |\n| Beef, fresh, 350 lbs a week for 10 mos. at 9 cts. per lb | $1,354.50 |\n| Pork or bacon, 50 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 10 cts. per lb | $215.00 |\n| Coffee, green, 12\u00bd lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 28 cts. per lb | $150.40 |\n| Tea, Congon, 14 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 37 cts per lb | $23.65 |\n| Sugar, 30 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 12\u00bd cts. per lb | $161.25 |\n| Beans, rice, or hominy, 25 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 8 cts. per lb | $86.00 |\n| Dried fruit, 25 lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 10 cts. per lb | $107.50 |\n| Syrup or molasses, 2\u00bd galls. a week for 10 mos. at 85 cts. per gallon | $91.16 |\n| Vinegar, 2\u00bc qts. a week for 10 mos. at 75 cts. per gall | $20.24 |\n| Salt, 12\u00bd lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 2 cts. per lb | $16.75 |\n| Soap, 12\u00bd lbs. a week for 10 mos. at 8 cts. per lb | $43.00 |\n| Baking powder, 2 lbs. week for 10 mos. at 42 cts. per lb | $36.12 |\n| Deduct as belonging to capital account | $82,200.00 |\n| Total | $82,550.00 |\n\nTotal: $82,550.00\nThere are, as a rule, blacksmith and carpenter and even shoemaker's shops on each Agency, where boys are taught a trade, but these are charged to the Agency.\n\nButter, eggs, milk, garden vegetables, raised and produced on the farm, may be used in addition to the above. The ration is a maximum, which the agent is directed to reduce when practicable.\n\nOn the Agencies, it may be remarked, in passing, Indian Police are employed with excellent results. Those I saw were, for the most part, of mixed blood. The Indians submit to their surveillance with more readiness than they would to that of whites. These police are paid $5 a month and their rations and clothes.\n\nThe happy results of Industrial Schools are strikingly shown in the case of the five \"civilized\" nations, the Cherokees, the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, the Creeks and Seminoles, who are all making undoubted progress in agriculture and in education. They number in all about sixty thousand, and occupy reservations on what is known as the \"Indian Territory,\" where it is the policy of the United States to settle as many Indian tribes as possible. This territory lies, roughly speaking, between 34 and 37 latitude and 96 and 100 longitude. A large proportion of the income of these nations is devoted to educational purposes. They have their own schools; a code of their own; a judiciary; a national council which enacts laws; newspapers in the native dialect and in English; and they are, in effect, five little republics within the Republic, but of course without the higher functions of empire. The Honourable the Commissioner arranged that I should meet some of the principal men of these nations, Colonel Pleasant Porter and W. D. M. Hodge (Creek Nation); Colonel Wm. P. Ross and his brother, Mr. D. H. Ross (Cherokee); Mr. Charles Thompson, the Chief of the Cherokees; ex-Judge Stellwagen (late of the Supreme Court of the Cherokee Nation), and Colonel Ashir; also Colonel Brown, of the Seminoles. They had all come up to Washington to watch the Indian Bills, which were before Congress. They made a remarkable group. But I am bound to say there was not one of them of pure Indian blood. Even the Chief, Mr. Charles Thompson, who looked the Indian, had a very slight Scotch strain in him. Colonel Pleasant Porter was in part of Irish descent, and looked like a Spanish grandee, or as the Commissioner said, like a Bank Director with a deep olive complexion. Colonel Wm. J. Ross had in his features scarcely a hint of Indian blood. Indeed he might have passed for a clever Scotchman.\n\nColonel Pleasant Porter had been educated at what he called the \"Manual Labour School,\" and gave the following account of the progress of education in his nation, an account which, on verification, proved to be correct:\n\n\"Up to twenty-two years ago,\" said Mr. Porter, \"the schools of the Creek nation were under the management of the United States Government. The Government\ncontracted with either the Presbyterians or Methodists to carry on Manual Labour Schools, as far back as thirty-two years ago. I am thirty-eight years of age, and was educated at one of these schools. About twenty years ago the control of the schools was transferred entirely to the Creek nation. The schools were still carried on by teachers appointed by the religious boards, but under contract with the nation, (that is, the Creek nation). Since then, we have established what is called the neighborhood schools system\u2014day schools in fact\u2014among the five civilized nations. Day-schools carry no disadvantage, because the child's home is a civilized home.\n\nMr. Porter here assured me that the five \"civilized\" nations were accurately so described. But Colonel Brown, of the Seminoles, stated that they never could, in his opinion, cope with the white man in either cunning or industry. The Principal of the school, Mr. Porter added, was always a white man. The children made good progress in the ordinary branches of an English education, but not in the higher branches of study. It was impossible to show the Indian the utility of advanced studies.\n\n\"What,\" repeated Colonel Porter several times, \"the Indian needs most is to be taught to work, and to appreciate values. When the Indians settle down and farm they accumulate property, cattle, hogs, and cereals. Our people are a farming people, but they never farmed until they were educated. When first the Indian is set to work, he takes best to raising stock, and then he gradually passes on to agriculture. The first animal he wants is a horse, then cattle, after a time he wants hogs and sheep. It is hard to get him to raise wheat. But he comes to it after a time. He likes to work with his hands. It is hard for him to understand machinery. Cotton is becoming quite an industry with us. Last year we raised $40,000 worth. The Creeks do not hunt, save for pasture.\"\n\nColonel Wm. P. Ross, (Cherokee), spoke as follows:\n\n\"I was President of the Board of Education last year. We had in operation about seventy-eight primary schools, (that is, neighborhood or day schools), where the children are taught the ordinary elements of an English education. We have two high schools taught by white teachers\u2014one male, the other female; in each there are two departments, one primary, the other academic. Last year we had an aggregate attendance at all our schools of 2,800 children, and an average of something less than 2,000. We have a Board of Education, consisting of three members, who have charge of all the schools in the country; they examine teachers and pay them, or rather they give certificates upon which they draw their pay from the treasury through the Chief. We support our schools out and out, and the majority of our teachers are Indian teachers. About $75,000 a year is expended for educational purposes. The first public schools the Cherokees had, west of the Mississippi, were established in 1842. There were schools\namongst them previously to that time, but they were partially or entirely supported by missionary institutions. But since 1842 we have had our own system of public schools, under the control and management of the Cherokee nation. We pay the Principal $700 a year and board in the institution; he is generally white. High school assistant teachers are paid $600 and board for the school year of ten months, and we pay our common school teachers, one class $50 a month, the next class $40, the next $30, or $500, $400 and $300, for ten months of a school year. As to the cost of the schools, the primary are, as a rule, put up by the neighbourhood. The boarding schools are generally solid brick buildings, and cost about $2,500. We have a regularly-organized government, and we elect our Chiefs and Judges, who used to be hereditary. Our population is about nineteen thousand, and we are increasing. We live by agriculture and stock-raising. We have $3,000,000 in trust with the Government.\"\n\nJudge Steedham said the cost of boarding a child, among the Cherokees, was $7.00 a month, or $70.00 for ten months. He added that the children were made to work two hours a day and half the day on Saturday.\n\nAll the representatives of the five civilized nations declared their belief that the chief thing to attend to in dealing with the less civilized or wholly barbarous tribes, was to separate the children from the parents. As I have said, the Indian Department, at Washington, have not much hope in regard to the adult Indians, but sanguine anticipations are cherished respecting the children. The five nations are themselves a proof that a certain degree of civilization is within the reach of the red man while illustrating his deficiencies.\n\nAt the suggestion of the Commissioner, I visited the White Earth Agency, Minnesota. I found the school well attended, and the answering of the children creditable. But the quickest and brightest were mixed-bloods.\n\nThe Principal of the school is a mixed-blood; his Assistant is an Indian. The dormitory was plainly but comfortably furnished, and the children, whom I saw at dinner, were evidently well fed. The Episcopalian clergyman is a full-blood Ottawa, and is an able preacher. On the Reserve, there is also a Roman Catholic Church, and two Roman Catholic clergymen, and everything goes harmoniously forward. Mr. Ruffee, the Agent, who is an able man, and who knows the Indian character well, made a memorandum regarding Agencies, the gist of which may be given, as bearing not remotely, on the subject of my inquiry.\n\nMr. Ruffee deemed it necessary, first of all, that an Indian Reservation should have manual labour schools, or, in other words, boarding industrial schools; mills, both saw and grist; blacksmith and carpenter's shops; that all the young men of a tribe or tribes, who desired it, should be taught some trade; that missionaries of all denominations\nshould have equal advantages; that a first-class physician should be employed; that, as soon as possible, tribal relations should be abolished; that chiefs should be recognized, if at all, only for meritorious conduct and industry; that the Indians should be dealt with in severity; that money or goods should be disbursed for an equivalent in labour; that in the first year farming implements, cattle, hogs, sheep and the like should be supplied; and finally that, Indian (that is with some Indian-blood, more or less) police should be employed. They work admirably and cannot be dispensed with\u2014is his emphatic opinion.\n\nThere were, on this Reserve, some excellent farms cultivated by pure-blood Indians. One would be struck by the progress made in ten years by a full-blood Indian pair\u2014Mo-che-ge-wence and his wife, who had come to the agency wild, and whose smoky wigwam, where they first lived, was within a stone's throw of their comfortable home. Passing through a kitchen, where stood a good cooking stove, you entered a large room\u2014at once a sitting and sleeping apartment\u2014and you noticed around the walls, little chunums in tasteful frames made by the squaw. The room was well furnished. The Indian said he had twenty acres cleared on which he had grown wheat last year. He had had no help. His stock consisted of one yoke of oxen and one yoke of steer, two milk cows, one pony. He had built the house himself. The rule is to give the Indians tools, and let them build their own dwellings, in fact to make them do as much as possible for themselves. Mo-che-ge-wence can neither read nor write. He is a member of the Episcopal Church. In the wigwam he used to inhabit some five years before, were found, amid the dirt and smoke and closeness of the lodge, a few Indians lately came to the Reservation. In ten years an immense stride had been made. The stables were good. There was the Indian pony comfortable and clean. The stable, which was of fair size, also contained roomy stalls for oxen. There was another building\u2014the store-room full of seed, wheat and flour, ground in the mill of the Reservation, from wheat of this prudent Indian's own growth. He had an ice-house. He had also a quantity of reeds and birch bark to aid him in making maple sugar in the summer. \"This man\u2014this farmer,\" said Mr. Ruffe; \"is a fair sample and not the best. He is a zealous churchman. He had distinguished visitors here last Sunday, a Sioux chief and part of the chief's following, and when the collection was being taken up he put half a dollar on the plate.\" This man, like all those on the Reservation, belongs to the Chippewa nation\u2014a large branch of which we have in Canada. White Cloud\u2014the great orator of the Reservation\u2014expressed the high esteem his nation had for the Government of the Queen, recalled the kind treatment the Indians, and more especially his nation, had always received at the hands of the British, and bade the Canadian visitor give his people in Canada this message\u2014to travel along the white man's way, and educate their children.\nThe zeal and enthusiasm and life on this Reservation is due to Mr. Ruff\u00e9e's energy and his determination to surround himself with half-breed assistants. Every employee on the Reservation is of mixed blood. A mixed-blood family named Beaulieu, two generations of which took a deep and warm interest in the Indians, must be of the greatest assistance to him.\n\nAt Winnipeg, I met most of the leading men, clerical and lay, who could speak with authority on the subject of the inquiry, and to the experience, knowledge and courtesy of Mgr. Tach\u00e9, P\u00e8re Lacombe, Hon. Jas. McKay, and many others, this report is much indebted.\n\nAmong the Indians there is some discontent, but as a rule it amounts to no more than the chronic querulousness of the Indian character, and his uneasiness about food at this time of year will unfortunately leave no trace in his improvident mind when spring opens and fish are plentiful. The exceptions are furnished by one or two chiefs whose bands are starving, that is in the Indian sense of that word, without a certain prospect of food in the future. Distress will always exist among improvident people, and undoubtedly distress and misery exist in many Bands. The attitude of the chiefs referred to, and the language held by the chief on the occasion of a visit to the St. Peter's Reservation\u2014language which showed that he was in communication with the unsettled Bands\u2014open up, in the event of the disappearance of the buffalo (a disappearance no protective legislation can long retard), a prospect which demands the serious consideration of the Department. No race of men can be suddenly turned from one set of pursuits to another set of a wholly different nature without great attendant distress. But, suddenly, to make men long accustomed to a wild unsettled life, with its freedom from restraint, its excitement and charm, take to the colourless monotony of daily toil, the reward of which is prospective, is impossible.\n\nThe half-breeds or mixed-bloods are thoughtful, if not anxious, regarding the Government's intentions respecting them. But the problem before the Department cannot be settled by the issue of scrip. That problem can be solved only by gradually educating Indians and mixed-bloods in self-reliance and industry.\n\nColonel Porter's testimony given above, that of Mr. Ross, the position of these gentlemen and the position of the other leading men of the five \"civilized\" nations are instructive. Not merely is the only effective means of educating the Indians in self-reliance and self-support pointed out; the inference is not far-fetched that the mixed-blood is the natural mediator between the Government and the red man, and also his natural instructor.\n\nThe lesson would also be taught, were that lesson necessary, that the mixed-blood or half-breed is a man of capacity, intelligence and power. But that lesson does not need to be taught in the Dominion, where we have leading\nThere is now barely time to inaugurate a system of education by means of which the native populations of the North-West shall be gradually prepared to meet the necessities of the not distant future; to welcome and facilitate, it may be hoped, the settlement of the country; and to render its government easy and not expensive.\n\nI would respectfully warn the Department against listening to alarmists who would press them to act in a manner which would develop, with tropical rapidity, in every chief, the pestilent character of the demagogue. But as far as we can judge from approximate returns, there are some twenty-eight thousand Indians in the seven territorial divisions covered by treaty. There are about twelve hundred half-breed families. Chief Beardy and Big Bear are malcontent. Beardy's Band is put down in the official returns as not more than thirty nine. His Band is, however, many times larger than this. We have warlike and excited refugees within our territory. A large statesmanlike policy, with bearings on immediate and remote issues, cannot be entered on too earnestly or too soon.\n\nThe Indian character, about which some persons fling such a mystery, is not difficult to understand. The Indian is sometimes spoken of as a child, but he is very far from being a child. The race is in its childhood. As far as the childhood analogy is applicable, what it suggests is a policy that shall look patiently for fruit, not after five or ten years, but after a generation or two. The analogy is misleading when we come to deal with the adult, and is of course a mere truism and not a figure of speech when we take charge of the Indian in the period of infancy. There is, it is true, in the adult, the helplessness of mind of the child, as well as the practical helplessness; there is, too, the child's want of perspective; but there is little of the child's receptivity; nor is the child's tractableness always found. One of the prime conditions of childhood is absent\u2014the abeyance of the passions. Anybody who has tried to educate grown-up civilized men, with untrained minds, as are the minds of most civilized men, will understand the disturbing and dwarfing influence of the complex interests which crowd in on the adult. The Indian is a man with traditions of his own, which make civilization a puzzle of despair. He has the suspicion, distrust, fault-finding tendency, the insincerity and flattery, produced in all subject races. He is crafty, but conscious how weak his craft is when opposed to the\nsuperior cunning of the white man. Not to speak of him \u2014 even some of the half-breeds of high intelligence are incapable of embracing the idea of a nation \u2014 of a national type of man \u2014 in which it should be their ambition to be merged and lost. Yet he realises that he must disappear, and realizing this, and unable to associate himself with the larger and nobler idea, the motive power which inspired a Pontiac and a Tecumseh, is absent. The Indian's solidity is in part assumed, in part the stupor produced by external novel and distasteful conditions, and in both respects has been manifested in white races at periods of helplessness and ignorance, of subjection to, and daily contact with, the power and superior skill and refinement of more advanced races, or even more advanced branches of the same race.\n\nWe need not, therefore, recall the names of Indian heroes to make us respect the latent capacities of the red man. We have only to look to the rock whence we were hewn. The Indian, I repeat, is not a child, and he is the last person that should be dealt with in a childish way. He requires firm, bold, kindly handling and boundless patience. He exacts, and surely not unreasonably, scrupulous honesty. There ought to be a special exemplary punishment provided for those persons who, when employed by the Government to supply the Indian with stores, cheat him.\n\nIt would be travelling beyond the record to comment on our Indian policy and our treaties with the Indians, though I have formed very decided opinions respecting both. But this remark is pertinent. Guaranteeing schools as one of the considerations for surrendering the title to land, was, in my opinion, trifling with a great duty and placing the Government in no dignified attitude. It should have been assumed that the Government would attend to its proper and pressing business in this important particular. Such a guarantee, moreover, betrays a want of knowledge of the Indian character. It might easily have been realized, (it is at least thinkable), that one of the results would be to make the Chiefs believe they had some right to a voice regarding the character and management of the schools, as well as regarding the initiatory step of their establishment. Chief Prince is giving some trouble on this head. There are cases where a denominational would be more suitable than a secular school, and vice versa; there are other cases where no Government school is needed, and where the true policy is to utilize the mission schools. The establishment and conduct of schools are matters which should have been left in a position to be considered apart from the disturbing, and sometimes designing prejudices of a Chief; the needs and aptitudes of the settlement are alone worthy of being weighed. The moment there exists a settlement which has any permanent character, then education in some form or other should be brought within reach of the children. This is not merely a matter of policy. It is that, of course, in the highest degree. It is a sacred duty.\n\nOne ill result of promising the Indians schools, is that the Church Missionary Society is withdrawing its aid to the\nmission schools\u2014a step which adds to conditions already sufficiently imperative, calling for a prudent, far-seeing and vigorous educational policy.\n\nThe first and greatest stone in the foundation of the quasi-civilization of the Indians, wherever seen, was laid by missionaries, men who had a supreme object and who did not count their lives dear unto them. Schools are scattered over the whole continent, wherever Indians exist, monuments of religious zeal and heroic self-sacrifice. These schools should be utilized as much as possible, both on grounds of efficiency and economy. The missionaries' experience is only surpassed by their patient heroism, and their testimony, like that of the school teachers, like that of the authorities at Washington is, that if anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young. The children must be kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions. Mgr. Tache in his work, \"Sketch of the North-West of America,\" points out that the influence of civilized women has issued in superior characteristics in one portion of the native population. This influence in and out of the school must be constantly present in the early years. \"Hitherto,\" says Mr. Meeker, a man who could speak with authority of a large portion of the Indians of the United States, \"young men have been boarded and clothed and instructed, but in time they were off to the hunting ground. The plan now is to take young children, give them the care of a mother, and have them constantly in hand.\" Such care must go pari passu with religious training.\n\nThere are, as we have seen, some twelve hundred families of half-breeds\u2014or mixed-bloods\u2014in the North-West. Some of these are men of education and settled pursuits. But the great majority of them live under conditions which turn on the vanishing axle-tree of the buffalo's existence. It is no reproach to these men and their children to say that they will require training, whether supplied from within or without, before they can happily and effectively settle down as farmers. Archbishop Tache's sketch of the virtues and vices of the mixed-bloods (Sketch of the North-West of America, pp. 98\u2014110), a sketch drawn at once by a masterly and loving hand, can leave no doubt on the mind that training will be needed. Nor, as I have said, is this a reproach. The same thing has been true of men belonging to the best white races, and in modern times. The mixed-blood has already in his development many of those virtues which would make him a useful official, where activity, intelligence, horsemanship and fidelity were required. But if the mixed-blood is to hold his own in the race for existence, which will soon be exigent, in lands where, even yet, for the greater part of the year, primeval silence reigns, it is not enough that he should know all the arts of the voyageur and trader; not enough even that he should be able to do a little farming; he must be educated, and become susceptible to the bracing influences of complex wants and varied ambitions.\nI should recommend, at once, an extensive application of the principle of industrial boarding schools in the North-West, were it not that the population, both Indian and half-breed, is so largely migratory that any great outlay at present would be money thrown away.\n\nThe recommendations I venture to submit are as follows:\n\n(1.) Wherever the missionaries have schools, those schools should be utilized by the Government, if possible; that is to say, a contract should be made with the religious body controlling the school to board and educate and train industrially a certain number of pupils. This should be done without interfering with the small assistance at present given to the day mission schools.\n\n(2.) Not more than four industrial boarding schools ought to be established at first. If the Department should determine to establish more than four, the Reservation recommended by Mr. McColl (Appendix B) would possess many advantages. Here the population is settled and to some extent civilized. The soil is rich. The Missionary Society is withdrawing its aid from the school, which will henceforth be dependent on Government aid, and voluntary contributions. The Rev. Mr. Cook assured me that here there would be no difficulty in getting a sufficient number of children from eight years old to twelve to attend the boarding industrial school.\n\n(3.) An industrial boarding school should be established somewhere in the fork of the North and South Saskatchewan, near Prince Albert, in connection with the Episcopalian Church. The land is wonderfully fertile. There are a good many Indians in the neighborhood. There are Bands of Indians near Carlton and near Dutch Lake. There is plenty of fish and timber.\n\n(4.) In no place could an industrial boarding school in connection with the Methodist body be more properly placed than near Old Bow Fort. The Blackfeet and Stonys, wild but noble types of Indians, would thus be reached. There are numbers of good places between the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca rivers; but the needs in those quarters are not so pressing, as the Methodists and Roman Catholics have here been very successful, the boarding school principle having been tried with great success by the Roman Catholics in at least one instance. The want in the Blackfeet country is pressing. A Wesleyan mission exists to the east of Old Bow Fort. Timber and fish are at hand, and a vast tract of the finest grazing soil in the world. There ought to be no difficulty here, in a few years, in rivalling the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency with its promising herd.\n\n(5.) At Qu'Appelle it might well be thought we should find an appropriate site for an industrial boarding school to be conducted by Roman Catholics. The soil, it is true, is generally poor, but where the river narrows it leaves a good\ndeal of fair land. To the north is Touchwood, a trading post of the Hudson Bay Co. Around are lakes in which much fish is found, and when the buffalo is gone the Indians will flock hither to fish. A good many half-breeds are here now. It is a central point. Roads run south and west and north. The Blackfoot country, or that covered by Treaty 7, is sure to be a great grazing country in the not distant future. The advantages of the route thence to Qu'Appelle, on and alongside of the river, are unmistakable. There is a permanent settlement. There is also a Roman Catholic mission. But there is no timber, and it is said the frosts menace the crops; but this is true of a good many other places where men, not with bad results, take the risks; and, notwithstanding these last drawbacks, I should have recommended Qu'Appelle as a site for a Roman Catholic industrial boarding school, were it not that other considerations of a weighty nature point to Buffalo Lake or some spot on the Red Deer River running by it. The advantages of Qu'Appelle should, however, be utilized in the near future, either on the contract system, or by means of a boarding school, immediately controlled by the Government, on a denominational or secular basis. On the shores of Buffalo Lake the school would have the advantage of being removed far from possible contact with whites for many years at least. Timber is sufficiently near along the river to the east and west. The land, I am assured, is good. The most pressing considerations of workableness point to those shores as the site for a Roman Catholic boarding industrial school.\n\n(6.) An industrial boarding school, in connection with the Presbyterian Church, should be established on Riding Mountain. The Presbyterians have already been very successful here. There is plenty of timber and the land is excellent. There is, it is true, no abundant supply of fish in the Little Saskatchewan. In all other respects, however, the locality is every thing that could be desired. The Indians here are represented as intelligent, and the children eager to acquire.\n\nThe importance of denominational schools at the outset for the Indians must be obvious. One of the earliest things an attempt to civilize them does, is to take away their simple Indian mythology, the central idea of which, to wit, a perfect spirit, can hardly be improved on. The Indians have their own ideas of right and wrong, of \"good\" Indians and \"bad\" Indians, and to disturb this faith, without supplying a better, would be a curious process to enlist the sanction of civilized races whose whole civilization, like all the civilizations with which we are acquainted, is based on religion. A civilized sceptic, breathing, though he does, an atmosphere charged with Christian ideas, and getting strength unconsciously therewith, is nevertheless, unless in instances of rare intellectual vigour, apt to be a man without ethical backbone. But a savage sceptic would be open to civilizing influences and moral control only through desires, which, in the midst of enlightenment, constantly\nbreak out into the worst features of barbarism. Where, however, the poor Indian has been brought face to face with polemics and settlements are divided, or think they are divided, on metaphysical niceties, the school should be, as at the White Earth Agency, Minnesota, undenominational.\n\n(7.) Some distinction should be made between the treatment of parents who send their children regularly to the day-school, and of those who are either careless whether their children go to school or not, or who are wholly opposed to their children attending school, as some are. To the first, an additional ration of tea and sugar might be given.\n\n(8.) Where practicable, some inducement of a special nature should be held out to the child.\n\n(9.) As Bands become more amenable to the restraints of civilization education should be made compulsory.\n\n(10.) The character of the teacher, morally and intellectually, is a matter of vital importance. If he is morally weak, whatever his intellectual qualifications may be, he is worse than no teacher at all. If he is poorly instructed or feeble in brain, he only exacts every day an elaborate taxe. It must be obvious that to teach semi-civilized children is a more difficult task than to teach children with inherited aptitudes, whose training is, moreover, carried on at home. A teacher should have force of character, and when he presides over an industrial school should have a knowledge of farming. Such a man must be adequately paid. The advantage of calling in the aid of religion is, that there is a chance of getting an enthusiastic person, with, therefore, a motive power beyond anything pecuniary remuneration could supply. The work requires not only the energy but the patience of an enthusiast. The teacher's appointment to an industrial boarding school should be made by the Government, after consultation with the religious body immediately interested, and the whole machinery should be carefully guarded against the suspicion of having any character of religious endowment, or any likelihood of issuing therein.\n\n(11.) In order to secure that the education given would be efficient, there ought to be competent inspection. Failing this, when industrial boarding schools come to be widely established, large sums will be thrown into the sea. The education given in Indian schools is, as a rule, of a very poor sort, mechanical to the last degree.\n\n(12.) Where boys or girls, whether Indians or half-breed, show special aptitudes or exceptional general quickness, special advantages should be offered them, and they should be trained to become teachers and clerks in connection with the Department, as well as fitted to launch out on commercial and professional careers.\n\n(13.) The salary of a teacher must be such as will induce good men to offer themselves. The teacher should be paid according to his qualifications. In the future, when the manual labour boarding school is an established insti-\ntution, those teachers who manage their schools in a manner tending towards self-support, should have a percentage on the reduction in the cost of management.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nNICHOLAS FLOOD DAVIN.\n\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA,\n25th February, 1879.\n\nSir.\u2014In accordance with instructions received from the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, dated the 6th instant, as to the advisability of establishing an industrial school in some central place, within the Manitoba Superintendency, where the Indian youth of both sexes could be taught the various industries, as suggested in my Report of Inspection of the 24th ultimo, and to indicate to you what point would, in my opinion, be the most suitable within the Superintendency at which to establish such institution; the staff of instructors it would require to employ; the cost of the building and offices connected therewith, as well as the management of the institution, I have the honour to offer the following suggestions, together with my reasons for the same, as requested by yourself.\n\n1st. In my opinion, the St. Peter's Indian Reserve would be the most suitable location for such an institution, being the most central point between Prince Arthur's Landing on Lake Superior, and Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan River, the extreme eastern and western limits of the Manitoba Superintendency, being also about 30 miles north from this city, on Red River, near the Canadian Pacific Railway crossing at Selkirk, accessible by railway and water communication from the east and west, by water communication from the north, and from the west, progressively, by railway.\n\n2nd. It is a large Reserve, having an area of about 39,000 acres of most excellent prairies and wood-land, the soil being of the richest alluvial deposit with an abundance of the choicest hay land and sufficient quantity of poplar, oak, spruce and tamarack for present and prospective requirements of such an institution, without demending the Reserve of fuel, fencing and building timber for the wants of the Band, which would be a great source of economy to the Government in its maintenance. It is also well-watered by the Red River, which runs north through its centre, and drained by Devil's, Cook's, Maclellan's, and Netley Creeks, flowing from the east and west into said river.\n\n3rd. It has a population of 1,646 of Ojibbeway and Cree Indians more advanced in civilization than anywhere else in the Manitoba Superintendency; there being 200 families cultivating an average of about 5 acres each of ordinary\nMemo. to Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to state that he has had under consideration the subject of Indian schools in the Province of Manitoba, District of Keewatin and the North West Territories.\n\nThe several Treaties provide that schools for the benefit of Indian children shall be established on the different reserves within the limits of said Treaties.\n\nIt appears that in Manitoba and Keewatin there are 19 schools at present in operation and a like number in the North West Territories.\n\nContributions from the Parliamentary appropriation are made to each of these schools at a rate not exceeding in any instance three hundred dollars per annum; and should the daily average attendance fall short in any quarter of twenty-five, being the number entitling the teacher at the rate of three dollars per pupil to the full payment of seventy five dollars, then salary is paid to him at a per capita allowance of three dollars per quarter for each pupil shown to have been in attendance during the quarter.\n\nWith regard to such of the schools above referred to as are conducted under auspices of religious denominations, the grant of three hundred dollars per annum, coupled with the salary which the teacher receives from the denomination under which he serves, makes his remuneration probably sufficient.\n\nBut as respects schools established by the Department which receive no subsidy from any other source than Indian funds, the\nundersigned is of opinion that the maximum amount of salary paid each teacher from the appropriation should be increased to five hundred and four dollars per annum which, at the rate of twelve dollars per annum for each pupil, will pay for the tuition of forty-two pupils, and should the attendance fall short of that number in any quarter, then the teacher should be paid at the rate of three dollars for each pupil shown to have been present during the quarter.\n\nThis addition to the maximum allowance to teachers of Indian schools in the North West Territories, Manitoba and Keewatin when they are wholly supported by the Department is necessary as competent teachers cannot be procured for less.\n\nThe following Indian schools among those now in operation in the North West Territories and Keewatin have not as yet been allotted grants by Order of Council, viz.:-those on the reserves of Chiefs John Smith, Mistawasis and Attakakooops, as well as on the reserves at Victoria and Pigeon Lake which are all on the Saskatchewan; also the school on the reserve on Berens River on the east side of Lake Winnipeg and on that of the Stony Indians near Morleyville within the Territory covered by Treaty 7. The undersigned respectfully recommends that grants on the basis already described be made to these schools.\n\nAs an incentive to teachers to conduct their schools efficiently the undersigned submits that in addition to the regular salaries, it would be advisable to sanction payment of annual bonuses to the teachers of the five best conducted schools in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories in the following proportions:- $100 to the best; $80.00 to the second; $60.00 to the third; $40.00 to the fourth and $20.00 to the fifth; the same to be awarded on recommendation of the Indian Commissioner for the North West Territories and Manitoba.\nAnd in order to stimulate the pupils to increased exertions, it appears advisable to give prizes at the different schools on the result of examinations being learned.\n\nThese prizes might be of an inexpensive description and yet sufficiently attractive to provoke the efforts of the Indian children to obtain them.\n\nThe undersigned also recommends that all teachers of Indian schools in the North West Territories and elsewhere whether appointed by religious denominations or by the Department, be required to hold certificates of competency and character and to file the same in the Department.\n\nHe begs to state that quarterly school returns are required from each institution in the Dominion toward which aid is contributed by the Department before the teachers salary is paid, showing the number of pupils on the roll, the daily weekly and quarterly attendance at the school and the branches of study pursued by each pupil.\n\nAs regards the erection of school buildings on reserves in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories, the plan at present pursued by the Department appears to work satisfactorily, viz.:-to require the Indians on any reserve on which a school is to be established to get out and flatten the logs and erect the walls of the building therewith.\n\nThe Department upon learning that the building is in course of construction, contributes a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars towards completing the building and providing furniture for the same.\n\nThe undersigned is of the opinion that school lands in the North West should eventually be charged with the expense of Indian schools.\n\nWith regard to the inspection of Indian schools generally, the undersigned respectfully submits that negotiations should be opened up with the local Governments of each Province having for their object the securing to the Indian\nschools in such Province, the same system of inspection at the hands of the local Government officers as the public schools of the Province undergo; and in this connection the undersigned recommends that he be authorized to make the most economical arrangement possible in regard to the compensation to be made to the local officials for their services in that behalf.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJohn A. Macdonald,\n\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs.\nCOPY:\n\nCOPY of a Report of the Honourable the PRIVY COUNCIL approved by His Excellency the GOVERNOR GENERAL in Council on the 29th October 1880.\n\nOn a memorandum hereto annexed, dated 19th October, 1880 from the Hon. the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, on the subject of Indian schools in the Province of Manitoba, the District of Keewatin and the North West Territories,\n\nThe Minister recommends increased allowances to Teachers; grants to certain schools and submits suggestions with a view to imparting greater efficiency to Indian Schools.\n\nThe Committee advise that the recommendations submitted be approved and carried into effect.\n\nCertified,\n\nJ.O. Cote\nClerk P.C.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nCopy of a Report of a committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 19th July, 1883.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a Report, dated 13th July, 1883, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in which it is represented that the time has now arrived for the establishment of three Industrial Schools in the North West, and for expending the appropriation made at the last Session of Parliament for that purpose.\n\nThe Minister submits in connection therewith a Report, dated 16th April, 1883, from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for Manitoba and the North West Territories, and he, the Minister, recommends that its provisions be carried out in the following manner:\n\n1st. That the building at Battleford, formerly occupied by the Lieutenant Governor, be at once utilized for the purposes of a Protestant Institution to be established there with all convenient speed, and that the Reverend T. Clarke be appointed Principal of the school at a salary of $1200 per annum.\n\n2nd. That the staff consists of an assistant to the Principal, a matron, a farmer and a cook at the salaries recommended by the Commissioner in his Report, the Assistant to be a layman carefully selected for his qualifications.\n\n3rd. That in addition to this staff, when a sufficient number of pupils are collected, means be adopted for teaching some of them trades or occupations other than that of agriculture. The two most serviceable trades in the North West seem to be those of carpenter and blacksmith.\n\n4th. That the Commissioner determine whether the pupils\npupils be taken from one tribe or indifferently from all\nthe bands in a given area.\n\n5th. That the Commissioner be charged with the duty of\nseeing that the buildings are fitted for the purposes of the\ninstitution. It is assumed that the present building will be\nsufficient, with slight alterations, for some considerable\nperiod; it can be added to from time to time as necessity\narises for increase.\n\nThe Minister further recommends that in accordance with\nthe advice of the Commissioner, a Roman Catholic Industrial\nSchool be established at or near Qu'Appelle, at a fitting\nplace, with the staff as that at Battleford, and he, the Min-\nister, advises that the selection of the Principal be left\nto the Archbishop of St. Boniface, and that the attention of\nHis Grace be specially called to the necessity of selecting\na clergyman or other person possessed not merely of erudi-\ntion but of administrative ability; and that the Commissioner\nbe directed to see to the erection of the necessary build-\nings, the cost not to exceed $6,000, and if convenient he can\nobtain the aid of the Officer of the Department of Public\nWorks for the erection of the building in Manitoba.\n\nThe Minister also recommends that a Roman Catholic\nIndustrial School be established at some point\nin Treaty number Seven, the institution to be erected and es-\ntablished in the same manner as that at Qu'Appelle, and he,\nthe Minister, also advises that the selection of the Princi-\npal be left to the Bishop of St. Albert, and the Commissioner\nbe directed to report as early as possible after consulting\nwith the Bishop as to the best locality for the establishment\nof this school.\n\nThe Minister further advises that the Commissioner's\nattention be specially called to the confidential report of\nMr. Nicholas Flood Davin on the subject of Industrial Schools, dated 14th March, 1879.\n\nThe Committee concur in the Report of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and the several recommendations therein made, and they submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nsd.

The teachers are required to have a speaking acquaintance with the Indian Language, and are, consequently, likely in most cases to be Indians; but the instruction should, as soon as practicable and as far as possible, be given in English.\n\n2. Teachers shall be selected by recommendation from County or District Board of Examiners, who shall be granted discretionary powers as to the attainments required; it will be found, however, for some time to come that the standard of \"High School Entrance\" will be quite as high as is attainable.\n\n3. The subjects of study in these schools need not at present embrace more than the following, viz.: Reading, Writing, Object Lessons, Elementary Drawing (from cards), Elementary Arithmetic (the four simple rules), Elementary Geography, (the maps of the World and Dominion of Canada), Spelling and Grammar (formation and analysis of simple sentences).\n\n4. The Indian Department will furnish all text-books and apparatus for use in the schools.\n\n5. The schools will be placed under the inspectorial supervision of the County Inspectors in conjunction with the Indian Agent, who shall together also have a controlling influence in the selection of teachers, except in the case of such schools as are established by any religious denomination under the Regulations of the Department of Indian Affairs and in such schools the religious teacher shall be permitted to serve as headmaster; but each of the Inspectors shall state, in his reports of inspection, his opinion upon the competency of the teacher of each denominational Indian School inspected by him.\n\nA fee of six dollars ($6) per visit shall be paid the Inspector and legitimate travelling expenses allowed, for two visits per annum.\n\nGEO.

But as respects schools established by the Department which receive no subsidy from any other source than Indian funds, the undersigned is of opinion that the maximum amount of salary paid each teacher from the appropriation should be increased to five hundred and four dollars per annum which at the rate of twelve dollars per annum for each pupil will pay for the tuition of forty-two pupils and should\nshould the attendance fall short of the number in any quarter then the teacher should be paid at the rate of three dollars for each pupil shown to have been present during the quarter.\n\nThis addition to the maximum allowance to teachers of Indian schools in the North West Territories, Manitoba and Keewatin when they are wholly supported by the Department is necessary as competent teachers cannot be procured for less.\n\nThe following Indian schools among those now in operation in the North West Territories and Keewatin have not as yet been allotted grants by Order in Council, viz., those on the reserves of Chiefs John Smith, Mistawasis and Attackakops as well as on the reserves at Victoria and Pigeon Lake which are all on the Saskatchewan, also the school on the reserve on Berens River on the east side of Lake Winnipeg and on that of the Stony Indians near Morleyville within the territory covered by Treaty No.7.- The undersigned respectfully recommends that grants on the basis already described be made to these schools.\n\nAs an incentive to teachers to conduct their schools efficiently the undersigned submits that in addition to the regular salaries it would be advisable to sanction payment of annual bonuses to the teachers of the five best conducted schools in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories in the following proportions: $100 to the best, $80 to the second best, $60 to the third, $40 to the fourth and $20 to the fifth. The same to be awarded on recommendation of the Indian Commissioner for the North West Territories and Manitoba.\n\nAnd in order to stimulate the pupils to increased exertions it appears advisable to give prizes at the different schools on the result of examinations being learned.\n\nThese prizes might be of an inexpensive description and yet sufficiently attractive to provoke the efforts of the Indian children to obtain them.\n\nThe undersigned also recommends that all teachers of Indian schools\nschool in the North West Territories and elsewhere, whether appointed by religious denominations or by the Department be required to hold certificates of competency and character and to file the same in the Department.\n\nHe begs to state that quarterly school returns from each institution in the Dominion toward which aid is contributed before the teachers salary is paid showing the number of pupils on the roll, the daily, weekly and quarterly attendance at the school, and the branches of study pursued by each pupil.\n\nAs regards the erection of school buildings on reserves in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories, the plan at present pursued by the Department appears to work satisfactorily, viz., to require the Indians on any reserve on which a school is to be established to get out and flatten the logs and erect the walls of the building therewith.\n\nThe Department upon learning that the building is in course of construction, contributes a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars towards completing the building and providing furniture for the same.\n\nThe undersigned is of the opinion that school lands in the North West should eventually be charged with the expense of Indian schools.\n\nWith regard to the inspection of Indian schools generally the undersigned respectfully submits that negotiations should be opened up with the Local Government of each Province, having for their object the securing to the Indian Schools in such Province the same system of inspection at the hands of the Local Government Officers as the public schools of the Province undergo; and in this connection the undersigned recommends that he be authorized to make the most economical arrangements possible in regard to the compensation to be made to the local officials for their services in that behalf.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nsd.

John J. Mcgee,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nCertified Copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 16th of September, 1892.\n\nOn a report dated the 13th September, 1892, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stating that the Order in Council of the 7th April, 1874, on the subject of the establishment of Indian Schools in the Province of British Columbia amongst other things provides for an annual grant of $300 to each of seven Indian day schools then or thereafter to be established in parts of the Province of British Columbia in accordance with the wishes of the Indians and the approval of the Indian Superintendent upon the understanding that the grant should be paid to a school only so long as the average attendance of pupils did not fall below thirty. The average rate thus paid to a teacher was $10.00 per annum per pupil and in each case where the average attendance fell below thirty in any quarter the sum of $2.50 has been since deducted from the quarterly salary paid to the teacher.\n\nThe Minister observes that under this method of computing the salaries the sum paid annually for a school teacher's services may become so small as to render it practically impossible to obtain persons competent to fill the position.\n\nA practice similar to the above prevailed in the North West Territories up to October of last year; but it was found to work so injuriously to the interest of the schools that it was decided to pay in each case to the teachers the whole salary of $300.00 per annum irrespective of the average attendance, and, in the event of the average exceeding twenty-five, that the teacher should receive the further sum of $12.00 per pupil per annum for a number not exceeding forty-two; and this arrangement has continued to work satisfactorily both to the teachers and to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe\nThe Minister, in view of the fact that the average attendance in many of the day schools in British Columbia is comparatively small, very seldom indeed reaching thirty, and in view of the difficulty experienced by the Department of Indian Affairs in securing the services of competent teachers for the very small salary paid to them, recommends that in future the salary guaranteed to each teacher of an Indian day school in British Columbia shall be $300.00 and that in each case when the average attendance is greater than twenty-five the teacher shall, as is the custom in the North West Territories, receive an additional sum of $12.00 per annum for each pupil in excess of twenty-five and up to forty-five, under which exceptionally favorable circumstances, the salary of the teacher would reach the sum of $504.00 per annum.\n\nThe Committee submit the above recommendation for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nsd. John J. McGee,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nCertified Copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable\nthe Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the\nGovernor General in Council on the 22nd October, 1892.\n\nOn a Report dated 17th of October, 1892, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stating that it is advisable to make a change in the manner of carrying on those Industrial Schools in the North West that are wholly supported by the Government. The cost of these institutions is larger, it is thought, than that for which they might be conducted, and with a view to more economical management it is advisable and necessary to adopt some method which would relieve the pressure of the present expenditure and at the same time keep up the schools to an equal standard of efficiency and usefulness.\n\nThe Minister considers that when the whole cost of an institution is directly borne by the Government the same economy by those in immediate charge is not used as would be employed under other conditions, demands, under the present system, are frequently made for articles and supplies whereas if the amount to be expended were to take the form more of an annual per capita grant more effort in the way of economizing would be made.\n\nThe Minister states that the actual cost to the Government, as shown under the head of Industrial Schools, does not represent the total expenditure which the present system entails, as there is a small expense in the purchasing and inspection of supplies to be added.\n\nThe accounts for the past year (1890-91) show that the per capita cost of each child at the Industrial Schools under consideration was:\n\n- Qu'Appelle: $134.67\n- Battleford: 175.45\n- High River: 185.55\n\nThe rate per capita, it is thought, is higher than it would be\nif a forced system of economy were exercised, and that the best way to effect the desired decrease would be to place the schools under a per capita grant system similar to that now in operation at Elkhorn and St. Paul's under Church of England authorities, St. Boniface and Kootenay under Roman Catholic Church authorities. The per capita system under which these schools are operated by the religious bodies has been found to work satisfactorily.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to the Industrial Schools in operation in the North West Territories, and to such other similar institutions as may hereafter be established, as soon as, in the opinion of the Indian Department said institutions are in proper running order, at rates to be fixed upon as being fair and just, viz,\u2014\n\nThe buildings are to be kept in repair jointly by the Government and the management, the former to furnish the material and the latter to perform the labor.\n\nAll books and appliances, that is, maps, globes, &c., for educational purposes, to be furnished by the Government.\n\nAll charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses to be paid by the management, out of the per capita grant.\n\nThe management not in any event to charge children or their parents for being allowed to attend such institutions.\n\nThe Government to pay the management an annual grant for each pupil up to the number authorized by the Indian Department as represented by the Commissioner at the following rates,\u2014\n\nQu'Appelle $115.00\nRegina 120.00\nBattleford 140.00\nHigh River 130.00\n\nFor this consideration the management shall agree to conform to the rules of the Indian Department, as laid down from time to time, and to keep the schools at a certain standard of instruction,\ndietary and domestic comfort, and that the Inspectors and Officers of the Indian Department may at any time inspect and report upon the Institutions.\n\nPayment to be made only for children authorized by the Commissioner to be admitted, and in accordance with the scale now governing payments to schools under the per capita system, which may be altered from time to time to suit circumstances, and no children, white or Indian, are to be admitted save under authority of the Commissioner.\n\nThe Minister deems it desirable to put this system into operation after a reasonable time is given to the Church authorities, and he recommends that the first of July, 1893, be fixed as the date upon which the per capita allowances shall commence to be payable.\n\nThe Committee submit the above for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nsd. John J. McGee,\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nExtract from a Report of the Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency on the 27 Mar, 1895.\n\nOn a Report dated the 15th March, 1895, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that on the 30th June, 1894, the regulations authorized by your Excellency in Council on the 22nd of October, 1892, for the more economical administration of certain Industrial Schools in the North West Territories had been in operation for one year.\n\nThe Minister observes that the reason which led to the adoption of these regulations was that the cost of the institutions had been larger than was thought to be necessary, and it was deemed advisable to bring the schools under the operation of the same system as those which were conducted with a fixed yearly grant for each pupil. This step, it was believed, would tend to greater economy in management and would eventually lead to a saving in actual outlay. The annual allowance for each pupil was fixed after consideration of past expenditure, and although in each instance this amount was held to be too small by the denominational authorities interested in the management of the schools, it was thought better to begin the new system with a rate which would fairly represent the probable outlay when viewed from an economical standpoint, than to fix a rate which might not promote the careful and business-like management which it was desired to inaugurate. But at the same time it was clearly understood that the rates decided upon were not absolutely fixed, but that they were merely tentative and were subject to revision from time to time if experience proved that they did not fairly represent the actual cost of maintaining a pupil for one year.\n\nThe Minister states that at the close of the first year under this new system it is found that there have been deficits at the three schools where the plan had been adopted, viz.,\n\nQu'Appelle Industrial School $1431.09\nSt. Joseph's \" 1616.58\nRegina \" 880.44\nAnd at these schools although efforts were made by the management to curtail expenses, it was found impossible to so retrench as to render the fixed rates sufficient for all necessary purposes. The system was quite and it was impossible to make changes which would immediately and effectually prevent expenditure which might be regarded as unnecessary until a short period of experiment had proved where such retrenchment could take place without impairing the usefulness of the schools. Such a period has elapsed, and the Department of Indian Affairs have taken steps, by a reduction of salaries and other means to endeavor to prevent a recurrence of these deficits without at present increasing the per capita grant.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that authority be granted for the payment of the amount of the deficits hereinbefore mentioned.\n\nThe Minister states further that the books of the several institutions have been carefully audited by the Inspector of the Department of Indian Affairs and the amount necessary to meet the payment is available from the vote for Industrial Schools for the current year.\n\nThe Committee advise that the requisite authority be granted accordingly.\n\nsd. John J. McGee,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMemo. to Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to state that he has had under consideration the subject of Indian schools in the Province of Manitoba, District of Keewatin and the North West Territories.\n\nThe several Treaties provide that schools for the benefit of Indian children should be established on the different reserves within the limits of said Treaties.\n\nIt appears that in Manitoba and Keewatin there are 19 schools at present in operation and a like number in the North West Territories.\n\nContributions from the Parliamentary appropriation are made to each of these schools, at a rate not exceeding, in any instance, three hundred dollars per annum; and should the daily average attendance fall short in any quarter of twenty-five, being the number entitling the teacher at the rate of three dollars per pupil to the full payment of seventy-five dollars, then salary is paid to him at a per capita allowance of three dollars per quarter for each pupil shown to have been in attendance during the quarter.\n\nWith regard to such of the schools above referred to as are conducted under auspices of religious denominations, the grant of three hundred dollars per annum, coupled with the salary which the teacher receives from the denomination under which he serves, makes his remuneration probably sufficient.\n\nBut as respects schools established by the Department which receive no subsidy from any other source than Indian funds, the\nundersigned is of opinion that the maximum amount of salary paid each teacher from the appropriation should be increased to five hundred and four dollars per annum, which at the rate of twelve dollars per annum for each pupil will pay for the tuition of forty-two pupils, and should the attendance fall short of that number in any quarter, then the teacher should be paid at the rate of three dollars for each pupil shown to have been present during the quarter.\n\nThis addition to the maximum allowance to teachers of Indian schools in the North West Territories, Manitoba and Keewatin when they are wholly supported by the Department is necessary, as competent teachers cannot be procured for less.\n\nThe following Indian schools among those now in operation in the North West Territories and Keewatin have not as yet been allotted grants by Order of Council, viz:-those on the reserves of Chiefs John Smith, Mistawasis and Attakakoose as well as on the reserves at Victoria and Pigeon Lake, which are all on the Saskatchewan, also the school on the reserve on Berens River on the east side of Lake Winnipeg and on that of the Stony Indians near Morleyville within the Territory covered by Treaty 7. The undersigned respectfully recommends that grants on the basis already described be made to these schools.\n\nAs an incentive to teachers to conduct their schools efficiently the undersigned submits that in addition to the regular salaries, it would be advisable to sanction payment of annual bonuses to the teachers of the five best conducted schools in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories, in the following proportions,-$100.00 to the best, $80.00 to the second, $60.00 to the third, $40.00 to the fourth and $20.00 to the fifth, the same to be awarded on the recommendation of the Indian Commissioner for the North West Territories and Manitoba.\n\nAnd in order to stimulate the pupils to increased exertions it appears advisable to give prizes at the different\nschools on the result of examinations being learned.\n\nThese prizes might be of an inexpensive description and yet sufficiently attractive to provoke the efforts of the Indian children to obtain them.\n\nThe undersigned also recommends that all teachers of Indian schools in the North West Territories and elsewhere whether appointed by religious denominations or by the Department, be required to hold certificates of competency and character and to file the same in the Department.\n\nHe begs to state that quarter school returns are required from each institution in the Dominion toward which aid is contributed by the Department before the teacher's salary is paid, showing the number of pupils on the roll, the daily, weekly and quarterly attendance at the school and the branches of study pursued by each pupil.\n\nAs regards the erection of school buildings on reserves in Manitoba, Keewatin and the North West Territories, the plan at present pursued by the Department appears to work satisfactorily, viz.: to require the Indians on any reserve on which a school is to be established, to get out and flatten the logs and erect the walls of the building therewith.\n\nThe Department upon learning that the building is in course of construction contributes a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars towards completing the building and providing furniture for the same.\n\nThe undersigned is of the opinion that school lands in the North West should eventually be charged with the expense of Indian schools.\n\nWith regard to the inspection of Indian schools generally, the undersigned respectfully submits that negotiations should be opened up with the local Governments of each Province, having for their object the securing to the Indian\nSchools in such Province, the same system of inspection at the hands of the local Government officers as the public schools of the Province undergo; and in this connection the undersigned recommends that he be authorized to make the most economical arrangements possible in regard to the compensation to be made to the local officials for their services in that behalf.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJohn A.

MACDONALD, P.C., G.C.B.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt is with a considerable degree of diffidence, that the undersigned approaches the complicated question of the improved methods which it is desirable should be inaugurated with a view to the more general and more effectual education of the Indian children of the Dominion. It is a subject surrounded with many difficulties. The success that has attended the efforts made in the past to accomplish satisfactory results has not been such as to impress one with the idea that the present system is sufficient or by any means perfect, and yet there is difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to the exact changes which should be made in order to improve on the same, and even where changes are most manifestly deserving of adoption they involve an expense to meet which the Department at the present time has not the means at its disposal.\n\nWhile it is true, as above indicated, that no very apparent successful results have attended the efforts put forth for the education of the Indian youth of the Dominion, it is nevertheless undeniable that the system at present in vogue is a great improvement on that which formerly prevailed; for, within the last decade many improved methods have been introduced, and, although successful results are not yet as manifest as might be desirable, this may in part be owing to the fact that sufficient time has not elapsed since the inauguration of these improved methods to judge of their value by the results. There are, however, still many defects which require to be remedied, and wants which should be supplied.\n\nThe improved methods which have been introduced within the last ten years consist of:\u2014\n\n1. The employment of properly certificated teachers, in so far at least as teachers in charge of schools which are wholly under the management of the Government, as well as teachers conducting Protestant schools are concerned, when the services of such can possibly be procured.\n\n2. The better and more thorough equipment of the schools with the latest series of educational works.\n\n3. The inspection by the Public School officials of the Indian schools in the various Provinces.\n\n4. The requirement of very full returns from the schools at the end of each quarter, describing the number of pupils in attendance and the\nnumber of days each pupil attended, the different branches of study pursued, and in the case of industrial institutions, the trade or industry in which each pupil is receiving instruction.\n\nThe number of schools has also greatly increased during this time. In the year 1876 the number of schools of every type in operation was seventy-five; while the number at present in operation is one hundred and ninety-five. The various educational institutions in operation among the Indians may be classified as follows:\n\n1. Industrial boarding schools wholly supported by the Government.\n2. Industrial boarding schools conducted by religious denominations or benevolent societies and receiving Government subsidy.\n3. Industrial boarding schools conducted by religious societies but not subsidized by the Government.\n4. Day schools wholly supported by the Government.\n5. Day schools conducted under the auspices of benevolent societies or religious denominations and receiving subsidy from Government or from the funds of the Band.\n6. Day schools conducted under the auspices and wholly at the expense of benevolent societies or religious denominations.\n\nThe principals and teachers of institutions and schools which are wholly supported by Government or by the Indians, as a matter of course, receive their appointments from the Government.\n\nAs respects other day schools, the teachers are appointed by the society or denomination under whose auspices the schools are conducted; but they are required to furnish the Department with certificates of competency and character before their appointments are confirmed.\n\nIn considering the question of what remains yet to be done to perfect the system, there are, it appears to the undersigned, three points which require special consideration, viz., the character of the tuition at present afforded Indian children and how it can be improved; the matter of the attendance of the pupils; and the best method to adopt in order to secure to the pupils in after life the greatest possible benefit as the result of the education afforded them.\n\nAs respects the first point, it has been felt and it is generally acknowledged to be the fact, that owing to the very small salaries offered teachers of Indian day schools, it is impossible to secure the services of competent and desirable persons for those positions. The highest salary paid to teachers of such institutions is $350 per annum; and the average salary $240 per annum. This, it must be admitted, is altogether inadequate compensation for even a partially educated or ordinarily competent teacher. But this is not by any means the only disadvantage under which teachers of Indian day schools labor. As a rule, there is no residence for the teacher attached to the school. The teachers have consequently either to reside in the schoolhouses and provide for themselves, which is, obviously, very objectionable for several reasons, to go long distances to their lodgings, or\nto put up with very uncomfortable lodging and indifferent board at Indian houses.\n\nThe undersigned begs to offer the opinion that not less than double the amount of the average salary now paid the teachers of Indian day schools should be provided by Parliament, and that the Government should charge itself with the responsibility of supplying proper accommodation for the teacher (and, if married, for his family) in the vicinity of the school. It is desirable, in the case of day schools, that the schoolhouse and the teacher's residence should not be in one building; but that the latter should be within easy distance of the former.\n\nWere these modifications adopted, the Department would have no trouble in securing the services of competent and desirable persons as teachers of Indian schools. At present it has very often to put up with teachers who, while they may hold certificates of competency, are, for other reasons not desirable appointees; as to take an Indian school, except in the case of persons actuated by a missionary spirit, must be under the disadvantageous circumstances at present connected with the position the dernier resort of a teacher, and anyone doing so has generally the suspicion attached to him that he or she had not been a success as a teacher of a public school or it would not have been abandoned, considering the superior advantages enjoyed in connection therewith as regards emolument, the advantages of society for themselves and families, house accommodation and the ordinary luxuries of life.\n\nTeachers of Indian schools and their families, if they have any, labor under the very serious disadvantage of being debarred of all these privileges, not the least among which is the society of white people, being obliged to associate wholly with Indians, as the reserves are generally situated at considerable distance from white settlements.\n\nTeachers, therefore, should be made as comfortable in their surroundings as the Department can reasonably make them under these very untoward circumstances.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be well to not give the maximum of salary, viz., $480, at once to a teacher, but to have a scale of salaries, commencing with $350, to be increased as attendance at the school increases, allowing so much per head for the number in attendance over a certain percentage of the possible attendance; also to make the teacher an allowance for each pupil who passes the qualifying examination in his or her class for admittance to an Industrial Institution.\n\nWith regard to the second point, viz., the ensuring of better attendance at the day schools, it is well known that, as a rule, Indian children are extremely irregular in their attendance.\n\nThis arises from several causes, chief among which may be stated the indifference of the parents in the matter of the education of their children and the absence of the exercise by the parents of proper authority over them to compel attendance. But there are other causes which occasion failure in this respect, such as the want of sufficient clothing during the inclement\nseasons of the year, also the distances from the school at which some of the Indian families reside, rendering it very often impossible for many of the children in the winter season or on wet autumn or spring days to attend. Then there is the difficulty connected with the children being fed while attending school, e.g., a child residing a considerable distance\u2014say 3 or 4 miles\u2014from the school, leaves its home, say, at 8 a.m., to attend school, and, with the well-known improvidence of Indians, no luncheon or dinner has been prepared by its parents for the child to take with it. As a consequence the child remains fasting, if it stays the day through, and after repeating this process a few times it becomes discouraged and ceases to attend. Again if the child should return to its home at dinner time, in the generality of cases there is no dinner ready, or if in exceptional instances such should be the case, the child after eating its meal can scarcely be back at school in time for the afternoon session. Moreover, even in the case of children who have not these drawbacks of long distances and the want of proper clothing or food to hinder constant attendance, it is most difficult to induce them to attend regularly. The Department has hitherto found itself unable to offer inducements for such regular attendance by presenting prizes as rewards for the same owing to the inadequate means at its command, which are insufficient even for the remunerative payment of teachers and the proper equipment of the schools, repairs to school buildings, &c., &c. It would, however, cost but very little more to provide prizes for presentation to pupils who by punctual attendance and application to their studies should merit the same. In addition to these inducements, the further one of a meal at mid-day should be offered the pupils; for under even the most favorable circumstances in Indian families, it is not always possible for the children to obtain sufficient food. The meal at the school might consist of a plate of oatmeal porridge with syrup and a couple of biscuits. Such food would be economical, nourishing and the material could be easily provided and prepared and served without much trouble.\n\nAs regards clothing, the undersigned would favor the adoption of a regular uniform for the children attending day schools, to be provided in the first instance by the Department but to be charged with the consent of the Indian parents, in the case of bands having invested funds at their credit or drawing annuity, to the share of interest or annuity payable to the child until the amount advanced is repaid to the Department. There is no doubt that arrangements could be made with a clothing house to provide a cheap, warm uniform for winter and a suitable one for summer use at very reasonable rates.\n\nAs before stated, the distance at which Indian families live from the school being often a serious hindrance to the regular attendance of the children, to remedy this the undersigned is of opinion that no school should be further distant than two miles from the home of each child; and in the case of large Reserves where there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify it, as many schools as would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the band should be established, estimating the attendance\nat each school at not more than 40 pupils; and the school to be within two miles of the home of each pupil.\n\nThere are many reserves, notably in British Columbia, so sparsely populated that the number of children, of an age to attend school on each Reserve, would not justify the expense necessary to establish a school. The undersigned submits that central boarding schools, of the primary class, should be established to meet the educational requirements of bands so situated.\n\nThe undersigned is also of the opinion that among the duties of the teachers that of looking after absentees from school should be included, and that they should be required to make a return to the Department, at the end of each month, of all absent pupils, and the cause of absence in each case, and the return should state what steps the teacher took, by visiting and advising the parents, to ensure attendance on the part of the absentees. It may be alleged as an objection that the Teachers would not have sufficient time between the closing of the school and night to accomplish this duty. To meet this objection the undersigned would recommend that instead of Indian schools closing as they generally do at the hour of 4 they should be allowed to close at 3 p.m., in order to give the teachers sufficient time to make the necessary enquiries relating to absentees.\n\nA system of regular and efficient inspection, by competent persons specially qualified, should be instituted. In the older Provinces such a system exists. The Provincial School Inspectors do this work for the Department. But in the newer Provinces and Territories there is no such inspection, the Indian Agents only visiting the schools occasionally. A Board of Trustees for each Reserve, to consist in part of the most intelligent Indians, and of the missionary and Indian Agent, should be formed. The returns from the schools should be made at least monthly, instead of as at present, quarterly. Examinations should be held by the teachers at the end of each quarter, and a faithful record of the same kept. Certificates as to progress and conduct should be regularly given pupils.\n\nWith reference to the third point, namely, the perfecting of the education of Indian children, and ensuring lasting beneficial results from the education given them, the undersigned submits that the education of Indian children should be commenced with essentially primary methods, such as the kindergarten and object lesson systems, and as the mind of the child develops it should be advanced in its studies until finally, in the case of pupils who have distinguished themselves by their intelligence and progress in the day schools, they should be drafted into schools of a higher order, such as industrial boarding schools, where they could be trained in the knowledge of some industrial pursuit, as well as receive instruction in higher educational subjects, and after they have completed a course at such an institution the Department, through its agents, should charge itself with the responsibility of obtaining for each pupil who has acquired a trade, employment at the same, outside of the Reserve of the band, and the annuity share of the youth thus placed, provided the band of which he is a member receives annuity money, should be charged with the cost\nof furnishing him with the necessary tools wherewith to follow the same successfully, the first cost being borne by the Government, or by the capital fund of the Band, if it has funds at its credit and recouped by deductions from the annuity of the Indian mechanic, until all shall have been repaid. A somewhat similar system might be followed in the case of Indian boys who may acquire, at an industrial school, a knowledge of agriculture, to provide them with the necessary implements, cattle, &c., to work land successfully. And as respects Indian females educated at these institutions, when they become adepts at tailoring or housewifery, employment might be obtained for them also, in clothing establishments, in tailor shops, as dressmakers or as domestic servants, as their qualifications may best adapt them for.\n\nShould the views above enunciated be approved of and should it be decided to give practical effect to them, it would necessitate an increase in the number of day schools as well as of industrial institutions or of the accommodation in the latter establishments; and each of the industrial institutions should be supplied with pupils selected from the schools on a certain number of Reserves grouped for the purpose; and children from these Reserves should not be allowed to attend any other industrial school than the one assigned their Reserves. Thus each industrial institution would form a central school of a superior class for the advanced pupils attending the day schools on the Reserves included in the group from which the pupils would be drafted for that institution. The reasons above urged for increasing the number of educational institutions of either class will be more clearly manifested from the review which the undersigned proposes to make of the schools at present in operation and the facilities for education at present afforded as well as the additional facilities which it is desirable should be extended to the Indian youth upon the different Reserves in the various Provinces and Territories of the Dominion. He will, with this object in view, deal with the subject of Indian education as it at present exists on the various Reserves in each Province, and make suggestions of the improvements which he thinks should be adopted in connection with each Reserve, commencing with the Province of Ontario.\n\nPROVINCE OF ONTARIO.\n\nThere are in this Province 69 Indian Reserves. Of these, 24 have no schools established upon them, viz., the Reserves at Lac des Mille Lacs, Kawasagamot, Rat Portage, Big Island, North-West Angle, (8 Reserves), Assabaskasing, White Fish Bay, Buffalo Bay, Shoal Lake (2 Reserves), Temogamingue, French River, Thessalon, Spanish River, Point Grondine, Ojibwaning, Cockburn Island, Sucker Lake, Long Lake, Pays Plat, Riviere au Sable and Scugog. Of these Reserves, which are as yet without schools, 12 would appear to have a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of schools upon them, viz., the Reserves at Lac des Mille Lacs, Rat Portage, Big Island, Reserve 37 at the North-West Angle, Assabaskasing, White Fish Bay, Buffalo Bay, No. 39 at Shoal Lake, Temogamingue, French River, Spanish River and\nLong Lake. On the remaining 12 Reserves the number of children of school age ranges from 5 to 12.\n\nOf the 69 Reserves in the Province there are 45 on which schools are established. Of these 45, however, 12 would appear, from the number of children upon them of school age, not to have sufficient facilities for the education of the children. The Reserves last referred to are as follows:\u2014Coutecheching, where there are 60 children of school age and only one school; Islington, whereon there are 65 children of school age and but one school; at Garden River, on which the number of children of school age is 175, and the number of schools in operation 2; at Christian Island, on which the number of children of school age is 70, with only one school in operation; at Walpole Island, on which the number of children of school age is 153, with 2 schools in operation; on the Oneida Reserve, in the Township of Delaware, where there are 180 children of school age and 3 schools in operation; on the Reserve at Henvey Inlet, in the Parry Sound District, on which there are 70 children of school age and only 1 school in operation; on the Six Nations Reserve, in the Townships of Tuscarora, Oneida and Onondaga, having 1,066 children of school age and but 12 schools in operation; on the Mississauga Reserve, in the Township of Oneida, having 70 children of school age and only 1 school in operation; on the Reserve at Tyendinaga, on which there are 340 children of school age and 4 schools in operation; on the Reserves of the Chippewas of Sarnia, situated near Sarnia, and at Kettle Point, on which the number of children of school age is 128 with 2 schools in operation.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be obvious that estimating 40 children or thereabouts for each school, there should be on the Reserve at Coutecheching 2 schools instead of 1; on the Reserve at Islington, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Garden River Reserve, at least 4 schools instead of 2; on the Christian Island Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Walpole Island Reserve, 4 schools instead of 2; on the Oneida Reserve, in the Township of Delaware, 4 schools instead of 3; on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Six Nation Reserve, 26 schools instead of 12; on the Mississauga Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Reserve at Tyendinage, 8 schools instead of 4; on the Reserves near Sarnia and at Kettle Point, which belong to the one Band, 3 schools instead of 2.\n\nIt is desirable, in the case of Reserves having more than one school upon them, that when it is practicable\u2014which will be the exception\u2014the sexes should be divided, that is, that there should be a school for boys and another for girls.\n\nAs regards the Reserves on which schools have been established and are in operation, no accommodation has been provided for the teachers of these schools, in the shape of house room. Consequently they have to obtain board and lodging where best they can. This is, as stated in the prefatory part of this report, a very undesirable condition of matters. The teacher should be supplied with a proper place of abode, at a convenient distance from the school.\nWith regard to Industrial Schools, there are in existence at present, in the Province of Ontario, four of these institutions, viz.:\u2014At Sault Ste. Marie, where are established the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes, one for the instruction of Indian boys and the other for the instruction of Indian girls. The principal of these institutions is the Rev. E. F. Wilson. He is a clergyman of the Church of England, but has expressed his willingness to make his institutions undenominational.\n\nAt Wikwemikong, on Manitoulin Island, there are also boys' and girls' industrial institutions conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. At Brantford the Mohawk Institute is carried on under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Ashton and under the auspices of the New England Company. It receives no aid from the Government. This institution has both boys and girls as pupils. At Mount Elgin, in the Township of Caradoc, in the County of Middlesex, an Industrial Institution is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. It has also male and female pupils. Of these institutions the Shingwauk Home and Wawanosh Home at Sault Ste. Marie can accommodate between them about 85 pupils. The institutions at Wikwemikong can afford accommodation for about 114 pupils. The Mohawk Institute, near Brantford, can accommodate about 90. The Mount Elgin Institution accommodates 60 pupils.\n\nIt will thus be seen that at these four institutions accommodation can at present be furnished for 349 pupils. The number of children of school age upon the various Reserves in the Province is 5,191, and should schools, as recommended, be established upon Reserves on which there are none at present and where there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of schools, and should the additional number of schools recommended be established on the Reserves where the number of schools at present in operation is insufficient to meet the educational requirements of the Indians, and estimating the percentage of children fit to be drafted from day schools into the industrial institutions at 10 per cent., it is obvious that there will not be sufficient accommodation in the existing institutions of the latter type to meet the requirements of the more advanced pupils, and that either the accommodation of the present institutions will have to be increased or new institutions must be established. Further, should the recommendation contained in the previous part of this report be approved of and given effect to, viz., that in the case of Reserves in regard to any of which there is not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a day school on the Reserve, a central boarding school of the primary class should be established to meet the educational requirements of bands so situated, this will necessitate, in the case of the Province of Ontario, one institution of that class, there being 85 children in all upon Reserves who would have to be provided for in this way. And it is submitted, that as occasionally in each band children are left without natural protectors, owing to the death of their parents, to meet such cases, this primary institution might be made of sufficient dimensions to accommodate say 100 pupils.\n\nIt would be preferable, were it possible, to have all these industrial institutions non-denominational, and in so far as Protestant Indians are\nconcerned, there would probably be little or no objection to non-denomi-\nnational schools; but the Roman Catholic Indians would undoubtedly be\nprevented by their clergy from allowing their children to attend any other\nthan Roman Catholic institutions.\n\nThe undersigned would favor the enlargement of the existing insti-\ntutions rather than the establishment of others. He is of the opinion that\nthey are favorably situated, being sufficiently central for all practical\npurposes. He would, however, in accordance with his previously\nexpressed views in this matter, require that the Indian children from cer-\ntain Reserves should attend one of the institutions and no other, e.g.,\nthe institution at Mount Elgin might be supplied with children from the\nday schools on the Reserves at Rice Lake, Mind Lake, Georgina Island,\nRama, Walpole Island, Delaware, Caradoc, Alnwick, Orford, Sarnia,\nKettle Point, Scugog. The Mohawk Institute might draw its pupils from\nthe schools in operation on the Reserves of the Six Nations, of the Mississ-\nagans of the County of Haldimand, and of the Mohawks of the Bay of\nQuint\u00e9, in the Township of Tyendinaga, in the county of Hastings; while\nthe institutions at Sault Ste. Marie and Wikwemikong would absorb\nthe pupils drafted from the Protestant day schools on the various Reserves from\nPenetanguishene northward, including the Reserves on the Lake of the\nWoods and on Rainy River, while the Roman Catholic schools on any of\nthe reserves in the same territory might furnish their quota to the Wik-\nwemikong institutions. The capacity of each institution would then require\nto be increased as follows:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution, which at present accommodates sixty\npupils, would have to be increased so as to permit of 113 pupils being\nadmitted.\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, which at present has accommodation for 90\npupils, would require to be enlarged sufficiently for lodging 155 pupils.\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes at Sault Ste. Marie, which at\npresent have lodging capacity for 85 pupils, should be enlarged to a sufficient\nextent to admit of 128 pupils being lodged thereat.\n\nThe Wikwemikong Institutions it is thought already have sufficient\nlodging capacity for any additional pupils that they may be required to\ntake in.\n\nIf effect should be given to the views above expressed, the following\nstatement will show the increased cost which must necessarily be incurred\nin connection with the day schools at present conducted upon Reserves in\nthe Province of Ontario, and the cost of establishing new day schools on\nReserves on which there is only one school at present in operation but\nwhereon there is a sufficient number of children of school age to warrant\nthe establishment of more schools, and the cost of establishing schools on\nReserves on which no schools at present exist. Taking the present average\nsalary paid to teachers, viz., $240 per annum, and the number of schools\nat present in operation, viz., 69, and doubling the salary of $240, which is\nthe average remuneration now given, the increase in this item would be\n69 teachers at $240 additional each, $16,560 per annum, and adding thereto\nthe number of additional schools which it is proposed to establish on these Reserves on which schools at present exist, viz. 29, and estimating, as before, the salary of each teacher at $480, the 29 teachers' salaries would cost $13,920.\n\nThe total amount that will then be required for 69 teachers at $240 each + 29 at $480 each, will be .................................................. $30,480 00\n\nAnd estimating the cost of erecting new buildings upon these Reserves both for school houses and for the teachers' accommodation at the lowest figure, viz., $500 for each school house and teacher's residence, the cost of schoolhouses and teachers' residences at $500 for 29 new institutions would be $14,500, and of residences for the teachers of 69 schools, the schoolhouses for which have already been erected, say, at $300 each, $20,700; total cost $14,500 + $20,700 ....... $35,200 00\n\nIn addition to the foregoing there are as shown in a previous part of this report 12 Reserves which though they have a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school upon each of them have at present no schools in operation. Allowing one school to each of these Reserves and the same rate of salary, viz., $480 to each teacher, there would be 12 teachers at $480, equal to... 5,760 00\n\nAnd allowing the same expenditure for erecting school houses and teachers' dwellings, viz., $500 for each Reserve the cost of these erections on the 12 Reserves would be ................. 6,000 00\n\nAdding the cost of equipping all the new schools with proper books and school materials, say at the lowest estimate $100 for each school to be established, being 41 schools in all .......... 4,100 00\n\nAdding thereto the cost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits to 5,191 pupils in 98 schools at $8 per head, equal to ........................................ 41,528 00\n\nAnd the cost of clothing the pupils with winter and summer apparel, 5,191, at say $10 each... 51,910 00\n\nAllowing a sufficient sum to furnish prizes to deserving pupils, say $15 to each school, 98 schools at $15 equal to............................... 1,470 00\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the total cost involved in increasing the facilities at present afforded at day schools for the education of the Indian children of Ontario and in improving the methods at present in operation will be ........................................... $176,448.00\n\nFrom this amount, after deducting the cost of the schoolhouses and residences, and the cost of the equipment of the new schoolhouses, $45,300 in all, the balance, viz., $131,148, will represent, approximately, what the annual expenditure on account of day schools will be; in addition to which there will also, of course, be required a certain amount of expenditure in supplying school material, keeping the building in repair, &c. For this it is difficult to estimate; but on a rough calculation it might be set down at $5,000 to meet all such requirements.\n\nThe increased expenditure in connection with the Industrial Institutions would be as follows:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution, accommodation for board and tuition for 53 additional pupils at $60 each .................................................. $3,180.00\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, for board and tuition of 65 additional pupils, at $60 each ......................... 3,900.00\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes, for board and tuition of 50 additional pupils, at $60 each .......................................................... 3,000.00\n\nThe cost of the enlargement of these institutions, so as to meet the additional accommodation required, would be approximately as follows:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution ........................................... $2,000.00\n\nThe Mohawk Institute .................................................. 3,000.00\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes ...................... 2,000.00\n\nFor repairs, annually .................................................. 2,000.00\n\nDeducting the cost of enlarging the buildings, viz., $7,000, the annual expenditure in board and tuition of the additional pupils, and in repairs, would be .................................................. $12,080.00\n\nWhich, added to the present expenditure of $6,000 at the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes and at the Mount Elgin Institute, on the same account (there is no subsidy at present given to the Mohawk Institute) would make the whole amount to be expended on the above account .................................................. $33,380.00\n\nAdding the additional cost of establishing new day schools, the enlargement of the Industrial Institutions and the cost of the board and tuition of the pupils at both day schools and Industrial Schools, the following would be\nthe additional amount to be provided, viz., for day schools, $146,148; for Industrial Schools, $93,380; less $6,000 already paid, $27,380; total .................................................. 178,128 00\n\nAfter deducting from which the first cost on account of buildings, viz., $52,300; the balance, viz., $120,828, will be the additional amount to be provided annually for the support of day schools, and for the board and tuition of the additional number of pupils at the Industrial Institutions of this Province.\n\nPROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\n\nIn this Province there are 10 Indian Reserves. In addition to these, there are bands of Indians on the Lower St. Lawrence, who, after returning from their winter's hunt, are in the habit of camping at the following places: Escomains, Godbout, Sept Isles, Mingan and Musquero.\n\nIn the County of T\u00e9miscouata, there are also wandering Indians who usually camp, during the open seasons, at Rivi\u00e8re du Loup and Tadoussac and on the opposite side of the river, at Rimouski and at L\u00e9vis. These Indians formerly occupied a Reserve at Isle Verte, in the Township of Viger, which was surrendered by them and the land has been sold.\n\nThe total number of children of an age to attend school in the Province is approximately 673.\n\nOf the Indian Reserves on which there are schools in operation there are three Reserves with only one school on each, whereas the number of children of school age on each would justify the establishment of more, viz., at River Desert, where there are 75 children; at Caughnawaga, 187 and at Point Bleue, Lac St. Jean, 106 children of school age. At Caughnawaga another school is, however, about to be brought into operation for the female children. In order to meet the educational requirements of the children of these three Reserves it would appear to be necessary to establish another school on the Reserve at River D\u00e9sert, three additional schools on the Reserve at Caughnawaga, and another school, at least, on the reserve at Lac St. Jean.\n\nOn the Reserve at Betsiamits, where during the open season there are 131 children of school age, there is no school in operation, nor are there schools in operation at any of the points above enumerated on the north shore of the Lower St. Lawrence, to which the Indians resort in the summer season; although at Sept Isles, in the families that remain, in the open season, there are said to be 98 children of school age; at Mingan, 50; at Musquarro, 72; at Godbout, 15, and at Escomains, 13. It is difficult to say how the education of the children at these last named points is to be accomplished. For the greater portion of the year the Indians are absent, leaving early in the month of August and not returning until about the middle of June. Their hunting grounds are distant and they are therefore obliged to leave early for the same in order to reach them in good time to commence their hunt and to arrange their winter quarters; and for the same reason, viz., the distance they have to travel, they\nare in the spring late in arriving at the coast. The only feasible plan by which to accomplish the education of any of the children of these nomads would appear to be by the establishment at some point of a central boarding school at which the children might remain while their parents went to their hunting grounds; but the school would have to be a large one to accommodate the number of children of school age were they all to be admitted at the same time. The whole number of children of school age at the above points including Betsiamits is 370. It is not, however, likely that the parents of the children would all agree to leave them, and the Department could scarcely calculate upon more than perhaps a quarter of that number, or in round numbers say 100 children, being left at the school. Should such a central boarding school for about 100 children be established there is no reason why the children of the nomadic Indians of Temiscouata before referred to should not also be admitted into the same.\n\nWith a view to the higher education of the children who attend the schools established upon Indian Reserves in this Province, it would be necessary to establish an industrial boarding school at some central point, whereat Indian boys selected from the day schools, besides having the benefit of a higher education, might be instructed in trades that would enable them to obtain a livelihood after leaving the institution, and girls might receive instruction in sewing, knitting, dress-making, tailoring, baking and other household industries.\n\nThe total number of children of school age on the various Reserves in the Province is 673, and estimating that 10 per cent. of these would be eligible for admission into an industrial institution, the number to be admitted would be about 68, or say 70. It would not, therefore, be necessary to have more than one industrial school for the above purpose.\n\nThe expense involved in giving effect to the above ideas, if approved of, would be as follows:\n\n- Five additional schools at River Desert, Caughnawaga and Lac St. Jean, at a salary of say $480 for each teacher ........................................... $2,400 00\n\n- Additional amount required, viz., $240 for each, to bring up the salaries of the teachers of the three schools at present in operation on those Reserves to $480 for each teacher ......................... 720 00\n\n- Additional amount required to increase the salaries of 11 teachers on the Reserves at Restigouche, St. Francis (2 schools), Maria, Lorette, St. Regis (4 schools), Temiscamingue (2 schools), from the salaries at present received by them, $240 to $480 each per annum .......................... 2,640 00\n\n- The cost of mid-day meal for the pupils at the 19 day schools, estimating the outside number of children to be provided for at 673, and at the rate of $8 per capita ........................................... 5,384 00\nAdding cost of erection of five additional school buildings and residences at $500 each........... 2,500 00\nFourteen residences for the teachers at $300 for each.................................................. 4,200 00\nCost of clothing for the children attending the day schools, $6.50 for winter uniform and $2.50 for summer uniform, 678 children at $10 each.... 6,780 00\nCost of prizes for pupils, 19 schools at $15 each.... 285 00\nCost of erection of a central boarding school for the Indian children of the Lower St. Lawrence, to accommodate 100 children, about..... 4,000 00\nCost of tuition and board, &c., of these children at $100 each per annum................................. 10,000 00\nCost of building for an Industrial School for children selected from 19 Reserve schools..... 3,500 00\nFor tuition, board, clothing, &c., therest of 70 children at $60 each...................................... 4,200 00\nCost of furniture and school material................. 2,500 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance. $49,650 00\n\nThe above estimate in regard to the boarding school for the Lower St. Lawrence and the industrial school for the children from day schools on the Reserves is based upon the supposition that, as in the case of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institution in Ontario and the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes at Sault Ste. Marie, some religious denomination or benevolent society will share the expense of the tuition, board, &c., of the children. Should, however, this prove not to be the case and the whole expense have to be borne by the Government, the estimate would have to be increased to the extent of at least two-thirds.\n\nDeducting first cost of buildings and of furniture, $16,700, the balance, $32,850, shows the additional amount required annually for educating the Indian children of the Province.\n\nNOVA SCOTIA.\n\nThere are in this Province 18 Indian Reserves, and the total number of children of school age is 486.\n\nThe following Reserves have each one school in operation upon them, viz.: at Cow Bay, in the County of Halifax, where there are school children to the number of 20; Whycoomagh, in the County of Inverness, the number of school children being 84; Eskasoni, in the County of Cape Breton, the number of school children being 21; at Indian Cove, in the County of Pictou, with a school population of 85; New Germany in the County of Lunenburg, having 25 children of school age; Red Islands, in the county of Richmond, with a school population of 45; Middle River, in the county of Victoria, having a school population of 39; Bear River, in the County of Digby, having a school population of 71.\nWith the exception of the last named Reserve, the number of children of school age on each of these Reserves is not greater than one teacher should be able to instruct. On the Bear River Reserve, however, there would appear to be a larger number than any one teacher can properly manage.\n\nOn the following Reserves there are no schools in operation:\n\nSheet Harbor, in the County of Halifax, where there are 15 children of school age; Shubenacadie, in the County of Hants, where there are about 40 children of an age to attend school; Franklin Manor, in the County of Cumberland, with children of school age to the number of 12; at Truro, in the County of Colchester, where there are 20 children sufficiently old to attend school; in the Counties of Annapolis and Shelburne, the number of children of school age being 38; in Queen's County, where there are 20 children of an age to go to school; in the County of Antigonish, where there are about 40 children old enough for attendance at school; in King's County, the number of children of school age being 30.\n\nIt will be observed from the foregoing that there are 8 Reserves in the Province with schools established on them; while there are 10 Reserves without schools, although the number of children of an age to bear school on each of those Reserves, with the exception of those at Sheet Harbor, in the County of Halifax, and at Franklin Manor, in the County of Cumberland, is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve.\n\nIf, as in the case of the other Provinces, the average salary at present paid the 8 teachers now employed, viz., $240 each per annum, be doubled, the additional amount required to increase the salaries now paid will be........... $1,920 00\n\nIf 11 new schools are to be brought into operation on the ten Reserves at present without any, and another at Bear River, the total amount required for salaries for the teachers of the 11 schools would be.................................. 7,680 00\n\nAdding the cost of erecting new school-houses upon ten Reserves not already supplied with schools, and of a school-house for an additional school at Bear River, as well as the cost of residences for teachers at the rate of $500 for each school-house and residence the total amount to be provided for buildings would be.................................................. 5,500 00\n\nAnd if provision of residences is to be made for the teachers of the schools at present in operation, allowing $300 for each building, $300 x 8................................. 2,400 00\nAdding cost of equipment of eleven new schools with proper books and school material, at say, $160 each .......................................................... 1,100 00\n\nCost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits, to 486 children, at $8 each per school year ........ 3,888 00\n\nCost of clothing 486 pupils with winter and summer apparel, at $10 each ........................................ 4,860 00\n\nCost of providing prizes for each school, 19 schools, at $15 each ...................................................... 285 00\n\nRepairs and renewing the supply of school books and material annually, say ......................... 800 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided ....................... $26,025 00\n\nThis amount, $26,025, less the cost of the building and of equipment of new schools, viz.: $9,000, will represent the amount to be annually provided for the purposes of day schools on the Reserves in the Province, viz.: $17,025.\n\nIf a central industrial institution for the instruction of boys in trades and agriculture, and of girls in sewing, dressmaking, tailoring, knitting, cooking, baking, washing, and household duties generally, be established, which the undersigned thinks is highly desirable in order that promising children who have acquitted themselves in a creditable manner at the day schools should receive higher educational advantages, as well as instruction in some useful trade, taking the percentage as in the case of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec at 10 per cent. of the total school population in the Province, the number of children for whom accommodation would be required at the industrial institution would be about 50.\n\nThe approximate cost of the erection of a building for the purpose would be, say ........................................ $2,750 00\n\nCost of tuition, board, &c., of 50 children, at $60 each ............................................................ 3,000 00\n\nCost of furnishing the building, say ..................... 800 00\n\nCost of repairs annually ........................................ 400 00\n\nTotal cost ....................................................... $6,950 00\n\nFrom which, in order to show the amount to be annually provided, should be deducted the cost of the building, $2,750; and of furnishing, &c., $800, leaving as a result ......................... 3,400 00\n\nAnd this added to the annual cost of the day schools, $17,025, will make the total annual cost of Indian schools in Nova Scotia, $8,400 +$17,025 ......................................................... 20,425 00\nNEW BRUNSWICK.\n\nThere are 19 Indian Reserves in this Province, with a school population of 481.\n\nOn the following Reserves schools have been established:\n\nAt Kingsclear and at St. Mary's, in the County of York; at Tobique, in the County of Victoria; at Burnt Church and at Eel Ground, in the County of Northumberland; one school being in operation on each of these Reserves and with the exception of that at Burnt Church, where there are 75 children of school age, one school is sufficient to meet the educational requirements of the children so far as can be judged from the number on each Reserve.\n\nThere are 14 Reserves without schools. Of these the Reserves at St. Andrew's, in the County of Charlotte; St. John, in the County of St. John; Edmundston, in the County of Madawaska; Red Bank, in the County of Northumberland; Shediac, in the County of Westmoreland, and Folly Point, in the County of Westmoreland, have not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve, none of them having more than 10 children of an age to attend school, and the majority of them only from 4 to 9 children.\n\nThe other Reserves, in view of the number of children of school age upon them, should have schools established theretofore, viz., at Woodstock, in the County of Carleton, where there are 20 children; Aphaquai, in the County of King's, where there are 14; Dalhousie, in the County of Restigouche, where there are 12 children; Bathurst, in the county of Gloucester, having 18 children; Indian Island, in the County of Kent, with 22 children; Big Cove, in the same county, having as many as 61 children; and Buctouche, also in the County of Kent, 16 children.\n\nOf these last named Reserves, that at Big Cove is the only one on which there would be a necessity, apparently, for the establishment of more than one school, there being, as above stated, 61 children of school age upon it, which number should afford an attendance sufficient for two schools.\n\nAllowing two schools for that reserve and one school for each of the others, there would be\n\n8 new schools to be established, which, at $480 salary for each teacher, would cost for salaries $3,840 00\n\nAnd adding the additional cost of increasing the salaries of the present teachers of the 5 existing schools by $240, the additional amount to be provided for salaries for those teachers would be .................................................. 1,200 00\n\nThe cost of building 8 new school-houses and residences for the teachers, say at $500 each, would amount to ........................................... 4,000 00\n\nAnd to this should be added the cost of 5 residences for the teachers of the existing schools, at say $300 each .............................................. 1,500 00\nCost of equipment of the 8 new schools, with proper books and school materials, at say $100 each, would be ........................................... 800 00\n\nCost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits, to 384 children, at $8 each per school year ........ 3,072 00\n\nCost of clothing the same number of children with winter and summer apparel, at $10 each .......... 3,840 00\n\nCost of providing prizes for each school, 18 schools, at $15 .......................................................... 195 00\n\nFor repairs and renewal of supply of school books and material annually ........................................ 650 00\n\nTotal additional amount to be provided .. $19,097 00\n\nThis sum, less the cost of the buildings and of equipping the new schools, viz., $6,800, will represent the additional amount, viz., $12,797, to be annually voted for day schools on the reserves in this Province.\n\nIf the proposition to establish a central industrial institution in this Province should be approved of, the number of pupils who would attend, at the rate of percentage adopted for the other Provinces, viz., 10 per cent. of the children of school age, would be about 44; but it is considered that, as already stated, on several of the reserves above-mentioned, there is not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a day school, provision should be made in the said central industrial institution for the admission of these children thereto; and this would occasion a necessity for a larger building, as there are altogether 87 children of school age on the several reserves referred to; consequently the total number to be provided for in the industrial institution would be 44 + 87 = 81 children.\n\nIt is possible, however, that arrangements might be made by which the children of some of the reserves last referred to, which may have public schools in the vicinity, might be admitted to the same; and if such could be effected, there would, of course, be no necessity for so large a building; but it may be concluded that it will not be possible, in the majority of instances, to effect such an arrangement, and allowing that one-half of the number of children of school age on these reserves, say 18, would be admitted to the institution, provision would then have to be made for 62 children, and the approximate cost of the erection of a building for the accommodation of that number it is thought would be about ......................................................................................................................... $3,000 00\n\nCost of board and tuition of 62 children, at $60 each per annum ...................................................... 3,720 00\n\nCost of furnishing the building and equipping it, &c., say ............................................................ 800 00\n\nCost of repairs and school material annually, say ............................................................................. 400 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided would therefore be ..... $7,920 00\nFrom this amount, in order to show the sum to be annually provided, must be deducted the cost of the buildings and of furnishing the same, $8,800, leaving as the result $4,120, and this amount added to the actual cost of the day schools, $12,797, will make the total additional annual cost of Indian schools in New Brunswick $16,917.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\n\nIn this Province there are two Reserves. The larger one consists of Lennox Island, and the smaller one is situated in Township No. 39. In the latter there are but a few families, and the number of children of an age to attend school being only 6, no school has been established on the Reserve. On Lennox Island, however, there are 67 children old enough to be at school, and there is one in operation; but the attendance thereof is very small; indeed there are only 22 names on the school roll, and the average attendance falls, as a rule, far short of that number. The teacher is favorably reported of, but as he combines with his office of school teacher that of Indian Agent, it is probable, as has frequently been alleged by the incumbent, that the duties of the one office interfere with those of the other, and that were the offices separated, the school teacher, having nothing but his school to attend to, would be able to give closer attention to his duties, and both the attendance at and efficiency of the institution would be thereby greatly enhanced.\n\nThe school teacher, who as above stated also fills the position of Indian Agent, receives for the two offices a salary of $500 per annum, divided thus: $300 as agent, and $200 as teacher. Should it be decided to dissociate the positions, and to place the teacher on a similar footing as respects salary and residence, as is recommended in the case of teachers of Indian schools elsewhere, the present compensation of $200 would have to be increased by $280.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| And cost of a dwelling house for the teacher, say | $300   |\n| Additional furniture, desks, &c.           | $100   |\n| Daily meal of porridge, syrup and biscuits for 67 children, at $8 each per annum | $536   |\n| Clothing 67 children, at $10               | $670   |\n| Prizes for children                       | $25    |\n| For repairs annually to buildings and renewal of school material | $50    |\n\nTotal additional amount to be provided: $1,961\n\nAnd to ascertain the additional amount to be annually voted, the sums above stated as necessary for cost of teacher's house, $300; additional furniture, books, &c., $110; making together $400, should be deducted from the total amount above stated, which will give as a result, $1,561.\n\nThe small number which, at 10 per cent. of the school children would be available for promotion to an industrial boarding school, might be\naccommodated in the institutions of that type proposed to be established in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; and as respects the 6 children on the Reserve in Township 39, arrangements might possibly be made for their admittance into the nearest public school in that locality.\n\nMANITOBA AND KEKWATIN.\n\nOn Lake Winnipeg there are 11 Reserves, with 691 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Black River, 23; Hollow Water, 32; Loon Straits, 10; Blood Vein, 81; Jack Head, 19; Fisher River, 85; Berens River, 73; Grand Rapids of Berens River, 68; Poplar River, 57; Norway House, 208; Cross Lake, 90. There are schools in operation on 7 of these Reserves, viz., at Hollow Water, Loon Straits, Fisher River, Berens River, Poplar River, Norway House (2), and Cross Lake. On 4 Reserves there are no schools, viz., at Black River, Blood Vein Creek, Jack Head, and at the Grand Rapids of Berens River. There is a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school on each of the Reserves last mentioned, and, therefore, the establishment of a school on each Reserve would be justifiable. And, on each of the Reserves at Fisher River, Berens River, Grand Rapids, Poplar River, and Cross Lake, the number of children would justify the establishment of 2 schools instead of one such institution. And on Norway House Reserve, where there are 208 children of an age to attend school, there should be 4 instead of 2 schools in operation. The average salary paid the teachers of Indian Schools on Lake Winnipeg, is $360 per annum, which is a wholly insufficient remuneration, and it is submitted that the salary should be increased to $480 per annum.\n\nSuch increase, if agreed to, will involve an additional grant for the 9 teachers of the schools at present in operation of $180 \\times 9 = $1,620.00\n\nAnd if the 11 additional schools above recommended are established there will be a further sum required for salaries of $480 \\times 11 = $5,280.00\n\nAnd assuming that residences are to be provided for the 9 teachers at present in the service at $300 each \\times 9 there will require to be provided $2,700.00\n\nAnd schoolhouses and residences for the 11 new teachers at $500 each will cost $500 \\times 11 = $5,500.00\n\nAdd cost of equipping the 11 new schools with furniture and school material, say, for each $100 \\times 11 = $1,100.00\n\nCost of furnishing food for 691 children, at $8 each per annum $5,528.00\n\nExpense of clothing the same number, at $10 = $6,910.00\n\nCost of prizes for 20 schools, at $15 each $300.00\nCost of repairs to buildings and renewal of school material annually ........................................... $1,000.00\n\nThe total sum to be provided for Indian schools on Lake Winnipeg in addition to the amount already granted will then be ........................................... $29,988.00\n\nFrom this amount should be deducted the cost of new school buildings $8,200 + cost of equipment, 1,100 ........................................... $9,300.00\n\nAnd the result will give ........................................... $20,688.00\n\nas the additional amount to be annually voted for the 17 schools in this agency.\n\nAn industrial institution, with a capacity of accommodation for 70 pupils, should be established at some central point, into which the most promising and furthest advanced children from the day schools of the district might be drafted. Berens River Reserve, whereon the Indian Agent for the locality resides, would appear to be the most suitable location for such an establishment.\n\nThe cost of erecting a building for the above purpose at Berens River would be, it is thought, about ........................................... $10,000.00\n\nAnd provided some religious and benevolent body will co-operate, the expense to the Department connected with the board, clothing, tuition, and instruction in industries of 70 children may be placed at $100 per capita ........................................... $7,000.00\n\nAnd the cost of keeping the institution buildings in repair at ........................................... $800.00\n\nThe total amount to be in the first place provided will therefore be ........................................... $17,800.00\n\nAnd there will require to be annually voted for maintenance of the institution that sum less cost of building $10,000 ........................................... $7,800.00\n\nThe additional amount that will therefore be annually required for maintenance of day schools and of the industrial institution will be $20,688 + $7,800 ........................................... $28,488.00\n\nIn the St. Peter's Agency there are 466 children of an age to attend school, viz., on the Reserves as St. Peter's 328, on that at Broken Head River 80, and on the Reserve at Fort Alexander 108. On the St. Peter's Reserve there are 6 schools in operation, but there would appear to be a sufficient number of children to admit of the establishment of two additional schools; on the Reserve at Broken Head River there is one school, and on that at Fort Alexander there are 2 schools in operation.\nAs in the case of the Lake Winnipeg reserves the average salary paid the school teachers in this agency is $300 per annum. If, as has been recommended as respects teachers in other agencies, and which appears worthy of adoption in this agency, their salaries are increased to $480 each, there will be required an additional amount for the 9 school teachers now employed at $180 each of ........................................... $1,620 00\n\nAnd if two additional schools are established on the St. Peter's Reserve as recommended, salaries of $480 each will require to be provided\u2014$480 \u00d7 2.......................................................... 960 00\n\nAnd should residences for the 9 teachers now employed be built at, say $300, for each building, the cost will be.................................................. 2,700 00\n\nTo which add cost of schoolhouses and residences for two new teachers on the St. Peter's Reserve, at $500 each ............................................. 1,000 00\n\nAnd cost of furniture for the same and of school material, say $100 for each ................. 200 00\n\nAnd the expense of furnishing a mid-day meal for the 460 children of the agency, at $8 each per annum .......................................................... 3,728 00\n\nAlso of clothing the same number of children, at $10 each per annum.............................................. 4,660 00\n\nAnd of providing prizes for 11 schools, at $15 each per annum.................................................. 165 00\n\nCost of repairs to buildings and of renewing school material annually at $50 each \u00d7 11 .... .......... 550 00\n\nTotal of first cost.................................................. $15,588 00\n\nFrom this sum should be deducted the cost of new buildings, $3,700, plus the equipment of the two new schools, $200........................................... 3,900 00\n\nAnd as a result we have........................................... $11,688 00\n\nas the additional amount to be annually granted for the maintenance of the 11 schools of this agency.\n\nThe number of children of school age in the agency being 466 and the proportion of 10 per cent. being taken as a proper estimate of the number adaptable for introduction into a school of industries, there would be, in round numbers, 47 children for admission into such an institution.\n\nThe cost of a building for the accommodation of that number of pupils would be, say....................... $6,000 00\nThe cost of tuition, industrial training, maintenance and clothing of 47 children, at $100 each per annum .................................................. 4,700 00\n\nThe cost of keeping the buildings in repair per annum, say .......................................................... 800 00\n\nThe total amount that must be in the first place provided will therefore be ........................................... $11,500 00\n\nAnd to be annually voted $11,500\u2014$6,000 (the cost of building) ...................................................... 5,500 00\n\nThe additional sum that will be required annually for maintenance of the day schools and of the industrial institutions of this agency will therefore be $11,683+$5,500 ........................................... 17,183 00\n\nIn the Lake Manitoba Agency there are 9 reserves with 10 schools in operation, and in the Portage la Prairie Agency there are 4 Reserves with 1 school. It would appear convenient to deal with these two agencies together as respects school matters.\n\nIn the former there are 297 children, and in the latter 70 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows: At Sandy Bay, 3; Lake Manitoba, 32; Rbh and Flow Lake, 25; Fairford, 90; Little Saskatchewan, 28; Crane River, 30; Water Hen River, 46; Duck Bay, 15; Rosseau River, 30; Long Plain, 20; Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing, 20. On all of these Reserves, excepting at Long Plain, Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing, schools have been established. At Fairford, where, as above stated, there are 90 children of school age, 2 schools are in operation; at Rosseau River, the school is kept in the private house of an Indian, owing to the want of a public building for the purpose. At Long Plain, there being 20 children of an age to attend school, one should be established, and as there is a similar number at Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing a school might be started at the latter point, where the most of the Indians reside.\n\nThe average salary of the teachers in these agencies is as in the other Agencies, $300 per annum. Should it be decided to raise the salaries of the teachers to $480, the additional amount required for the 11 teachers at present employed would be $180 x 11 ........................................... $1,980 00\n\nAnd should schools be established at Long Plain and at Hamilton's Crossing, the amount required for salaries of teachers will be $480 x 2 ........................................... 960 00\n\nThe cost of erecting residences for 10 teachers where schoolhouses have been erected at $300 each, would be .......................................................... 3,000 00\n\nAnd of building a new schoolhouse and teacher's residence at Rosseau River ........................................... 500 00\nAnd of erecting similar buildings at Long Plain and Swan Lake, $500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000 00\n\nCost of furnishing the 3 new schools and of school material for the same, $100 \u00d7 3 = 300 00\n\nExpense of supplying a mid-day meal to 367 children, at $8 each per annum = 2,936 00\n\nCost of clothing the same number, at $10 each per annum = 3,670 00\n\nProviding prizes for 11 schools, at $15 each per annum = 165 00\n\nRepairs to buildings and school material for 14 schools, $50 at each per annum = 700 00\n\nThe total additional amount to be provided in the first place for day schools in these agencies will therefore be $15211, 00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the cost of buildings and furnishing the same, $4,500 + $300 = 4,800 00\n\nThe result = $10,411 00\n\ngives the amount to be annually voted for the maintenance of day schools in these agencies. And allowing, as in the other agencies, 10 per cent. of the children as eligible for admission into an industrial institution, a building would be required of a capacity to accommodate 37 pupils.\n\nThe approximate cost of such a building would be $5,000 00\n\nAnd of furniture and school apparatus = 1,000 00\n\nAnd the cost of tuition, instruction in industries, clothing and board for 37 pupils at $100 each per annum would be = 3,700 00\n\nAnd the expenditure for repairs and equipment, annually = 800 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided = $10,500 00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the first cost of building and equipping, $5,000 \u00d7 $1,000 = 6,000 00\n\nThe result, viz., = $4,500 00\n\nshows the amount to be annually voted for maintaining the institution, and this sum, $4,500 + $10,411 = $14,911, will represent the total additional amount to be annually provided for day and industrial schools in these agencies.\n\nIn the Birtle District there are 14 Reserves, with 927 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014On the Reserve of the Sioux at Bird Tail Creek there are 52 children; on the Oak River Sioux Reserve, 108; on the Oak Lake Sioux Reserve, 16; on the Turtle Mountain Sioux\nReserve 14; on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9's Band, 141; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kouse, 94; on the Reserve of Way-way-se-cappo, 50; on the Reserve of the Gambler, 94; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kow-we-nin, 52; on the Reserve of The Key, 116; on the Reserve of South Quill, 60; on the Reserve of Pheasant Rump, 28; on the Reserve of Red Ear, 32; on the Reserve of White Bear, 70. Schools are in operation on six of these Reserves, viz., on Bird Tail Creek, Oak River, Cot\u00e9's, The Key's, Kee-see-kouse, Kee-see-kow-we-nin.\n\nOn the Reserve on Oak River there is only one school, whereas there is a sufficient number of children (108) of school age thereon to justify the establishment of another school; and on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9 there is only one school while there are 141 children, being sufficient for an attendance of over 40 at 3 schools; on the Reserve of The Key there are 116 children and only 1 school, whereas for that number of children there should be 3 schools in operation; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kouse there are 94 children and but one school, whereas there should be two schools in order to afford sufficient instruction to that number of children. On the Reserves at Oak Lake and Turtle Mountains, having respectively 16 and 14 children, there are no schools; the same remark applies to the Reserves of Way-way-se-cappo, where there are 50 children, of the Gambler, where there are 94, (being sufficient to afford an attendance of 47 each to 2 schools); of South Quill, having 60 children, a sufficient number for 2 schools; of Pheasant Rump, with 28 children, of Red Ear, having 32 children; and of White Bear, where there are 70 children, or a sufficient number to afford an attendance at two schools, of 35 to each.\n\nThe average salary paid school teachers in this district is $300 per annum. Should it be decided to increase the same to $480, it will involve an increased grant of for six teachers at $180 each.................................................. $1,080 00\n\nAnd should there be established, as above suggested, another school on Oak River Reserve and two additional schools on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9, and a like increased number of schools on the Reserve of The Key, and one more school on that of Kee-see-kouse, and one school on each of the Reserves at Oak Lake, Turtle Mountains, and a school on each of the Reserves of Way-way-se-cappo, South Quill, Pheasant Rump, Red Ear, and two schools on each of the Reserves of the Gambler and Red Bear\u2014for the teachers of these seventeen schools provision of salaries at $480 each will have to be made, $480 \u00d7 17.................................................. 8,160 00\n\nAnd should residences be provided for the six teachers at present employed, at say $800 each, $300 \u00d7 6.................................................. 1,800 00\nAnd school houses and residences for seventeen teachers, at $500 each ........................................... $8,600 00\n\nCost of furniture for the seventeen new schools and of school material for the same, at $100 each. ........................................... $1,700 00\n\nExpense of supplying mid-day meal to 927 children at $8 each per annum ........................................... $7,416 00\n\nCost of clothing 927 children, at $10 per annum each ........................................... $9,270 00\n\nProvision of prizes for twenty-three schools, at $15 each per annum ........................................... $345 00\n\nRepairs and school material at $50 each per annum, $50 \u00d7 23 ........................................... $1,050 00\n\nThe total additional sum required will in the first instance be ........................................... $89,321 00\n\nDeduct therefrom cost of buildings and of furnishing the same $10,300 + $1,700 ........................................... $12,000 00\n\nand the result ........................................... $27,321 00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in the Birtle Agency.\n\nAn industrial institution of a capacity to lodge ninety-three children should be established.\n\nThe approximate cost of a building for such a purpose would be ........................................... $10,000 00\n\nAnd the cost of clothing, board, tuition and instruction in industries of ninety-three pupils, at $100 each per annum would be ........................................... $9,300 00\n\nThe cost of equipment of the institution say ........................................... $2,400 00\n\nAnd of repairs and school material annually ........................................... $1,600 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided ........................................... $23,800 00\n\nDeduct therefrom the first cost of building and equipment ........................................... $12,400 00\n\nand the result ........................................... $10,900 00\n\nwill represent the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the institution and that amount, $10,900 + $27,321 = $38,121, shows the additional sum total required annually for maintenance of day schools and of an industrial institution in this agency.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend that the latter institution be established at Birtle, which is the headquarters of the agency, and the agent could then personally, from time to time, inspect the institution and exercise a general supervision over the expenditure at and management of the same.\n\nThe District of Assiniboia is divided into five agencies. The Assiniboine or Indian Head Agency, in which there is but one Reserve known as Jack's,\nhaving 53 children of an age to attend school and where one school is in operation.\n\nThe Crooked Lakes Agency, embraces four Reserves, viz., the reserve known as Coweses', with 55 children of an age to attend school, and where there is one school in operation, Ochapawasis', having 50 children of school age, but no school, Sakiway's, which has 44 children old enough but having no school to attend, Ka-kee-wis-ta-hau's, with 28 children of school age but no school in operation; the File Hills Agency, which embraces four reserves, viz., Little Black Bear's, with 20 children of an age to attend school and one school in operation, Star Blanket's, with 18 children old enough but having no school to attend, Okanee's, having 10 children of sufficient age to attend but no school in operation, Pee-ppee-kee-sis', having 19 children of school age but no school in operation.\n\nMuscowpetung's Agency includes four reserves, consisting of Pasqua's, with 65 children of school age and one school in operation, Muscowpetung's, having 20 children of an age to attend school but no school in operation, Piapot's, where there are 46 children old enough to attend and one school in operation, Standing Buffalo's, having 52 children of school age and one school in operation.\n\nThe Touchwood Hills Agency, contains five reserves, viz., Poor Man's, having 35 children of an age to attend, but having no school, Day Star's, with 25 children of school age but no school, Gordon's, having 55 children of an age to attend and one school in operation, Muscowequan's, with 30 children sufficiently old to attend school and one in operation, Yellow Quill's, having 40 children sufficiently old but no school to attend.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be observed that of the four reserves in the Crooked Lakes Agency there is only one with a school on it, although on each of the other three reserves there is a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school if one were established; also that in the File Hills Agency there is only one school, although there are four reserves, and that on two of these reserves, if not on the three, the number of children of school age is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each. In the Muscowpetung Agency of the four reserves only one is without a school, but there being 20 children of school age theron, one might very properly be established. Another school on Pasquah's Reserve, where there are 65 children of school age, would not be too many.\n\nIn the Touchwood Hills Agency out of five reserves only two have schools on them, whereas on each of the three other reserves the number of children of an age to attend school would justify the establishment of one school, and on one of those upon which one school exists the number of children is sufficient to afford a fair attendance for two schools.\n\nOn Jack's Reserve, in the Assiniboine Agency, there are, as above stated, 53 children and one school; another school would not be too many.\n\nAs elsewhere in the North-West, the average salary of the school teachers at these five agencies is $300 per annum.\nIf it be decided to increase the same to $480 per annum, the additional amount to be provided for the eight teachers at present employed, will be $180 \\times 8 = $1,440 00\n\nAnd for teachers of the 13 new schools proposed to be established, $180 \\times 13 = 2,340 00\n\nIf teachers' residences for the 8 now employed are to be erected, the cost, at $300 each, will be... 2,400 00\n\nAnd of school houses and teachers' residences for 13 new institutions, at $500 each... 6,500 00\n\nCost of furnishing and supplying material for 13 new schools, at $100 each... 1,300 00\n\nCost of supplying a mid-day meal to 628 children, at $8 each per annum... 5,024 00\n\nCost of clothing same number of children, at $10 each per annum... 6,280 00\n\nCost of providing prizes for 21 schools, at $15 each per annum... 315 00\n\nRepairs and school material for 21 schools, at $50 each per annum, $50 \\times 21 = 1,050 00\n\nTotal expense to be incurred in first instance... $26,649 00\n\nDeducting first cost of building and furnishing, $8,900 + 1,300 = 10,200 00\n\nAnd the result... $16,249 00\n\ngives the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of schools in these agencies.\n\nThere is already an Industrial Institution at Qu'Appelle, conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic church, which is probably of sufficient capacity to accommodate such number of children, of Roman Catholic parentage, from the day schools of these agencies, as well as from the Reserves of the Birtle, Prince Albert and Duck Lake and Pas Agencies, as may be selected as eligible for promotion into a higher school, and it is proposed to establish, as soon as possible, in the vicinity of Regina, another institution of the same type, to be placed under the Presbyterian Church, and when the same shall have been opened, it should be sufficient for the more advanced pupils of the day schools, of Protestant parentage, in the five agencies last referred to.\n\nThe southern part of the District of Alberta is the most difficult field in which to accomplish anything in the educational line. The great majority of the Indians are of the Blackfoot Nation, and having but little intelligence in respect to such matters, they consequently have little or no appreciation of the benefit of education for their children. They therefore have availed themselves but slightly of the scanty facilities afforded for\neducating them by the few day schools established by missionaries, and so discouraged have the teachers become that of the five schools formerly in operation only one remains at present open. That school has on its roll the names of 100 pupils, but the daily average attendance is very far short of that number, and even were the daily attendance equal to the number on the roll it would be but a poor showing for 1,940 children of school age on the three Reserves.\n\nNor have the attempts made to induce the parents to allow their children to remain at the Industrial Institution established at High River for the special benefit of the Blackfeet youth been successful, and the Department has consequently been obliged to draw from the more northern Cree Reserves of the district for inmates of that establishment. It is difficult to determine what measures should be adopted to effect a change of sentiment as respects education in these people. The attractive power which doubtless will be exercised over the minds of the Indian children on the other Reserves by a mid-day meal being given those attending school would, it is feared, fail of its object in the case of the Blackfeet children, inasmuch as, owing to the special circumstances surrounding those Indians in consequence of the extinction of the buffalo, on which they solely subsisted in times past, the Department has been obliged to regularly ration the whole nation with meat and flour. This has not had to be done with any of the other tribes, as they were not so wholly dependent as the Blackfeet on buffalo for a subsistence, their Reserves being situated in a country frequented more or less by wild fowl and other game of large and small size. The Department has therefore merely ministered to their actual necessities as they arose and thrown them mainly on the above resources and on the produce raised on their land for sustenance. It will thus be readily seen how difficult, and in fact impossible, it would be to induce the Blackfeet children, who are accustomed to a diet of meat and flour daily, to attend school where they would only get a meal of farinaceous food. The plan might be adopted of deducting a sufficient proportion of the shares of the children of school age from the rations deliverable to the parents for their families and have the same cooked for a mid-day meal for the pupils attending the day school. It might, however, cause considerable dissatisfaction were this to be done without the parents' consent. The presentation of cheap but showy prizes, consisting of such articles as would be specially attractive to the children, at the end of each week to regular attendants at the schools, who were otherwise deserving, would probably have a good effect in ensuring regularity and docility on the part of the pupils, and might go far towards inducing their parents to consent to the deduction of their proportionate share of rations for the mid-day meal for their children, and at the same time cause them to compel their children to attend regularly. Indeed some small remuneration might be given the parents with a view to ensure their co-operation in this much-to-be-desired end.\n\nThe number of children of an age to attend school in these tribes is as before stated 1,940, and\nestimating 40 children for each school the number of schools that should be established is 48, and these at a salary of $480 for each teacher would involve an expenditure for salaries of $480 \\times 48 = $23,040.00\n\nAnd for school and teachers houses, at $500 each... 24,000.00\n\nFor furniture and school material, at $100 each \\times 48... 4,800.00\n\nCost of clothing 1,940 children, at $10 per annum each... 19,400.00\n\nCost of providing prizes for 48 schools, at say $40 each per annum... 1,920.00\n\nRepairs and material for 48 schools, at $50 each per annum... 2,400.00\n\nTotal expense to be incurred in first instance $75,560.00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the first cost of building and furniture... 28,800.00\n\nThe result... $46,760.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually incurred for the maintenance of the schools among the Blackfoot Nation, which, it may be here stated, comprises three bands, consisting of Blackfeet proper, Bloods and Piegan, with the tributary tribes, though not allied to the Nation by ties of consanguinity, of Sarcees.\n\nThe reserve of these last named Indians is situated about 12 miles to the south-west of Calgary, and on it there are 40 children of an age to attend school and one school in operation, the average daily attendance at which is however only five. The same measures recommended to induce a larger attendance at schools on the Blackfoot Reserves should be adopted as regards this Reserve, as these Indians are manifestly as indifferent respecting the education of their children as their Blackfeet confr\u00e8res.\n\nThe following is a statement of the expense to be incurred on the Sarcee Reserve:\n\nTo increase salary of teacher from $800 to $480 per annum... $180.00\n\nTo erect a dwelling house for the teacher... 800.00\n\nTo provide clothing for 40 children, at $10 each per annum... 400.00\n\nFor prizes for the school per annum... 40.00\n\nFor repairs and material for one school annually... 50.00\n\nTotal amount to be expended in the first instance $970.00\n\nFrom which sum after deducting cost of building... 300.00\n\nThe result... $670.00\ngives the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the school.\n\nThe number of children of an age to attend school on the Reserves of the Blackfeet Nation and Sarcees being 1,980, the number available at 10 per cent. for transfer to industrial institutions would be 198. The institution at High River is not sufficiently large to accommodate that number of pupils were it otherwise desirable to place all the children in one institution, which it is not, as both Episcopal and Methodist missionaries, as well as Roman Catholic, have for several years been carrying on mission work on these Reserves, and it would therefore appear advisable to have another industrial school for the training of the more advanced children of adherents of the Protestant bodies whose missionaries are operating on the Reserves.\n\nIn the event of this proposition being acted upon, the expenditure for the erection of a building to accommodate 100 pupils would approximately be $12,000.00\n\nAnd the cost of clothing, feeding and instructing in trades and for the tuition of 100 pupils, at $120 each per annum, would be $12,000.00\n\nCost of furniture and equipment, with school materials, say $2,000.00\n\nFor repairs, annually, and renewing school material, furniture, &c., $1,000.00\n\nFor prizes for pupils $300.00\n\nTotal expenditure in first instance $27,300.00\n\nFrom which, after deducting cost of building and furnishing $14,000.00\n\nThe result $13,300.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for maintenance, and this sum added to the amount above shown to be required for maintenance of day schools, will give the additional sum to be provided annually for day schools on the Blackfeet Reserves and on the Reserves of the Sarcees, and for the proposed industrial institution, viz., $46,760 + $670 + $13,300 = $60,730.\n\nOn the Stoney Reserve, which is situated at Morleyville in this district, there are 153 children of an age to attend school and two schools are in operation. The number of children of school age would be sufficient to justify the establishment of two additional schools on this Reserve. The more advanced pupils of the day schools on the Reserve might be admitted to the Protestant industrial institution proposed to be established in the Blackfoot country.\nThe teachers of the day schools at present are paid at the rate of $300 each per annum. If the same be increased to $480, the additional amount required will be $180 \\times 2 = $360.00\n\nAnd should two more schools be established, the salaries of the teachers of the same at $480 each per annum will be $960.00\n\nAnd if residences be provided for the 2 teachers at present employed at say $300 each, the cost will be $600.00\n\nAnd for schoolhouses and residences for 2 new teachers at $500 each $1,000.00\n\nThe expense connected with feeding 158 children at $8 each per annum will be $158 \\times $8 = $1,224.00\n\nAnd with clothing the same number of children, $158 \\times $10 = $1,580.00\n\nCost of furniture and equipment with school material of the 2 new schools, at $100 each $200.00\n\nCost of prizes for the 4 schools, at $15 each per annum $60.00\n\nRepairs and renewal of equipment of 4 schools, at $50 each par annum $200.00\n\nThe total amount to be in the first instance provided will be $6,134.00\n\nFrom this sum should be deducted cost of buildings and furnishing $1,800.00\n\nAnd the result $4,334.00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for schools on this Reserve.\n\nIn the northern part of the District of Alberta, the first Indian agency north of Calgary is that of the Peace or Bear Hills, where we have five Reserves, with children thereon of an age to attend school to the number of 215, distributed as follows:\u2014On Sampson's Reserve, where there is one school in operation, 69 children; Ermineskin's Reserve, 31 children, and no school; Bobtail's Reserve, 25 children, without a school; Louis Bull's Reserve, 34 children and no school; Sharphead's Reserve, 56 children and one school. The number of children on the Reserves of Ermineskin, Bobtail and Louis Bull, where no schools at present exist, is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve, and the number of children (69) on Sampson's Reserve is sufficient to warrant the establishment of an additional school thereon.\n\nThe salaries paid the teachers at present employed in this agency averages, as elsewhere, $300 each per annum.\nShould it be decided to increase them to $480, the additional amount required to do so, in the case of the teachers at present employed will be $180 \\times 2 = $360.00\n\nAnd should 4 new schools be established, the salaries of 4 teachers at $480 each per annum will be $1,920.00\n\nThe cost of building residences for the two teachers now employed will be, at $300 each = $600.00\n\nAnd the cost of erecting schoolhouses and residences for 4 new teachers at $500 each = $2,000.00\n\nCost of furnishing and supplying school material to 4 new schools, at $100 each = $400.00\n\nCost of renewing supply of material and of repairs annually for 6 schools, at $50 each = $300.00\n\nCost of supplying a mid-day meal for 215 children at $8 each per annum = $1,720.00\n\nCost of clothing same number, at $10 each per annum = $2,150.00\n\nCost of prizes for 6 schools, at $15 each per annum = $90.00\n\n$9,540.00\n\nDeducting first cost of buildings and furniture = $3,000.00\n\nThe result = $6,540.00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for maintenance of day schools in this agency.\n\nThe adjoining Indian district, known as the Edmonton Agency, embraces 6 Reserves, having 209 children of an age to attend school, viz., on Pass-pass-chase's Reserve 60 children, on Alexander's 89, on Michel's 15, on Alexis' 30, on Enoch's 40, on Ironhead's 15.\n\nOn each of the Reserves of Pass-pass-chase, Alexander and Enoch there is a school; on those of Michel, Alexis, and Ironhead there are no schools. On the Reserve of Pass-pass-chase there is a sufficient number of children (60) of school age to warrant the establishment of an additional school.\n\nIf this school be established and a school on each of the three Reserves now without any\u20144 new schools will have to be provided for. And if the salaries of the teachers of the 3 schools now in operation be raised from $800 to $480 each per annum, the additional expenses to be provided for will be:\n\nIncrease of $180 to the salary of each of 3 teachers = $540.00\n\n4 new teachers, at $480 = $1,920.00\n\nFor residences to be provided for the 3 teachers at present employed at $300 each = $900.00\nAnd 4 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences at $500 each - - - - - 2,000 00\n\nFurniture and school material for 4 new schools, at $100 each - - - - - 400 00\n\nFor repairs to buildings and renewal of school material annually, at $50 each, for 7 schools. 350 00\n\nPrizes for 7 schools, at $15 each per annum - 105 00\n\nProviding mid-day meal for 209 pupils, at $8 each per annum - - - - - 1,672 00\n\nProviding clothing for same number, at $10 each per annum - - - - - 2,090 00\n\nTotal amount to be in the first instance provided $9,977 00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of buildings and of furniture - - - - - 3,300 00\n\nThe result - - - - - $6,677 00\n\nshows the additional amount to be annually provided for day schools in this agency.\n\nThe Saddle Lake Indian Agency comprehends the seven Reserves lying east of the Edmonton Agency, and they contain 250 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows: On Saddle Lake Reserve 30 children, Muskogawaties 23, Blue Quill's 13, Seenum or Pecan's, 112, Chippewayen's 31, Antoine's 30, Pee-ay-sis' 11. On three of these Reserves, viz., at Saddle Lake, Seenum's, Pee-ay-sis', there are schools in operation, on the other four Reserves there are no schools. The large number of children (112) on Seenum's Reserve makes it apparent that 3 schools instead of 1 should be in operation there. If therefore 2 additional schools be established on that Reserve and a school on each of the Reserves at present without any, provision must be made for 6 new schools, and estimating expenses on a similar basis to that recommended to be adopted in other agencies, the following provision will have to be made:\n\nTo increase 3 teachers' salaries from $300 to $480 per annum - - - - - $ 540 00\n\nTo provide salaries for 6 new teachers, at $480 - 2,880 00\n\nResidences for 3 teachers, at $300 each - - - - - 900 00\n\n6 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - - - - - 3,000 00\n\nFurniture and school material for 6 new schools, at $100 each - - - - - 600 00\n\nFor repairs to buildings and renewal of school material, at $50 each per annum, for 9 schools - 450 00\n\nPrizes for 9 schools, at $15 each per annum - 185 00\n\nProviding mid-day meal for 250 pupils, at $8 each per annum - - - - - 2,000 00\nProviding clothing for the same number, at $10 each per annum - 2,500 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance $13,005 00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of building and furniture - 4,500 00\n\nThe result - $8,505 00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of schools in this Agency.\n\nIn the 3 Indian Agencies whose school matters have been last under review the number of school children is 674, which number, allowing at the rate of 10 per cent for attendance at an industrial institution which it has been decided shall be established in the Peace Hills district, would give say 68 children for entry into that establishment. It is to be a Protestant institution\u2014the Roman Catholic Indians of the different Reserves having the benefit of the very excellent school at St. Albert for the industrial training and higher education of their children.\n\nIn the Onion Lake Agency there are 7 bands, having Reserves located as follows:\u2014Seecascooth's Band on Onion Lake, Kimoosayo's Band on Beaver Lake, Peometah-ah-soos' at Fort Pitt, Wee-nis-ta-coo-se-a-wa-sis' on Stoney Lake, On-ip-ow-hay-os' on Frog Lake, Pus-ke-ah-ke-we-nin'o's on Moose Lake, Kee-he-win's on Frog Lake. These Indian bands since the troubles of 1885 have been somewhat disorganized, and consequently they have not remained upon their Reserves; those of them, however, who were disposed to farm removed to the Sekaskooth Reserve, and the residue engaged in hunting. On the latter Reserve there are 70 children of an age to attend school, but there is no school in operation. Two schools might, with advantage, it is thought, be established for the benefit of that number of children.\n\nThis, if done, will involve for the salaries of two teachers, at $480 each, an expenditure of - $960 00\n\nTwo schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - 1,000 00\n\nFurnishing two schools and supplying material for the same at $100 each - 200 00\n\nProviding prizes for two schools, at $15 per annum each - 30 00\n\nRenewing school material and for repairs annually, at $50 for each school - 100 00\n\nProviding mid-day meal for 70 children, at $8 each per annum - 560 00\n\nClothing same number, at $10 each per annum - 700 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance - $8,550 00\n\nFrom which after deducting cost of buildings and of furnishing and equipping schools - 1,200 00\n\nThe balance - $2,350 00\nshows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of two schools on that Reserve.\n\nSome of the pupils when they become sufficiently advanced in their studies might be transferred from the day schools to the industrial school now in operation at Battleford.\n\nAttached to the Indian Agency at Battleford there are seven Reserves, viz., the Stonoys, having 37 children of an age to attend school, Red Pheasant's with 28 children, Sweet Grass having 48 children, Poundmaker's where there are 36 children, Little Pine's with 35 children, Moosomin's having 15 children and Thunder Child's with 41 children. On each of these Reserves, except Little Pine's, there is a school in operation. The number of children (35) on the Reserve of Little Pine is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school thereon.\n\nThe average salary paid teachers in this Agency is the same as that paid elsewhere in the North-West, viz. $300 per annum. And estimating the additional expenditure to be incurred in order to impart greater efficiency to the schools, the following statement will show the provision required to be made:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| To increase 6 teachers' salaries from $300 to $480 each, $180 \u00d7 6     | $1,080 |\n| To erect houses for 6 teachers, at $300 each                         | 1,800   |\n| For salary of 1 new teacher                                           | 480     |\n| New school-house and teacher's residence                              | 500     |\n| Furnishing and providing material for 1 new school                    | 100     |\n| To renew school material and for repairs annually for 7 schools, at $50 each | 850     |\n| To provide a mid-day meal for 285 pupils, at $8 each per annum       | 1,880   |\n| To provide clothing for same number, at $10 each per annum           | 2,350   |\n| To supply prizes for 7 schools, at $15 each per annum                | 105     |\n\n$8,615\n\nDeducting therefrom the first cost of building and furniture $2,400\n\nThe result $6,245 shows the additional amount to be annually incurred, in order to maintain the 7 schools of this Agency.\n\nIn the Duck Lake Agency there are 18 Reserves, and, so far as known, 357 children of an age to attend school on them, distributed as follows: On the Reserve of Attakakoop, 40; on Mistowasis, 34; Petequaqua's, 10; Beardy's, 81; Okemas', 16; One Arrow's, 18; Wm. Twatt's, 45; John Smith's, 85; James Smith's, 65; Che-keas-ta-pay-sin's (number not known); White Cap's, 15; Kermenootayo's, 45; Kopahawakemun's (number not known).\nOn each of the Reserves of Attakakoop, Mistowasis, John Smith and James Smith, a school has been established. On each of the 9 other Reserves there is no school, though with the exception possibly of that of Petequaqua, there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school.\n\nProceeding upon the same basis as in other Agencies, the amount required to increase the salaries of the 4 teachers at present employed from $800 to $480, $180 x 4, will be $720.00\n\nTo provide salaries for 9 new teachers, at $480 each per annum, $480 x 9 = 4,320.00\n\nFor residences for 4 teachers at present employed, at $300 = 1,200.00\n\nTo provide 9 new school and teachers' houses, at $500 for each school = 4,500.00\n\nTo furnish and supply material for 9 new schools, at $100 each = 900.00\n\nFor repairs and to renew material annually for 18 schools, at $50 each = 650.00\n\nFor prizes for 18 schools, at $15 each per annum = 195.00\n\nTo provide a mid-day meal for 357 pupils, at $8 each per annum = 2,856.00\n\nTo provide clothing for the same number, at $10 each per annum = 3,570.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance, $18,911.00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of building and furnishing = 6,600.00\n\nThe result = $12,311.00\n\nshows the additional amount necessary to be provided for the maintenance of schools in this Agency.\n\nIn the Pas Indian Agency there are 6 Reserves, with 230 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Grand Rapids of the Saskatchewan, 20; Chemewawin, 35; Moose Lake, 30; The Pas, 100; Pas Mountain, 80; Cumberland, 15. There is a school on each of these Reserves, excepting on that at Pas Mountain. On the Reserve at The Pas there are two schools in operation.\n\nEstimating for the schools in this agency, on the same basis as has been done for schools in other agencies, the following statement will show the additional expense involved:\n\nTo increase salaries of teachers at present employed from $800 to $480 each per annum, $180 x 7 = $1,260.00\n\nTo provide salary for teacher at Pas Mountain = 480.00\n\nTo provide houses for 7 teachers, at $800 each = 2,100.00\n\nAnd 1 school and teacher's house at Pas Mountain = 500.00\nTo furnish and equip school at that point - 100 00\nFor repairs and renewal of material annually for\n8 schools, at $50 each - - - 400 00\nPrizes for 8 schools, at $15 each per annum - 120 00\nTo provide mid-day meal for 230 pupils, at $8\neach per annum - - - 1,840 00\nTo provide clothing for same number, at $10 each\nper annum - - - 2,300 00\n\n$9,100 00\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of building\nand furniture - - - 2,700 00\n\nThe result - - - $6,400 00\nshows the additional amount to be annually incurred to maintain the\nschools of this agency.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nIndian school matters in this Province are in a very unsatisfactory\ncondition, very few schools being in existence, and those in operation are,\nfor the most part, not conducted in an efficient manner, nor are they kept\nregularly open. As a consequence of the very small size of many of the\nReserves in the Province, and the few families resident thereon, the num-\nber of children of an age to attend school on these Reserves is too limited to\njustify the establishing of schools thereon. If, therefore, the children in\nReserves so situated are to receive the benefits of education, the only feasi-\nble plan to adopt for the accomplishment of that object will be to group\nthe small Reserves as school districts, and to establish, at central points in\nthem, boarding schools of the primary class, at which the children of\nschool age would be educated.\n\nCommencing with the Cowichan Agency, which embraces the northern\nportion of Vancouver Island, thirty-seven Reserves are comprised therein,\nwith 480 children old enough to attend school. But, with the exception\nof the Roman Catholic Mission School, near the Comeakim Village, the\nChurch of England School on Kuper Island, and the Methodist School at\nNanaimo, there are no schools in operation in this Agency, with its 37 Re-\nserves and large number of children of school age.\n\nOn each of the following Reserves the number of children of an age to\nattend is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school, viz.: Cher-er-no,\nwhere there are 18 children, Songhees 36, Pauquachin 14, Tsart-ilp 14,\nClem-clem-a-late 20, Quamichan 45, Somenos 18, Lyach-sun 17. The Roman\nCatholic Mission School at Comeakim draws its pupils from the Reserves\nof Tsai-out, where there are 8 children of school age, Comeakim 8, Clem-\nclem-a-lats 20, Klenipsin 8, Koh-si-lath 6, Quamichan 45, Someno 18,\nHallet 5. But the aggregate number (118) of children of school age on\nthese Reserves is too many for one school to properly instruct, and it is\ntherefore submitted that, leaving to that institution the instruction of the\nchildren from the small Reserves, from which it at present draws some of\nits pupils, and who number together 35, a school might, with advantage, be established at each of the larger Reserves, as previously suggested.\n\nThe Church of England School on Kuper Island instructs the children from the Reserves at Ll-mal-che, where there are 4 children of school age, and Pen-e-la-luts, having 40 children.\n\nThe Methodist School at Nanaimo draws its pupils from the Reserve near that place, where there are 40 children of school age.\n\nOn the residue of the Reserves there are 72 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Sooke 7 children, at Esquimalt 5, at Malahat 2, at Tse-kaun 9, at Kil-pau-hus none, at Sica-meek 7, at Kne-leets 11, at Tsussie 10, at Sno-no-nus 6, at Quali-cum 5, at Pun-ti-ledge 6, at Comox 4, at Ga-li-a-no Island, Mayne Island, Haitch Point and Discovery Island 4. It will be observed that on none of these Reserves would the number of children warrant the establishment of a day school. One or two boarding schools of the primary class should therefore be established at some central point or points, in the selection of which the Indian Agent for the locality should be consulted.\n\nThe maximum salary paid teachers of Indian schools in the Province, based upon an annual allowance of $12 per capita for an attendance of 25 children, is $300.\n\nOwing, however, to the very small average attendance and the irregular manner in which the schools are kept, the salary usually paid does not exceed $200.\n\nThe industries, viz., fishing, seal hunting, and hop-picking, pursued by these Indians, occasion frequent and prolonged terms of absence of the families from their villages; and these methods of obtaining a livelihood are very successful, and it is, therefore, unlikely that the Indians would abandon them for any other, and these absences from the Reserves are, therefore, likely to continue.\n\nIt is difficult to suggest what course should be followed under the circumstances described to secure to the children whose names are, or may yet be, placed on the rolls of the day schools continuous instruction. The Indian heads of families who engage in fishing and seal hunting could scarcely be persuaded to leave their wives and children at home. The objection would probably be raised by the Indians, and which, it must be admitted, would be a proper one, that if their boys did not accompany them in their fishing and sealing expeditions they would fail to acquire a knowledge of industries so essential for their maintenance in the future. The women also obtain employment at the canneries in the cleaning and curing of fish, and their earnings are, therefore, also a considerable item in the family income.\n\nThe amount of remuneration paid to the teachers should, it is considered, be a fixed sum, and the amount of salary proposed to be paid teachers in other portions of the Dominion will not, it is thought, when the expense of living in this Province is taken into account, be regarded as excessive compensation notwithstanding that, as a consequence of the long absences\nof families from the villages, the schools may be closed for a considerable portion of the year. With a view to induce the children to attend school regularly when they are at home, prizes for regularity of attendance and for assiduity should be given those meriting the same. Residences for the teachers should also be erected, and a mid-day meal should be provided for the pupils. But owing to the long terms of absence of the children from the villages it is probable that no more than a supply of provisions for 8 months will be required. It is not thought that it will be necessary to provide clothing for the children attending day school in this Province as their parents are well enough off to clothe them.\n\nThe expense involved as respects schools in the Cowichan Agency will therefore be as follows:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries of 11 teachers, at $480 each per annum                      | $5,280.00 |\n| 8 new schools and teachers' houses, at $500 each                    | 4,000.00 |\n| Furnishing and supplying material for 8 schools, at $100 each        | 800.00  |\n| Repairs and renewing supply of material annually, at $50 each for 11 schools | 550.00  |\n| Prizes for 11 schools, at $30 each                                   | 330.00  |\n| Residences for teachers of 3 schools already established, at $300 each | 900.00  |\n| Supplying mid-day meal for 345 pupils for 8 months, at $5.32 each   | 1,835.40|\n\nTotal expenditure in the first instance: $18,695.36\n\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of buildings and furnishing schools: $5,700.00\n\nThe result: $7,995.36\n\ngives the total annual expense to be incurred for day schools in this agency.\n\nAnd if a central boarding school of the primary class be established as suggested, for the children of the smaller Reserves, who, as before stated, number in the aggregate 95\u2014the cost of such an establishment will be as follows:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost of building                                                     | $4,000.00 |\n| Cost of furniture and school material                               | 1,000.00 |\n| Cost of maintenance and tuition of 95 children, at $100 each per annum | 9,500.00 |\n| Cost of repairs and renewing material annually                       | 200.00  |\n\nTotal first cost: $14,700.00\n\nAnd deducting cost of building and furniture: $5,300.00\n\nThe result: $9,500.00\n\nshows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of the institution. And that sum, $9,500 + $7,955 = $17,455, will represent\nthe amount to be annually provided for the education of the Indian children of the Cowichan Agency.\n\nThe West Coast Agency of Vancouver Island comprises 18 Reserves, with 613 children of an age to attend school, but, with the exception of the 3 schools conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church at Kyuhaht, where there are 75 children of school age, Hosquiaht, where there are 46, and Ah-hou-saht, where there are 50, there are no schools in the agency; although on each of the Reserves, excepting 4, there is a sufficient number of children to justify the establishment of a school. Besides those on the 4 Reserves on which schools have been already established, there are children of an age to attend school on each of the following Reserves, and of the number stated after each:\u2014Chai-cu-les-aht, 28; Nooch-aht-i-laht and Eh-aht-ti-saht, 60; Moo-ach-aht, 44; Match-it-laht, 14; Kel-se-maht, 30; Cla-o-quah, 50; E-weh-nilc-caht, 49; Too-qu-aht, 7; Ou-aht, 49; Ow-chuh-dis-saht, 10; Tseshah and O-pitch-e-saht, 50; Nil-te-naht, 50; Pa-chee-naht, 10.\n\nThe methods followed by these Indians to obtain a livelihood are about the same as those of the Cowichan Bands. Consequently school matters in this Agency should be dealt with in a similar manner; and the expenses may therefore be similarly calculated\u2014that is to say:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries of 14 teachers, at $480 each                                | $6,720.00 |\n| Eleven new schoolhouses and teachers' residences                    |        |\n| at $500 each                                                        | $5,500.00 |\n| Furniture and material for 11 new schools, at $100 each             | $1,100.00 |\n| Repairs and renewing supply of material annually,                   |        |\n| at $50 each for 14 schools                                          | $700.00 |\n| Prizes for 14 schools at, $30 each                                  | $420.00 |\n| Residences for teachers of 3 schools already established, at $300 each| $900.00 |\n| Supplying mid-day meal for 572 children for eight months, at $5.32 per capita | $3,048.04 |\n\nTotal expenditure in first instance: $18,888.04\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of buildings and furniture: $7,500.00\n\nThe result: $10,888.04\n\nshows the total amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in the West Coast Agency. If a central boarding school of the primary class be established for the children of the smaller Reserves, who number 41, the expense connected therewith will probably consist of the following items:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost of building              | $2,500.00 |\n| Cost of furniture and school material | $750.00 |\nMaintenance and tuition of 41 children, at $100 each per annum - 4,100 00\nRepairs and renewing material annually - 185 00\n\nTotal first cost - $7,485 00\nDeducting cost of building and furniture - 3,250 00\n\nThe balance - $4,235 00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the institution and that sum, $4,235 + $10,883.04 = $15,118.04, represents the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of day schools and of a primary boarding school in this agency.\n\nParliament at its last Session voted an appropriation for the establishment of an Industrial Indian School on Vancouver Island, it was only calculated for the maintenance and instruction in industries of 25 children, and as a commencement it will probably be sufficient but it will be readily seen from the number of children of an age to attend school in the two agencies into which the Island has been divided, and the school affairs whereof have just been under discussion, that accommodation will be required for a much larger number of pupils; the aggregate number of children of school age in the two agencies being 958, the proportion at 10 per cent, which should be admissible to the higher school would give in round numbers 96 pupils, for whom provision should be made.\n\nThe expense involved in the same would therefore be:\n\nCost of building, supplying school material and furnishing the same - $10,000 00\nMaintenance, clothing, lodging, tuition and instruction in industries of 96 children, at $120 each per annum - 11,520 00\nRepairs and renewal of material annually - 1,000 00\n\nTotal - $22,520 00\nDeducting therefrom the first cost of building and furnishing - 11,000 00\n\nAnd the result - $11,520 00\n\nwill show the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the establishment and that sum, $11,520 + $24,200, being cost of maintaining day and primary boarding schools in the Cowichan Agency + $15,118.04, being cost of a similar service in the West Coast Agency will show the whole amount, $50,888.04, to be provided annually for the education and industrial training of the Indian children of Vancouver Island.\n\nThe Kwaw-kewlth Agency embraces all the bands and Reserves on the south coast of the mainland, and contains 333 children of school age, distributed among the 25 Reserves in the agency in the following manner:\n\nAt Ah-wah-koos 7, Ah-kwaw-ah-mish 14, Ah-wah-ut-tla-la 11, Ke-o-pe-e-no\nThe morals of these Indians are so depraved that in the opinion of the undersigned the only course to pursue, if their children are to be rescued from the path of infamy on which their wretched parents set them as soon as they arrive at years of maturity, will be to establish central boarding schools and to endeavor to induce the parents to allow their children, as soon as they are of an age to attend school, to be lodged thereat, educated, clothed and fed. The expense will be heavy\u2014but to establish day schools in such a community would be worse than useless, as the female children are used by their parents, so soon as they arrive at puberty, for purposes of traffic of the worst description, and the boys by the terrible example set them by their parents\u2014which it may be stated is the rule and not the exception with these Indians\u2014would become as depraved as themselves, notwithstanding all the instructions given them at a day school. If the proposition to establish boarding schools is approved of, the approximate expenses involved will be as follows:\n\nBuilding, supplying with school material and furniture, 3 boarding schools for 111 children at each, 333 in all. $30,000.00\n\nFor maintenance, including clothing and tuition of 333 children, at $120 each per annum. $39,960.00\n\nFor renewal of furniture and school material for each school at $800 each per annum. $2,400.00\n\nTotal of first expenditure. $72,360.00\n\nDeducting therefrom first cost of building and furnishing. $30,000.00\n\nThe result. $42,360.00\n\nwill represent the amount to be annually provided for education in the Agency.\n\nShould it, however, be considered advisable to establish day schools in this Agency notwithstanding the representations made respecting the morals of the people, each of the following Reserves would appear to have a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school. Ah-kwahah-mish, 14 children; Ko-se-ke-noo, 13; Klah-wit-sis, 18; Kwaw-waw-i-mich, 13; Kwick-so-te-no, 14; Mah-wa-lil-le-kul-lah, 19; Na-knock-to, 18; Noo-we-tee, 21; Ta-nock-teuch, 18; Tsah-waw-ti-neuch, 22; Waw-let-sum, 15; We-wai-ai-kum, 15; We-wai-ai-kai, 32.\n\nAt Nim-cush, where there are 24 children of school age, at We-wai-ai-kai, where there are 32, and at Kwaw-kewlith, where there are only 7, schools have been established by the Church Missionary Society. At the last named point a schoolhouse has been recently built.\nThe number of children of school age, on the Reserves above named, having on each a sufficient number of children of school age, but on which no schools have, as yet, been established, is 200, and on the 8 Reserves where schools exist, 63, making 263 children of an age to attend school. And the number of schools to be established, allowing one for each Reserve, would be 12. The expenditure involved would therefore be as follows:\n\nSalaries of 15 teachers at $480 each................. $7,200 00\n12 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each.................................................. 6,000 00\n3 teachers' residences, at $300 each, in connection with schools already established.......................... 900 00\nFurniture and school material for 12 new schools, at $100 each.................................................. 1,200 00\nFor repairs and renewal of material for 15 schools, at $50 each per annum...................................... 750 00\nPrizes, 15 schools, at $30 each per annum............. 450 00\nSupplying mid-day meal for 263 children for 8 months, at $5.82 each........................................... 1,399 16\n\nTotal sum to be provided in the first instance $15,019 16\nAfter deducting first cost of building and furniture 8,100 00\n\nThe result .................................................. $6,919 16\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided if day schools are established.\n\nThe children of school age on the smaller Reserves number 77, and if a central boarding school of the primary class be established for the education of these children, the following expenditure will have to be incurred:\n\nCost of building.............................................. $5,000 00\nCost of furniture and school apparatus.................. 1,000 00\nMaintenance and tuition of 70 children, at $100 each per annum.................................................. 7,000 00\nCost of repairs and of renewal of school materials annually....................................................... 270 00\n\nThe total sum to be provided will be.................... $18,270 00\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of building and furniture.................................................... 6,000 00\n\nThe result.................................................. $7,270 00\n\nwill show the amount to be annually provided to keep the institution in operation, and that sum, $7,270 + $6,919.16 = $14,189, represents the cost of education in the Kwaw-kewith Agency, should day schools and a primary boarding school be established.\n\nIn the New Westminster Agency there are 50 Reserves, having on them 464 children of an age to attend school. On each of the following the number of children of an age to attend school would appear to be\nsufficient to justify the establishment of a school thereon.\u2014Mission Burrard Islet, where there are 30 children of school age, Skwawmish, Howe Sound, having 30 children of school age, False Creek 12, Musqueam 16, Sarassen 18, Semi-ha-mo 18, Langley 14, Che-he-les 14, Pemberton Meadows 12, Che-am 14, Yale 13, Sec-halt 20, Sli-a-mon 22, New Westminster 14. The aggregate number of children of an age to attend school on these Reserves is 242.\n\nOn each of the following reserves the number of children of an age to attend school is too small to warrant one being established: Seymour Creek, where there are only 2 children; Capatano Creek, 8 children; No. 3 Reserve, Burrard Inlet, 7; Coymittam, 4; Ke-it-sey, 10; Whenack, 3; Mats-qui, 8; Sumas, No. 1, reserve 7; Sumas, No. 2, 8; Sumas, No. 3, 6; Ne-cam-en, 4; Syn-can, 4; Harrison River Mouth, 9; Douglas Lake, 10; E-mal-com, 8; Skuk-run-chuck, 9; Sknl-teen, 7; Sy-nah, 8; Sy-ne-hal-lo, 4; Hoy-n-put, 4; Assylets, 5; Sknay, 4; Skaw-kale, 5; Zach-y-yon, 6; Toylee, 5; Pop-cum, 2; Synnat-lete 5; Show-al-le, 6; O-ha-mille, 9; Hope, 11; En-a-woose, 8; Texas Lake, 6; Ruby Creek, 4; Trap-al-yer Flat, 4; Cla-hoose, 8; Waddington Harbor, 4. The aggregate number of children on these reserves is 222. Should it be decided to establish day schools on each of the 14 Reserves above enumerated having a sufficient number of children of school age on it, the following expenditure will have to be incurred:\n\nFor salaries of 14 teachers, at $480 each - $6,720 00\n14 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - 7,000 00\nFurniture and school material for 14 schools, at $100 each - 1,400 00\nRepairs and renewal of material annually for 14 schools, at $50 each - 700 00\nPrizes for 14 schools at $30 each per annum - 420 00\nSupplying mid-day meal to 242 children for 8 months, at $5.32 each - 1,287 44\n\nTotal amount to be provided - $17,527 44\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of buildings and furniture - 8,400 00\n\nThe balance - $9,127 44\n\nwill show the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in this agency. And should central boarding schools of the primary class be established for the education of the children on the 36 smaller reserves the number of children on each of which is not sufficient to justify the establishment of a day school, two at least of such boarding schools would be required, the number of children so situated being 222.\n\nAllowing one-half of that number to each establishment the expenditure on account of the same would be:\n\nBuildings, school material and furniture for 2 boarding schools with 111 pupils at each, 222 in all - $20,000 00\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 222 children, at $120 each per annum - 26,640 00\n\nRenewing furniture and school material and for repairs for each school, at $800 each per annum - 1,600 00\n\nTotal of first expenditure - $48,240 00\n\nAnd deducting first cost of building and furniture 20,000 00\n\nAnd the balance - $28,240 00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the two establishments, and this sum, $28,240 + $9,127.44 = $37,367.44, represents the full amount of the cost of educating the children of this agency.\n\nThe Kamloops and Okanagan Agencies consist of 16 Reserves, having 252 children of an age to attend school on them, distributed as follows:\n\nOn the Reserve at Hal-a-at, 29 children; at Haltkum, 30; at Ku-a-at, 15; at Chu-chu-way-ha, 10; at Ke-re-me-us, 12; at Na-a-ih, 30; at N-kam-iss, 6; at N-kam-ap-lix, 25; at Ny-is-kat, 4; at Pen-tic-ton, 23; at Quin-sha-satin, 5; at Quis-han-aht, 9; Shen-nos-quan-kin, 10; Ap-a-ha-min, 33; A-pal-lam-cheen, 10; Yoht, 1.\n\nFrom the foregoing enumeration it will be observed that only on five out of sixteen Reserves is there a sufficient number of children of school age on each to justify the establishment of a school, viz., at Na-a-ik, where there are 30; Ke-re-me-us, 12; N-kam-ap-lix, 25; Pen-tic-ton, 23; Ap-a-ha-min, 33. The total number of children of school age on these 5 Reserves is 123. The expenditure for day schools will therefore be as follows:\n\nFor salaries of five teachers, at $480 each per annum - $2,400 00\n\nFive new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - 2,500 00\n\nFurniture and school material for 5 schools, at $100 each - 500 00\n\nRepairs and renewal of material annually for 5 schools, at $50 each - 250 00\n\nPrizes for 5 schools, at $30 each per annum - 150 00\n\nMid-day meal for 123 pupils for 8 months, at $5.32 each - 654 36\n\nTotal amount to be provided in first instance - $6,454 36\n\nAnd deducting therefrom first cost of building and furniture - 3,000 00\n\nThe balance - $3,454 36\n\nwill be the sum annually required for the maintenance of day schools on those five Reserves.\n\nThe number of children of school age on the smaller Reserves is 129 in the aggregate, and as on none of these Reserves is there a sufficient number to justify the establishment of a day school two central boarding schools of the primary class whereas these children may be educated should be established. The expense connected herewith will be approximately as follows:\nBuildings, school material and furniture for 2 institutions with 65 pupils at each, 130 in all $12,000 00\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 130 children, at $120 each per annum - 15,600 00\nRenewing school material and furniture, and for repairs annually, $800 for each school - 1,600 00\n\nTotal of first expenditure - $29,200 00\nAnd deducting therefrom first cost of building and furniture - 12,000 00\n\nThe balance - $17,200 00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the support of the institutions; and this sum $17,200 + $3,454 36 = $20,654.36, give the whole cost of education in the two agencies.\n\nIn the Williams' Lake or Lillooet Indian Agency there are 23 Reserves, with 192 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u20146 at Alexandria, 10 at Quesnelle, 8 at Soda Creek, 11 at Williams Lake, 40 at Alkali Lake, 2 at Dog Creek, 17 at Canoe Creek, 5 at Clinton, 6 at Pavillion, 18 at Fountain, 8 at Bridge River, 8 at Lillooet, 6 at Cayoosh, 4 at Pesh-ilqua, 0 at Chenook, 3 at Col-o-hu-ps, 1 at Elias (Seaton Lake), 8 at Mission (Seaton Lake), 5 at head of Seaton Lake, 6 at head of Anderson Lake, 5 at foot of Anderson Lake, 5 at High Bar, 10 among the Chilcotin bands.\n\nThis enumeration shows that only 3 Reserves in the agency possess a sufficient number of children of school age on each to justify the establishment thereon of a dayschool, viz., at Alkali Lake, where there are 40 children; Canoe Creek, 17; and Fountain, 18. The expenditure for day schools will therefore be as follows:\n\nFor 3 schools and teachers' houses at $500 - $1,500 00\nFor furniture and school material for 3 schools, at $100 each - 300 00\nFor renewal of supply of school material and for repairs annually, at $50 for each school - 150 00\nPrizes annually for 3 schools, at $30 each - 90 00\nSalaries of 3 teachers, at $480 each per annum - 1,440 00\nMid-day meal for 75 children for 8 months, at $5.82 each - 399 00\n\nTotal first cost to be provided - $3,379 00\nDeducting therefrom cost of building and furniture - 1,800 00\n\nThe balance - $2,079 00\n\nshows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of dayschools in this agency. And if for the education of the 117 children on the smaller reserves 2 central boarding schools are established, the expenditure to be incurred will be as follows:\n\nFor buildings, school material and furniture for 2 institutions with 59 pupils at each, 117 in all. $11,000 00\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 117 children, at $120 each per annum 14,040 00\nRenewal annually of furniture and school material and for repairs, $800 for each school - 1,600 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance $25,640 00\nDeducting first cost of building and furniture - 11,000 00\n\nThe balance - $14,640 00\n\nrepresents the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the two institutions, and this sum, $15,640 + $2,019 = $17,719, will be the sum annually required for the education of the children of the Williams' Lake Agency.\n\nThe North-West Coast Agency, which extends to the southern limit of Alaska\u2014and includes the Queen Charlotte Islands to the south, Port Simpson, Metlakatla, the Nass and Skeena Rivers to the north\u2014owing to certain untoward circumstances has not as yet been for a sufficiently long time under any one Agent to admit of correct statistics as to the number of children of school age being obtained, but the number must be large, and at Metlakatla, Lakalsap on Nass River, and at Port Simpson schools are in operation.\n\nThe same system as that proposed for the other Indian agencies of the Provinces should be established in this Agency, so soon as correct statistics shall have been obtained, viz: The inauguration on Reserves having a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school of day schools, and for the children of smaller Reserves a central boarding school of the primary class.\n\nAn industrial institution might also with great advantage be established in this Agency.\n\nRecapitulation.\n\nAdditional cost to be incurred in the first place:\n\nOntario .......................................................... $178,128 00\nQuebec .......................................................... 49,059 00\nNova Scotia ...................................................... 32,975 00\nNew Brunswick .................................................. 27,017 00\nPrince Edward Island ........................................... 1,921 00\nManitoba and Keewatin ....................................... 100,582 00\nNorth-West Territories ......................................... 270,952 00\nBritish Columbia ................................................ 237,186 52\n\nTotal ............................................................. $892,620 52\n\nAdditional amounts to be provided annually:\n\nOntario .......................................................... $120,828 00\nQuebec .......................................................... 32,859 00\nNova Scotia ...................................................... 20,425 00\nNew Brunswick .................................................. 16,917 00\nPrince Edward Island .......................................... 1,561 00\nManitoba and Keewatin ........................................... $60,582.00\nNorth-West Territories ........................................... $158,462.00\nBritish Columbia .................................................. $184,032.60\n\nTotal ........................................................................ $545,206.60\n\nThe above figures show that a very large increased expenditure will require to be incurred, should effect be given to the suggestions contained in this report. It is, however, submitted that the results to be attained are beyond in importance mere monetary considerations, for therein lies the solution of the Indian question.\n\nBut even from an economic point of view it is apparent that the expenditure incurred in educating and training the children would be a good investment and that it would be repaid to the country with compound interest by the conversion of the descendants of a people, a large number of whom are at the present time a source of expense, into profitable citizens, who, instead of being supported from the revenue of the country as their people are at present, would contribute largely to the same.\n\nGive me the children and you may have their parents, or words to that effect, were uttered by a zealous divine in his anxiety to add to the number of those whom his Church called her children. And the principle laid down by that astute reasoner is an excellent one on which to act in working out that most difficult problem\u2014the intellectual emancipation of the Indian, and its natural sequel, his elevation to a status equal to that of his white brother. This can only be done through education of the children. Nor must its full accomplishment, even with that important lever zealously applied, be looked for in one generation, nor in two, nor even in three generations, though vast strides in each of those epochs towards the desired end will doubtless be made. Only by a persistent continuance in a thoroughly systematic course of educating (using the word in its fullest and most practical sense) the children, will the final hoped and long striven for result be attained, but that it will, ultimately, with God's blessing on the efforts made to effect the same, be accomplished, does not, in the opinion of the undersigned, admit a doubt.\n\nThat the country owes it to the poor Indian to give him all that will afford him an equal chance of success in life with his white brother, by whom he has been supplanted (to use no stronger expression) in his possessions, goes without saying, and the gift for which we pray on his behalf, with a view to the discharge of this just debt, is the education of his children in such a way as will put beyond question their success in after life.\n\nAll respectfully submitted.\n\nL. VANKOUGHNET,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nGeneral View\n\nIn considering the question of what measures are best adapted to the system, there are, it appears to me, several points which require attention. The first is the question of the relative importance of the various parts of the system. It seems to me that the most important part is the central authority. This should be strong enough to control all the other parts, but not so strong as to make them useless. The second point is the question of the distribution of power among the various parts of the system. It seems to me that the distribution should be such as to give each part a fair share of the power, but not too much. The third point is the question of the efficiency of the system. It seems to me that the system should be efficient enough to carry out its purposes, but not too efficient as to make it difficult to change.\n\nWith these points in view, I propose to consider the following questions:\n\n1. What is the best form of central authority?\n2. How should the power be distributed among the various parts of the system?\n3. How can the system be made more efficient?\nGeneral View\n\nIn considering the question of what remains yet to be done to perfect the system, there are, it appears to the undersigned, three points which require special consideration, viz., the character of the tuition at present afforded Indian children and how it can be improved; the matter of the attendance of the pupils; and the best method to adopt in order to secure to the pupils in after life the greatest possible benefit as the result of the education afforded them.\n\nHalton Facombe\n\nThinks the scheme a very good one.\n\nRev. J.B. Fraser, Leith, Ont., says:\n\n\"With the cooperation of all the Christian Churches\" the problem of educating the Indians should be solved in 15 or 20 years, but moral development is essential to success.\n\nBishop Grandin\u2014\n\nHe is convinced, he says, that the plan was \"seriously misconceived,\" but he insists that all schools should be denominational and he thinks it difficult to give general rules for Indian schools of different nations.\"\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land (Eng. Ch.) expressed his deep sympathy with the whole scheme, his sense of its absolute necessity, of a great part of it, and his hope that it may gradually be accepted & brought into operation.\n\nRev. John M. Leau, M.A., Alberta, strongly approves of the Report, \"with a few exceptions.\"\n\nRev. W.W. Shepherd, Principal, Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, is pleased with the proposal to so greatly improve the educational work among the Indians.\n\nRev. Wm. A. Burman, B.D., Griswold, Mass., thoroughly concurs in the general principles, & thinks that \"such a policy\" will result in untold good to the Indians.\n\nRev. Alfred J. Hall, Alert Bay, B.C., thinks the Report has \"thoroughly entered into the need of our Indian children.\"\nThe Bishop of Algoma\nThinks the suggested improvements would very largely add to the efficiency of the schools.\n\nRev. E. H. Wilson says:\n\"On the whole I entirely approve of & endorse your proposal.\"\n\nRev. R. Ashton\nSuggests \"that a visit to the Board Schools of the Six Nations or a conference with the managers of Indian schools would greatly aid... in working out the object.\"\n\n\"Bishop Whipple, Minnesota\nThinks the Report comes a desire to grapple earnestly with the work.\"\n\nRev. J. A. Gilfillan, Minnesota,\nThinks the scheme \"comprehensive & admirable.\"\nHon. John Schultz\u2014\nConsiders \"the present effort as the dawning of a better day.\"\n\nHe deals in a general way with the whole Indian Question; & in his opinion what is required for the betterment of its Indians is:\n\n1st. \"More liberal payments... for a term of years instead of for life\"\n\n2nd. \"Instead of money annuities... indispensable articles...\"\n\n3rd. \"The payment of native 'Farm Instructors'; as Indians not knowing English or French cannot fully benefit by teachings of Farm Instructors\"\n\n4th. \"160 acres to each individual instead of 160 to each family\"\n\n5th. \"Reservations to be situated near some well known fishing ground &c. far...\"\n\"removed from centres of\nwhite population or much\ntravelled highways, as\npossible\"\n\n6th \"ample instructions\nin our language\"\n\n7th The reservation for\nschool purposes of\none section (640 acres) out\nof each surveyed township,\n\"with the case of school\nlands\".... for if 1/8 of all\nlands are reserved for the\nschools of the incoming\nrace, why not reserve\n\"... 36th for the school purposes\nof those who were late\nits owners\"\n\nProfessor Woodo\n\nThinks that, if one or\ntwo government inspectors-\nmen thoroughly conversant\nwith school matters-\nwere appointed to visit\nall the agencies so as to\n\"get a thorough understanding\n\"of the whole subject; they\n\"would prove of invaluable\n\"assistance in rounding\n\"up the plans\" sketched\n\"in the report; and he adds\n\"If a good man who\n\"understood English & the\n\"teaching of it\u2014and me who\n\"understood French & the\n\"teaching of it were at\n\"once appointed, they would\n\"mature plans in a year\n\"to overcome most, if not\n\"all, the difficulties...\n\"indicated\"\nW. H. Lums, Indian Agent, Quamichan, B.C.\n\nThinks it is\nnecessary to inaugurate a\nsystem of education different\nfrom the present.\n\nJ. C. Phipps, Indian Sup't, Inuvikwaniq, says:\n\"It would be difficult\n\"for any one taking an interest\n\"in the improvement of the\n\"condition of the Indians to fail\n\"to approve of \"the general scope\n\"and tenor\" of the Report.\n\nHonble E. Dewdney -\n\nFavors the extension of the Indian School System\n\nshines not be \"forced\", and he prefers Primary Boarding Schools to Day Schools.\nAs respects the first point, it has been felt and it is generally acknowledged to be the fact, that owing to the very small salaries offered teachers of Indian day schools, it is impossible to secure the services of competent and desirable persons for those positions. The highest salary paid to teachers of such institutions is $350 per annum; and the average salary $240 per annum. This, it must be admitted, is altogether inadequate compensation for even a partially educated or ordinarily competent teacher. But this is not by any means the only disadvantage under which teachers of Indian day schools labor. As a rule, there is no residence for the teacher attached to the school. The teachers have consequently either to reside in the schoolhouses and provide for themselves, which is, obviously, very objectionable for several reasons, to go long distances to their lodgings, or to put up with very uncomfortable lodging and indifferent board at Indian houses.\n\nTeachers of Indian schools and their families, if they have any, labor under the very serious disadvantage of being debarred of all these privileges, not the least among which is the society of white people, being obliged to associate wholly with Indians, as the reserves are generally situated at considerable distance from white settlements.\n\nTeachers, therefore, should be made as comfortable in their surroundings as the Department can reasonably make them under these very untoward circumstances.\n\nThe undersigned begs to offer the opinion that not less than double the amount of the average salary now paid the teachers of Indian day schools should be provided by Parliament, and that the Government should charge itself with the responsibility of supplying proper accommodation for the teacher (and, if married, for his family) in the vicinity of the school. It is desirable, in the case of day schools, that the schoolhouse and the teacher's residence should not be in one building; but that the latter should be within easy distance of the former.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be well to not give the maximum of salary, viz., $480, at once to a teacher, but to have a scale of salaries, commencing with $350, to be increased as attendance at the school increases, allowing so much per head for the number in attendance over a certain percentage of the possible attendance; also to make the teacher an allowance for each pupil who passes the qualifying examination in his or her class for admittance to an Industrial Institution.\n\nWere these modifications adopted, the Department would have no trouble in securing the services of competent and desirable persons as teachers of Indian schools. At present it has very often to put up with teachers who, while they may hold certificates of competency, are, for other reasons not desirable appointees; as to take an Indian school, except in the case of persons actuated by a missionary spirit, must be under the disadvantageous circumstances at present connected with the position the dernier resort of a teacher, and anyone doing so has generally the suspicion attached to him that he or she had not been a success as a teacher of a public school or it would not have been abandoned, considering the superior advantages enjoyed in connection therewith as regards emolument, the advantages of society for themselves and families, house accommodation and the ordinary luxuries of life.\nFather Lacombe\u2014\nConcurs in suggestions and thinks, if they be carried out, there will be no difficulty in securing good teachers. He suggests that the scale of salaries begin with $400.\n\nRev. J.B. Fraser, Leith, Ont.\nConcurs in suggestions and suggests that teachers be, as far as possible, appointed on the recommendation of some missionary society, and they are bound, he says, be actuated by a missionary spirit.\n\nBishop Grandin says:\nTeachers, unless with a missionary stamped be married, & married or unmarried $300 is not sufficient salary. He agrees as to the disadvantages incident to the position of teacher among the Indians, and acts\nthe necessity of paying them better & providing them with accommodation. No teachers house should, he says, be separated from, yet not far away from the school.\n\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land thinks that in order to secure properly qualified teachers it will be necessary to make the minimum salary $500, for the appointment of a teacher to advance a quarter's salary & pay his expenses to the Reserve, & afterwards pay his salary \"promptly every quarter\" independently of any returns or reports\u2014(incompetence must be dealt with otherwise); to improve the school buildings so as to make them warm, comfortable & healthy, & to supply them with proper fittings & adequate school material.\nHis Lordship approves of the suggestion as to providing a \"residence or decent lodgings\" for the teacher.\n\nRev. John M. Leau, M.A., says:\n\n\"$480 is not sufficient to secure good teachers. Salaries should be paid not 'in attendance' only, but should include progress in 'study'; '$480 should be given 'in attendance & from $150 'or Inspector's Report.'\n\nThe procuring of fuel, he says, \"very often devolves on the teacher & missionary; it should be supplied by the Indian Dept.\"\n\nRev. Wm. A. Burman, B.D.\n\nAgrees as to the necessity of paying teachers higher salaries. Teachers, he says \"should be properly certified by the proper Board of Education; in such cases 'should receive 'for ten months worth at least...\"\n\"$400. To this should be added a bonus for success of attendance over the average, together with a fixed grant for every child who passes successfully an examination in 4th Standard work,\" as is done in the Provincial Schools of Manitoba. The bonuses, he says, should not be allowed to exceed $100 in one year.\n\nThe furnishing of accommodation for teachers is, he says, a necessity; but he fears that the estimated cost of erecting dwelling houses for teachers is far too low. \"Whenever a garden is practicable,\" he says, \"an acre should be set apart & fenced for the use of the teacher & scholars.\" To avoid contention it should be clearly understood by all concerned that the teachers are entitled to hay & grazing privileges for his horse teams.\nas he has learned from experience that such matters \"cannot be too carefully arranged.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma says teachers should receive \"fair remunerative salaries\" & be provided with \"adequate accommodation\" either beside or over the school.\n\nThe Bishop of Beka kokwan thinks it would be advantageous to have the teacher's residences in same building as the school.\n\nHe suggests that teachers of English Church schools be paid, \"through our agent,\" a uniform salary of $400 per an. & \"that the balance saved by giving this sum instead of $480... be paid each year to Emmanuel College.\" (see page 57)\nBishop Whipple, Minnesota,\n\n\"Permanence in the\nrelation of teachers is a\nnecessity,\" he says, \"and you\ncannot keep your teachers\nunless they are made\ncomfortable.\"\n\nRev. J.A. Gilfillan\n\nConcurs as to increasing\nthe salaries of teachers &\nsupplying them with proper\naccommodation.\n\nHon. John Schultz\n\nConcurs as to the\nnecessity of paying teachers\nbetter & of providing them\nwith proper accommodation.\n\"The missionary spirit,\" he\nsays, \"cannot be counted upon.\"\nHe doubts whether \"really\ngood married teachers\"\ncan be got under $450 per an.\nand other conditions being\n\"equal they should be\nmarried men.\"\nProfessor Wood\n\nThinks the providing of accommodation for teachers and the increasing of their salaries good ideas.\n\nTeachers should not, he says, receive $480 at first. \"They ought in every case to start with $300,\" which should be increased by \"$50 per ann. for each year.\" Practical service until \"day $700 was reached.\"\n\nIndian Agent Lomas\n\nThinks the suggestions as to improving the condition of teachers very good, particularly the suggestion that they be given an allowance for each pupil who passes the examination for entrance into industrial schools.\n\nIndian Sup't Phipps says:\n\n\"with increased salaries and free dwelling houses provided...\"\n\"The position of teacher will be more eagerly sought after by a superior class.\"\n\nHighly certificated teachers in this province are not required for \"primary or day schools,\" as the children, when a certain standard is reached, \"can be removed to Industrial Schools.\"\n\nThe suggestion as to \"a scale of salaries\" he says \"is undoubtedly a good one.\"\n\nHon. E. Dewdney recommends the payment of $400. for an average attendance of 12 pupils & a capitation grant for each unit of attendance over such percentage of the number of children of school age upon the reserve, so the Commissioner may determine, up to a limit to be also determined by the Commissioner; and that the Commissioner be the judge\n\"of the circumstances that\ndictate the advisability of\nwithholding part of a teacher's\nsalary or closing a school.\"\nHe endorses the suggestion\nas to providing proper\naccommodation for teachers\nin the N.W.T. especially,\nhe says, the condition of\nteachers should be improved\nif good ones are desired.\nAttendance of Pupils\n\nWith regard to the second point, viz., the ensuring of better attendance at the day schools, it is well known that, as a rule, Indian children are extremely irregular in their attendance.\n\nThis arises from several causes, chief among which may be stated the indifference of the parents in the matter of the education of their children and the absence of the exercise by the parents of proper authority over them to compel attendance. But there are other causes which occasion failure in this respect, such as the want of sufficient clothing during the inclement seasons of the year, also the distances from the school at which some of the Indian families reside, rendering it very often impossible for many of the children in the winter season or on wet autumn or spring days to attend. Then there is the difficulty connected with the children being fed while attending school, e.g., a child residing a considerable distance\u2014say 3 or 4 miles\u2014from the school, leaves its home, say, at 8 a.m., to attend school, and, with the well-known improvidence of Indians, no luncheon or dinner has been prepared by its parents for the child to take with it. As a consequence the child remains fasting if it stays the day through, and after repeating this process a few times it becomes discouraged and ceases to attend. Again if the child should return to its home at dinner time, in the generality of cases there is no dinner ready, or if in exceptional instances such should be the case, the child after eating its meal can scarcely be back at school in time for the afternoon session. Moreover, even in the case of children who have not these drawbacks of long distances and the want of proper clothing or food to hinder constant attendance, it is most difficult to induce them to attend regularly. The Department has hitherto found itself unable to offer inducements for such regular attendance by presenting prizes as rewards for the same owing to the inadequate means at its command, which are insufficient even for the remunerative payment of teachers and the proper equipment of the schools, repairs to school buildings, &c., &c. It would, however, cost but very little more to provide prizes for presentation to pupils who by punctual attendance and application to their studies should merit the same. In addition to these inducements, the further one of a meal at mid-day should be offered the pupils; for under even the most favorable circumstances in Indian families, it is not always possible for the children to obtain sufficient food. The meal at the school might consist of a plate of oatmeal porridge with syrup and a couple of biscuits. Such food would be economical, nourishing and the material could be easily provided and prepared and served without much trouble.\n\nAs regards clothing, the undersigned would favor the adoption of a regular uniform for the children attending day schools, to be provided in the first instance by the Department but to be charged with the consent of the Indian parents, in the case of bands having invested funds at their credit or drawing annuity, to the share of interest or annuity payable to the child until the amount advanced is repaid to the Department. There is no doubt that arrangements could be made with a clothing house to provide a cheap, warm uniform for winter and a suitable one for summer use at very reasonable rates.\n\nAs before stated, the distance at which Indian families live from the school being often a serious hindrance to the regular attendance of the children, to remedy this the undersigned is of opinion that no school should be further distant than two miles from the home of each child; and in the case of large Reserves where there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify it, as many schools as would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the band should be established, estimating the attendance...\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo the Deputy Minister Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 19th March 1887\n\nFrom what I have been able to gather in the way of information on the subject of a midday meal for Indian School children in Canada consisting of oatmeal porridge with syrup I conclude that the average cost per pupil would not exceed 20 cents per week of five days or 4 cents per day equal per head to about $1.00 per school year of say 200 days or about $48,000.00 per annum for an approximate number of 6,000 children.\nat each school at not more than 40 pupils; and the school to be within two miles of the home of each pupil.\n\nThe undersigned is also of the opinion that among the duties of the teachers that of looking after absentees from school should be included, and that they should be required to make a return to the Department, at the end of each month, of all absent pupils, and the cause of absence in each case, and the return should state what steps the teacher took, by visiting and advising the parents, to ensure attendance on the part of the absentees. It may be alleged as an objection that the Teachers would not have sufficient time between the closing of the school and night to accomplish this duty. To meet this objection the undersigned would recommend that instead of Indian schools closing as they generally do at the hour of 4 they should be allowed to close at 8 p.m., in order to give the teachers sufficient time to make the necessary enquiries relating to absentees.\n\n**Father Lucumbe -**\n\nConsiders irregularity of attendance the real cause of non-success of schools.\n\nHe suggests that tea be added to the mid-day meal & that rice be given instead of oatmeal porridge. He points out that nothing is said about the preparation of the meal, but supposes it will be prepared by the teacher assisted by the pupils.\n\nHe thinks that six hours of school is too hard on the pupils, & that for the first two or three years four hours a day would be sufficient.\nThough he is opposed to the employment of coercion, he thinks that Indians who do not care about the education of their children should be \"less considered by the Dept.\" and the agents, he adds, can be \"of great help in that way.\" He suggests, too, that a reward in the shape of clothing be given to those Indians who regularly send their children to school.\n\nRev. J.B. Fraser:\n\nThinks larger inducements should be offered Indians to locate themselves within reasonable reach of \"the school house.\"\n\nHe mid-day meal, he considers, \"a very good suggestion. Very cheap & wholesome food,\" he says \"and easily prepared\" and \"if cooked in a double pot...\"\nwould require no attention\nafter it was set on the fire\n& could be cooked in the same\nfire as the school was\nwarned with\n\nAt to the uniform, he\nsays, that so much is being\ndone by missionary organizations\nin supplying Indian children\nwith winter clothing that\nwith a little more system &\nenterprise the children might\nbe clad without Govt help.\n\nIf children are to be\nclothed & partially boarded\nat day schools, their being\nallowed to continue pupils\nshould, he says, be\n\"conditioned on a certain\n\"average attendance monthly\n\"(unless in special cases) &\n\"reasonable rate of progress in\n\"study.\"\n\nBut \"as regards food\n& clothing,\" he says, \"the main\nobjection to both suggestions\nso that they tend to the further pauperization of the race which should be avoided as far as possible.\n\nIn his general remarks he says:\n\n\"If possible it should be made well worth while for the parents to send their children to school, & for the children to learn.\"\n\nBishop Grandin\u2014\n\nAs to the number of schools necessary, he thinks the plan excellent but impossible of realization, as the Indian habitations are so isolated that it is impossible to place the schools in centres accessible to all.\n\nHe agrees as to the advisability of giving a mid-day meal & prizes to ensure attendance, & urges the necessity of clothing the children, particularly in winter.\nNotwithstanding what may be done, he adds, it will be difficult to ensure regular attendance, as the Indian children like to roam & their parents like to have them in account of the services they render, and the father insists on having his sons with him on the hunt so that he may teach them. The only way he sees of overcoming the difficulty is having the children \"boarders entirely,\" and he doubts the feasibility of that.\n\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land concurs in the suggestion as to the quick-dry meal & the uniform, & thinks that \"nothing less will bring about the required result\" & that the \"System ought be gradually introduced.\"\nRev. John McLean, M.A.\n\nThinks the methods adopted to secure attendance must differ in different places.\n\nOne of the chief causes of non-attendance, he says, is the monotony incident to there being but two classes. Where the attendance is good, he says, \"a second female teacher should be employed. The lady teacher 'could teach' during cooking; the male teacher 'should have' a small garden attached to the schoolroom which the boys could work an hour a day. Prizes should be given to those proficient in agriculture, 'farming, cooking to'\n\n\"A female gymnasium,\" he thinks, \"would be a strong factor in increasing the attendance.\"\n\n\"Visitation by teacher\" would be a good thing, he says; but he \"would make the hours...\"\n\"much shorter - say from\n10 to 12 & 1 to 3\"\n\nHe thinks the mid-\nday meal & the uniform\ngood suggestions, but, he adds,\nthe clothing should not be\nworn during school hours,\nas the clothes would be\ndestroyed & in many instances\nstolen or soiled if taken\nhome.\n\nRev. W.W. Shepherd says\n\"I fear the kind of\ndinner you propose would not\nbe satisfactory in quantity\nor quality.\"\n\n\"If the standard of\nschools is elevated,\" he says,\n\"the number might be\nreduced & have central\nschools graded with two or\nthree teachers. For example\none central school in Oneida\nwith two teachers could do\nall the work.\"\nRev. Wm. A. Burman, B.D.\n\nThis \"mid-day meal\" will be a great help in securing regular attendance. The amount named for this purpose is very small,\" he says. It would possibly be well to arrange that one third the children's rations should be handed over to the school during operation, so that those who did not attend would actually benefit thereby.\n\nThe idea of an uniform is \"an excellent one,\" he says, for in addition to other advantages it would be easy to become the property of young Indians. In this connection he asks if the Department would not consent to pay the cost of transporting from the nearest Railway Station to the School of articles of clothing sent by charitable persons to the Indians, as\nas the missionaries have often to incur heavy expense in that way.\n\nFrom 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. is, he thinks, \"quite long enough for school work,\" so the teachers will often require the rest of the day to cook up a breakfast.\n\n\"To avoid the difficulty of reaching children whose parents have built too far from the school-house,\" he says, \"sheds be made to have houses built nearer a common centre in the future.\"\n\nRev. A.J. Hale - of 185.\n\nConsiders the mid-day meal \"most necessary\"; but \"who\" he asks is to prepare \"to carry this away?\" - not \"the teacher?\"\n\n\"By all means, he says, \"have a uniform\u2014it is most taking to the Indian mind.\"\n\"The visiting & advising\nof the parents is perfectly useless,\" Mr. Hall says. \"They are\nthoroughly ignorant of the\nbenefits of education &\nthink we have minister\nmotives in being so\nanxious to teach their\nchildren. Make the teaching\nattractive\u2014teach them to\nsing bright songs\u2014in winter\nbe sure to have a warm\nschool\u2014and the children\nhe wishes will attend often\nagainst the wishes of their\nparents.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma\nTo secure regular\nattendance, the schools, he\nsays, should be well\nequipped & prizes should be\ngiven strictly according to\nMerit. It would be well,\nhe thinks, to have uniforms\nfor summer & winter, but,\nif possible, he adds, they\nShould be worn only during \"school hours.\" The midday meal should be given, \"if feasible,\" but who is to prepare it? he asks.\n\nRev. E. J. Wilson does not approve of a uniform for pupils attending day schools, as \"it would soon be torn to rags & loaded with vermin.\"\n\nPrizes, he says, should only be \"given in the same way as at other schools.\"\n\nA mid-day meal, he thinks, might be given \"in certain exceptional cases.\"\n\nHe is \"utterly opposed to anything tending to foster in the Indian the savage spirit.\" He thinks there would be no need of special inducements \"if only thorough good teachers could be got who would do their...\"\n\"work thoroughly & take\nreal interest in it.\"\n\n\"The way to gain the Indians\nis not,\" he says, \"through the\nmedium of prizes or other\ninducements. They will\ntake what is given them\n& yet have little or no\nrespect for the donor\u2014\nindeed they have a secret\ncontempt for those who try\nto win them over by gifts.\nWhat we want is to be\nthoroughly honest with them,\nto treat them as intelligent\nbeings, not as ignorant paupers,\nto convince them that we are\ntheir friends seeking their\nwelfare; in this way only,\nhe believes, can the Indian\nbe influenced.\n\nThe Bishop of Protestantman\n\nEmphasizes the necessity\nof having better & more\nthoroughly equipped schools\nhere. He considers\nThe suggestion in regard to encouraging regular attendance \"good will\" to the exception of the suggestion that teachers should come after students. This he thinks \"unpracticable.\" The only thing to do, he adds, \"is for the Dept't to require attendance of children of school age. This is absolutely necessary & should be at once put into effect.\"\n\nBishop Whipple says:\n\n\"The lunch at noon is the only way you can secure the regular attendance of the Indian children,\" and the suggestion of an early closing of the schools is very wise.\n\nRev. J.A. Gillilan\n\nHe mid-day was tried, he says, with good\n\"Results\" on the White Earth Reservation, Minnesota.\n\n\"Corn-meal mush & syrup\" help,\n\"no more heating in winter.\"\n\nTeachers, he thinks,\nshoved back after absences &\nmake the proposed return.\n\nHon. John Schultz\n\nConsiders the suggestions\nas to the uniform mid-day\nmeal good, and the food\nsuggested \"healthful & cheap,\"\nbut, he says, it \"should be\n\"varied in localities in which\n\"animal food, fish, wild rice,\n\"vegetables admit of an\n\"easily prepared soup.\"\n\nIt is well, he thinks,\nthat teachers should cast\nafter absences as suggested\nthe remark as to the\ndistance schools should be\nfrom Indian homes should,\nin his opinion, \"not apply to\n\"Reserves where the Indian houses\n\"or lodges are near together.\"\n\"and the distance not greater\n\"than proposed\"\n\nProfessor Wood\n\nThinks the mid-day\nmeal \"the very thing.\"\nThe uniform, he says,\n\"shoved if possible... be worn\n\"only at school & during\n\"school hours.\"\n\nSchool hours, he says,\n\"should be \"from 9 a.m. until\n\"1:30 p.m. with 30 minutes\n\"off, from 11:30 to 12,\" for\n\"luncheon.\"\n\nIndian Agent Thomas states\nthat the Cowichan Indian\nCouncil have passed a by-law\nto the effect that every child\non the Reserve between the\nage of 7-14 years shall\nattend school at least\n15 days in each month,\nand parents or guardians not\ncomplying with this regulation\nare liable to fine, the only\nacceptable plea being (1)\nDickness, (2) non-residence on the Reserve \"the necessary time during the month\" (3) no school being open within a distance of three miles.\n\n\"Curing,\" he says, \"to severe epidemics... this by-law has not yet been properly carried out,\" and so he is unable to say how it may work.\n\nMr. Tomas considers the idea of a regular uniform \"a good one.\"\n\nWilliam Supit Phipps considers that cooking after absences is \"a very important part of a teacher's duty.\"\n\nThe mid-day meal, he thinks, \"an excellent suggestion.\" As to the uniform he anticipates objections on the part of the parents to the cost being charged to the child's annuity, the fear...\nthat \"the ordinary share of\n\"annuity\" would not be\n\"insufficient.\" He is of opinion\nthat \"if payment either\n\"whole or in part were made\n\"contingent upon attendance\n\"for a stated number of days\n\"at school,\" it \"might\n\"tend to check irregular\n\"attendance.\"\n\nPrizes for regular\nattendance would, he says,\n\"have a good effect.\"\n\nMr. Chipps emphasizes\nthe necessity of making every\neffort to insure regular attendance.\n\nHon. E. Dewdney says\n\n\"School facilities\n\"should certainly be provided\n\"for all children of a school\n\"age as soon as the Indians\n\"are prepared to avail\n\"themselves of them\"; but the\nextension of the school systems\n\"must be kept in pace...with\n\"the gradual advancement of\n\"The Indians' willingness to avail themselves of educational advantages.\" He questions whether all the day schools proposed are required in view of the facts\u2014(1) \"that a large part of the Indian population is so scattered that schools cannot be established for them; and (2) that many of the suggested schools would be almost entirely unattended owing to Indian apathy or prejudice.\"\n\nHe thinks, however, \"that 15 instead of 20 pupils should be considered sufficient to warrant a day school being established.\"\n\nHe \"entirely\" agrees \"with the mid-day meal plan,\" and concurs in the suggestion as to the uniform; and he thinks that teachers should look after absences & make the proposed returns.\nPrimary Boarding School.\n\nThere are many reserves, notably in British Columbia, so sparsely populated that the number of children, of an age to attend school on each Reserve, would not justify the expense necessary to establish a school. The undersigned submits that central boarding schools, of the primary class, should be established to meet the educational requirements of bands so situated. And it is submitted, that as occasionally in each band children are left without natural protectors, owing to the death of their parents, to meet such cases, this primary institution might be made of sufficient dimensions to accommodate say 100 pupils.\n\nRev. J.B. Fraser\u2014\n\napproves and adds\n\nit is worthy of extended experiment as well as the Industrial School. It would be a great point gained if every youth could spend seven three years\u2014say from 15 to 18\u2014entirely away from the influence of the Indian \"home.\" In these schools, he says, children should be taught to work.\n\nAn Indian School?\n\nHence, that Central Boarding Schools may also be required in the North West.\n\nProfessor Wood says\u2014\n\n\"A good idea.\"\nIndian Agent James, etc.\n\nHe writes that owing to the wandering habits & the Indians & the smallness of many Reserves, the central boarding school is \"the only kind...that could be expected to succeed\"; and he suggests that orphans be \"first admitted.\"\n\nHonble E. Dewdney\n\nConsiders the remarks as to Primary Boarding Schools are \"also true of the N.W.T. He is indeed of opinion that in order to lead to satisfactory result such schools must take the place of day schools.\"\nWith reference to the third point, namely, the perfecting of the education of Indian children, and ensuring lasting beneficial results from the education given them, the undersigned submits that the education of Indian children should be commenced with essentially primary methods, such as the kindergarten and object lesson systems, and as the mind of the child develops it should be advanced in its studies until finally, in the case of pupils who have distinguished themselves by their intelligence and progress in the day schools, they should be drafted into schools of a higher order, such as industrial boarding schools, where they could be trained in the knowledge of some industrial pursuit, as well as receive instruction in higher educational subjects, and after they have completed a course at such an institution the Department, through its agents, should charge itself with the responsibility of obtaining for each pupil who has acquired a trade, employment at the same, outside of the Reserve of the band, and the annuity share of the youth thus placed, provided the band of which he is a member receives annuity money, should be charged with the cost of furnishing him with the necessary tools wherewith to follow the same successfully, the first cost being borne by the Government, or by the capital fund of the Band, if it has funds at its credit and recouped by deductions from the annuity of the Indian mechanic, until all shall have been repaid. A somewhat similar system might be followed in the case of Indian boys who may acquire, at an industrial school, a knowledge of agriculture, to provide them with the necessary implements, cattle, &c., to work land successfully. And as respects Indian females educated at these institutions, when they become adepts at tailoring or housewifery, employment might be obtained for them also, in clothing establishments, in tailor shops, as dressmakers or as domestic servants, as their qualifications may best adapt them for.\n\nShould the views above enunciated be approved of and should it be decided to give practical effect to them, it would necessitate an increase in the number of day schools as well as of industrial institutions or of the accommodation in the latter establishments; and each of the industrial institutions should be supplied with pupils selected from the schools on a certain number of Reserves grouped for the purpose; and children from these Reserves should not be allowed to attend any other industrial school than the one assigned their Reserves. Thus each industrial institution would form a central school of a superior class for the advanced pupils attending the day schools on the Reserves included in the group from which the pupils would be drafted for that institution. The reasons above urged for increasing the number of educational institutions of either class will be more clearly manifested from the review which the undersigned proposes to make of the schools at present in operation and the facilities for education at present afforded as well as the additional facilities which it is desirable should be extended to the Indian youth upon the different Reserves in the various Provinces and Territories of the Dominion.\n\nFather Lacombe\u2014Pupils, he says, should only be drafted into schools under the auspices of a\nChurch to which they belong.\n\nEmployment for graduates of Industrial Schools should, he says, be procured through the officials of the institutions.\n\nHe insists on the necessity of teachers & agents being of the same religious denomination as the majority of the Indians.\n\nOf encouraging associating Christian missionaries.\n\nRev. J.B. Morse\u2014\n\nConsiders all the suggestions as to perfecting the system excellent; but he adds, in his general remarks, that Education is not the largest factor in the elevation and civilization of the Indians, but that there must be \"above all the inspiration of true religion.\"\n\n\"Every teacher,\" he says, \"should not only be a moral but a religious man & have a practical acquaintance with farming\" & in the Industrial Schools the\ntrades should be taught by practical men. He lays stress on the necessity of the boys being \"taught practically the elements of farming,\" gardening & every part the routine of housekeeping \"the farm\" as the vast majority must live by agriculture. To encourage diligence & application, he suggests that every pupil be promised a half section of land on reaching a certain standard, with the proviso that the land could not be sold within a specified time or till after certain improvements were made. Education, he says, will be of but little help to the Indian youth without \"the spur of the necessity of self-support & the prospect of owning & accumulating the results of his industry on land that is his own in fee simple.\"\nTo be successful in training the children something must be done for the improvement of the parents, and he thinks that it might even be possible to educate many of them \"to the point of self-support by an arrangement that would entitle them to hold land in severalty with the option of receiving the equivalent of their Gov't allowance in cash in condition of certain work done to improve the land allotted to them.\"\n\nBishop Grandin\n\nHis experience of industrial school training is that, though the children learn to speak & write fairly well English & French & to live by the labor of their hands, when they leave the School they \"hire themselves\" for the most part for wages,\n\"Spend their money as they earn it & have nothing ahead when they marry,\" they thus become poor & useless creatures. Those who return to their Reserves are for a time the laughing stock of their nation. In spite of their instruction they are less skilful in many things necessary for the Indians. They feel themselves despised; they are humiliated; they strive to become savages again; & they often succeed only too well.\" The most successful results have been attained by marrying the girl graduates to white men, he says, & in the schools in his diocese they generally do that. He is convinced that the benefits of industrial training is nullified on the graduates returning to the Reserves, & that they can have no\ninfluence for good on the uncivilized Indians, unless they be sufficiently numerous to form a distinct community.\n\nThis plan is that the Indians educated in industrial institutions be assisted to settle on special Reserves near the schools, their teachers to retain a certain directing authority, a limited number of their relatives & friends to be permitted to live with them; and His Lordship's opinion is that, in order to attain success in educating the Indian race, this plan or one akin thereto must be adopted by the Gov't.\n\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land,\n\nAlways doubted the efficacy of sending graduates of industrial schools back to their Reserves after they may have been given a taste\nfor something very different. The Indian youths should, he thinks, be \"left free to decide their future after being educated,\" as thus \"many of the best perhaps would be drafted into ways of independence,\" and \"since would return to the Reserve probably a sufficient number to exercise the elevating power hoped for.\" He thinks it would be a pity not to give the Indian boys a chance of entering the professions; & he suggests that if an Industrial School be established in Manitoba under the auspices of the English Church, two or three of the boys, between twelve & fourteen years of age, might be drafted into St John's College School, & that \"to encourage this... a grant of $200. a head might be given if...\"\n\"The Church authorities could\n\"raise the rest, or even\n\"something might be done,\n\"if the \u00a3100- were merely\n\"transferred,\" he added\u2014\n\"but I think the scheme\n\"would be certainly practicable\n\"if \u00a3200- were given as a\n\"kind of scholarship of an\n\"honorable character.\"\n\nThe selection of pupils\nfor the industrial schools,\nhe says, \"would, if the schools\n\"were popular & successful,\n\"be a great stimulus to\n\"regularity of attendance,\n\"diligence & good conduct in\n\"the Reserve schools.\"\n\nIf the proposal as\nregards industrial schools\n\"seem too extensive,\" his\nlordship says, \"the nearer\n\"they can be approached the\n\"better.\"\n\nRev. John McLean, M.A., says\u2014\n\nThe kindergarten system\nwould need a training school\nfor teachers, or properly\ncertified teachers from the\nkindergarten training schools;\nthe object lesson system is now\nin use in many Indian schools.\nThe idea of founded\nschools** is a good one**\n\"English only,\" he thinks,\nshould be taught. An\nauthorized list of books should\nbe drawn up by the Indian\nBoard of Education; but he\nadds that he hopes the\nCanadian Gov't, while seeking\nCompulsory Education &c.,\nfor the elevation of the Red Race\nby means of learning English,\nwill never make the mistake\nmade lately by the Gov't of the\nUnited States [in] enforcing an\norder compelling all children\nto attend the Gov't schools &\nthere to learn English only, thus\ninterfering with the work done\nfaithfully by the Churches.\"\nThe early age at which Indian girls marry, he says, \"precludes the possibility of any entering Industrial Institutions.\"\n\nRev. Wm A. Burman, B.D., says:\n\nArrangements should be made to have sewing & knitting taught by the wives of teachers. The expense would be slight, & after awhile the Indian girls would be able to make their own clothing.\n\nHe highly approves of Industrial Schools, & thinks that in such institutions the most effective educational work will be done. He suggests that \"in drafting pupils for these schools preference should be given to orphans & the children of deserted women,\" and that \"it will be found necessary to follow the example of the...\"\n\"U.S. Gov't in paying\ntransport expenses in\nbringing pupils from Reserves\nto Industrial Schools.\" These\nexpenses, he says, \"while not\nexcessive\" are greater than\ncould well be borne by the\nfunds of such institutions.\"\n\nHe \"heartily endorses\"\nthe \"suggestion with regard to\nthe investment of the annuities\nof children\" (Mr. Burman must\nrefer to the proposition to\nprovide Indians youths who\nhave learned a trade with\ntools & to charge the same\nto their share of their Band's\nannuity). And he suggests\nthat arrangements be made\nfor their receiving a sufficient\nnumber of cattle from the\nReserve Band to give them\na good start in farming\nwhen they are ready to\nstart on their own account.\"\n\nRev'd\nRev. A. J. Hall\u2014\n\nConcludes from his experience in British Columbia that much labor is lost unless the child's education is carried far enough to assist him to earn his living.\n\nMost of the children, he says, \"have latent powers which only require educating.\"\n\nHe has seen many Indians in the service skill as steam mechanics; and his sawmill, he says, \"is now run by four Indian lads, the fruit of the boarding school.\"\n\nThe Gov't, he thinks, will \"not wisely in starting so soon as possible the proposed Industrial schools.\"\n\nAs to the Indian girls, he says, they \"are married at twelve years of age\" and \"are too vain foolish ever to consider to act as domestic servants.\"\nThe Bishop of Algoma\u2014\nAs to Industrial Schools, his opinion is\nthat \"all that is needed\nis, first, the enlargement\n& better equipment of the\nInstitutions already\nestablished, and, secondly,\nthe assignment to each\nInstitution of a specified\narea from which exclusively\nit is to draw its supplies\nof children already\ntrained in the preparatory\nSchools in that area.\"\nRev. E. H. Wilson\nthinks that effectual\nwork can only be done\nthrough the medium of\nInstitutions; and, in his\nopinion, the day schools\nshould be left pretty much\nas they are. & whatever\nfunds are to be expended now\n... should be expended mainly\nin the erection & maintenance\nof Boarding Schools or \"Institutions\"\n\nMr. Wilson's plan is the establishment of four large central Institutions\u2014one for the Roman Catholics, one for the Presbyterians, one for the Methodists, one for the Church of England\u2014each Central Institution to have 3 or 4 Branch Homes scattered through the Country. This would, he says, be more economical than the scheme proposed in the Report, more satisfactory from a religious point of view, and more fruitful in good results.\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan says:\n\n\"There is no better way of raising the tone of the Indians than by encouraging the boys to look forward to the time when the...\"\n\"knowledge they acquire at school will enable them to teach their own people.\"\n\nSpeaking of the schools of his own church, he says:\n\n\"I want the ordinary schools to feed the Industrial School [Battleford] & the Industrial School the College which has been established for the special benefit of Indians \"Lands\", viz., Emmanuel College, Prince Albert.\n\nIf the suggested assistance (see page 13) is given this College, he agrees \"to employ a thoroughly competent teacher to train each year a certain number of pupils sent there from the Battleford Industrial School, as the College is intended specially for the training of native teachers.\"\n\nThe system of grading outlined in the Report is,\nLe says \"good, but... will require trained teachers\" & schools well equipped.\n\nBishop Whipple says:\n\nThe \"suggestions as to district day schools & the advanced pupils being drafted in boarding schools is wise.\"\n\nThough the medium of all instruction must be the tongue understood by the Indians, he emphasizes the necessity of giving particular attention to the teaching of English.\n\nRev. J.A. Gilfillan\u2014Believes that no Indian School should devote the whole day to book learning. Half the day should be given to teaching the Indians how to work with their hands, how to farm & to garden, & how to use their powers for their\nTeach the boys \"the English language alone in the schools\u2014no Indian.\"\n\nMr. John Schultz says\u2014\n\n\"The whole boy should be educated,\" and so \"Indian children... need much exercise\" it should be given them \"in the way of light work commencing even with primary instruction.\"\n\nThe selection of pupils for Industrial Schools etc., \"are matters so affected by surrounding circumstances that at least at present no arbitrary rule should be decided upon.\"\n\n\"Every effort should be made\" to obtain employment for graduates of Industrial Schools \"should be made,\" he says, but \"without actually committing the Dept. to the obligation,\" and\nin the matter of supplying them with outfits \"assistance should be voluntarily rendered by those in charge of the Indian children...but the committee of the dep't to promise to do this right make them insist on it as a right\"\n\nIn Dr. Schulz's opinion the most economical & effective way of dealing with the question of Indian education is to educate the children entirely in Industrial Schools; for they would not eat much more at three regular meals than at one when the others are scanty & problematical, the clothing supplied would last three times as long, and the cost of teaching would be \"far less per capita,\" while the children would receive sixteen hours\n\"Of civilized instruction\ninstead of a few hours... half at\nleast of which is lost in the\nsubsequent time of each day.\"\nProfessor Woods\n\nThinks the kindergarten\nobject lesson systems &c. should\nbe employed.\n\nThe plan of drafting\nportfolios for industrial schools\nis, he says, \"very good.\"\n\nThomas Hart, B.A., F.C. I.M.,\nIndian Teacher at the Pao.\n\nThinks best results\ncan be obtained from Boarding\nor Industrial schools, but he\nthinks it enough to teach the\nordinary subjects of a common\nschool education, such plain\nuseful work as would most\nbenefit them in becoming\nthrifty settlers.\n\nAs incentives to\nindustry offer such prizes,\nhe says, as \"a comfortable\nhome on their Reserve for...\"\n\"any who had shown their\nefficiency to support it\u2014\nlet assistance be given in\nputting in their first crop\netc., but let them hold\nsuch a home in trust for\na year or two until they had\nproved themselves able and\nwilling to keep it up, after\nwhich it might be given\nto them absolutely, subject\nto provisions against\nalienation before a certain time:\nShould any show\nspecial aptitude for teaching\nhe thinks, they should be\nspecially trained for a year\nor two with a view to\ntheir becoming teachers\nunder the Department\"\n\nAdrian Sup't Phipps\u2014\n\nThe suggestion as to\nobtaining employment for\npupils who have acquired a\ntrade is, he says, a good one;\nbut he thinks that those\nwho remain on their Reserves should be assisted in that way. It is very desirable, he says, that those who have given their attention to agriculture at the schools should be provided with implements etc., as suggested.\n\n\"As a rule,\" he states, \"Indians have a great disinclination to sever themselves from the associations connected with their Reserves.\"\n\nHon. E. Dewdney\n\nIs of opinion that day schools cannot be \"as effective instruments in Indian education, and subsequent civilization, as boarding schools of the primary order;\" and that where it can be \"done to advantage, day-schools should be merged into boarding schools.\"\n\nIn support of this opinion he\nsays that in addition to other advantages, boarding schools would ensure \"regular attendance & the removal of the unsalutary influences of home life\" both essential to the education of Indian youth.\" And he adds, speaking relatively, that boarding schools \"will prove to be far the more economical of the two methods, so well do they combine productive of lasting benefit to the children.\"\n\nWith reference to the scheme for perfecting Indian Education, Dr. Dewdney approves of the primary method suggested. Industrial institutions should be \"led up to,\" he says, but as older boys can be more readily managed when at a distance from their...\nparents. As many such must be taken in hand, he thinks it would not be wise to limit certain Reserves to certain schools, particularly in the Northwest where so few Industrial Schools exist. He thoroughly endorses the principle of looking after & finding employment for educated boys & girls; but, he adds, great care must have to be exercised in extending aid of any description to them.\n\nBishop D'Herbomez\u2014\n\nSpeaking of British Columbia says that our Industrial Schools will be of benefit to the majority of the Indians of that Province (see page 144)\nInspection of Schools,\nFormation of School Boards, etc.\n\nA system of regular and efficient inspection, by competent persons specially qualified, should be instituted. In the older Provinces such a system exists. The Provincial School Inspectors do this work for the Department. But in the newer Provinces and Territories there is no such inspection, the Indian Agents only visiting the schools occasionally. A Board of Trustees for each Reserve, to consist in part of the most intelligent Indians, and of the missionary and Indian Agent, should be formed. The returns from the schools should be made at least monthly, instead of as at present, quarterly. Examinations should be held by the teachers at the end of each quarter, and a faithful record of the same kept. Certificates as to progress and conduct should be regularly given pupils.\n\nFather Lacombe\nsuggests that the work of inspection be left in the hands of the Indian agents.\n\nRev. J.B. Frazer\n\"Suggestions all good\"\n\nRev. John M. Sean, M.A.\nThinks the suggested Board of Trustees would be partial & inefficient, & suggests the creation of \"an Indian Board of Education composed of men well versed in the subject, and if possible having some experience, appointed by the Indian Commissioner, etc. duties of this Board to be similar to those of Provincial Boards of Education.\"\n\"Nothing satisfactory,\" he says, \"will be done until there is an efficient system of inspection,\" & regular inspectors should be appointed as \"inspectors of white schools\" know very little about Indians.\n\nRev. Wm. A. Burman, B.D.\n\n\"Immediate attention,\" he says, should be given to the inspection of schools; he suggests the arranging of districts of a size to admit of an inspector visiting \"each school during the season of travel.\" The inspector might give the remainder of his time to receiving and tabulating returns.\n\n\"The Inspector,\" he says, \"in conjunction with the Inspector of agencies & the Superintendent of Education for the Province, should arrange for the appointment & removal of teachers & lay down a\n\"Programme of studies suitable\nto the particular needs of the\nschools. Such an officer\nshould be experienced in\neducational matters, & should\nreceive the usual salary\nof school inspectors\u2014$1200.\nper. an., with office & travelling\nexpenses.\" Such an officer,\nhe adds, would \"be able to\nrender good service in drafting\nchildren for the industrial schools.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan\nconsiders competent\ninspectors desirable; & he\nsuggests that Archdeacon\nJ.A. McKay & Rev. J.W. Irvine\nwould be \"in every way\nqualified to inspect the\nEnglish Church Schools in\nSaskatchewan\u2014the former\nto include in his inspection\nthe Industrial School at\nBattleford.\n\nHe suggests the\nsuggestion as to Board of\nTrustees is \"unpracticable\" in the North-west.\n\nHon John Schultz says\u2014\n\n\"Inspection is an 'necessary, & more so, in the case of Indian schools as in the case of white schools.\"\n\nProfessor Woods\n\nEmphasizes the necessity of having all Indian schools inspected by a thoroughly competent man or men appointed by the Dominion Gov't. Provincial inspectors or Indian Agents cannot, in his opinion, be expected to do the work of inspection as it ought to be done; and so \"the Dominion pays the money, an Officer should be appointed by [the Dom. Gov't] to report on the way in which it is expended,\" and \"a good man would soon improve things most materially.\"\nIndian Sup't Phipps\n\nConsiders the system of inspection in vogue in his superintendency inefficient,\n\"as the inspectors live at a distance & inspections are\n\"all made in summer\"\nwhen \"the attendance is\n\"in its worst stage\"\n\nHumboldt County says:\n\"True tests ought work\n\"on one or two Reserves in the\n\"N.W.T. The experiment ought\n\"be a good one. A wise agent\n\"to few advanced Indians\n\"might do much to abolish\n\"prejudice to education.\"\nSeparation of the sexes:\n\nIt is desirable, in the case of Reserves having more than one school upon them, that when it is practicable\u2014which will be the exception\u2014the sexes should be divided, that is, that there should be a school for boys and another for girls.\n\nProfessor Wood says\n\n\"Certainly, if possible.\"\nDenominational Control of Schools.\n\nIt would be preferable, were it possible, to have all these industrial institutions non-denominational, and in so far as Protestant Indians are concerned, there would probably be little or no objection to non-denominational schools; the Rev. E. F. Wilson, a clergyman of the Church of England, has expressed his willingness to make his institutions non-denominational; but the Roman Catholic Indians would undoubtedly be prevented by their clergy from allowing their children to attend any other than Roman Catholic institutions.\n\nFather Scambe says\n\nIn all cases teachers should be of the same religious denomination as the pupils, and even agents should be of the same faith as the majority of the Indians over whom they are placed. \"Let the Indians be free...to embrace the denomination they like,\" and \"give full liberty & encouragement to Christian missionaries.\"\n\nRev. J. B. Kroese - 8070 -\n\nThe cooperation of all Christian Churches should be enlisted to secure attention to moral development \"without which all the...\"\n\"intellectual development\n\"possible will fail of\n\"accomplishing the result\n\"desired.\"\n\nBishop Grandin\n\nDrives on all schools\nDiscrimination both day & boarding\u2014being\nNon-denominational. \"Experience,\" he says, proves that these\n\"non-sectarian schools are\noften the most sectarian\"\nand \"public or non-sectarian\nschools are impossible\"\n\nRev John McLean\n\nHopes the work done\n\"faithfully by the Churches\"\nwill not be interfered with\nby the Gov't \"compelling all\nchildren to attend the Gov't\nSchools\"\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma says:\nThat if the scheme\noutlined in the Report\ncarries \"with it of necessity\nthe 'undenominationalising'\nprocess ... great difficulty\n\"will be encountered\" in connection with the English Church Institutions at Sault Ste. Marie. He states that it is neither the province of himself nor Mr. Wilson to deal with these institutions in the way of making them non-denominational, as they \"are the property of the Diocese of Algoma\" and derive their \"subsistence very largely from funds contributed by Church members.\" How far either he himself or the Church \"generally\" would be willing to surrender the control into the hands of the \"Gov't has yet to be ascertained,\" he says, \"as the question has not been discussed.\" All those who have expressed an opinion on the matter\u2014save Mr.\nWilson\u2014were \"unfavorable\n\"to any such change\"\nRev. E. H. Wilson\u2014\n\nIn a letter, dated 27th\nJanuary 1887, outlining\na scheme for the extension\nof his work at Sault Ste\nMarie, Mr. Wilson expressed\nhis willingness \"to yield\n\"place... independence\" and\n\"to become a servant of the\n\"Government\" and implicitly under\n\"their direction\" if the\nGov't would carry out\nhis plan. He added \"I am\n\"willing that the Institution\n\"Should become non-denominational\n\"in so far that pupils not\n\"belonging to the Church of\n\"England be allowed to attend\n\"their own place of worship\n\"in town & to be visited by\n\"their own ministers\u2014provided\n\"only that the Institution\n\"continue to be distinctly\n\"Protestant & that the whole...\"\n\"Bible always be a text book in the school\"\n\nIn a letter to the Sup't General, dated 30 Oct '87, Mr Wilson says, in regard to the Report, \"I agree with Mr Vankoughnet in regard to the desirability of Protestant institutions being non-denominational to the following extent. I think if an institution is under Presbyterian rule the services & teaching should be Presbyterian\" and so will the Church of England & other bodies. \"But at the same time if any persons attend who do not belong to the Church represented at the Institution they should be allowed, if they wish to do so, if found convenient, to attend their own place of worship. He, however, suggests, in another part of the same letter,\nas a better way of dealing with the question of Indian Education, the establishment of Central Institutions under control of the leading religious bodies, with branches or feeders scattered through \"the country\", which \"would\", he thinks \"be more satisfactory from a religious point of view\" as each denomination would thus be represented in all parts of the country & each \"have one substantial centre\". In his letter to the D'j Sup't General, giving his views on the Report, Mr Wilson iterates the foregoing plan, and says it is \"more likely to give satisfaction both to the missionaries and the Indians, & so more likely to be successful\". He adds: \"I think if you divide up the country...\"\n\"... and oblige Indian children whose parents are Presbyterian or Methodists to go to a Church of England Institution; and vice versa, there will be trouble. He objects on the same grounds to the institutions being made denominational what he proposed, he says, was that pupils attending his schools \"belonging to other denominations should be allowed to attend their own place of worship, but that Church of England services would be continued as usual,\" and that is what he \"would suggest in the case of all Protestant institutions established or assisted by Government.\" He goes on to say that it would be a great mistake to discourage those who have been making it their life work to care for and teach the...\"\n\"Indians, and it must\nbe remembered that in\nevery instance this has\nbeen done from religious\nmotives; the bond that\nunites the teacher & taught\nis religion, & a religion of\nsome definite form which\nhas become dear not only to the\nteacher but also to the taught.\"\n\"The religious feelings of the\npeople must,\" he feels sure,\nbe respected, & they must\nnot be in any way forced to\nhave their children brought\nup under other teachings\nthan that which they approve.\"\nEvery encouragement, he says,\nshould be given to those who\nare engaged in this work of\ncivilizing & educating & christianizing\nthe Indians, as those who\nhave been the longest\nliving with them probably\nknow best how to deal\nwith them. The Dept.,\nHe says, \"by taking things into their own hands & making their own rules about everything, they very likely succeed in producing more order & system than at present exists,\" but he doubts \"very much whether it will result in success.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan says:\n\n\"In view of the fact that certain schools are in missions conducted by the Church of England, & that several of them were carried on entirely by the Church for years before it didn't had anything to do with them, I desire to exercise control of them, i.e., to appoint the teachers & superintend their work. This of course we have hitherto done in the case of most of them.\"\nBishop Whipple says:\n\"I cannot interfere with the denominational schools.\"\n\nRev. J.A. Gilfillan\nThinks sufficient prominence has not been given in the Report to the necessity of religious education, without which \"mere intellectual furnishing will not make the Indian more powerful for evil.\"\nHe \"would have belief in God, in religion, taught as the foundation of all the most essential things\u2014no matter whether taught by Roman Catholics or the various missions of Protestants.\" He would have \"Christian teachers & Christian schools,\" no \"godless teachers, no matter how bright intellectually, are worthless & their work a failure.\"\nBrother D'Herbomez\n\nStrongly urges the necessity of having the B.C. Industrial School under denominational control.\n\n(See pg. 144)\nEstimate of Expenditure Required for Improved System.\n\nAdditional cost to be incurred in the first place:\n\n- Ontario .......................................................... $178,128 00\n- Quebec ......................................................... 49,059 00\n- Nova Scotia .................................................... 32,975 00\n- New Brunswick ............................................... 27,017 00\n- Prince Edward Island ..................................... 1,921 00\n- Manitoba and Keewatin ................................... 100,582 00\n- North-West Territories .................................... 270,952 00\n- British Columbia ............................................ 287,186 52\n\nTotal ........................................................................ $892,620 52\n\nAdditional amounts to be provided annually:\n\n- Ontario .......................................................... $120,828 00\n- Quebec ......................................................... 32,559 00\n- Nova Scotia .................................................... 20,425 00\n- New Brunswick ............................................... 16,917 00\n- Prince Edward Island ..................................... 1,561 00\n- Manitoba and Keewatin ................................... 60,582 00\n- North-West Territories .................................... 158,662 00\n- British Columbia ............................................ 134,022 60\n\nTotal ........................................................................ $545,208 60\n\nThe above figures show that a very large increased expenditure will require to be incurred, should effect be given to the suggestions contained in this report. It is, however, submitted that the results to be attained are beyond in importance mere monetary considerations, for therein lies the solution of the Indian question.\n\nBut even from an economic point of view it is apparent that the expenditure incurred in educating and training the children would be a good investment and that it would be repaid to the country with compound interest by the conversion of the descendants of a people, a large number of whom are at the present time a source of expense, into profitable citizens, who, instead of being supported from the revenue of the country as their people are at present, would contribute largely to the same.\n\nRev J. B. Fraser\n\nThinks there could be no objection to the country \"if provision were made that no one who received an education should afterwards be supported.\"\nby Gov't.\n\nBishop Whipple\n\n\"It will cost money\nto inaugurate these\nschools, but it will cost\nten times more to care for\nthese same children if\npermitted to grow up as\nsavage paupers.\"\n\nHon. John Schultz:\n\nI think it evident\nfrom the \"standpoint of\nexpediency\" that the outlay\nis called for, as the only\neffective way of civilizing\nthe Indians is by doing our\nuty towards them \"i.e., to\nthoroughly educate them.\"\n\nProfessor Wood says:\n\n\"The expense seems\nlarge, but the work needs\nit all.\"\n\nIndian Sup't Phipps\n\nTrusts \"the benefits\ninferred will be commensurate\nwith the expenditure.\"\nOntario.\n\nDay Schools.\n\nThere are in this Province 69 Indian Reserves. Of these, 24 have no schools established upon them, viz., the Reserves at Lac des Mille Lacs, Kawagamot, Rat Portage, Big Island, North-West Angle, (3 Reserves), Assabaskasing, White Fish Bay, Buffalo Bay, Shoal Lake (2 Reserves), Temogamiingue, French River, Thessalon, Spanish River, Point Grondine, Ojibwaneing, Cockburn Island, Sucker Lake, Long Lake, Pays Plat, Riviere au Sable and Scugog. Of these Reserves, which are as yet without schools, 12 would appear to have a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of schools upon them, viz., the Reserves at Lac des Mille Lacs, Rat Portage, Big Island, Reserve 37 at the North-West Angle, Assabaskasing, White Fish Bay, Buffalo Bay, No. 39 at Shoal Lake, Temogamiingue, French River, Spanish River and Long Lake. On the remaining 12 Reserves the number of children of school age ranges from 5 to 12.\n\nOf the 69 Reserves in the Province there are 45 on which schools are established. Of these 45, however, 12 would appear, from the number of children upon them of school age, not to have sufficient facilities for the education of the children. The Reserves last referred to are as follows:\u2014Coutecheeching, where there are 60 children of school age and only one school; Islington, whereon there are 65 children of school age and but one school; at Garden River, on which the number of children of school age is 175, and the number of schools in operation 2; at Christian Island, on which the number of children of school age is 70, with only one school in operation; at Walpole Island, on which the number of children of school age is 153, with 2 schools in operation; on the Oneida Reserve, in the Township of Delaware, where there are 180 children of school age and 3 schools in operation; on the Reserve at Henvey Inlet, in the Parry Sound District, on which there are 70 children of school age and only 1 school in operation; on the Six Nations Reserve, in the Townships of Tuscarora, Oneida and Onondaga, having 1,066 children of school age and but 12 schools in operation; on the Mississauga Reserve, in the Township of Oneida, having 70 children of school age and only 1 school in operation; on the Reserve at Tyendinaga, on which there are 340 children of school age and 4 schools in operation; on the Reserves of the Chippewas of Sarnia, situated near Sarnia, and at Kettle Point, on which the number of children of school age is 128 with 2 schools in operation.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be obvious that estimating 40 children or thereabouts for each school, there should be on the Reserve at Coutecheeching 2 schools instead of 1; on the Reserve at Islington, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Garden River Reserve, at least 4 schools instead of 2; on the Christian Island Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Walpole Island Reserve, 4 schools instead of 2; on the Oneida Reserve, in the Township of Delaware, 4 schools instead of 3; on the Henvey Inlet Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Six Nation Reserve, 26 schools instead of 12; on the Mississauga Reserve, 2 schools instead of 1; on the Reserve at Tyendinaga, 8 schools instead of 4; on the Reserves near Sarnia and at Kettle Point, which belong to the one Band, 3 schools instead of 2.\n\nAs regards the Reserves on which schools have been established and are in operation, no accommodation has been provided for the teachers of these schools, in the shape of house room. Consequently they have to obtain board and lodging where best they can. This is, as stated in the prefatory part of this report, a very undesirable condition of matters. The teacher should be supplied with a proper place of abode, at a convenient distance from the school.\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land says:\n\nIt is difficult to deal with the Reserves along the Lake of the Woods & the Rainy River as they are so small, but one or two of the largest might have schools.\n\nRev. R. Ashton says:\n\nThat among the Six Nations all that is desired may be accomplished by the passing of a compulsory school law requiring all children between the ages of 5 & 14 years to attend school for at least 100 days in each year until they are able to pass a fair examination in the subjects prescribed for the 4th Standard in the Public Schools of Ontario. The children will not require to be fed or clothed; but, he suggests, that arrangement be made whereby the\n\"destitute, orphaned & neglected children be admitted into an Industrial School.\"\n\nHe considers the estimate of the school population or the number of schools required \"to be very wide of the mark.\" 20% of the population gives \"near enough for all practical purposes,\" he says, the number of children of school age, & \"it is not necessary to provide for more than 75% of that number. He bases his calculation on the Report of the Minister of Education of Ontario, which shows \"that the percentage of average to total attendance is in counties 48 & cities 58,\" while \"the average attendance at the Red Nations Schools last year...\"\n\"was 46% of the registered\n\"number of pupils.\"\n\"Since then\" he adds \"if\n\"we provide for 60%\n\"we shall have room\n\"enough.\" He estimates the\n\"number of school\n\"children in the Six\n\"Nations Reserve to be 656,\n\"deducting 10% for\n\"attendance at Industrial\n\"Schools would leave\n\"591 to be accommodated\n\"in day schools. \"It will\n\"require,\" he says, \"a school\n\"population of 60 under the\n\"most favorable circumstances\n\"to give an average attendance\n\"of 48\" and allowing for\n\"children who may not\n\"be included in the census\n\"it is clear that 11 or 12\n\"Schools may be required\n\"for the Six Nations instead\n\"of 26\" as stated in the\n\"Report.\"\n\"There are at present,\" he states, \"11 schools\u2014\n\"8 controlled by the School\n\"Board, 2 by the Methodists\n\"and 1 (Shawnee) supported by\n\"the Council. A futile\n\"effort has been made to\n\"bring all these schools\n\"under a joint board of\n\"management so that they\n\"might be more equally\n\"distributed.\" If the schools\nwere placed as proposed\n\"very few of the children\n\"would have to travel more\n\"than two miles to school\n\".... while as is the case,\n\"now those who reside\n\"near a school among the\n\"whites can attend the same,\n\"their fees & books being\n\"supplied from the Indian\n\"School Fund.\"\n\nHe affirms \"that the\n\"township of Tuscarora is so\n\"well provided with\n\"efficient schools, neat\nschool houses, modern\nschool apparatus at any\nplace in rural townships in\nOntario\"; that from an\nintellectual educational\npoint of view they are\nsuperior to the white schools.\nAll that is required,\nhe says, to make them\nmore efficient is a\ncompulsory school law,\na united board of\nmanagement, & teachers\nhaving a speaking\nacquaintance with the\nlanguage spoken by the\npupils.\n\nIndian Sup't Plappo states\nthat the Reserve\nat French River is \"not\noccupied by the Band.\" The\nIndians \"live at Shoquiandah\nManitoulin Island.\"\nWith regard to Industrial Schools, there are in existence at present, in the Province of Ontario, four of these institutions, viz.:\u2014At Sault Ste. Marie, where are established the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes, one for the instruction of Indian boys and the other for the instruction of Indian girls. The principal of these institutions is the Rev. E. F. Wilson. He is a clergyman of the Church of England, but has expressed his willingness to make his institutions undenominational.\n\nAt Wikwemikong, on Manitoulin Island, there are also boys' and girls' industrial institutions conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. At Brantford the Mohawk Institute is carried on under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Ashton and under the auspices of the New England Company. It receives no aid from the Government. This institution has both boys and girls as pupils. At Mount Elgin, in the Township of Caradoc, in the County of Middlesex, an Industrial Institution is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. It has also male and female pupils. Of these institutions the Shingwauk Home and Wawanosh Home at Sault Ste. Marie can accommodate between them about 85 pupils. The institutions at Wikwemikong can afford accommodation for about 114 pupils. The Mohawk Institute, near Brantford, can accommodate about 90. The Mount Elgin Institution accommodates 60 pupils.\n\nIt will thus be seen that at these four institutions accommodation can at present be furnished for 349 pupils. The number of children of school age upon the various Reserves in the Province is 5,191, and should schools, as recommended, be established upon Reserves on which there are none at present and where there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of schools, and should the additional number of schools recommended be established on the Reserves where the number of schools at present in operation is insufficient to meet the educational requirements of the Indians, and estimating the percentage of children fit to be drafted from day schools into the industrial institutions at 10 per cent., it is obvious that there will not be sufficient accommodation in the existing institutions of the latter type to meet the requirements of the more advanced pupils, and that either the accommodation of the present institutions will have to be increased or new institutions must be established.\n\nThe undersigned would favor the enlargement of the existing institutions rather than the establishment of others. He is of the opinion that they are favorably situated, being sufficiently central for all practical purposes. He would, however, in accordance with his previously expressed views in this matter, require that the Indian children from certain Reserves should attend one of the institutions and no other, e.g., the institution at Mount Elgin might be supplied with children from the day schools on the Reserves at Rice Lake, Mud Lake, Georgina Island, Rama, Walpole Island, Delaware, Caradoc, Alnwick, Orford, Sarnia, Kettle Point, Scugog. The Mohawk Institute might draw its pupils from the schools in operation on the Reserves of the Six Nations, of the Mississaugas of the County of Haldimand, and of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quint\u00e9, in the Township of Tyendinaga, in the county of Hastings; while the institutions at Sault Ste. Marie and Wikwemikong would absorb the pupils drafted from the Protestant day schools on the various Reserves from Penetanguishene northward, including the Reserves on the Lake of the Woods and on Rainy River, while the Roman Catholic schools on any of the reserves in the same territory might furnish their quota to the Wikwemikong institutions. The capacity of each institution would then require to be increased as follows:\u2014\nThe Mount Elgin Institution, which at present accommodates sixty pupils, would have to be increased so as to permit of 113 pupils being admitted.\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, which at present has accommodation for 90 pupils, would require to be enlarged sufficiently for lodging 155 pupils.\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes at Sault Ste. Marie, which at present have lodging capacity for 85 pupils, should be enlarged to a sufficient extent to admit of 128 pupils being lodged thereat.\n\nThe Wikwemikong Institutions it is thought already have sufficient lodging capacity for any additional pupils that they may be required to take in.\n\nRev. W.W. Shepherd says:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution \"has pupils from Moravian town near Bothwell, only a few miles from here. The New Credit Indians have sent here for many years. For several years we have pupils from Oka, P.I., & Muskrato (Gibson Re). We would like to have these bands still if it can be so arranged.\"\nFurther, should the recommendation contained in the previous part of this report be approved of and given effect to, viz., that in the case of Reserves in regard to any of which there is not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a day school on the Reserve, a central boarding school of the primary class should be established to meet the educational requirements of bands so situated, this will necessitate, in the case of the Province of Ontario, one institution of that class, there being 85 children in all upon Reserves who would have to be provided for in this way. And it is submitted, that as occasionally in each band children are left without natural protectors, owing to the death of their parents, to meet such cases, this primary institution might be made of sufficient dimensions to accommodate say 100 pupils.\n\nRev W.W. Shepherd says:\n\n\"Would it not be less expensive to have a primary department in connection with one or two of the existing institutions so as to accommodate the 85 or 100 children here mentioned. They could be taught by an advanced pupil or by a teacher in training.\"\nIncreased Cost.\n\nIf effect should be given to the views above expressed, the following statement will show the increased cost which must necessarily be incurred in connection with the day schools at present conducted upon Reserves in the Province of Ontario, and the cost of establishing new day schools on Reserves on which there is only one school at present in operation but whereon there is a sufficient number of children of school age to warrant the establishment of more schools, and the cost of establishing schools on Reserves on which no schools at present exist. Taking the present average salary paid to teachers, viz., $240 per annum, and the number of schools at present in operation, viz., 69, and doubling the salary of $240, which is the average remuneration now given, the increase in this item would be 69 teachers at $240 additional each, $16,560 per annum, and adding thereto the number of additional schools which it is proposed to establish on these Reserves on which schools at present exist, viz., 29, and estimating, as before, the salary of each teacher at $480, the 29 teachers' salaries would cost $13,920.\n\nThe total amount that will then be required for 69 teachers at $240 each + 29 at $480 each,\nwill be .................................................. $30,480 00\n\nAnd estimating the cost of erecting new buildings upon these Reserves both for school houses and for the teachers' accommodation at the lowest figure, viz., $500 for each school house and teacher's residence, the cost of schoolhouses and teachers' residences at $500 for 29 new institutions would be $14,500, and of residences for the teachers of 69 schools, the schoolhouses for which have already been erected, say, at $300 each, $20,700; total cost $14,500+20,700...... 35,200 00\n\nIn addition to the foregoing there are as shown in a previous part of this report 12 Reserves which though they have a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school upon each of them have at present no schools in operation. Allowing one school to each of these Reserves and the same rate of salary, viz., $480 to each teacher, there would be 12 teachers at $480, equal to... 5,760 00\n\nAnd allowing the same expenditure for erecting school houses and teachers' dwellings, viz., $500 for each Reserve the cost of these erections on the 12 Reserves would be............. 6,000 00\n\nAdding the cost of equipping all the new schools with proper books and school materials, say at the lowest estimate $100 for each school to be established, being 41 schools in all .......... 4,100 00\n\nAdding thereto the cost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits to 5,191 pupils in 98 schools at $8 per head, equal to........................................ 41,538 00\nAnd the cost of clothing the pupils with winter and summer apparel, 5,191, at say $10 each... 51,910.00\n\nAllowing a sufficient sum to furnish prizes to deserving pupils, say $15 to each school, 98 schools at $15 equal to.............................................. 1,470.00\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the total cost involved in increasing the facilities at present afforded at day schools for the education of the Indian children of Ontario and in improving the methods at present in operation will be......................................................... 176,448.00\n\nFrom this amount, after deducting the cost of the schoolhouses and residences, and the cost of the equipment of the new schoolhouses, $45,300 in all, the balance, viz., $131,148, will represent, approximately, what the annual expenditure on account of day schools will be; in addition to which there will also, of course, be required a certain amount of expenditure in supplying school material, keeping the building in repair, &c. For this it is difficult to estimate; but on a rough calculation it might be set down at $5,000 to meet all such requirements.\n\nThe increased expenditure in connection with the Industrial Institutions would be as follows:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution, accommodation for board and tuition for 53 additional pupils at $60 each.......................................................... $3,180.00\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, for board and tuition of 65 additional pupils, at $60 each................................. 3,900.00\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes, for board and tuition of 50 additional pupils, at $60 each.......................................................... 3,000.00\n\nThe cost of the enlargement of these institutions, so as to meet the additional accommodation required, would be approximately as follows:\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institution........................................... $2,000.00\n\nThe Mohawk Institute.................................................... 3,000.00\n\nThe Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes.......................... 2,000.00\n\nFor repairs, annually..................................................... 2,000.00\n\nDeducting the cost of enlarging the buildings, viz., $7,000, the annual expenditure in board and tuition of the additional pupils, and in repairs, would be......................................................... 12,080.00\n\nWhich, added to the present expenditure of $6,000 at the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes and at the Mount Elgin Institute, on the same account (there is no subsidy at present given to the Mohawk Institute) would make the whole amount to be expended on the above account......................................................... 33,380.00\n\nAdding the additional cost of establishing new day schools, the enlargement of the Industrial Institutions and the cost of the board and tuition of the pupils at both day schools and Industrial Schools, the following would be the additional amount to be provided, viz., for day schools, $146,148; for Industrial Schools, $32,380; less $6,000 already paid, $27,380; total......................................................... 178,128.00\n\nAfter deducting from which the first cost on account of buildings, viz., $52,300; the balance, viz., $120,828, will be the additional amount to be provided annually for the support of day schools, and for the board and tuition of the additional number of pupils at the Industrial Institutions of this Province.\nRev W.W. Shepherd\n\nThinks the estimated cost of enlarging Industrial Institutions \"would not more than cover cost of material\"\nIn this Province there are 10 Indian Reserves. In addition to these, there are bands of Indians on the Lower St. Lawrence, who, after returning from their winter's hunt, are in the habit of camping at the following places: Escomains, Godbout, Sept Isles, Mingan and Musquero.\n\nIn the County of T\u00e9miscouata, there are also wandering Indians who usually camp, during the open seasons, at Rivi\u00e8re du Loup and Tadoussac and on the opposite side of the river, at Rimouski and at L\u00e9vis. These Indians formerly occupied a Reserve at Isle Verte, in the Township of Viger, which was surrendered by them and the land has been sold.\n\nThe total number of children of an age to attend school in the Province is approximately 673.\n\nOf the Indian Reserves on which there are schools in operation there are three Reserves with only one school on each, whereas the number of children of school age on each would justify the establishment of more, viz., at River Desert, where there are 75 children; at Caughnawaga, 187 and at Point Bleue, Lac St. Jean, 166 children of school age. At Caughnawaga another school is, however, about to be brought into operation for the female children. In order to meet the educational requirements of the children of these three Reserves it would appear to be necessary to establish another school on the Reserve at River D\u00e9sert, three additional schools on the Reserve at Caughnawaga, and another school, at least, on the reserve at Lac St. Jean.\n\nOn the Reserve at Betsiamits, where during the open season there are 131 children of school age, there is no school in operation, nor are there schools in operation at any of the points above enumerated on the north shore of the Lower St. Lawrence, to which the Indians resort in the summer season; although at Sept Isles, in the families that remain, in the open season, there are said to be 98 children of school age; at Mingan, 50; at Musquaro, 72; at Godbout, 15, and at Escomains, 13. It is difficult to say how the education of the children at these last named points is to be accomplished. For the greater portion of the year the Indians are absent, leaving early in the month of August and not returning until about the middle of June. Their hunting grounds are distant and they are therefore obliged to leave early for the same in order to reach them in good time to commence their hunt and to arrange their winter quarters; and for the same reason, viz., the distance they have to travel, they are in the spring late in arriving at the coast. The only feasible plan by which to accomplish the education of any of the children of these nomads would appear to be by the establishment at some point of a central boarding school at which the children might remain while their parents went to their hunting grounds; but the school would have to be a large one to accommodate the number of children of school age were they all to be admitted at the same time. The whole number of children of school age at the above points including Betsiamits is 379. It is not, however, likely that the parents of the children would all agree to leave them, and the Department could scarcely calculate upon more than perhaps a quarter of that number, or in round numbers say 100 children, being left at the school. Should such a central boarding school for about 100 children be established there is no reason why the children of the nomadic Indians of T\u00e9miscouata before referred to should not also be admitted into the same.\nWith a view to the higher education of the children who attend the schools established upon Indian Reserves in this Province, it would be necessary to establish an industrial boarding school at some central point, whereat Indian boys selected from the day schools, besides having the benefit of a higher education, might be instructed in trades that would enable them to obtain a livelihood after leaving the institution, and girls might receive instruction in sewing, knitting, dress-making, tailoring, baking and other household industries.\n\nThe total number of children of school age on the various Reserves in the Province is 673, and estimating that 10 per cent. of these would be eligible for admission into an industrial institution, the number to be admitted would be about 68, or say 70. It would not, therefore, be necessary to have more than one industrial school for the above purpose.\n\nThe expense involved in giving effect to the above ideas, if approved of, would be as follows:\n\n- Five additional schools at River Desert, Caughnawaga and Lac St. Jean, at a salary of say $480 for each teacher ........................................... $2,400 00\n- Additional amount required, viz., $240 for each, to bring up the salaries of the teachers of the three schools at present in operation on those Reserves to $480 for each teacher ......................... 720 00\n- Additional amount required to increase the salaries of 11 teachers on the Reserves at Restigouche, St. Francis (2 schools), Maria, Lorette, St. R\u00e9gis (4 schools), Temiscamingue (2 schools), from the salaries at present received by them, $240 to $480 each per annum .......................... 2,640 00\n- The cost of mid-day meal for the pupils at the 19 day schools, estimating the outside number of children to be provided for at 673, and at the rate of $8 per capita ........................................... 5,384 00\n- Adding cost of erection of five additional school buildings and residences at $500 each .............. 2,500 00\n- Fourteen residences for the teachers at $300 for each .................................................. 4,200 00\n- Cost of clothing for the children attending the day schools, $6.50 for winter uniform and $2.50 for summer uniform, 673 children at $10 each ..... 6,730 00\n- Cost of prizes for pupils, 19 schools at $15 each .... 285 00\n- Cost of erection of a central boarding school for the Indian children of the Lower St. Lawrence, to accommodate 100 children, about ...... 4,000 00\n- Cost of tuition and board, &c., of these children at $150 each per annum ........................................... 10,000 00\n- Cost of building for an Industrial School for children selected from 19 Reserve schools ..... 3,100 00\n- For tuition, board, clothing, &c., thereat of 70 children at $60 each ........................................... 4,200 00\n- Cost of furniture and school material .................... 2,500 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance. $49,055 00\nThe above estimate in regard to the boarding school for the Lower St. Lawrence and the industrial school for the children from day schools on the Reserves is based upon the supposition that, as in the case of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institution in Ontario and the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes at Sault Ste. Marie, some religious denomination or benevolent society will share the expense of the tuition, board, &c, of the children. Should, however, this prove not to be the case and the whole expense have to be borne by the Government, the estimate would have to be increased to the extent of at least two-thirds.\n\nDeducting first cost of buildings and of furniture, $16,700, the balance, $92,359, shows the additional amount required annually for educating the Indian children of the Province.\n\nProfessor Wood\n\nthinks the question of the education of the Inabean nomads is \"a very difficult one, but that the establishment of the Central Boarding School is at least feasible.\"\nThere are in this Province 18 Indian Reserves, and the total number of children of school age is 486.\n\nThe following Reserves have each one school in operation upon them, viz.: at Cow Bay, in the County of Halifax, where there are school children to the number of 20; Whycoomagh, in the County of Inverness, the number of school children being 84; Eskasoni, in the County of Cape Breton, the number of school children being 21; at Indian Cove, in the County of Pictou, with a school population of 35; New Germany in the County of Lunenburg, having 25 children of school age; Red Islands, in the county of Richmond, with a school population of 45; Middle River, in the county of Victoria, having a school population of 39; Bear River, in the County of Digby, having a school population of 71.\n\nWith the exception of the last named Reserve, the number of children of school age on each of these Reserves is not greater than one teacher should be able to instruct. On the Bear River Reserve, however, there would appear to be a larger number than any one teacher can properly manage.\n\nOn the following Reserves there are no schools in operation:\n\nSheet Harbor, in the County of Halifax, where there are 15 children of school age; Shubenacadie, in the County of Hants, where there are about 40 children of an age to attend school; Franklin Manor, in the County of Cumberland, with children of school age to the number of 12; at Truro, in the County of Colchester, where there are 20 children sufficiently old to attend school; in the Counties of Annapolis and Shelburne, the number of children of school age being 38; in Queen's County, where there are 20 children of an age to go to school; in the County of Antigonish, where there are about 40 children old enough for attendance at school; in King's County, the number of children of school age being 30.\n\nIt will be observed from the foregoing that there are 8 Reserves in the Province with schools established on them; while there are 10 Reserves without schools, although the number of children of an age to be at school on each of those Reserves, with the exception of those at Sheet Harbor, in the County of Halifax, and at Franklin Manor, in the County of Cumberland, is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve.\n\nIf, as in the case of the other Provinces, the average salary at present paid the 8 teachers now employed, viz., $240 each per annum, be doubled, the additional amount required to increase the salaries now paid will be........... $1,920 00\n\nIf 11 new schools are to be brought into operation on the ten Reserves at present without any, and another at Bear River, the total amount required for salaries for the teachers of the 11 schools would be........................................ 7,680 00\n\nAdding the cost of erecting new school-houses upon ten Reserves not already supplied with schools, and of a school-house for an additional school at Bear River, as well as the cost of residences for teachers at the rate of $500 for each school-house and residence the total amount to be provided for buildings would be........................................ 5,500 00\nAnd if provision of residences is to be made for the teachers of the schools at present in operation, allowing $300 for each building, $300 x 8 = 2,400.00\n\nAdding cost of equipment of eleven new schools with proper books and school material, at say, $100 each = 1,100.00\n\nCost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits, to 486 children, at $8 each per school year = 3,888.00\n\nCost of clothing 486 pupils with winter and summer apparel, at $10 each = 4,860.00\n\nCost of providing prizes for each school, 19 schools, at $15 each = 285.00\n\nRepairs and renewing the supply of school books and material annually, say = 800.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided = $26,025.00\n\nThis amount, $26,025, less the cost of the building and of equipment of new schools, viz.: $9,000, will represent the amount to be annually provided for the purposes of day schools on the Reserves in the Province, viz.: $17,025.\n\nIf a central industrial institution for the instruction of boys in trades and agriculture, and of girls in sewing, dressmaking, tailoring, knitting, cooking, baking, washing, and house hold duties generally, be established, which the undersigned thinks is highly desirable in order that promising children who have acquitted themselves in a creditable manner at the day schools should receive higher educational advantages, as well as instruction in some useful trade, taking the percentage as in the case of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec at 10 per cent. of the total school population in the Province, the number of children for whom accommodation would be required at the industrial institution would be about 50.\n\nThe approximate cost of the erection of a building for the purpose would be, say = $2,750.00\n\nCost of tuition, board, &c., of 50 children, at $60 each = 3,000.00\n\nCost of furnishing the building, say = 800.00\n\nCost of repairs annually = 400.00\n\nTotal cost = $6,950.00\n\nFrom which, in order to show the amount to be annually provided, should be deducted the cost of the building, $2,750; and of furnishing, &c., $800, leaving as a result = 3,400.00\n\nAnd this added to the annual cost of the day schools, $17,025, will make the total annual cost of Indian schools in Nova Scotia, $8,400 + $17,025 = 20,425.00\nThere are 19 Indian Reserves in this Province, with a school population of 431.\n\nOn the following Reserves schools have been established:\n\n- At Kingsclear and at St. Mary's, in the County of York; at Tobique, in the County of Victoria; at Burnt Church and at Eel Ground, in the County of Northumberland; one school being in operation on each of these Reserves and with the exception of that at Burnt Church, where there are 75 children of school age, one school is sufficient to meet the educational requirements of the children so far as can be judged from the number on each Reserve.\n\nThere are 14 Reserves without schools. Of these the Reserves at St. Andrew's, in the County of Charlotte; St. John, in the County of St. John; Edmundston, in the County of Madawaska; Red Bank, in the County of Northumberland; Shubenacadie, in the County of Westmorland, and Folly Point, in the County of Westmorland, have not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve, none of them having more than 10 children of an age to attend school, and the majority of them only from 4 to 9 children.\n\nThe other Reserves, in view of the number of children of school age upon them, should have schools established thereat, viz., at Woodstock, in the County of Carleton, where there are 20 children; Apohaqui, in the County of King's, where there are 14; Dalhousie, in the County of Restigouche, where there 12 children; Bathurst, in the county of Gloucester, having 13 children; Indian Island, in the County of Kent, with 22 children; Big Cove, in the same county, having as many as 61 children; and Buctouche, also in the County of Kent, 16 children.\n\nOf these last named Reserves, that at Big Cove is the only one on which there would be a necessity, apparently, for the establishment of more than one school, there being, as above stated, 61 children of school age upon it, which number should afford an attendance sufficient for two schools.\n\nAllowing two schools for that reserve and one school for each of the others, there would be 8 new schools to be established, which, at $489 salary for each teacher, would cost for salaries $3,840.00\n\nAnd adding the additional cost of increasing the salaries of the present teachers of the 5 existing schools by $240, the additional amount to be provided for salaries for those teachers would be .................................................. 1,200.00\n\nThe cost of building 8 new school-houses and residences for the teachers, say at $500 each, would amount to .................................................. 4,000.00\n\nAnd to this should be added the cost of 5 residences for the teachers of the existing schools, at say $300 each .................................................. 1,500.00\n\nCost of equipment of the 8 new schools, with proper books and school materials, at say $100 each, would be .................................................. 800.00\n\nCost of food to furnish a daily meal, as proposed, of oatmeal porridge, syrup and biscuits, to 384 children, at $8 each per school year ........... 3,072.00\nCost of clothing the same number of children with winter and summer apparel, at $10 each........... 3,840.00\n\nCost of providing prizes for each school, 13 schools, at $15.................................................. 195.00\n\nFor repairs and renewal of supply of school books and material annually................................. 650.00\n\nTotal additional amount to be provided... $19,097.00\n\nThis sum, less the cost of the buildings and of equipping the new schools, viz., $6,300, will represent the additional amount, viz., $12,797, to be annually voted for day schools on the reserves in this Province.\n\nIf the proposition to establish a central industrial institution in this Province should be approved of, the number of pupils who would attend, at the rate of percentage adopted for the other Provinces, viz., 10 per cent. of the children of school age, would be about 44; but it is considered that, as already stated, on several of the reserves above-mentioned, there is not a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a day school, provision should be made in the said central industrial institution for the admission of these children thereto; and this would occasion a necessity for a larger building, as there are altogether 37 children of school age on the several reserves referred to; consequently the total number to be provided for in the industrial institution would be 44+37=81 children.\n\nIt is possible, however, that arrangements might be made by which the children of some of the reserves last referred to, which may have public schools in the vicinity, might be admitted to the same; and if such could be effected, there would, of course, be no necessity for so large a building; but it may be concluded that it will not be possible, in the majority of instances, to effect such an arrangement, and allowing that one-half of the number of children of school age on these reserves, say 18, would be admitted to the institution, provision would then have to be made for 62 children, and the approximate cost of the erection of a building for the accommodation of that number it is thought would be about.................................................................................................................. $3,000.00\n\nCost of board and tuition of 62 children, at $60 each per annum.................................................. 3,720.00\n\nCost of furnishing the building and equipping it, &c., say.......................................................... 800.00\n\nCost of repairs and school material annually, say.............................................................. 400.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided would therefore be...... $7,920.00\n\nFrom this amount, in order to show the sum to be annually provided, must be deducted the cost of the buildings and of furnishing the same, $3,800, leaving as the result $4,120, and this amount added to the actual cost of the day schools, $12,797, will make the total additional annual cost of Indian schools in New Brunswick $16,917.\nIn this Province there are two Reserves. The larger one consists of Lennox Island, and the smaller one is situated in Township No. 39. In the latter there are but a few families, and the number of children of an age to attend school being only 6, no school has been established on the Reserve. On Lennox Island, however, there are 67 children old enough to be at school, and there is one in operation; but the attendance thereat is very small; indeed there are only 22 names on the school roll, and the average attendance falls, as a rule, far short of that number. The teacher is favorably reported of, but as he combines with his office of school teacher that of Indian Agent, it is probable, as has frequently been alleged by the incumbent, that the duties of the one office interfere with those of the other, and that were the offices separated, the school teacher, having nothing but his school to attend to, would be able to give closer attention to his duties, and both the attendance at and efficiency of the institution would be thereby greatly enhanced.\n\nThe school teacher, who as above stated also fills the position of Indian Agent, receives for the two offices a salary of $300 per annum, divided thus: $300 as agent, and $200 as teacher. Should it be decided to dissociate the positions, and to place the teacher on a similar footing as respects salary and residence, as is recommended in the case of teachers of Indian schools elsewhere, the present compensation of $200 would have to be increased by $280.00\n\nAnd cost of a dwelling house for the teacher, say $300.00\n\nAdditional furniture, desks, &c., $100.00\n\nDaily meal of porridge, syrup and biscuits for 67 children, at $8 each per annum $536.00\n\nClothing 67 children, at $10 each $670.00\n\nPrizes for children $25.00\n\nFor repairs annually to buildings and renewal of school material $50.00\n\nTotal additional amount to be provided $1,961.00\n\nAnd to ascertain the additional amount to be annually voted, the sums above stated as necessary for cost of teacher's house, $300; additional furniture, books, &c., $100; making together $400, should be deducted from the total amount above stated, which will give as a result, $1,561.\n\nThe small number which, at 10 per cent. of the school children would be available for promotion to an industrial boarding school, might be accommodated in the institutions of that type proposed to be established in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; and as respects the 6 children on the Reserve in Township 39, arrangements might possibly be made for their admittance into the nearest public school in that locality.\nOn Lake Winnipeg there are 11 Reserves, with 691 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Black River, 23; Hollow Water, 32; Loon Straits, 40; Blood Vein, 31; Jack Head, 19; Fisher River, 85; Barons River, 73; Grand Rapids of Barons River, 68; Poplar River, 57; Norway House, 203; Cross Lake, 90. There are schools in operation on 7 of these Reserves, viz., at Hollow Water, Loon Straits, Fisher River, Barons River, Poplar River, Norway House (2), and Cross Lake. On 4 Reserves there are no schools, viz., at Black River, Blood Vein Creek, Jack Head, and at the Grand Rapids of Barons River. There is a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school on each of the Reserves last mentioned, and, therefore, the establishment of a school on each Reserve would be justifiable. And, on each of the Reserves at Fisher River, Barons River, Grand Rapids, Poplar River, and Cross Lake, the number of children would justify the establishment of 2 schools instead of one such institution. And on Norway House Reserve, where there are 203 children of an age to attend school, there should be 4 instead of 2 schools in operation. The average salary paid the teachers of Indian Schools on Lake Winnipeg is $300 per annum, which is a wholly insufficient remuneration, and it is submitted that the salary should be increased to $480 per annum.\n\nSuch increase, if agreed to, will involve an additional grant for the 9 teachers of the schools at present in operation of $180 \u00d7 9 = $1,620 00\n\nAnd if the 11 additional schools above recommended are established there will be a further sum required for salaries of $480 \u00d7 11 = $5,280 00\n\nAnd assuming that residences are to be provided for the 9 teachers at present in the service at $300 each \u00d7 9 there will require to be provided = $2,700 00\n\nAnd schoolhouses and residences for the 11 new teachers at $500 each will cost $500 \u00d7 11 = $5,500 00\n\nAdd cost of equipping the 11 new schools with furniture and school material, say, for each $100 \u00d7 11 = $1,100 00\n\nCost of furnishing food for 691 children, at $8 each per annum = $5,528 00\n\nExpense of clothing the same number, at $10 = $6,910 00\n\nCost of prizes for 20 schools, at $15 each = $300 00\n\nCost of repairs to buildings and renewal of school material annually = $1,000 00\n\nThe total sum to be provided for Indian schools on Lake Winnipeg in addition to the amount already granted will then be = $29,938 00\n\nFrom this amount should be deducted the cost of new school buildings $8,200 + cost of equipment, $1,100 = $9,300 00\n\nAnd the result will give = $20,638 00\n\nas the additional amount to be annually voted for the 17 schools in this agency.\nAn industrial institution, with a capacity of accommodation for 70 pupils, should be established at some central point, into which the most promising and furthest advanced children from the day schools of the district might be drafted. Berens River Reserve, whereon the Indian Agent for the locality resides, would appear to be the most suitable location for such an establishment.\n\nThe cost of erecting a building for the above purpose at Berens River would be, it is thought, about $10,000.00\n\nAnd provided some religious and benevolent body will co-operate, the expense to the Department connected with the board, clothing, tuition, and instruction in industries of 70 children may be placed at $100 per capita. 7,000.00\n\nAnd the cost of keeping the institution buildings in repair at 800.00\n\nThe total amount to be in the first place provided will therefore be $17,800.00\n\nAnd there will require to be annually voted for maintenance of the institution that sum less cost of building $10,000. 7,800.00\n\nThe additional amount that will therefore be annually required for maintenance of day schools and of the industrial institution will be $29,638 + $7,800. $28,438.00\n\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land says:\n\nThe Reserves are so small along Lake Winnipeg that it is difficult to deal with them, but one or two of the largest might have day schools.\n\nH. E. Macdonald says:\n\nThe Industrial School should be near a town or thickly settled section of country, as otherwise one of the benefits of its establishment will be lost.\nIn the St. Peter's Agency there are 466 children of an age to attend school, viz., on the Reserves as St. Peter's 328, on that at Broken Head River 30, and on the Reserve at Fort Alexander 108. On the St. Peter's Reserve there are 6 schools in operation, but there would appear to be a sufficient number of children to admit of the establishment of two additional schools; on the Reserve at Broken Head River there is one school, and on that at Fort Alexander there are 2 schools in operation.\n\nAs in the case of the Lake-Winnipeg reserves the average salary paid the school teachers in this agency is $300 per annum. If, as has been recommended as respects teachers in other agencies, and which appears worthy of adoption in this agency, their salaries are increased to $489 each, there will be required an additional amount for the 9 school teachers now employed at $180 each of ........................................... $1,620 00\n\nAnd if two additional schools are established on the St. Peter's Reserve as recommended, salaries of $489 each will require to be provided\u2014 $489 x 2 ................................................................. 960 00\n\nAnd should residences for the 9 teachers now employed be built at, say $300, for each building, the cost will be.................................................. 2,700 00\n\nTo which add cost of schoolhouses and residences for two new teachers on the St. Peter's Reserve, at $500 each ............................................. 1,000 00\n\nAnd cost of furniture for the same and of school material, say $100 for each ....................... 200 00\n\nAnd the expense of furnishing a mid-day meal for the 466 children of the agency, at $8 each per annum .......................................................... 3,728 00\n\nAlso of clothing the same number of children, at $10 each per annum .................................................. 4,660 00\n\nAnd of providing prizes for 11 schools, at $15 each per annum .......................................................... 165 00\n\nCost of repairs to buildings and of renewing school material annually at $50 each x 11 .............. 550 00\n\nTotal of first cost .......................................................... $15,583 00\n\nFrom this sum should be deducted the cost of new buildings, $3,700, plus the equipment of the two new schools, $200 .................................................. 3,900 00\n\nAnd as a result we have .................................................. $11,683 00\n\nas the additional amount to be annually granted for the maintenance of the 11 schools of this agency.\nThe number of children of school age in the agency being 466 and the proportion of 10 per cent. being taken as a proper estimate of the number adaptable for introduction into a school of industries, there would be, in round numbers, 47 children for admission into such an institution.\n\nThe cost of a building for the accommodation of that number of pupils would be, say.................. $6,000 00\n\nThe cost of tuition, industrial training, maintenance and clothing of 47 children, at $100 each per annum................................................................. 4,700 00\n\nThe cost of keeping the buildings in repair per annum, say................................................................. 800 00\n\nThe total amount that must be in the first place provided will therefore be.......................... $11,500 00\n\nAnd to be annually voted $11,500\u2014$6,000 (the cost of building)......................................................... 5,500 00\n\nThe additional sum that will be required annually for maintenance of the day schools and of the industrial institutions of this agency will therefore be $11,683\u2014$5,500................................. 17,183 00\n\nThe Bishop of Rupert's Land says,\n\n\"There should be two [day] schools in the Large Reserve at St. Peter's & Fort Alexander.\"\nIn the Lake Manitoba Agency there are 9 reserves with 10 schools in operation, and in the Portage la Prairie Agency there are 4 Reserves with 1 school. It would appear convenient to deal with these two agencies together as respects school matters.\n\nIn the former there are 297 children, and in the latter 79 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows: At Sandy Bay, 3; Lake Manitoba, 82; Elbow Flow Lake, 25; Fairfield, 90; Little Saskatchewan, 28; Crane River, 30; Water Hen River, 46; Duck Bay, 15; Rosseau River, 30; Long Plain, 29; Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing, 20. On all of these Reserves, excepting at Long Plain, Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing, schools have been established. At Fairfield, where, as above stated, there are 90 children of school age, 2 schools are in operation; at Rosseau River, the school is kept in the private house of an Indian, owing to the want of a public building for the purpose. At Long Plain, there being 20 children of an age to attend school, one should be established, and as there is a similar number at Swan Lake and Hamilton's Crossing a school might be started at the latter point, where the most of the Indians reside.\n\nThe average salary of the teachers in these agencies is as in the other Agencies, $300 per annum. Should it be decided to raise the salaries of the teachers to $480, the additional amount required for the 11 teachers at present employed would be $180 \u00d7 11 = $1,980.00\n\nAnd should schools be established at Long Plain and at Hamilton's Crossing, the amount required for salaries of teachers will be $480 \u00d7 2 = $960.00\n\nThe cost of erecting residences for 10 teachers where schoolhouses have been erected at $300 each, would be $3,000.00\n\nAnd of building a new schoolhouse and teacher's residence at Rosseau River = $500.00\n\nAnd of erecting similar buildings at Long Plain and Swan Lake, $500 \u00d7 2 = $1,000.00\n\nCost of furnishing the 3 new schools and of school material for the same, $100 \u00d7 3 = $300.00\n\nExpense of supplying a mid-day meal to 367 children, at $8 each per annum = $2,936.00\n\nCost of clothing the same number, at $10 each per annum = $3,670.00\n\nProviding prizes for 11 schools, at $15 each per annum = $165.00\n\nRepairs to buildings and school material for 14 schools, $50 at each per annum = $700.00\n\nThe total additional amount to be provided in the first place for day schools in these agencies will therefore be $15,211.00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the cost of buildings and furnishing the same, $4,500 + $300 = $4,800.00\n\nThe result = $10,411.00 gives the amount to be annually voted for the maintenance of day schools in these agencies.\nAnd allowing, as in the other agencies, 10 per cent. of the children as eligible for admission into an industrial institution, a building would be required of a capacity to accommodate 37 pupils.\n\nThe approximate cost of such a building would be $5,000.00\n\nAnd of furniture and school apparatus..................$1,000.00\n\nAnd the cost of tuition, instruction in industries, clothing and board for 37 pupils at $100 each per annum would be..........................$3,700.00\n\nAnd the expenditure for repairs and equipment, annually..............................................$800.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided............................$10,500.00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the first cost of building and equipping, $5,000 x $1,000.....................$6,000.00\n\nThe result, viz. ...........................................$4,500.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually voted for maintaining the institution, and this sum, $4,500 + $10,411 = $14,911, will represent the total additional amount to be annually provided for day and industrial schools in these agencies.\nIn the Birtle District there are 14 Reserves, with 927 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014On the Reserve of the Sioux at Bird Tail Creek there are 52 children; on the Oak River Sioux Reserve, 108; on the Oak Lake Sioux Reserve, 16; on the Turtle Mountain Sioux Reserve 14; on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9's Band, 141; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kouse, 94; on the Reserve of Way-way-se-cappo, 50; on the Reserve of the Gambler, 94; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kow-we-nin, 52; on the Reserve of The Key, 116; on the Reserve of South Quill, 60; on the Reserve of Pheasant Rump, 28; on the Reserve of Red Ear, 32; on the Reserve of White Bear, 70. Schools are in operation on six of these Reserves, viz., on Bird Tail Creek, Oak River, Cot\u00e9's, The Key's, Kee-see-kouse, Kee-see-kow-we-nin.\n\nOn the Reserve on Oak River there is only one school, whereas there is a sufficient number of children (108) of school age thereon to justify the establishment of another school; and on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9 there is only one school while there are 141 children, being sufficient for an attendance of over 40 at 3 schools; on the Reserve of The Key there are 116 children and only 1 school, whereas for that number of children there should be 3 schools in operation; on the Reserve of Kee-see-kouse there are 94 children but only one school, whereas there should be two schools in order to afford sufficient instruction to that number of children. On the Reserves at Oak Lake and Turtle Mountains, having respectively 16 and 14 children, there are no schools; the same remark applies to the Reserves of Way-way-se-cappo, where there are 50 children, of the Gambler, where there are 94, (being sufficient to afford an attendance of 47 each to 2 schools); of South Quill, having 60 children, a sufficient number for 2 schools; of Pheasant Rump, with 28 children, of Red Ear, having 32 children; and of White Bear, where there are 70 children, or a sufficient number to afford an attendance at two schools, of 35 to each.\n\nThe average salary paid school teachers in this district is $300 per annum. Should it be decided to increase the same to $480, it will involve an increased grant of for six teachers at $180 each...........................................$1,080.00\n\nAnd should there be established, as above suggested, another school on Oak River Reserve and two additional schools on the Reserve of Cot\u00e9, and a like increased number of schools on the Reserve of The Key, and one more school on that of Kee-see-kouse, and one school on each of the Reserves at Oak Lake, Turtle Mountains, and a school on each of the Reserves of Way-way-se-cappo, South Quill, Pheasant Rump, Red Ear, and two schools on each of the Reserves of the Gambler and Red Bear\u2014for the teachers of these seventeen schools provision of salaries at $480 each will have to be made, $480 x 17...........................................8,160.00\n\nAnd should residences be provided for the six teachers at present employed, at say $300 each, $300 x 6...........................................1,800.00\nAnd school houses and residences for seventeen teachers, at $500 each ........................................... 8,500 00\n\nCost of furniture for the seventeen new schools and of school material for the same, at $100 each .................................................. 1,700 00\n\nExpense of supplying mid-day meal to 927 children at $8 each per annum .................................................. 7,416 00\n\nCost of clothing 927 children, at $10 per annum each ................................................................. 9,270 00\n\nProvision of prizes for twenty-three schools, at $15 each per annum .................................................. 345 00\n\nRepairs and school material at $50 each per annum, $50 x 23 .......................................................... 1,050 00\n\nThe total additional sum required will in the first instance be .................................................. $39,321 00\n\nDeduct therefrom cost of buildings and of furnishing the same $10,300 + 1,700 ........................................ 12,000 00\n\nand the result .................................................. $27,321 00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in the Birtle Agency.\n\nAn industrial institution of a capacity to lodge ninety-three children should be established.\n\nThe approximate cost of a building for such a purpose would be .................................................. $10,000 00\n\nAnd the cost of clothing, board, tuition and instruction in industries of ninety-three pupils, at $100 each per annum would be .................................................. 9,300 00\n\nThe cost of equipment of the institution say .................................................. 2,400 00\n\nAnd of repairs and school material annually .................................................. 1,600 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided .................................................. $23,900 00\n\nDeduct therefrom the first cost of building and equipment .................................................. 12,400 00\n\nand the result .................................................. $10,900 00\n\nwill represent the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the institution and that amount, $10,900 + $27,321 = $38,121, shows the additional sum total required annually for maintenance of day schools and of an industrial institution in this agency.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend that the latter institution be established at Birtle, which is the headquarters of the agency, and the agent could then personally, from time to time, inspect the institution and exercise a general supervision over the expenditure at and management of the same.\n\nHon. John Schulz\n\nThinks the estimated cost of building the Industrial School is too low, & that\nan allowance of $100 for each pupil is too small.\n\nHumble E. Dewdney\n\nConsiders the estimated number of children to be excessive. He estimates as follows:\n\n- Cote 80, key 55\n- Keesee house 51, Keesee house in 40\n- Waywaysee camp 33, gambler 54\n- Smith Hill 30, Pleasant Rump 21\n- Red Ear 12, White Bear 24\n- Oak Lake 16, Mountain 14\n- Big Jail 97, Oak River 108\n\nMaking a total of 590 instead of 927.\n\nThe Industrial School, he thinks, \"will cost nearer $30,000 than $10,000,\" and he asks \"will not the per capita cost exceed $100. If the Institution is to be carried on sustained by the Dept., he agrees that Battle wound be the best place for the Industrial School.\"\nThe District of Assiniboia is divided into five agencies. The Assiniboine or Indian Head Agency, in which there is but one Reserve known as Jack's, having 33 children of an age to attend school and where one school is in operation.\n\nThe Crooked Lakes Agency embraces four Reserves, viz., the reserve known as Cowesses', with 35 children of an age to attend school, and where there is one school in operation; Ochapawasis', having 50 children of school age, but no school; Sakway's, which has 44 children old enough but having no school to attend; Ka-kee-wis-te-hau's, with 23 children of school age but no school in operation; the File Hills Agency, which embraces four reserves, viz., Little Black Bear's, with 26 children of an age to attend school and one school in operation; Star Blanket's, with 18 children old enough but having no school to attend; Okanee's, having 19 children of sufficient age to attend but no school in operation; Peepeewee-sis', having 19 children of school age but no school in operation.\n\nMuscowpetung's Agency includes four reserves, consisting of Pasqua's, with 65 children of school age and one school in operation; Muscowpetung's, having 20 children of an age to attend school but no school in operation; Piapot's, where there are 46 children old enough to attend and one school in operation; Standing Buffalo's, having 52 children of school age and one school in operation.\n\nThe Touchwood Hills Agency contains five reserves, viz., Poor Man's, having 35 children of an age to attend, but having no school; Day Star's, with 25 children of school age but no school; Gordon's, having 55 children of an age to attend and one school in operation; Muscowequan's, with 30 children sufficiently old to attend school and one in operation; Yellow Quill's, having 40 children sufficiently old but no school to attend.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be observed that of the four reserves in the Crooked Lakes Agency there is only one with a school on it, although on each of the other three reserves there is a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school if one were established; also that in the File Hills Agency there is only one school, although there are four reserves, and that on two of these reserves, if not on the three, the number of children of school age is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each. In the Muscowpetung Agency of the four reserves only one is without a school, but there being 29 children of school age therein, one might very properly be established. Another school on Pasquah's Reserve, where there are 65 children of school age, would not be too many.\n\nIn the Touchwood Hills Agency out of five reserves only two have schools on them, whereas on each of the three other reserves the number of children of an age to attend school would justify the establishment of one school, and on one of those upon which one school exists the number of children is sufficient to afford a fair attendance for two schools.\n\nOn Jack's Reserve, in the Assiniboine Agency, there are, as above stated, 33 children and one school; another school would not be too many.\n\nAs elsewhere in the North-West, the average salary of the school teachers at these five agencies is $300 per annum.\nIf it be decided to increase the same to $480 per annum, the additional amount to be provided for the eight teachers at present employed, will be $180 \u00d7 8 ........................................... $1,440 00\n\nAnd for teachers of the 13 new schools proposed to be established, $180 \u00d7 13 ......................... 2,340 00\n\nIf teachers' residences for the 8 now employed are to be erected, the cost, at $300 each, will be... 2,400 00\n\nAnd of school houses and teachers' residences for 13 new institutions, at $500 each ...................... 6,500 00\n\nCost of furnishing and supplying material for 13 new schools, at $100 each............................... 1,300 00\n\nCost of supplying a mid-day meal to 628 children, at $8 each per annum.................................. 5,024 00\n\nCost of clothing same number of children, at $10 each per annum........................................ 6,280 00\n\nCost of providing prizes for 21 schools, at $15 each per annum............................................. 315 00\n\nRepairs and school material for 21 schools, at $50 each per annum, $50 \u00d7 21............................... 1,050 00\n\nTotal expense to be incurred in first instance, $26,649 00\n\nDeducting first cost of building and furnishing, $8,900 + 1,300 ............................................ 10,200 00\n\nAnd the result........................................... $16,249 00\n\ngives the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of schools in these agencies.\n\nThere is already an Industrial Institution at Qu'Appelle, conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic church, which is probably of sufficient capacity to accommodate such number of children, of Roman Catholic parentage, from the day schools of these agencies, as well as from the Reserves of the Birtle, Prince Albert and Duck Lake and Pas Agencies, as may be selected as eligible for promotion into a higher school, and it is proposed to establish, as soon as possible, in the vicinity of Regina, another institution of the same type, to be placed under the Presbyterian Church, and when the same shall have been opened, it should be sufficient for the more advanced pupils of the day schools, of Protestant parentage, in the five agencies last referred to.\n\nFather Lacombe\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Institute, he says, is not sufficient for the Catholic children, \"as the Bishop has already refused to receive Catholic children in...\"\nthis Institution; and he states it is proposed \"to apply to the Dept. to \"grant another Catholic \"Industrial School in the \"Valley of the Saskatchewan, \"about Fort Pitt.\"\n\nHumble E. Dewdney says:\n\n\"The Pinus Lake Boarding & Lacippee Industrial School should be considered \"with reference to the Crooked Lakes & Hill Cree Agencies.\n\nBoth these schools \"draw so largely from the Reserves in the Crooked Lakes agency that Crooked School \"has been ordered to be closed.\n\n\"The pagan influence \"of the Hill Cree Band \"renders a boarding school \"very desirable.\" The Presbyterians are establishing one, as \"the day School on Black Bear's Reserve has not been \"successful.\" They are also\nestablishing a boarding school in the immediate neighborhood of these people's Reserve.\n\n\"Three of the five named Reserves,\" Mr. Dewdney says, \"have schools, one having been recently opened at Wag-Stars. The scattered children that cannot attend the existing schools might hence be gathered into a boarding school.\"\n\n\"Another school,\" he adds, \"would not be too much in Jack's Reserve if the children could be got to attend, but they will not do so at present.\"\nThe southern part of the District of Alberta is the most difficult field in which to accomplish anything in the educational line. The great majority of the Indians are of the Blackfoot Nation, and having but little intelligence in respect to such matters, they consequently have little or no appreciation of the benefit of education for their children. They therefore have availed themselves but slightly of the scanty facilities afforded for educating them by the few day schools established by missionaries, and so discouraged have the teachers become that of the five schools formerly in operation only one remains at present open. That school has on its roll the names of 190 pupils, but the daily average attendance is very far short of that number, and even were the daily attendance equal to the number on the roll it would be but a poor showing for 1,940 children of school age on the three Reserves.\n\nNor have the attempts made to induce the parents to allow their children to remain at the Industrial Institution established at High River for the special benefit of the Blackfoot youth been successful, and the Department has consequently been obliged to draw from the more northern Cree Reserves of the district for inmates of that establishment. It is difficult to determine what measures should be adopted to effect a change of sentiment as respects education in these people. The attractive power which doubtless will be exercised over the minds of the Indian children on the other Reserves by a mid-day meal being given those attending school would, it is feared, fail of its object in the case of the Blackfoot children, insomuch as, owing to the special circumstances surrounding those Indians in consequence of the extinction of the buffalo, on which they solely subsisted in times past, the Department has been obliged to regularly ration the whole nation with meat and flour. This has not had to be done with any of the other tribes, as they were not so wholly dependent as the Blackfeet on buffalo for a subsistence, their Reserves being situated in a country frequented more or less by wild fowl and other game of large and small size. The Department has therefore merely ministered to their actual necessities as they arose and thrown them mainly on the above resources and on the produce raised on their land for sustenance. It will thus be readily seen how difficult, and in fact impossible, it would be to induce the Blackfoot children, who are accustomed to a diet of meat and flour daily, to attend school where they would only get a meal of farinaceous food. The plan might be adopted of deducting a sufficient proportion of the shares of the children of school age from the rations deliverable to the parents for their families and have the same cooked for a mid-day meal for the pupils attending the day school. It might, however, cause considerable dissatisfaction were this to be done without the parents' consent. The presentation of cheap but showy prizes, consisting of such articles as would be specially attractive to the children, at the end of each week to regular attendants at the schools, who were otherwise deserving, would probably have a good effect in ensuring regularity and docility on the part of the pupils, and might go far towards inducing their parents to consent to the deduction of their proportionate share of rations for the mid-day meal for their children, and at the same time cause them to compel their children to attend regularly. Indeed some small remuneration might be given the parents with a view to ensure their co-operation in this much-to-be-desired end.\nThe number of children of an age to attend school in these tribes is as before stated 1,940, and estimating 40 children for each school the number of schools that should be established is 48, and these at a salary of $480 for each teacher would involve an expenditure for salaries of $480 \u00d7 48 = $23,040.00\n\nAnd for school and teachers houses, at $500 each... 24,000.00\n\nFor furniture and school material, at $100 each \u00d7 48... 4,800.00\n\nCost of clothing 1,940 children, at $10 per annum each... 19,400.00\n\nCost of providing prizes for 48 schools, at say $40 each per annum... 1,920.00\n\nRepairs and material for 48 schools, at $50 each per annum... 2,400.00\n\nTotal expense to be incurred in first instance $75,560.00\n\nAnd deducting therefrom the first cost of building and furniture... 28,800.00\n\nThe result... $46,760.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually incurred for the maintenance of the schools among the Blackfoot Nation, which, it may be here stated, comprises three bands, consisting of Blackfoot proper, Bloods and Piegan, with the tributary tribes, though not allied to the Nation by ties of consanguinity, of Sarcees.\n\nThe reserve of these last named Indians is situated about 12 miles to the south-west of Calgary, and on it there are 40 children of an age to attend school and one school in operation, the average daily attendance at which is however only five. The same measures recommended to induce a larger attendance at schools on the Blackfoot Reserves should be adopted as regards this Reserve, as these Indians are manifestly as indifferent respecting the education of their children as their Blackfoot confr\u00e8res.\n\nThe following is a statement of the expense to be incurred on the Sarcee Reserve:\n\nTo increase salary of teacher from $300 to $480 per annum... $180.00\n\nTo erect a dwelling house for the teacher... 300.00\n\nTo provide clothing for 40 children, at $10 each per annum... 400.00\n\nFor prizes for the school per annum... 40.00\n\nFor repairs and material for one school annually... 50.00\n\nTotal amount to be expended in the first instance... $970.00\n\nFrom which sum after deducting cost of building... 300.00\n\nThe result... $670.00\n\ngives the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the school.\nThe number of children of an age to attend school on the Reserves of the Blackfoot Nation and Sarcees being 1,980, the number available at 10 per cent. for transfer to industrial institutions would be 198. The institution at High River is not sufficiently large to accommodate that number of pupils were it otherwise desirable to place all the children in one institution, which it is not, as both Episcopal and Methodist missionaries, as well as Roman Catholic, have for several years been carrying on mission work on these Reserves, and it would therefore appear advisable to have another industrial school for the training of the more advanced children of adherents of the Protestant bodies whose missionaries are operating on the Reserves.\n\nIn the event of this proposition being acted upon, the expenditure for the erection of a building to accommodate 100 pupils would approximately be ........................................ $12,000.00\n\nAnd the cost of clothing, feeding and instructing in trades and for the tuition of 100 pupils at $120 each per annum, would be ............... 12,000.00\n\nCost of furniture and equipment, with school materials, say .................................................. 2,000.00\n\nFor repairs, annually, and renewing school material, furniture, &c ........................................... 1,600.00\n\nFor prizes for pupils .................................................. 300.00\n\nTotal expenditure in first instance .................. $27,300.00\n\nFrom which, after deducting cost of building and furnishing .................................................. 14,000.00\n\nThe result .................................................. $13,300.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for maintenance, and this sum added to the amount above shown to be required for maintenance of day schools, will give the additional sum to be provided annually for day schools on the Blackfoot Reserves and on the Reserves of the Sarcees, and for the proposed industrial institution, viz., $46,760 + $670 + $13,390 = $60,730.\n\nFather Lacombe\u2014\n\nThere are two Catholic schools, he says, open at work\u2014\"one at Crowfoot & one at the Pi\u00e9gans.\"\n\nHe complains that the Indian agents of Treaty 7 did \"very little to help the...\"\n\"Industrial School at\n\"High River,\" & if they had\ninterested themselves, he\nsays, there would not\nhave been so much\ndifficulty in getting pupils\nto attend; and, he adds,\nthat if the school were\nunder the auspices of\nanother denomination\nthe agent would have done\ntheir duty better.\n\nHe has tried the\nmid-day meal, & it is,\nhe says, a great inducement\neven among the Blackfeet,\nBloods, Peigan &c. He says\nthe children would not\nbe dissatisfied with a\nfarinaceous meal as it\nwould be a change,\nand the Indians would oppose\nthe deduction from their\nrations of the mid-day\nmeal for the children.\nHe considers the\nGiving some remuneration to the parents to be a plan for ensuring their cooperation.\n\nAs to the Industrial Schools for those Indians Mr. Macomb asks: \"Are we to have three Protestant institutions for one Catholic?\"\n\nRev. John M. Leau, M.A., says:\n\n\"There must surely be some mistake about the number of children of school age in this Conference\u20141940. 48 schools on the three Reserves would be a useless expenditure of money. There would not be work for more than four or five schools on the Blood Reserve with a teaching staff of 8 or 10. Young lads from 14 years of age will not attend school at the mission house owing to the immorality of the British Columbian Indians with regard to young girls applying here.\"\n\"Reserve. 4, or at most 5,\n\"central schools, will one male\n\"female teacher each, would\n\"accomplish the end desired.\"\n\"It would not be well,\nhe thinks, to deduct the mid-day\nmeal from the rations of the\nBlackfoot Nations. The meal\nfor the children of the Blackfoot\nnation should consist, he says,\nof rice, biscuit & soup. Let\nthis,\" he adds \"be an extra\nallowance for three years during\nwhich time the pupils should\nhave made progress sufficient\nto induce the parent to have\nit cut off.\"\n\nThe Methodist School\nat the Blood Reserve was not,\nhe says, closed from discouragement.\nThe teacher was found incompetent\n& was discharged. His successor\nwas dismissed. The dismissed\nteacher is contending for\nremuneration. Hence the closing\nof the school. In the meantime\nHowever \"a good two story frame building for teacher's house\" has been erected, it is intended soon to build \"a good frame school-house\". There is, he says, \"a fine bell\" \"... ready for the school\" and \"about 24 suits of clothing\" \"to be worn in school\". A teacher has been offered by the missionary society, Mr. McLean says, but has been refused as it was thought better to wait until the buildings were completed, \"believing that comfort at home will help a man with his work\", besides the Indians will take our buildings as models for their own.\n\nHon. John B. and H.\n\nEncourages the Salina for the Industrial Institution too low.\n\nProfessor Wood\u2014\n\nApproves of the suggestion\nas to deducting part of the children's share of rations for mid-day meal\nMonday & Saturday days -\nin some instances\ndeduction from rations for\nmid-day meal made.\n\nHe concurs in the\ngiving of prizes to ensure\nattendance, but says they\n\"should be to some extent\n\"instruments of education\"\nHe fears that the giving\nof remuneration to parents\nwill the same effect would\nbe an unhealthy stimulant.\n\nHe estimates the\nnumber of children at\n1600 instead of 1940, and\nthere are he says, 6 schools\nin operation - 3 in Blackfoot\n2 on the Blood, & 1 on the\nPigeon Reserve\n\nAs to the three or four\nhe thinks \"100 children would\nbe nearer to the correct\n\"number\" than 40.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bowne's estimate, the industrial school accommodation would not have to be provided for 170\u2014not 198.\n\n\"$12,000,\" he says, \"will not erect a building for 100 pupils\u2014say $35,000.\"\n\n\"If an industrial school is established in Treaty 7, should it not be done so, be under the auspices of the Church of England, which Body will have in the way of Battleford School or a non-sectarian school, while the Methodists have the Orange Orphanage\u2014and are to have a school at Battle River? The Roman Catholics have two industrial schools\u2014that at St. Albert...\n\nBesides the Church of England has, it seems to him, more necessary missions among...\"\n\"The Blackfoot tribes than any other Church.\"\nOn the Stoney Reserve, which is situated at Morleyville in this district, there are 153 children of an age to attend school and two schools are in operation. The number of children of school age would be sufficient to justify the establishment of two additional schools on this Reserve. The more advanced pupils of the day schools on the Reserve might be admitted to the Protestant industrial institution proposed to be established in the Blackfoot country.\n\nThe teachers of the day schools at present are paid at the rate of $309 each per annum. If the same be increased to $480, the additional amount required will be $189 \u00d7 2 = $360.00\n\nAnd should two more schools be established, the salaries of the teachers of the same at $480 each per annum will be 960.00\n\nAnd if residences be provided for the 2 teachers at present employed at say $200 each, the cost will be 600.00\n\nAnd for schoolhouses and residences for 2 new teachers at $500 each 1,000.00\n\nThe expense connected with feeding 153 children at $8 each per annum will be $153 \u00d7 $8 = 1,224.00\n\nAnd with clothing the same number of children, 153 \u00d7 $10 = 1,530.00\n\nCost of furniture and equipment with school material of the 2 new schools, at $100 each 200.00\n\nCost of prizes for the 4 schools, at $15 each per annum 60.00\n\nRepairs and renewal of equipment of 4 schools, at $50 each per annum 200.00\n\nThe total amount to be in the first instance provided will be $6,134.00\n\nFrom this sum should be deducted cost of buildings and furnishing 1,800.00\n\nAnd the result $4,334.00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for schools on this Reserve.\n\nThere is also the Wesley orphanage for the Reserve.\nDistrict of Alberta - Northern Part.\nPeace Hills Agency.\n\nIn the northern part of the District of Alberta, the first Indian agency north of Calgary is that of the Peace or Bear Hills, where we have five Reserves, with children thereon of an age to attend school to the number of 215, distributed as follows:\u2014On Sampson's Reserve, where there is one school in operation, 69 children; Ermineskin's Reserve, 31 children, and no school; Bobtail's Reserve, 25 children, without a school; Louis Bull's Reserve, 54 children and no school; Sharphead's Reserve, 56 children and one school. The number of children on the Reserves of Ermineskin, Bobtail and Louis Bull, where no schools at present exist, is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school on each Reserve, and the number of children (69) on Sampson's Reserve is sufficient to warrant the establishment of an additional school thereon.\n\nThe salaries paid the teachers at present employed in this agency averaged, as elsewhere, $300 each per annum.\n\nShould it be decided to increase them to $480, the additional amount required to do so, in the case of the teachers at present employed will be $180 x 2 = $360 00\n\nAnd should 4 new schools be established, the salaries of 4 teachers at $480 each per annum will be 4 x $480 = $1,920 00\n\nThe cost of building residences for the two teachers now employed will be, at $300 each = $600 00\n\nAnd the cost of erecting schoolhouses and residences for 4 new teachers at $500 each = $2,000 00\n\nCost of furnishing and supplying school material to 4 new schools, at $100 each = $400 00\n\nCost of renewing supply of material and of repairs annually for 6 schools, at $50 each = $300 00\n\nCost of supplying a mid-day meal for 215 children at $8 each per annum = $1,720 00\n\nCost of clothing same number, at $10 each per annum = $2,150 00\n\nCost of prizes for 6 schools, at $15 each per annum = $90 00\n\n$9,540 00\n\nDeducting first cost of buildings and furniture = $3,000 00\n\nThe result = $6,540 00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for maintenance of day schools in this agency.\n\nFather Sacrambe:\nThere is one Catholic School at Ermineskin.\nHumble and Dunleavy say:\n\n\"Meaddy Bull's Band has\nhad a school for some time.\nA school has been\norganized for Ermine Skin.\nPotter's Band is so broken up\nby which means that it is\nquestionable whether a school\ncould be supported therein; it\nwas intended that they should\ngo to the school for Ermine\nSkin. The location of the\nfarm on Swampy Reserve\nwould make it difficult\nto secure attendance for\nanother day at school.\"\nEdmonton Agency.\n\nThe adjoining Indian district, known as the Edmonton Agency, embraces 6 Reserves, having 299 children of an age to attend school, viz., on Pass-pass-chase's Reserve 60 children, on Alexander's 39, on Michel's 15, on Alexis' 30, on Enoch's 46, on Ironhead's 15.\n\nOn each of the Reserves of Pass-pass-chase, Alexander and Enoch there is a school; on those of Michel, Alexis, and Ironhead there are no schools. On the Reserve of Pass-pass-chase there is a sufficient number of children (60) of school age to warrant the establishment of an additional school.\n\nIf this school be established and a school on each of the three Reserves now without any\u20144 new schools will have to be provided for. And if the salaries of the teachers of the 3 schools now in operation be raised from $300 to $480 each per annum, the additional expenses to be provided for will be:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Increase of $180 to the salary of each of 3 teachers                | $540.00|\n| 4 new teachers, at $480 each                                        | 1,920.00|\n| For residences to be provided for the 3 teachers at present employed at $300 each | 900.00 |\n| And 4 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences at $500 each         | 2,000.00|\n| Furniture and school material for 4 new schools, at $100 each       | 400.00 |\n| For repairs to buildings and renewal of school material annually, at $50 each, for 7 schools | 350.00 |\n| Prizes for 7 schools, at $15 each per annum                         | 105.00 |\n| Providing mid-day meal for 299 pupils, at $8 each per annum          | 1,672.00|\n| Providing clothing for same number, at $10 each per annum            | 2,090.00|\n\nTotal amount to be in the first instance provided $9,977.00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of buildings and of furniture $3,300.00\n\nThe result $6,677.00 shows the additional amount to be annually provided for day schools in this agency.\n\nFather Lacombe\u2014\n\nThese Indians are mostly Catholics, he says, and the teachers should be of the same faith.\n\nThe Honble Mr. Dewdney says, \"Pass-pass-chase Band...\"\nhas been broken up by withdrawal. Rio held. Band is too scattered on the Reserve to make attendance at a day so hard possible. Mexico & Rio heads bands are 'mountain stories' & the two chiefs by hunting which causes absence from their Reserve.\nSaddle Lake Agency.\n\nThe Saddle Lake Indian Agency comprehends the seven Reserves lying east of the Edmonton Agency, and they contain 250 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows: On Saddle Lake Reserve 39 children, Muskegawatis 23, Blue Quill's 13, Seenum or Pecan's 112, Chippewayen's 31, Antoine's 30, Peeay-sis 11. On three of these Reserves, viz., at Saddle Lake, Seenum's, Peeay-sis, there are schools in operation, on the other four Reserves there are no schools. The large number of children (112) on Seenum's Reserve makes it apparent that 3 schools instead of 1 should be in operation there. If therefore 2 additional schools be established on that Reserve and a school on each of the Reserves at present without any provision must be made for 6 new schools, and estimating expenses on a similar basis to that recommended to be adopted in other agencies, the following provision will have to be made:\n\nTo increase 3 teachers' salaries from $300 to $480 per annum $540 00\n\nTo provide salaries for 6 new teachers, at $480 - 2,880 00\n\nResidences for 3 teachers, at $300 each - 900 00\n\n6 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - 3,000 00\n\nFurniture and school material for 6 new schools, at $100 each - 600 00\n\nFor repairs to buildings and renewal of school material, at $50 each per annum, for 9 schools - 450 00\n\nPrizes for 9 schools, at $15 each per annum - 135 00\n\nProviding mid-day meal for 250 pupils, at $8 each per annum - 2,000 00\n\nProviding clothing for the same number, at $10 each per annum - 2,500 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance $13,095 00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of building and furniture - 4,500 00\n\nThe result $8,595 00\n\nwill show the additional amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of schools in this Agency.\n\nHerb. E. Dewdney says:\n\n\"Perhaps a school may be needed for Muskegawatis. A Boarding School would best suit for the Saddle Lake & Blue Quill's Reserves, while Hail Lake has sufficient in...\"\ntwo schools.\n\nPegase's band is broken up by withdrawal, & Chipewayan & Beaver Lake Indians are still hunting. Some of the children of these tribes might be got for a boarding school.\nIn the 3 Indian Agencies whose school matters have been last under review the number of school children is 674, which number, allowing at the rate of 10 per cent for attendance at an industrial institution which it has been decided shall be established in the Peace Hills district, would give say 68 children for entry into that establishment. It is to be a Protestant institution\u2014the Roman Catholic Indians of the different Reserves having the benefit of the very excellent school at St. Albert for the industrial training and higher education of their children.\n\nFather Lacombe says:\n\n\"It would be desirable and important that the school at St. Albert should be put on the same footing as other Industrial School.\"\n\nSpeaking generally he says there are three Catholic institutions in operation & two Protestant in the N.W.T. & it is proposed to establish three more Protestant Schools.\n\nHerbert E. Dewdney\u2014\n\nThinks \"this school should be established at Edmonton rather than at Battle River.\" He makes the following estimate:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Erection      | $5,000 |\n| Maintenance   | $3,000 |\n| Furniture     | $3,000 |\n| Total         | $11,000 |\n\nTotal Cost $16,300\nIn the Onion Lake Agency there are 7 bands, having Reserves located as follows:\u2014Seecascooche's Band on Onion Lake, Kimosayo's Band on Beaver Lake, Pemmetah-bah-soos' at Fort Pitt, Wee-nis-tacoo-sea-wasis' on Stoney Lake, On-pow-bay-os' on Frog Lake, Pus-ke-ab-ke-we-nimo's on Moose Lake, K-e-de-win's on Frog Lake. These Indian bands since the troubles of 1863 have been somewhat disorganized, and consequently they have not remained upon their Reserves; those of them, however, who were disposed to farm removed to the Sekaskootch Reserve, and the residue engaged in hunting. On the latter Reserve there are 79 children of an age to attend school, but there is no school in operation. Two schools might, with advantage, be thought, be established for the benefit of that number of children.\n\nThis, if done, will involve for the salaries of two teachers, at $480 each, an expenditure of $969.00\n\nTwo schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each $1,000.00\n\nFurnishing two schools and supplying material for the same at $100 each $200.00\n\nProviding prizes for two schools, at $15 per annum each $30.00\n\nRenewing school material and for repairs annually, at $50 for each school $100.00\n\nProviding mid-day meal for 70 children, at $8 each per annum $560.00\n\nClothing same number, at $10 each per annum $700.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance $3,559.00\n\nFrom which after deducting cost of buildings and of furnishing and equipping schools $1,200.00\n\nThe balance $2,359.00 shows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of two schools on that Reserve.\n\nSome of the pupils when they become sufficiently advanced in their studies might be transferred from the day schools to the industrial school now in operation at Battleford.\n\nFather Lacombe adds here:\n\n\"If they are Protestant, and the Catholic to a Catholic Institution\"\n\nHumble E. Dewdney says:\n\n\"The School is in operation [on Sekaskootch Reserve].\"\nand another is being estimated for for the year 1887-8.\n\nHe seems also to have formed advanced pupils to Industrial Institution at Battleford.\nBattleford Agency.\n\nAttached to the Indian Agency at Battleford there are seven Reserves, viz., the Stoneys, having 37 children of an age to attend school; Red Pheasant's with 28 children; Sweet Grass having 43 children; Poundmaker's where there are 36 children; Little Pine's with 35 children; Moosomin's having 15 children and Thunder Child's with 41 children. On each of these Reserves, except Little Pine's, there is a school in operation. The number of children (35) on the Reserve of Little Pine is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school therein.\n\nThe average salary paid teachers in this Agency is the same as that paid elsewhere in the North-West, viz., $300 per annum. And estimating the additional expenditure to be incurred in order to impart greater efficiency to the schools, the following statement will show the provision required to be made:\n\nTo increase 6 teachers' salaries from $300 to $480 each, $180 x 6 = $1,080.00\n\nTo erect houses for 6 teachers, at $300 each = $1,800.00\n\nFor salary of 1 new teacher = $480.00\n\nNew school-house and teacher's residence = $500.00\n\nFurnishing and providing material for 1 new school = $100.00\n\nTo renew school material and for repairs annually for 7 schools, at $50 each = $350.00\n\nTo provide a mid-day meal for 235 pupils, at $8 each per annum = $1,880.00\n\nTo provide clothing for same number, at $10 each per annum = $2,350.00\n\nTo supply prizes for 7 schools, at $16 each per annum = $105.00\n\nTotal = $8,615.00\n\nDeducting therefrom the first cost of building and furniture = $2,400.00\n\nThe result = $6,215.00\n\nshows the additional amount to be annually incurred, in order to maintain the 7 schools of this Agency.\n\nHubley E. Dewdney says:\n\n\"It would be well to have a Roman Catholic school at Little Pine's so the men intended for Poundmaker's - it is too far away for the former.\"\nIn the Duck Lake Agency there are 13 Reserves, and, so far as known, 357 children of an age to attend school on them, distributed as follows:\n\nOn the Reserve of Attakakooop, 40; on Mistowasis, 34; Petequaqua's, 10; Beardy's, 31; Okomas', 16; One Arrow's, 18; Wm. Twatt's, 45; John Smith's, 35; James Smith's, 65; Che-keas-ta-pay-sin's (number not known); White Cap's, 15; Kermeenootayo's, 45; Kopahawakemun's (number not known).\n\nOn each of the Reserves of Attakakooop, Mistowasis, John Smith and James Smith, a school has been established. On each of the 9 other Reserves there is no school, though with the exception possibly of that of Petequaqua, there is a sufficient number of children of school age to justify the establishment of a school.\n\nProceeding upon the same basis as in other Agencies, the amount required to increase the salaries of the 4 teachers at present employed from $300 to $480, $180 x 4, will be $720.00\n\nTo provide salaries for 9 new teachers, at $480 each per annum, $480 x 9 = 4,320.00\n\nFor residences for 4 teachers at present employed, at $300 = 1,200.00\n\nTo provide 9 new school and teachers' houses, at $500 each = 4,500.00\n\nTo furnish and supply material for 9 new schools, at $100 each = 900.00\n\nFor repairs and to renew material annually for 13 schools, at $50 each = 650.00\n\nFor prizes for 13 schools, at $15 each per annum = 195.00\n\nTo provide a mid-day meal for 357 pupils, at $8 each per annum = 2,856.00\n\nTo provide clothing for the same number, at $10 each per annum = 3,570.00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance, $18,911.00\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of building and furnishing = 6,690.00\n\nThe result = $12,311.00\n\nshows the additional amount necessary to be provided for the maintenance of schools in this Agency.\n\nHumble Mr. Dewdney says:\n\n\"At Petequaqua's there is a school for years, with an average attendance this year of 21 children. Twatt, Che-keas-ta-pay-sin & Kopahawakemun are still...\"\nhunting and too unsettled for day school. Kenowootago - a school has been authorized for. Beardy, Okemasis & Me Carrow need school advantages.\"\nIn the Pas Indian Agency there are 6 Reserves, with 230 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Grand Rapids of the Saskatchewan, 20; Chemewawin, 35; Moose Lake, 30; The Pas, 100; Pas Mountain, 30; Cumberland, 15. There is a school on each of these Reserves, excepting on that at Pas Mountain. On the Reserve at The Pas there are two schools in operation.\n\nEstimating for the schools in this agency, on the same basis as has been done for schools in other agencies, the following statement will show the additional expense involved:\n\nTo increase salaries of teachers at present employed from $800 to $480 each per annum, $1,260 00\n\nTo provide salary for teacher at Pas Mountain 480 00\n\nTo provide houses for 7 teachers, at $300 each 2,100 00\n\nAnd 1 school and teacher's house at Pas Mountain 500 00\n\nTo furnish and equip school at that point 100 00\n\nFor repairs and renewal of material annually for 8 schools, at $50 each 400 00\n\nPrizes for 8 schools, at $15 each per annum 120 00\n\nTo provide mid-day meal for 230 pupils, at $8 each per annum 1,840 00\n\nTo provide clothing for same number, at $10 each per annum 2,300 00\n\n$9,100 00\n\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of building and furniture 2,700 00\n\nThe result $6,400 00 shows the additional amount to be annually incurred to maintain the schools of this agency.\n\nThomas Hart, Indian Teacher in this Agency suggests the establishment, on a Central Reserve in the Agency, of what he calls a \"Training School\", for the accommodation of 50 pupils between 16-18 years of age\u2014boys & girls. In addition to the teaching of the ordinary school curriculum.\nConcerning these boys taught farming, gardening, the care of stock &c., through carpentry &c., the girls cooking, sewing, washing &c., dyeing.\n\nThis estimate of the expense of building & conducting such a school is:\n\nBuilding & furnishing $1000-\nProvision 1100-\nClothing 1500-\nSeed, stock, implements etc. 500-\nSupplies 100-\n\nSalaries:\nPrincipal 750-\nAss't Principal 500-\nMatron 500 1750\n\n$5,950\n\nAfter the first year the expenses would be $200 less per annum. Mr. Hart offers to take the Principalship of such a school & teach at the same time as Inspector of the other schools in the agency. (see file 45346)\nIndian school matters in this Province are in a very unsatisfactory condition, very few schools being in existence, and those in operation are, for the most part, not conducted in an efficient manner, nor are they kept regularly open. As a consequence of the very small size of many of the Reserves in the Province, and the few families resident thereon, the number of children of an age to attend school on these Reserves is too limited to justify the establishing of schools thereon. If, therefore, the children in Reserves so situated are to receive the benefits of education, the only feasible plan to adopt for the accomplishment of that object will be to group the small Reserves as school districts, and to establish at central points in them, boarding schools of the primary class, at which the children of school age would be educated.\n\nThe industries, viz., fishing, seal hunting, and hop-picking, pursued by these Indians, occasion frequent and prolonged terms of absence of the families from their villages; and these methods of obtaining a livelihood are very successful, and it is, therefore, unlikely that the Indians would abandon them for any other, and these absences from the Reserves are, therefore, likely to continue.\n\nIt is difficult to suggest what course should be followed under the circumstances described to secure to the children whose names are, or may yet be, placed on the rolls of the day schools continuous instruction. The Indian heads of families who engage in fishing and seal hunting could scarcely be persuaded to leave their wives and children at home. The objection would probably be raised by the Indians, and which, it must be admitted, would be a proper one, that if their boys did not accompany them in their fishing and sealing expeditions they would fail to acquire a knowledge of industries so essential for their maintenance in the future. The women also obtain employment at the canneries in the cleaning and curing of fish, and their earnings are, therefore, also a considerable item in the family income.\n\nThe maximum salary paid teachers of Indian schools in the Province, based upon an annual allowance of $12 per capita for an attendance of 25 children, is $300.\n\nOwing, however, to the very small average attendance and the irregular manner in which the schools are kept, the salary usually paid does not exceed $200.\n\nThe amount of remuneration paid to the teachers should, it is considered, be a fixed sum, and the amount of salary proposed to be paid teachers in other portions of the Dominion will not, it is thought, when the expense of living in this Province is taken into account, be regarded as excessive compensation notwithstanding that, as a consequence of the long absences of families from the villages, the schools may be closed for a considerable portion of the year. With a view to induce the children to attend school regularly when they are at home, prizes for regularity of attendance and for assiduity should be given those meritting the same. Residences for the teachers should also be erected, and a mid-day meal should be provided for the pupils. But owing to the long terms of absence of the children from the villages it is probable that no more than a supply of provisions for 8 months will be required. It is not thought that it will be necessary to provide clothing for the children attending day school in this Province as their parents are well enough off to clothe them.\nRev. A. J. Hall\n\nThinks \"no teachers\n\"salary in B.C. should be\n\"less than $20 per an.\n\"she should if possible be\n\"married & certainly be\n\"provided with a suitable\n\"residence near the school\"\n\nProfessor Wood\n\nThinks \"a live book\n\"inspector of schools would\n\"do good work in B.C.\n\nIndian agent Sonos\n\nConsiders the uniform\n\"too good a thing to be\n\"dispensed with in B.C.\n\"Of course,\" he adds, \"the\n\"Cowichan Indians\" could\n\"buy for it... I would take\n\"a pride in doing so.\"\n\nHe points out the\n\"necessity of doing something\n\"specials for the orphans.\n\"The Boarding schools should\n\"make it a first duty too\n\"care for orphans; and if the\nGov't, he adds, showed not see its way to carrying out all the suggestions made in the Report, something showed \"be done for the orphanage even on a small scale.\"\n\nBishop D'Herbomez -\n\nThe Lordship take his missionaries are of opinion that day schools would be of very little benefit to the majority of the Indians of B.C., for, as the Indians owing to the want of wood and in their Reserve have to move about to seek employment from wheresoever the schools would be without properies the greater part of the time; and that any industrial schools where the pupils are lodged, boarded & clothed will meet the exigencies of their condition and be of benefit to the Indians.\nHis lordship thinks that one or two schools of this kind in each Agency would be enough to begin with, and that children having a liking and some aptitude for education could, with the consent of their parents, be received; but he adds, to insist on the children not returning to their own tribes when the schools, as the Indians are two fond of their children to acquiesce in such separation. He points out the necessity of having these schools under denominational control, if the good work carried on successfully by the missionaries is not to be undone; and he recommends that the Kootenay School be placed in charge of the Sisters of Charity of Providence of Montreal.\n\nHe calls attention to the success which has attended the U.S. Govt Schools in Washington Territory & Montana in charge of the Sisters, and he says the Sisters would place the Kootenay School on an equal footing.\nCowichan Agency:\n\nCommencing with the Cowichan Agency, which embraces the northern portion of Vancouver Island, thirty-seven Reserves are comprised therein, with 430 children old enough to attend school. But, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Mission School near the Comeakin Village, the Church of England School on Kuper Island, and the Methodist School at Nanaimo, there are no schools in operation in this Agency, with its 37 Reserves and large number of children of school age.\n\nOn each of the following Reserves the number of children of an age to attend is sufficient to justify the establishment of a school, viz.: Cher-er-no, where there are 18 children; Songhees 36; Panquechin 14; Tsart-ilip 14; Clem-clem-a-late 20; Quamichan 45; Somenos 18; Lyach-sun 17. The Roman Catholic Mission School at Comeakin draws its pupils from the Reserves of Tsai-out, where there are 8 children of school age; Comeakin 8; Clem-clem-a-lats 20; Klenipsin 8; Koh-si-lath 6; Quamichan 45; Someno 18; Hellel 5. But the aggregate number (118) of children of school age on these Reserves is too many for one school to properly instruct, and it is therefore submitted that, leaving to that institution the instruction of the children from the small Reserves, from which it at present draws some of its pupils, and who number together 35, a school might, with advantage, be established at each of the larger Reserves, as previously suggested.\n\nThe Church of England School on Kuper Island instructs the children from the Reserves at Li-mal-che, where there are 4 children of school age, and Pen-e-la-luts, having 40 children.\n\nThe Methodist School at Nanaimo draws its pupils from the Reserve near that place, where there are 40 children of school age.\n\nThe expense involved as respects schools in the Cowichan Agency will therefore be as follows:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries of 11 teachers, at $480 each per annum                      | $5,280.00 |\n| 8 new schools and teachers' houses, at $500 each                     | 4,000.00 |\n| Furnishing and supplying material for 8 schools, at $100 each        | 800.00  |\n| Repairs and renewing supply of material annually, at $50 each for 11 schools | 550.00 |\n| Prizes for 11 schools, at $30 each                                   | 330.00  |\n| Residences for teachers of 3 schools already established, at $300 each | 900.00  |\n| Supplying mid-day meal for 345 pupils for 8 months, at $5.32 each    | 1,835.40 |\n\nTotal expenditure in the first instance: $18,695.36\n\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of buildings and furnishing schools: $5,700.00\n\nThe result: $7,995.36\n\ngives the total annual expense to be incurred for day schools in this agency.\nOn the residue of the Reserves there are 72 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u2014At Sooke 7 children, at Esquimalt 5, at Malahat 2, at Tse-kaun 9, at Kil-pau-hus none, at Sika-meek 7, at Kue-leets 11, at Tsusie 10, at Sno-no-nus 6, at Qua-li-cum 5, at Pun-ti-ledge 6, at Comox 4, at Ga-di-a-no Island, Mayne Island, Haitch Point and Discovery Island 4. It will be observed that on none of these Reserves would the number of children warrant the establishment of a day school. One or two boarding schools of the primary class should therefore be established at some central point or points, in the selection of which the Indian Agent for the locality should be consulted.\n\nAnd if a central boarding school of the primary class be established as suggested, for the children of the smaller Reserves, who, as before stated, number in the aggregate 95\u2014the cost of such an establishment will be as follows:\u2014\n\n| Item                                      | Cost       |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cost of building                          | $4,000.00  |\n| Cost of furniture and school material     | 1,000.00   |\n| Cost of maintenance and tuition of 95 children, at $100 each per annum | 9,500.00   |\n| Cost of repairs and renewing material annually | 200.00    |\n| **Total first cost**                      | **$14,700.00** |\n| And deducting cost of building and furniture | 5,200.00 |\n\nThe result shows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of the institution. And that sum, $9,500 + $7,955 = $17,455, will represent the amount to be annually provided for the education of the Indian children of the Cowichan Agency.\nThe West Coast Agency of Vancouver Island comprises 18 Reserves, with 613 children of an age to attend school, but, with the exception of the 3 schools conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church at Kyu-haht, where there are 75 children of school age, Hesquiaht, where there are 46, and Ah-hon-saht, where there are 50, there are no schools in the agency; although on each of the Reserves, excepting 4, there is a sufficient number of children to justify the establishment of a school. Besides those on the 4 Reserves on which schools have been already established, there are children of an age to attend school on each of the following Reserves, and of the number stated after each:\u2014Chais-a-le-saht, 28; Noo-ch-aht-i-laht and Eh-ab-i-saht, 60; Moo-neh-saht, 44; Match-it-laht, 14; Kel-se-maht, 30; Cla-o-quah-t, 50; E-weh-nilh-caht, 49; Too-qu-aht, 7; Ou-aht, 49; Ow-chub-dis-aht, 10; Ts-e-shaht and O-pitch-e-saht, 50; Nil-te-naht, 50; Pa-che-e-naht, 10.\n\nThe methods followed by these Indians to obtain a livelihood are about the same as those of the Cowichan Bands. Consequently school matters in this Agency should be dealt with in a similar manner; and the expenses may therefore be similarly calculated\u2014that is to say:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries of 14 teachers, at $480 each                                | $6,720   |\n| Eleven new schoolhouses and teachers' residences                    |          |\n| at $500 each                                                        | 5,500    |\n| Furniture and material for 11 new schools, at $100 each             |          |\n| Repairs and renewing supply of material annually, at $50 each        | 700      |\n| Prizes for 14 schools at $30 each                                   | 420      |\n| Residences for teachers of 3 schools already established, at $300 each| 900      |\n| Supplying mid-day meal for 572 children for eight months, at $5.32 per capita | 3,043    |\n\nTotal expenditure in first instance: $18,883\n\nFrom which after deducting first cost of buildings and furniture: $7,500\n\nThe result: $10,883\n\nshows the total amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in the West Coast Agency. If a central boarding school of the primary class be established for the children of the smaller Reserves, who number 41, the expense connected therewith will probably consist of the following items:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Cost of building                                                     | $2,500   |\n| Cost of furniture and school material                                | 750      |\n| Maintenance and tuition of 41 children, at $100 each per annum       | 4,100    |\n| Repairs and renewing material annually                               | 135      |\n\nTotal first cost: $7,485\n\nDeducting cost of building and furniture: $3,250\n\nThe balance: $4,235\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the institution and that sum, $4,235 + $10,883.04, = $15,118.04, represents the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of day schools and of a primary boarding school in this agency.\nParliament at its last Session voted an appropriation for the establishment of an Industrial Indian School on Vancouver Island, it was only calculated for the maintenance and instruction in industries of 25 children, and as a commencement it will probably be sufficient but it will be readily seen from the number of children of an age to attend school in the two agencies into which the Island has been divided, and the school affairs whereof have just been under discussion, that accommodation will be required for a much larger number of pupils; the aggregate number of children of school age in the two agencies being 958, the proportion at 10 per cent. which should be admissible to the higher school would give in round numbers 96 pupils, for whom provision should be made.\n\nThe expense involved in the same would therefore be:\n\nCost of building, supplying school material and furnishing the same $10,000.00\n\nMaintenance, clothing, lodging, tuition and instruction in industries of 96 children, at $120 each per annum $11,520.00\n\nRepairs and renewal of material annually $1,000.00\n\nTotal $22,520.00\n\nDeducting therefrom the first cost of building and furnishing $11,000.00\n\nAnd the result $11,520.00\n\nwill show the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the establishment and that sum, $11,520 + $24,200, being cost of maintaining day and primary boarding schools in the Cowichan Agency + $15,118.04, being cost of a similar service in the West Coast Agency will show the whole amount, $50,838.04, to be provided annually for the education and industrial training of the Indian children of Vancouver Island.\n\nHagolin Schultz thinks the estimate for building Industrial School to \"insufficient\"\nThe Kwaw-kewlth Agency embraces all the bands and Reserves on the south coast of the mainland, and contains 333 children of school age, distributed among the 25 Reserves in the agency in the following manner:\n\nAt Ah-wah-koos 7, Ah-kwaw-ab-mish 14, Ah-wah-nt-tla-la 11, Ke-o-pe-e-no 3, Ko-se-ke-moe 13, Klah-wit-sis 18, Klaski-ne 3, Kwawt-se-ni 8, Kwawshe-lah 10, Kwaw-wax-i-nuck 13, Kwaw-kewlth 7, Ke-ah-kah 6, Ke-ahkah (Lunch-kosil-tack) 10, Kwick-so-te-no 14, Mah-tewlth-pe 7, Mah-wa-lil-le-kullah 19, Na-knock-to 18, Nim-kush 24, Noo-we-tee 21, Tah-noch-tench 18, Tsah-waw-ti-neuch 22, Waw-lickwaw-Kewlth 10, Waw-let-sum 15, Wee-wai-ai-kum 15, We-wai-ai-kai 32.\n\nThe morals of these Indians are so depraved that in the opinion of the undersigned the only course to pursue, if their children are to be rescued from the path of infamy on which their wretched parents set them as soon as they arrive at years of maturity, will be to establish central boarding schools and to endeavor to induce the parents to allow their children, as soon as they are of an age to attend school, to be lodged thereat, educated, clothed and fed. The expense will be heavy\u2014but to establish day schools in such a community would be worse than useless, as the female children are used by their parents, so soon as they arrive at puberty, for purposes of traffic of the worst description, and the boys by the terrible example set them by their parents\u2014which it may be stated is the rule and not the exception with these Indians\u2014would become as depraved as themselves, notwithstanding all the instructions given them at a day school. If the proposition to establish boarding schools is approved of, the approximate expenses involved will be as follows:\u2014\n\nBuilding, supplying with school material and furniture, 3 boarding schools for 111 children at each, 333 in all $30,000 00\n\nFor maintenance, including clothing and tuition of 333 children, at $120 each per annum $39,960 00\n\nFor rent-wal of furniture and school material for each school at $800 each per annum $2,400 00\n\nTotal of first expenditure $72,360 00\n\nDeducting therefrom first cost of building and furnishing $30,000 00\n\nThe result $42,360 00\n\nwill represent the amount to be annually provided for education in the Agency.\n\nShould it, however, be considered advisable to establish day schools in this Agency notwithstanding the representations made respecting the morals of the people, each of the following Reserves would appear to have a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school. Ah-kwah-ah-mish, 14 children; Ke-se-ke-moe, 13; Klah-wit-sis, 18; Kwaw-waw-i-mich, 13; Kwick-so-te-no, 14; Mah-wa-lil-le-kul-lah, 19; Na-knock-to, 18; Noo-we-tee, 21; Ta-nock-teuch, 18; Tsah-waw-ti-neuch, 22; Waw-let-sum, 15; Wee-wai-ai-kum, 15; We-wai-ai-kai, 32.\n\nAt Nim-cush, where there are 24 children of school age, at We-wai-ai-kai, where there are 32, and at Kwaw-kewlth, where there are only 7, schools have been established by the Church Missionary Society. At the last named point a schoolhouse has been recently built.\nThe number of children of school age on the Reserves above named, having on each a sufficient number of children of school age, but on which no schools have, as yet, been established, is 200, and on the 3 Reserves where schools exist, 63, making 263 children of an age to attend school. And the number of schools to be established, allowing one for each Reserve, would be 12. The expenditure involved would therefore be as follows:\n\n- Salaries of 15 teachers at $480 each................. $7,200.00\n- 12 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each.......................... 6,000.00\n- 3 teachers' residences, at $300 each, in connection with schools already established.................. 900.00\n- Furniture and school material for 12 new schools, at $100 each.................................. 1,200.00\n- For repairs and renewal of material for 15 schools, at $50 each per annum.......................... 750.00\n- Prizes, 15 schools, at $30 each per annum.................. 450.00\n- Supplying mid-day meal for 263 children for 8 months, at $5.82 each.............................. 1,399.16\n\nTotal sum to be provided in the first instance $15,019.16\nAfter deducting first cost of building and furniture 8,100.00\n\nThe result .................................................. $6,919.16 shows the amount to be annually provided if day schools are established.\n\nThe children of school age on the smaller Reserves number 77, and if a central boarding school of the primary class be established for the education of these children, the following expenditure will have to be incurred:\n\n- Cost of building........................................... $5,000.00\n- Cost of furniture and school apparatus............... 1,000.00\n- Maintenance and tuition of 70 children, at $100 each per annum.......................... 7,000.00\n- Cost of repairs and of renewal of school materials annually........................................ 270.00\n\nThe total sum to be provided will be.............. $18,270.00\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of building and furniture........................................ 6,000.00\n\nThe result .................................................. $7,270.00 will show the amount to be annually provided to keep the institution in operation, and that sum, $7,270 + $6,919.16 = $14,189, represents the cost of education in the Kwaw-kewith Agency, should day schools and a primary boarding school be established.\n\nRev. J.B. Fraser\n\nUnless the children could be compelled to attend, it would be useless, he says, to build & equip schools.\nRev. A. J. Hall says,\nThe reference to the\nimmorality of these Indians\n\"is only too true\".\nHe suggests compulsory\neducation which might\nbe effected by the Indian\nAgent imposing a fine upon\nthose parents whose\nchildren were continually\nabsent without cause.\nIt would not be necessary\nto do this often\u2014perhaps\nnot twice. The Indians, he adds,\nfrequently call their girls\nout of schools &upbraid\nthem for wishing to attend\n\"the orphanage\", he says,\n\"since he made wards of the\nIndian Dept & placed in\na Central boarding school\nremain there till they are\nmarried.

He then \"tried the boys\" with more success than in any other part of his work. It was from this school the lad graduated who now runs his steam sawmill; and in most of the boys he has discovered an aptitude for mechanics.\n\n\"The experience of ten years compels him,\" he declares, \"to say that no permanent benefit can result from any education so long as the corrupt & baneful system of prostitution is allowed to exist\u2014it is the support of this system which drives our young women to live a life of shame, & it supplies an incentive for the illicit...\"\n\"Sale of intoxicants still so prevalent among these people.\"\nIn the New Westminster Agency there are 50 Reserves, having on them 464 children of an age to attend school. On each of the following the number of children of an age to attend school would appear to be sufficient to justify the establishment of a school thereon.\u2014Mission Burrard Islet, where there are 39 children of school age, Skwawmish, Howe Sound, having 30 children of school age, False Creek 12, Musqueam 16, Sarassen 18, Semi-ha-mo 13, Langley 14, Che-he-le 14, Pemberton Meadows 12, Che-am 14, Yale 13, See-helt 20, Sli-a-mon 22, New Westminster 14. The aggregate number of children of an age to attend school on these Reserves is 242.\n\nOn each of the following reserves the number of children of an age to attend school is too small to warrant one being established: Seymour Creek, where there are only 2 children; Capatano Creek, 8 children; No. 3 Reserve, Burrard Inlet, 7; Coyunitan, 4; Ke-it-sey, 10; Whenaok, 3; Mats-qui, 8; Sumas, No. 1, reserve 7; Sumas, No. 2, 8; Sumas, No. 3, 6; Ne-cam-en, 4; Syn-can, 4; Harrison River Mouth, 9; Douglas Lake, 10; E-mal-com, 8; Skuk-rum-chuck, 9; Sknl-teen, 7; Sy-nah, 8; Sy-ne-hal-lo, 4; Hoyn-o-put, 4; Assylets, 5; Skuay, 4; Skaw-kule, 5; Zach-y-you, 6; Toylee, 5; Pop-cum, 2; Sy-nat-lete 5; Show-al-le, 6; O-ha-mille, 9; Hope, 11; En-e-woose, 8; Texas Lake, 6; Ruby Creek, 4; Trap-al-yer Flat, 4; Cla-hoose, 8; Waddington Harbor, 4.

Should it be decided to establish day schools on each of the 14 Reserves above enumerated having a sufficient number of children of school age on it, the following expenditure will have to be incurred:\n\nFor salaries of 14 teachers, at $480 each - $6,720 00\n14 new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each - 7,000 00\nFurniture and school material for 14 schools, at $100 each - 1,400 00\nRepairs and renewal of material annually for 14 schools, at $50 each - 700 00\nPrizes for 14 schools at $30 each per annum - 420 00\nSupplying mid-day meal to 242 children for 8 months, at $5.32 each - 1,287 44\n\nTotal amount to be provided - $17,527 44\nFrom which, after deducting first cost of buildings and furniture - 8,400 00\n\nThe balance - $9,127 44\n\nwill show the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of day schools in this agency. (Continued next page)\nAnd should central boarding schools of the primary class be established for the education of the children on the 36 smaller reserves the number of children on each of which is not sufficient to justify the establishment of a day school, two at least of such boarding schools would be required, the number of children so situated being 222.\n\nAllowing one-half of that number to each establishment the expenditure on account of the same would be:\n\nBuildings, school material and furniture for 2 boarding schools with 111 pupils at each, 222 in all $20,000.00\n\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 222 children, at $120 each per annum $26,640.00\n\nRenewing furniture and school material and for repairs for each school, at $800 each per annum $1,600.00\n\nTotal of first expenditure $48,240.00\n\nAnd deducting first cost of building and furniture $20,000.00\n\nAnd the balance $28,240.00\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the two establishments, and this sum, $28,240 + $9,127.44 = $37,867.44, represents the full amount of the cost of educating the children of this agency.\nThe Kamloops and Okanagan Agencies consist of 16 Reserves, having 252 children of an age to attend school on them, distributed as follows:\n\n- On the Reserve at Hal-a-at, 29 children; at Haltkum, 30; at Ku-a-at, 15; at Chue-chu-way-ha, 10; at Ke-re-me-us, 12; at Na-a-th, 30; at N-kam-iss, 6; at N-kam-ap-lis, 25; at Nyis-kat, 4; at Pen-tie-ton, 23; at Quin-sha-atin, 5; at Quis-han-ahit, 9; Shen-nos-quan-kin, 10; Ap-a-ha-min, 33; A-pal-lam-cheen, 10; Yoht, 1.\n\nFrom the foregoing enumeration it will be observed that only on five out of sixteen Reserves is there a sufficient number of children of school age on each to justify the establishment of a school, viz., at Na-a-th, where there are 30, Ke-re-me-us, 12; N-kam-ap-lis, 25; Pen-tie-ton, 23; Ap-a-ha-min, 33. The total number of children of school age on these 5 Reserves is 123. The expenditure for day schools will therefore be as follows:\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| For salaries of five teachers, at $480 each per annum               | $2,400 |\n| Five new schoolhouses and teachers' residences, at $500 each         | 2,500  |\n| Furniture and school material for 5 schools, at $100 each           | 500    |\n| Repairs and renewal of material annually for 5 schools, at $50 each | 250    |\n| Prizes for 5 schools, at $30 each per annum                         | 150    |\n| Mid-day meal for 123 pupils for 8 months, at $5.32 each              | 654    |\n\nTotal amount to be provided in first instance: $6,454\n\nAnd deducting therefrom first cost of building and furniture: $3,000\n\nThe balance: $3,454\n\nwill be the sum annually required for the maintenance of day schools on those five Reserves.\n\nThe number of children of school age on the smaller Reserves is 129 in the aggregate, and as none of these Reserves is there a sufficient number to justify the establishment of a day school two central boarding schools of the primary class wherein these children may be educated should be established. The expense connected therewith will be approximately as follows:\n\nBuildings, school material and furniture for 2 institutions with 65 pupils at each, 130 in all: $12,000\n\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 130 children, at $120 each per annum: 15,600\n\nRenewing school material and furniture, and for repairs annually, $800 for each school: 1,600\n\nTotal of first expenditure: $29,200\n\nAnd deducting therefrom first cost of building and furniture: $12,000\n\nThe balance: $17,200\n\nshows the amount to be annually provided for the support of the institutions; and this sum $17,200 + $3,454 = $20,654, give the whole cost of education in the two agencies.\nIn the Williams' Lake or Lillooet Indian Agency there are 23 Reserves, with 192 children of an age to attend school, distributed as follows:\u20146 at Alexandria, 10 at Quesnel, 8 at Soda Creek, 11 at Williams Lake, 40 at Alkali Lake, 2 at Dog Creek, 17 at Canoe Creek, 5 at Clinton, 6 at Pavillion, 18 at Fountain, 8 at Bridge River, 8 at Lillooet, 6 at Cayoosh, 4 at Poshilqua, 0 at Chenook, 3 at Col-ohu-pa, 1 at Elias (Seaton Lake), 8 at Mission (Seaton Lake), 5 at head of Seaton Lake, 6 at head of Anderson Lake, 5 at foot of Anderson Lake, 5 at High Bar, 10 among the Chilcotin bands.\n\nThis enumeration shows that only 3 Reserves in the agency possess a sufficient number of children of school age on each to justify the establishment thereon of a dayschool, viz., at Alkali Lake, where there are 40 children; Canoe Creek, 17; and Fountain, 18. The expenditure for dayschools will therefore be as follows:\u2014\n\nFor 3 schools and teachers' houses at $500 - $1,500 00\nFor furniture and school material for 3 schools, at $100 each - 300 00\nFor renewal of supply of school material and for repairs annually, at $50 for each school - 150 00\nPrizes annually for 3 schools, at $30 each - 90 00\nSalaries of 3 teachers, at $480 each per annum - 1,440 00\nMid-day meal for 75 children for 8 months, at $5.32 each - 399 00\n\nTotal first cost to be provided - $3,879 00\nDeducting therefrom cost of building and furniture - 1,800 00\nThe balance - $2,079 00\n\nshows the amount to be provided annually for the maintenance of dayschools in this agency. And if for the education of the 117 children on the smaller reserves 2 central boarding schools are established, the expenditure to be incurred will be as follows:\u2014\n\nFor buildings, school material and furniture for 2 institutions with 59 pupils at each, 117 in all. $11,000 00\nMaintenance, including board, clothing and tuition of 117 children, at $120 each per annum - 14,040 00\nRenewal annually of furniture and school material and for repairs. $800 for each school - 1,600 00\n\nTotal amount to be provided in the first instance $25,640 00\nDeducting first cost of building and furniture - 11,000 00\nThe balance - $15,640 00\n\nrepresents the amount to be annually provided for the maintenance of the two institutions, and this sum, $15,640 + $2,079 = $17,719, will be the sum annually required for the education of the children of the Williams' Lake Agency.\nNorth-West Coast Agency.\n\nThe North-West Coast Agency, which extends to the southern limit of Alaska\u2014and includes the Queen Charlotte Islands to the south, Port Simpson, Metlakatla, the Nass and Skeena Rivers to the north\u2014owing to certain untoward circumstances has not as yet been for a sufficiently long time under any one Agent to admit of correct statistics as to the number of children of school age being obtained, but the number must be large, and at Metlakatla, Lakalsap on Nass River, and at Port Simpson schools are in operation.\n\nThe same system as that proposed for the other Indian agencies of the Provinces should be established in this Agency, so soon as correct statistics shall have been obtained, viz.: The inauguration on Reserves having a sufficient number of children of an age to attend school of day schools, and for the children of smaller Reserves a central boarding school of the primary class.\n\nAn industrial institution might also with great advantage be established in this Agency.\n\nRev. A.J. Hall says:\n\n\"we have at\n\"Metlakatla a high school\n\"where intelligent lads are\n\"drafted from all our\n\"missions.

Thanks to the author of \"Ramona\" and others like-minded, the great mass of the common people of the nation are at last working in union for the emancipation and regeneration of the tribes so long enslaved by the white man's troops, and robbed by our unprincipled adventurers. If General Morgan's appointment as Indian Commissioner be confirmed, the three and a half million Indians which he says are now living will be spared, be given him, the reproach of leaving 30,000 or 40,000 Indian children to grow up in ignorance and degradation will not fall upon him. General Morgan's plan is substantially that of the Lake Mohonk Conference, to establish a system of schools of the expense and under the charge of the Church. It is a scheme simply sufficient for the education of all the Indians children of school age in the Republic\u2014all, that is, whose education is yet needed. The plan is that of the Great Morgan's plan to interfere in any way with the educational work now being done by the churches of the various denominations. He does not propose to cancel the contracts under which some of these voluntary schools are carried on, nor to withdraw the subsidies they are at present receiving. But the conference (though not all the Christian Churches) has thus far refused to provide educational facilities for only about 12,000 Indian children, while three times that number, as shown in recent reports, are growing up in barbarism, ignorance and destitution.\n\nGeneral Morgan's proposal, which is heartily endorsed in many influential quarters, including the Christian Union, is to \"schools of various kinds\u2014day schools, boarding schools, Industrial Schools, literary schools, primary schools, High Schools, as they may be needed, and in the proper order.\" It is a proposal that without which the most complete system would be foredoomed to failure\u2014compulsory attendance. All who know the status of Indian affairs urge compulsory education, but Indian parents are compelled to educate their children, or rather to permit them to be educated, and thus lifted out of barbarism and civilization out of past primitiveness into citizenship? Are not the safety and well-being of the nation demand it? Is there a single reason which can be quoted to justify the present complacent attitude toward children whom disease apply with greater force to Indian children?\n\nWhat is it with our own Canadian Indians, especially with those of the Northwest and British Columbia? Are we not treading in the footsteps of our neighbors in the same direction? Are we preparing ourselves while they are on the point of abandoning? We pride ourselves on the alleged fact that Great Britain and Canada have always been good with the treaties made with their various Indian tribes. Grant it for the sake of our self-complacency and of the argument. We will not stay to inquire whether the tribes were forced to sign the treaties, whether they were treated fairly, whether the terms were carried out, whether fair equivalents for the supposed rights they surrendered. Nor need we now point out that the commissioners have hitherto been selected from the non-Indian press, and that these in great danger that, as the country fills up and the Indian reservations become objects of desire to greedy speculators and various settlers, the same state of things may arise which has been so fruitful of trouble and wrong in the United States. We will not even dwell upon the disheartening fact that it does not immediately concern our present purposes, that Canadian Indians are every year being paid out of the millions of dollars in the reserve paid them for their furs and other products, and that even men who were accounted honest and respectable are now engaged to commit it. We have to take the measure advantage of the red man when they are seeking their fortunes in the Northwest. Let all this pass.\n\nWhat is Canada doing to allocate the Indian tribes within her borders out of barbarism into civilisation and citizenship? What is the result of the question? The philanthropy of Church and Indians is doing something, and will probably do more in the future than it has yet done. The Government is doing something, something in the way of aiding Christian effort, and perhaps educating on a small scale on its own account. But how many years, or centuries, may it require before they will succeed in civilising the Indian race by means of these agencies? Is there the least ground for hoping that it will ever be accomplished? Can it be that the Government and people of Christian Canada calmly contemplate, so far as they think about the matter at all, the perpetuation existing in a race of barbarous savages in their land\u2014or the hopeless horrible alternative of their gradual extinction through disease engendered by disease, filth and the vices taught by white men?\n\nIf as a people we are unwilling to bear the responsibility of such neglect, whatever we may say to the contrary, the present system may be a present necessity, but surely it is but a temporary expedient. Let it not be forgotten that as a rule the Indians will deteriorate instead of improving under that system. There may be exceptions. In a few cases they may take to farming and make some progress toward a degree of prosperity. But, as a rule the untamed Indian on the reservation will lose the manly, if spasmodic energy, and the other moral qualities which are developed by the change of the new climate, influence and other necessities of his nomadic life, and will degenerate into the lazy, listless, worthless being we see in the wilds and on the reservations. The tribes will not remain stationary to await the advent of a wiser and more conscientious generation of Christian Indians. If they are not promptly and permanently filled up they will inevitably go down.\n\nWhat is to be done? Can any thoughtful person see the possibility of anything but means say the only thing\u2014a universal, compulsory education, especially industrial education, with the end directly in view of civilising the race and its ultimate reorganisation, at the earliest possible moment? Is it not time that both legislators and philanthropists were thinking along this and similar lines for its accomplishment?\n\nPOOR COPY\nMemorandum:\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit herewith for consideration and for confirmation by Your Excellency in Council, if approved of, the following Rules and Regulations in connection with the Indian Schools in the Province of Manitoba, the District of Keewatin and the North West Territories.\n\nThe scheme proposed embraces the following four classes of schools, viz:-\n\n1. Industrial Schools to be wholly supported by the Government.\n2. Industrial Schools to be partly supported by the Government.\n3. Boarding Schools, on or contiguous to Reserves.\n4. Day Schools on Reserves.\n\nI.\n\nIndustrial Schools to be wholly supported by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe opinion is strongly entertained\n\nTo the Honorable\nthe Privy Council of Canada.\nthat in order to keep schools of this class under the direct control of the Department, which, in view of its entirely supporting them, it is clearly entitled to exercise, any of such Institutions which may be hereafter purely opened should be secular, and not conducted in connection with, or under the auspices of any denomination; having always, as a matter of course, due regard to promises already made.\n\nII.\n\nIndustrial Schools to be partially supported by the Department.\n\nWhen application is made for a school of this class, the undersigned is of opinion that the denomination applying for assistance should state the facilities which it is prepared to afford for imparting industrial and other instruction, and before any aid is granted by the Government the proposition made by the Denomination should be approved of by Your Excellency.\n\nAll buildings for Industrial Schools partially supported by the Government must be on plans approved by the Department of Indian Affairs, and they should be erected upon Government lands, on the understanding that one half of the cost of such buildings shall be paid by the Department; also one half of the cost of furnishing the same so long as its share does not exceed $1,500. The buildings, fences, etc., to be kept in repair and the\nfurniture to be replenished when necessary by the denomination concerned.\n\nIn the event of school buildings and lands in connection therewith ceasing to be used for the exclusive purposes of educating Indian children, the Department shall have the right to buy out the interest of the denomination at a fair valuation, to be decided by the Department.\n\n**Maintenance**\n\nThe per capita annual allowance towards the maintenance of children in these schools shall be $100, for each unit of average attendance. This allowance shall be inclusive of everything, save where the Department of Indian Affairs sends its nominees to any school, when transport expenses will be paid.\n\nThe number of children to be received into a school shall be determined by the Department of Indian Affairs, and not exceeded.\n\nTwo industries for the boys, in addition to the Department's curriculum, and agriculture, must be taught; and for the girls the ordinary household duties, including knitting, sewing, baking, etc.\n\nA dietary table for the use of these schools must\nbe submitted to and approved of by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nInstitutions for the education of other than Indian children, into which they may be admitted.\n\nA per capita grant may be given towards the maintenance of Indian children in institutions not used exclusively for their education, but no aid towards the purchase of buildings or lands in connection therewith, nor towards the repairing or furnishing of the same, shall be given by the Government.\n\nThe following Rules shall apply to Industrial Institutions of both classes:\n\nHow to be Filled.\n\nSince Industrial Institutions are intended to afford the highest class of education, it is considered that they should be recruited from children who have given the greatest satisfaction in other schools, and so proved themselves most worthy of higher advantages of education and industrial training, although in the first instances the institutions would doubtless have to be filled up with children most readily attainable.\n\nThis system of recruiting would be in harmony with the strongly entertained conviction that the more remote from the Institution and distant from each other are the points from which the pupils are collected the better for the success of the former.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs reserves to itself the right at any time to send its own nominees, and they should have preference as to any vacancies, and it also reserves to itself power to curtail the number lodging in or attending any such schools.\n\nFarming Out.\n\nIn connection with these schools, the undersigned recommends that the system of farming out the more advanced pupils be developed, as increased settlement in the country of families suitable for their reception affords opportunity. This is regarded as the best method of educating children in the habits and ideas of, and in sympathy with, the whites; and further, the system would make room for the reception of others into the Institutions.\n\nGreat care will, of course, be required in the selection of families where the children will be subjected to proper treatment and influences, and the inauguration of a system of regular reports and inspection will be necessary to enable the Principals to assure themselves of the children's welfare.\n\nIt might be found advisable, in some cases, to let the children out for perhaps the summer months of the first year, returning to the Institution for the winter, and during the second year to extend the term of absence from the Institution. This would teach them to regard the Institution as a home, and keep them well\nunder the influence of their guardians, and enable a judgment to be formed as to how the system is working in individual cases.\n\nDisposition of pupils whose course has been completed.\n\nSpecial Reserves, it is thought, should be secured in the neighbourhood of the Institutions, and pupils, after the completion of their course should be established thereon by themselves, to remain under the supervision of the Principal, and receive his guidance and assistance. If this should be considered infeasible, pupils who have completed their course might be allowed to take up such vacant lands as are procurable adjacent to each Institution.\n\nWith regard to preventing discharged pupils returning to Reserves, exception might be made in favor of such Reserves as are occupied by Indians who are much advanced in civilization.\n\nAnother exception might be made with regard to Reserves, the whole of the children of which it had been found possible to educate at an Industrial Institution; and where all the children of a Reserve can be secured for one Institution, the advantages in one direction would be so great as to override those under ordinary circumstances of getting children from separate localities.\n\nPupils should not be permanently discharged from\nthe Institution without the permission of the Department,\nand if vacancies occur the same are not to be filled\nwithout permission being first had.\n\nIII.\n\nBoarding Schools on or Contiguous to Reserves.\n\nThese Schools are intended to be in lieu of Day\nSchools on Reserves, for which they should be substituted as considered desirable by the Department of Indian Affairs, and as circumstances will allow. These Schools are in the main intended for children whose parents reside at too great a distance on a Reserve to admit of the former attending Day Schools.\n\nBuildings.\n\nBuildings should be on a plan and erected on a site which have been approved of by the Department; and if it be decided to erect any of such off a Reserve upon Government lands, one half of the cost of such buildings shall be paid by the Department. The cost of keeping such buildings in repair is to be borne by the denomination having them in charge.\n\nMaintenance.\n\nWhere day scholars attend a Boarding School, it is recommended that the per capita allowance for the maintenance of the boarders shall be $50. for each unit of average attendance, but for schools whereat no day schol-\nFor Boarding Schools whereat day scholars are taught a salary of $300., it is considered, should be paid to a teacher, but that no salary should be paid to a teacher where the per capita annual allowance for maintenance is $60. This is an imposibility. The teacher's salary must be given; the per capita allowance of $4.60 being even insufficient for children's board.\n\nIn regard to schools on the Reserves within the territory covered by Treaty No. 7, the rations and clothing which would otherwise be provided for the children at their homes may be given in lieu of a per capita allowance towards maintenance.\n\nThe number of children to be received into a school, it is considered, should be determined by the Department of Indian Affairs, and not exceeded.\n\nIt is recommended that day scholars receive a mid-day meal, for which the school shall receive the usual allowance of biscuit now supplied the children, or an equivalent.\n\nWhere there are female teachers, it is recommended that sewing classes be held on certain days of the week, at fixed hours, for the instruction of the women on the Reserves.\n\nAgriculture, in a limited measure, it is considered should be taught, in addition to the Department's curriculum.\n\nThe daily dietary table used in these schools, it\nis submitted, should be approved of by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, it is considered, should reserve to itself the right to discontinue assistance to any Boarding School on or contiguous to a Reserve, when, in its opinion, there is sufficient accommodation for the children in higher institutions.\n\nThe following shall be the method of calculation in paying grants to assisted Industrial Institutions and Boarding Schools:\n\n| Days of Attendance | $100 Grant | $60 Grant | $50 Grant |\n|-------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| From 85 to 90     | 25.00      | 15.00     | 12.50     |\n| 79 - 84           | 23.33      | 14.00     | 11.67     |\n| 73 - 78           | 21.66      | 13.00     | 10.83     |\n| 67 - 72           | 20.00      | 12.00     | 10.00     |\n| 61 - 66           | 18.33      | 11.00     | 9.17      |\n| 55 - 60           | 16.66      | 10.00     | 8.33      |\n| 49 - 54           | 15.00      | 9.00      | 7.50      |\n| 43 - 48           | 13.33      | 8.00      | 6.67      |\n| 37 - 42           | 11.66      | 7.00      | 5.83      |\n| 31 - 36           | 10.00      | 6.00      | 5.00      |\n| 25 - 30           | 8.33       | 5.00      | 4.16      |\n| 19 - 24           | 6.66       | 4.00      | 3.33      |\n| 13 - 18           | 5.00       | 3.00      | 2.50      |\n| 7 - 12            | 3.33       | 2.00      | 1.66      |\n| 1 - 6             | 1.66       | 1.00      | .83       |\n\nRegulations Governing Day Schools, the same being the first established on a Reserve.\n\nBuildings.\n\nAll school houses should, it is believed, be built on a uniform plan and according to specifications to be\napproved by the Department, and they shall also have a\nkitchen attached; each school to be furnished with a cup-\nboard for storing material, which should be properly\nsecured with a lock and key. There should be in the\nschool a dais, desk, and chair, for use of teacher, and\ndesks, benches, maps, globes, &c., for the use of pupils.\nThere should also be separate water-closets for the use\nof boys and girls.\n\nAll such school-houses and furnishings should, it\nis considered, be paid for in full and kept in repair\nby the Department, but the first cost should in no case\nexceed $500.\n\nIt is further considered that Teachers' quarters\nshould be separate from the school building, and that the\nsum of $100. should be contributed towards the cost of\ntheir erection by the Department.\n\nAnything in the foregoing Regulations relative to\ncontribution by the Department towards the first cost of\nSchool buildings and Teachers' quarters should only have\neffect henceforward, and should not be in any sense re-\ntro-active, although the Department may, if it see fit,\nadd kitchens to, and keep in repair, school buildings\nalready existing. The object for which it is proposed\nto erect kitchens is to provide, at any rate during the\nWinter, a warm mid-day meal in place of biscuit.\n\nPayment of Teachers.\n\nThe salary paid by the Department to Teachers of\nDay Schools should, it is believed, be irrespective of\nany aid from any outside source, and that the minimum salary for Day Schools should be $300 per annum, contingent upon an average attendance of not less than eight pupils, and that Teachers should be paid, in addition to their fixed salary, a per capita annual allowance of $8.00 for each unit of average attendance from 15 to 30, inclusive, and $7.00 for each pupil who shall have attained to such standard as the Department may direct, and shall have obtained at least 60 per cent of marks obtainable for English in such standard; but the salary should in no case exceed $600. The system of providing for increase to Teachers' salaries is devised with a view to enabling a teacher who may have no field for the exercise of his energies in hunting up pupils to gain some reward for expending it on bringing forward such pupils as he can secure.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs should, it is considered, reserve to itself the right to discontinue assistance to any Day School on a Reserve when, in its opinion, there is sufficient accommodation for children of school age in boarding schools or in higher institutions, or for other good reason, and it may at any time raise the number entitling teachers to the full salary of $300.\n\nSecond Denominational Day Schools on Reserves\n\nAny denomination applying for permission to establish a second or minority school upon a Reserve where one has already been provided, be the same of the Day or\nBoarding School type, should, it is considered, be required to prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it has a reasonable prospect of securing an average attendance of at least eight pupils, being children of parents belonging to the denomination so applying.\n\nThe only salary that should be paid to a teacher of such Schools by the Department should be a per capita annual grant for each unit of attendance, calculated by the Department's method, always provided such average does not fall in the aggregate below eight, and such salary shall not exceed $300., and an additional annual grant of $7.00 might be paid for each pupil who shall have attained to the standard decided upon by the Department, and obtained at least 60 per cent of marks obtainable for English in such standard.\n\nNo assistance should, it is thought, be given towards the erection of, or furnishing of, the school house or teacher's quarters, but if an average attendance of not less than eight pupils shall have been maintained during twelve consecutive school months, the Department of Indian Affairs might contribute a sum not exceeding $200. towards the cost of the school building, and keep the same in repair on condition that the furniture shall be kept in a proper state of repair, and shall be replenished when necessary, by the denomination.\n\nSchool Material shall be furnished by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAll Regulations of the Department governing Day\nSchools and their Teachers, except insofar as they are modified by these special Regulations, shall apply to second denominational schools, when any assistance is afforded them by the Department.\n\nHolidays.\n\nDay Schools should, it is considered, be kept open during 221 days in each year, the balance of 144 days to be holidays, and be given, (excepting Sundays and Saturdays), at such time as Agent and Teacher shall consider most conducive to the best attendance; such Regulations being applicable to Day Scholars attending Boarding Schools.\n\nPrizes to Day Schools.\n\nPrizes should, it is thought, be continued as at present, but that consideration in awarding them should be given also to the percentage in the number of children of school age available, taken in connection with the enforcement or otherwise of compulsory measures to secure attendance, and to number of children who have attained a certain standard, and to order, discipline, cleanliness of pupils and of premises, including garden.\n\nAllowances for advancement of pupils to the appointed standard should, it is recommended, be made upon the certificate of Inspectors.\n\nThe following Regulations are recommended to apply to all Boarding or Day Schools on or contiguous to Reserves.\n\n(13)\nTeachers.\n\nNo Teacher shall enter upon duties without the approval of the Department having been first obtained.\n\nWhen no School Teacher's certificate exists, the Department shall order an examination of qualification to be made.\n\nCertificates of moral character shall be furnished.\n\nWhen Teachers are engaged it shall be on the understanding that any infringement of the Department's rules may be visited with reduction or stoppage of salary, or dismissal, and that such reduction or stoppage or dismissal may be made when the Department considers that sufficient advancement is not being made by the scholars, or when the Teacher shews a lack of energy in procuring as large an attendance as he should, and which the number of children of school age should afford.\n\nThe Department shall have the power to transfer a Teacher from one school to another of the same denomination, but in that case the cost of transport shall be paid by the Department, except the transfer is through the Teacher's own fault, or made at his request.\n\nNo changes of Teachers shall be made without the sanction of the Commissioner.\n\nNo substitute shall undertake the duties of my Teacher temporarily, without the sanction of the Indian Commissioner or Indian Agent, and, if the latter, he shall report to the Indian Commissioner the circumstances which necessitated the same.\nNo Teacher shall absent himself without permission of the Agent, excepting during recognized holidays, and in the event of such permission being given he shall report when he leaves and when he returns to duty, and the Agent shall report the circumstances to the Indian Commissioner which led to such leave being granted.\n\nThe following Regulations respecting the duties and powers of Teachers of Reserve Day Schools and Boarding Schools, insofar as they are applicable, are recommended for adoption.\n\nTeachers shall be in and open their schools for the reception of pupils, in the morning at least 15 minutes, and in the afternoon at least 5 minutes, before the time specified for beginning school, in order to afford shelter for pupils as they arrive.\n\nTeachers shall, during school hours, devote themselves faithfully and exclusively to the business of the School.\n\nTeachers shall give the children under their charge constant employment in the studies prescribed by the authorized course, inclusive of gardening, and endeavour to render the exercises of the School pleasant as well as profitable.\n\nTeachers shall devote themselves, as far as possible both in and out of School, to the improvement of the minds, morals, personal deportment, and habits of their pupils, and, while exercising firmness, shall endeavour to influence them by appealing to their reason and af-\nfactions, rather than to their fears.\n\nTeachers shall keep a daily and general Register, and enter in the latter the date of admission of each pupil, his or her name, age, date of promotion to higher classes, and such other information as may from time to time be required by the Department to be kept.\n\nTeachers shall keep in some conspicuous place in the schoolroom, a Time-table, showing the order of exercises for each day in the week, and the time for each as prescribed in the programme of studies, and shall see that the same is strictly observed.\n\nTeachers shall divide the pupils into classes, as prescribed by the programme of study, which must be strictly observed, and no Teacher shall take any class beyond the limits prescribed for the same until its course of study shall have been thoroughly mastered.\n\nTeachers shall examine each class during the last week of each half year, in the presence of the Indian Agent or other visitors; and each pupil in the school, unless for good reasons specially excused, shall be called upon to review or recite in the course of such examination, and the result shall be recorded.\n\nTeachers shall exercise strict vigilance to prevent injury to all school property, including material, furniture, buildings, out-houses, fences, garden-tools, under their charge, and give notice to the Agent of any necessary repairs or replenishment of supplies required for the use of the School.\n\n(16)\nTeachers shall see that all yards, privies, and other out premises are kept in proper order.\n\nTeachers shall see that school-houses are locked during other than school hours, and shall require each competent pupil in proper rotation to sweep the room daily, in the morning and evening, and to dust the windows, walls, seats, desks, &c.\n\nTeachers shall be most careful to keep the school-room thoroughly ventilated, fresh, and clean.\n\nTeachers shall not voluntarily absent themselves from their duties without permission of the Agent, and if compelled by sickness or urgent cause to do so, a competent substitute shall, with the approval of the Agent, be obtained, and the whole matter reported to the Commissioner without evitable delay.\n\nTeachers shall receive visitors courteously, and afford any that may be authorized every facility for examining into the state of their schools. They shall keep a visitor's book, in which shall be entered the dates of visits, and the names of visitors, and they shall inform visitors that they may enter remarks in it.\n\nThe nature of and necessity for regulations affecting pupils shall be explained to the latter at least once in every month, and, when opportunity offers, to their parents, whose interest and co-operation should, as far as possible, be secured.\n\nIt should always be borne in mind that the duties of the Teacher do not end with teaching, but he must work diligently in going among the children and their parents.\nto secure a proper attendance.\n\nIt is respectfully recommended that the following Regulations respecting Pupils be adopted.\n\nNo child under six years of age can become a pupil in any Indian Department Reserve Day School.\n\nIf pupils do not come to school clean with respect to their persons they should be compelled to wash and tidy themselves during school hours, and they should be required to be kind and courteous to each other, obedient to their teachers, diligent in their studies, and conform to the rules of the school.\n\nNo pupil, unless present for at least one half of the morning or afternoon, shall be entered on the Register as present for that half-day, nor should the pupil be allowed to share in the mid-day meal.\n\nNo pupil should be allowed to depart before the hour appointed for closing the school, excepting in case of sickness or other urgent necessity, in which case the teacher's consent should be first obtained.\n\nFifteen minutes recess shall be allowed, at 10.15 A.M., and at 12.15 P.M., during which time the school-room must be thoroughly ventilated, but pupils should not be permitted to leave their classes at any other time, unless the teacher considers that a case of urgent necessity exists.\n\nRegulations which it is recommended be made applicable to all Schools supplied in whole or in part by\n1st. All Returns required by the Department shall be regularly, punctually, and correctly made, and any information asked for shall be promptly and correctly given.\n\n2nd. The Department's Curriculum of Instruction must be closely adhered to. The vernacular is not to be taught in any schools. As soon as possible, the native language is only to be used as a vehicle of teaching, and should be discontinued as soon as practicable.\n\n3rd. No change with regard to any matter submitted to and approved of by the Department of Indian Affairs shall be made without its sanction.\n\n4th. Any deviation from, or failure to comply with, any of the Department's Regulations shall be held to justify it in discontinuing its assistance in whole or in part, and the Department of Indian Affairs shall be sole judge as to whether its Regulations have been satisfactorily observed or not.\n\n5th. The Department's officers shall have the right of inspection at all times, full control of the school during such inspection, and access at all times to all Registers, books, papers, etc., connected with the school.\n\nOne of the duties of the 6th. A school district shall, subject to charge at any time, be allotted to each School Inspector, who shall inspect all schools within the same, irrespective of denominations, they may not be deprived of the means to fulfill their duty.\nNote. If it be considered necessary to have two School Inspectors, it would seem advisable to abandon the present system of sending both through the whole country, to follow in each other's wake, and inspect each the schools of his denomination only. Religion need, in no way, enter into the work of inspection.\n\n7th. Instruction must, in all schools, be given primarily in the English language, even where French is taught.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for Manitoba, Keewatin, and the North West Territories is empowered to carry these Regulations into effect, save where specially otherwise directed.\n\nGeneral remarks.\n\n1st. The whole plan as above framed leaves too much room for subsequent arbitrary regulations on the part of the Indian officials.\n\n2nd. It does not take enough into consideration that its regulations are for Indian and not white children.\n\n3rd. The teacher, amongst the Indians, should enjoy a respectable position. From it, he is paid, secure a salary inferior to any other employee on Indian reserve, although he is very poorly built and obliged to live with Indians without any of the comforts of civilization. His position or rather his mission don't seem to be at all appreciated by the Indian department or at least by the author of this plan.\n\n+ V. J. Bick of St. Albert\nOttawa 17th November 1894\n\nTo the\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit the following remarks in reference to the inspection of Indian Schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces by the Public School Inspectors of these Provinces.\n\nIn October 1880 an Order-in-Council was passed authorizing negotiations to be opened up with the Local Government of each of the above Provinces through the Secretary of State, having for their object the securing for the Indian Schools in such Province the same system of inspection at the hands of the local Government officers as the public schools of the Province undergo. The results of such negotiations being that Orders-in-Council were passed by the different local Governments fixing the terms and conditions upon which such inspections were to be made, which were assented to by this Department. The inspections were to be made semi-annually and the Inspector was to make a report of his visit and state the condition of the school.\nschool and the progress of the pupils\nand offer any suggestions and re-\ncommendations relative to the future\nmanagement of the school, which he con-\nsidered desirable.\n\nRegulations on the subject of\nIndian Schools were approved by the\nMinister of Education for Ontario and\nthis Department, which read as follows:\n\n\"The Department of Indian Affairs for\nthe Dominion having expressed a desire\nto place the Indian Schools in Ontario\nunder the inspection of the Public\nSchool Inspectors for the Province, the\nfollowing Regulations have been\nadopted\":\n\nI. \"The teachers are required to\nhave a speaking acquaintance with the\nIndian language and are consequently\nlikely in most cases to be Indians;\nbut the instruction should as soon as\npracticable and as far as possible\nbe given in English.\"\n\nII. \"Teachers shall receive their\nCertificates from the County or District\nBoard of Examiners, who shall be grant-\ned discretionary powers as to the\nattainments required; it will be found\nhowever for some time to come that the\nstandard of 'High School Entrance'\nwill be as high as is attainable.\"\n\nIII. \"The subjects of study in these\nschools need not at present embrace\nmore than the following, viz:-\nReading,\nWriting, Object Lessons, Elementary\nDrawing (from cards) Elementary\nArithmetic (the four simple rules)\nElementary Geography (the maps of the\nWorld and Dominion of Canada) Spelling\nand Grammar (formation and analysis\nof simple sentences).\n\nIV. The Indian Department will\nfurnish all text-books and apparatus\nfor use in the schools.\n\nV. The schools shall be placed\nunder the inspectorial supervision\nof the County Inspectors in conjunc-\ntion with the Indian Agent, who shall\ntogether also have a controlling\ninfluence in the selection of teachers\nexcept in the case of such schools as\nare established by any religious\ndenomination under the Regulations\nof the Department of Indian Affairs,\nand in such schools the selection of\nteachers shall continue to be made as\nheretofore; but each of the Inspectors\nshall state in his reports of inspec-\ntion his opinion upon the competency\nof the teacher of each denominational\nIndian School inspected by him.\n\nA fee of six dollars ($6) shall\nbe paid the Inspectors and legitimate\ntravelling expenses allowed, for two\nvisits per annum.\n\n(Signed)\n\nGeo. W. Ross,\nMinister of Education\nIt will be seen from these Regulations that the Programme of Studies as they laid down was much lower than at present called for and that the qualification required for teachers was correspondingly low.\n\nAt the time the negotiations were entered into with the various local Governments for the Inspection of Indian Schools by their Public School Inspectors, the Department had not much experience in the management of Indian Schools. Although many of its schools had for a long time been in operation they were nearly, if not all, conducted by the various religious denominations. Quarterly School Returns were called for and received very irregularly in most instances, payment of teacher's salaries not being as now, contingent upon the receipt of such Return. The Agents of the Department were not then required to make periodical visits and reports on the schools in their Agency and no such reports were received; the only mention then made of them was a short sentence or paragraph sometimes occurring in their Annual Report on the affairs of their Agency. Appropriations were annually made for School purposes, salaries paid, material supplied, buildings put up and repaired and fuel provided but the Department had little if any knowledge as to what good was resulting from such outlay.\nThe present system of inspection has been in force for thirteen years in some of the Provinces and in all for more than ten years. The expenditure for these semi-annual inspections has been close upon $1000 a year for Ontario and Quebec alone, or all of the money voted by Parliament for the cost inspection, fuel, cleaning, books and maps for the whole of the schools of the two Provinces, while nearly, if not all of the information in the Inspector's Reports is now received by the Department through its Agents under the new Regulations, which require them to visit and inspect our schools, and from other sources long before the Inspector's Reports reach the Department; the Reports of some of the Inspectors being delayed frequently for months, so that when received it is too late for the requisite action to be taken. Most of their suggestions relate to the repairs to school-houses and outbuildings and the supply of school material and should be forwarded immediately after their inspection.\n\nPublic School Inspector's Reports on the qualification of teachers and progress of the pupils are also of slight value to the Department as many of our schools are so remote and the salaries so small that it is difficult\nto obtain properly qualified teachers to take positions, while the irregular attendance of children at such schools is greatly against their progress. The Public School Inspectors have so far failed to better the condition of affairs and improvement can only be looked for by the exercise of vigilance and energy on the part of the Department and its officers and its own officers and not from the paid officials of other Governments over whom the Department has no control. The undersigned is confident that one visit from an official from head-quarters, who knows the requirements of the Department in regard to Indian Schools would be productive of better results than any number of inspections by an Inspector who is not even allowed to communicate directly with the Department, and who takes his orders from his own Government. This Department has no power to command the services of these Inspectors and they only make their inspections when it suits their convenience or that of their Government.\n\nThe most we can at present expect is that our teachers should use their best endeavors to instruct the children in the elementary branches and that this instruction be given in English,\nand that they should use every means in their power to induce parents to send their children to school. The chief fault with our teachers is their neglect of this duty, where they are interested in the work good results are obtained both as regards progress and attendance.\n\nThe class of work done by our schools does not call for Inspectors holding Provincial Certificates. Any of our Agents of ordinary education and intelligence are competent, on hearing the school children go through their exercises, to give an opinion as to whether they are deriving any benefit from their attendance or not, and they should also be able to report on the fitness of the teacher for the position. In addition to this the undersigned begs to state that it is only through the officers of the Department it can look for any improvement. They are now aware that school matters form one of their most important duties and with very few exceptions are attending regularly and carefully to this duty.\n\nAs an instance of the cost of inspection the undersigned would refer to Mr Separate School Inspector White's account for inspecting the Catholic Schools from Manitoulin Island up to Fort William which, with visits to two schools in Eastern Ontario, amounted\nto $188, or $376 for the year. Inspector Kelly's account for visiting the Six Nation and New Credit Schools comes to $76 or $152 for the year, while Mr McCaig, who visited two Protestant Schools on Manitoulin Island and the Shingwauk Home renders a bill of $34.50. These are the only Inspector's reports yet received for this fall, but the cost of these three inspections foots up to $300 for the half-year.\n\nThe teachers of the denominational schools are appointed by the various denominations and the Department has been in the habit of approving of their nominees. Very few of these teachers hold anything higher than a Permit and in many instances even that qualification is lacking. Some of the teachers are Indians with only an imperfect knowledge of English, who find it easier to give their explanations in the Indian language than in English, which will account for the slow progress in English made by the pupils who, although able to repeat sentences in English off their book, do not understand what they read.\n\nThe Public School Inspectors, no matter how painstaking their examination\nand inspection cannot remedy those defects and both teachers, parents and pupils are well aware that they are not officers of this Department and that they have little to fear from their reports, which have resulted in nothing but the expenditure of large sums of money for the past twelve or fourteen years. What they do require to feel is that the Department is taking a personal interest in their work and its results and that good work will be appreciated and that carelessness will lead to dismissal or the closing of the schools. This they can only be taught by the Department itself through its officers.\n\nOther disadvantages also exist in the present system. The inspections are made too early in the fall and too late in the spring for Indian Schools, as they are not fairly in operation at such times. The Indians migrate in the Spring long before the Public Schools close and do not return until some time after they are re-opened in the fall and the Inspector's rarely, if ever, make a special visit for the purpose of inspecting an Indian School, but take them in their regular round of duty as Provincial Inspectors and charge this Department, in most instances with full travelling expenses.\nThese Inspection Reports are published in the Departmental Reports of the Ontario Government and most likely in the other Provincial Blue Books, this the undersigned considers to be unfair to our Department as our schools cannot be expected to compare favorable with the Ontario Public Schools or the Public Schools of the other Provinces.\n\nTwo sets of Inspectors are required now, the Public School and Separate School Inspector, both going over the same ground, but visiting only their own schools, while if an officer of the Department were to make a visit neither denomination would object, as they all recognize the right of the Department to make any inspection it considers necessary.\n\nIn regard to the inspection of Industrial Schools, the undersigned begs to repeat what he has already stated in his report on the Shingwauk Home, which is, that very little, if any, benefit to the Department is derived from such inspection, as the Inspector merely makes a hurried xixit examination of the pupils in their studies and does not make the minute examination into the details connected with the management of such Institutions which the Department requires and ought to be furnished with. The Public School Inspectors do\nnot know what the Department requires in regard to its schools, and their reports appear to be written solely with a view to brevity, very few of them making any remarks, and when they do so, only repeating their previous suggestions, most of which are wholly impracticable for Indian Schools.\n\nIf, however, it is not considered expedient to dispense with the services of the Public School Inspectors, altogether, the undersigned is of the opinion that they should be more under the immediate control of the Department than they now are and that they should only visit the schools when instructed to do so by the Department. If this concession could be obtained a great deal of unnecessary expense and many useless trips would be avoided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nEXTRACT of the Battleford Industrial School\n\"The Guide\" of March 22nd 1895.\n\nAs time advances, the Indians are being more and more brought to the front, and the Indians of the Canadian west are beginning to be recognized as a class of people worthy of the respect of the world, and capable of becoming clever citizens.\n\nThe law which calls for the education of Indian children will be a power for good among the native tribes\u2014it being compulsory of late that Indian children be educated. There may be a few difficulties to contend with in carrying out this injunction, but it will make the race a most useful one to the country.\n\n...\nEXTRACT of a letter dated 13th April 1895 from the Rev A.J. McLeod, Principal of the Regina Industrial School.\n\nSir,\n\nApart from the unfortunate deficit, the new arrangement for the conduct of this Industrial School has in my opinion worked admirably, and has strengthened the self reliance of the Institution which was one of the aims in the departure from the old method of its direct management by the Department. I can readily see that the Department will not tolerate extravagance or unnecessary purchases in the management of any of the schools.\n\nI have, etc.\nsgd. A.J. McLeod.\nPrincipal\nSchool Branch\nOttawa 20th June 1895\n\nIn reference to the Memo from the Minister asking for extracts from letters of clerics as to our schools method being the best, the undersigned begs to state that he is aware that the various church dignitaries who have visited the Department in connection with Indian school matters have expressed their satisfaction with the course pursued by it in regard to Indian Education. Communications from the various denominations officially made to the Department in regard to the schools conducted under their auspices are usually in the form of applications for further accommodation, augmented grants or for grants for new schools, and deal for the most part with the educational needs of the Indians under their charge.\n\nAll our Industrial and Boarding schools with the exception of the St. Paul's School in Manitoba and conducted by one or other of the following denominations\u2014Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist and Presbyterian, assisted by grants\ngrants from the Department, and as many of these Institutions, particularly the Boarding Schools are in receipt of outside aid, it can readily be seen that in their published reports and written communications that it is, from their standpoint, to their interest to make the most of any difficulties that have to be overcome in the education of Indian youth, so much so that in one or two instances which have been brought to the knowledge of the Minister, the Department has been obliged to call upon the Church authorities for a retraction of some of their published statements which has, in the cases referred to, been made, accompanied by a lame apology to the Department but no public withdrawal of such misleading and erroneous statements has ever been made to the knowledge of the undersigned.\n\nThe comments in the press on our schools are most favourable, especially as regards the progress made in the Western Provinces. Clippings from papers referring to Indian Schools will be found in the Department Scrap-Book.\n\n[Signature]\nEXTRACT of the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the United States for the year of 1894.\n\nAt the Summer Institute for Indian workers\u2014composed of the Superintendents and Supervisors of Indian Education, Indian Agents, Superintendents of Indian Schools and school employees\u2014which was held under the auspices of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Chilocco, Okla., U.S.A. in the month of July last\u2014the following Resolutions were passed.\n\nRESOLVED, (1) That at this time, pending the allotments of lands in severalty to reservation Indians, it is important in the interests of economy and effective service that liberal appropriations be made by the Government for the support of Indian schools.\n\nRESOLVED, (2) That there is urgent need of efficient and faithful service of all school employees and that the interests of the Government as well as the Indian demands that no others should be retained in the service.\n\nRESOLVED, (3) That no system of Indian education is complete without it embraces manual training, and that the future of the Indian youth requires that they be taught to labor for their own subsistence.\n\nRESOLVED, (4) That, in view of the fact that Indian education is largely conducted through governmental aid and instrumentality and that a strong disinclination prevails on the part of the parents growing out of their inability to appreciate its advantages, to send their children to reservation schools, it becomes necessary to adopt some method of compulsory attendance at such schools.\n\nRESOLVED, (5) That the future civilization of the Indian involves their gradual emancipation from a dependent condition of development not be accomplished in a day, but must be the outgrowth of the Indian school system, and that the time required to accomplish this object depends largely upon the perfection of such system and the force and personal character and efficiency of the employees engaged supplemented and consummated by the guidance and uplifting\nuplifting of those forming their environments in future homes.\n\nRESOLVED, (6) That, as it is the opinion of the members of the convention of Indian workers assembled at Chilocco that manual training is an essential part of education for Indians, we urgently request that competent persons be appointed tego from school to school to give employes instructions in practical manual training.\nEXTRACT from letter from the Rev.Professor Baird, Superintendent of the Presbyterian Missions in Manitoba and the North West Territories, dated April 12th 1890.\n\nSir,\n\n(1st) Any proposed solution of the Indian problem must treat the education of the young as one of its most important elements and there is no means of education practicable in the North West that equals in value the system of industrial boarding schools. This general principle is urged so forcibly and so frequently in your official reports that I make no attempt to prove it.\nEXTRACT of a report of Rev. J. Hines, Superintendent of the C.M.S. Mission in Eastern Saskatchewan, dated February '95, Rothbury-house, London.\n\nHand-in-hand and side-by-side with Christian teaching and agriculture and pastoral instruction went scholastic work. From the beginning, I introduced day schools for the mental improvement of the young, and the success in this branch was far beyond our most sanguine hopes. Youths who have not seen a letter of the English language when in 1875 we began to teach them, 1882 had become so efficient in English as to be able to teach the school in which they themselves had been taught, and the Government of Canada recognized their services and paid their salaries. One cannot speak too highly of the method adopted by the Canadian Government in dealing with the Indian question in all its branches.\nEXTRACT of the Battleford Industrial School\n\"The Guide\" of March 22nd 1895.\n\nAs time advances, the Indians are being more and more brought to the front, and the Indians of the Canadian west are beginning to be recognized as a class of people worthy of the respect of the world, and capable of becoming clever citizens.\n\nThe law which calls for the education of Indian children will be a power for good among the native tribes\u2014it being compulsory of late that Indian children be educated. There may be a few difficulties to contend with in carrying out this injunction, but it will make the race a most useful one to the country.\nEXTRACT of a letter dated 13th April 1895 from the Rev A.J. McLeod, Principal of the Regina Industrial School.\n\nSir,\n\nApart from the unfortunate deficit, the new arrangement for the conduct of this Industrial School has in my opinion worked admirably, and has strengthened the self reliance of the Institution which was one of the aims in the departure from the old method of its direct management by the Department. I can readily see that the Department will not tolerate extravagance or unnecessary purchases in the management of any of the schools.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd. A.J.

They have then become so far removed from the ordinary Indian that they ought to be in a position to get along as well as an ordinary white man. But experience shows that in very few cases is the Indian boy or girl capable of taking care of himself or herself in contact with the white race.\"\n\nMr. Sprague, in reply, said \"If these schools are not giving moderately good results, the question arises as to what we should do. We have had them long enough on trial to enable us to determine whether they are a success or a failure, and it is important should consider as to whether it would not be better to change the system.\"\n\nIndian workers claim that the children are not deficient, either mentally or morally, and the twenty years' experience of Col. Pratt of the Carlisle Institute proves this conclusively, for he has turned out hundreds of Indian youths from that institution who have taken their places as citizens of the United States and more than hold their own in every\nwalk of life. The labors of the Rev. William Duncan of Metlakahtla resulted more than twenty years ago in founding an ideal community which was an example of industry and morality to the whites in the neighborhood.\n\nIf one school can produce hundreds of thrifty, law-abiding citizens and if one man can convert a white tribe of untutored savages into self-respecting and self-supporting members of society, why cannot equally satisfactory results be obtained at our schools, which are entrusted to religious denominations who have control while the Department has the responsibility. The fault must be in the system.\n\nThe first school in the West was opened about 17 years ago, partially modeled on the American system of that date and adhered to ever since with very discouraging results. The present system ensures moral and religious training, order, industry, regularity, discipline, respect, obedience and other virtues but it confers no worldly wisdom or self-reliance on the pupils, no individuality or force of character. They are wards when they enter, wards when they leave and are content to remain wards until they die.\n\nThe money spent on the education of Indian children at our schools in industrial schools should represent something better than the perpetuation of a race of dependents.\n\nThe present system which is responsible for spoiling an Indian and not making him equal to holding his own with ordinary type white settlers, is all wrong and cannot be changed too soon, and I respectfully submit that the adoption or partial\nadoption of the George Junior Republic methods, which I have been studying for some time, is worthy of consideration.\n\nI shall now describe this remarkable community, which was founded and organized by Mr. William R. George at Proeville, Tompkins County, N.Y., about five years ago. It is certainly a most novel educational experiment and the principles upon which the republic is established might be well adopted by our Department and applied to some of our schools. \"Nothing without Labor\" is the Republic's motto and this motto is strictly adhered to, except in case of sickness. The two great basal principles of the Republic are \"Necessity\" and \"Opportunity\".\n\nThe idea of the Republic originated in the Fresh Air movement. In 1892 Mr. George brought thirty boys from the slums of New York to his home in Proeville for a holiday. They were a troublesome lot and until he hit upon the scheme of self-support and self-government he was in constant worry, as the boys robbed orchards and generally misbehaved themselves. A neighbor complained to him about two boys stealing his apples and identified them. Mr. George called the boys together and asked them to decide what their punishment should be. They decided that the one who planned the raid should be flogged and that the other boy, who was tempted, should be let off. This decision satisfied everyone. Friends had given Mr. George clothing for the boys, which they thought they were entitled to, but Mr. George said \"No, you must earn them\". They did not like the idea of working for what they claimed should be a gift, but at last they had to come to terms and understand that\nthey would receive nothing without labor. These summer outings continued until 1895 when a permanent home was established. Mr. George secured forty acres of land and put up one or two buildings and his work has expanded so that he has two hundred and fifty acres now under cultivation and twenty buildings put up and five more in course of construction.\n\nThe citizens of this Republic enact their own laws and provide the proper machinery for enforcing their observance. Mr. George, however, provided at the outset a sound framework for the guidance of the community, which enjoys perfect liberty under a reign of self-imposed law. The boys and girls make the republic work, all over twelve years being entitled to citizenship. Children under that age have guardians appointed for them, who are responsible for their physical, moral and social progress.\n\nAs there is nothing without labor, every citizen has to work and earn enough money to pay for his board and clothes. The citizens are divided into three classes\u2014unskilled workers, the middle class and skilled workers and work is carried on under helpers or instructors. Fidelity or conscientious effort count for more than natural aptitude. Unskilled labor is paid for at the rate of 50 cents a day; 70 cents is paid the middle class and 90 cents is the highest. The half-day system is in force. No one need work\u2014but no work no pay\u2014no pay no food, lodging or clothes. There is no room for idlers, who are treated as vagrants, being fined or imprisoned and then made to work out their sentence. Girls are eligible for office and vote and office-holders are paid according to a tariff. Attendance at school\ncounts as labor and is paid for accordingly. They have a metal currency of their own with a banking system and three per cent a month is allowed on deposits.\n\nThe Republic has passed beyond the experimental stage and has shown that the children have a keen sense of justice and discrimination, that they are superior by over of discipline and administration over their fellows to the superintendent and his helpers; that their suggestions as to government and administration were wise and practical and they have shown themselves as capable of making laws as of executing them.\n\nThe Republic is not planned so much to found a Utopia as it is to have the children adjust themselves to the questions as they really exist under the laws of the country at the present time. They follow the law and the constitution. The object from the beginning has been to inculcate self-reliance and orderly and intelligent conduct of affairs, as well as to give them a due sense of the value of money and other property. The non-producer is an injury to himself and a burden to the community and is dealt with accordingly.\n\nThe citizens of this Republic enjoy the wealth and blessings of variety and run no risk of losing the individual in a system which gives full sway to the personal element.\n\nYou will see from the subjoined list of publications kindly sent me by Mr. George how widespread is the fame of his undertaking. I have marked the magazines and articles I have been able to obtain at the Parliamentary Library and elsewhere.\nDr. George is described as a large-hearted man of thirty-three, of infinite tact, patience, and perception, who is assisted in his enterprise by his wife and mother and an able staff of teachers and instructors. The Republic receives no state aid and is wholly supported by voluntary subscription. He informs me that the cost per capita is about $140.00 per annum, which is to be reduced now that he has more land. He is a firm believer in the Cottage System and always has eight or ten of the children living with him, making it a point to have every child under his own roof for at least two months each year. To show how successfully this plan works I may mention that it is always spoken of by the citizens of the Republic as \"Happy George\" and his wife as \"Mother George\".\n\nI have endeavored to give you some idea of the purposes of Dr. George in establishing this Republic and the methods adopted to carry it into execution, and in concluding I cannot do better than quote Dr. George's own words: \"It is an attempt to diminish pauperism and crime by instilling into neglected children in fact any class of children, lessons of morality, responsibility, and self-control. The lessons are taught in such a way that the children can and learn by experience the results of laziness, disorder, and disobedience of moral laws. That they may learn these lessons naturally as possible and in a way to make them most useful in after life. The children are allowed to form a system of society of their own modeled as far as possible upon the great Republic in which they will ultimately become citizens and the largest measure of self-government is allowed them.\"\n\"The result is not by any means an ideal state, but it is believed that under this system each child receives just the treatment which its case demands and that the lessons learned are exactly in line with the experiences which it will meet in mature life. It is said that the Junior Republic is so radically different from any reform school, military institute or boarding school.\"\n\nMr. George, to whom I sent a copy of our Annual Report, writes me that he would very much like to have me visit the Junior Republic and thinks that possibly I might get some ideas that might be of advantage.\n\nThe interest I take in our schools led me to correspond with Mr. George and I may say candidly that it is my earnest wish that the Department would let me visit his Republic and study its workings. His new departure is endorsed by numbers of the principal educators in the United States and has attracted the attention of thousands of readers on this continent and in Europe, and I am surprised that it has not been more fully examined by our provincial governments which have to face similar problems.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nThe Association for Referring Indian School Graduates.\n\nMany have spoken to me in favor of the object of our Association, since our last meeting; and too\u2014some objections have been raised.\n\nYet there has been no objection grounded upon actual experience sufficiently strong to make me change my belief in the need of this work. Rather, from studying it further I feel the need more deeply.\n\nThe results of no previous trial of placing Indian graduates out at work can be taken as a measure of the success to look for in this, because there has not been any organized effort of this kind in America before.\n\nWe shall not only find work for the young Indians but we shall welcome them among us, and encourage and entertain them throughout their stay. All who would become Associates must pledge themselves to this. It will not be by any means a difficult undertaking, for every one who has ever worked sympathetically among Indians has experienced a rare fascination that makes many apparent sacrifices easy, even acceptable to him. I shall not attempt to analyze or explain this unusually remarkable attraction, but assuredly it exists, and I trust every Associate will feel it within a few years.\n\nThe main object of the Association\nis to take out into the cities some of the graduates of our Catholic Indian Industrial Schools; the graduates of other Indian schools to be cared for by associations in connection with the various missionary bodies in charge, if desired.\n\nOne of the first things to understand definitely is that we should prefer to have Western Indians cared for by Western branches of the Association, if possible, and too that we do not propose bringing out whole classes of graduates.\n\nWe will take rather the individuals whose abilities and temperament particularly recommend them, and who are desirous of coming.\n\nSome of the school-principals are timid about sending their pupils out to the cities. In their regard for the darker side of city life they forget that the spiritual side is trebly more active than in country life. We must have them send out a few young graduates at first, for they can do it, if they will\u2014then let the work of our Association be thorough and earnest\u2014not merely a kindling of fine ardors and sympathetic interest in the beginning, and the daddists' inertia afterward\u2014and the results will be so great and the reports sent home so bright, that it will soon be considered an honour and a desirable thing to pupils and parents for a graduate to be chosen to work in town.\n\nThe proposed Constitution explains itself. Each Indian boy or girl brought into town will not only be the protege of the Association, but will be under the particular care of some one Associate. These Associates will call upon their proteges from time to time, and the Indian should always feel at liberty in any difficulty to go to that Associat\nfor advice or encouragement.\n\nThere will be a Chaplain attached to each branch. We are most fortunate in Ottawa in the Chaplain whose appointment we anticipate. He is deeply interested in the spiritual and social advancement of the Indians and has but recently returned from a Western mission.\n\nThe pleasant little evenings to be held at an Assembly Room will be as helpful to the Associates as the Indians. There is nothing we need more to learn as Christian workers than the great want at present of brightening the right path for the masses of workers in the world.\n\nWork in this age is strenuous and exhausting. Body and spirit alike need some refreshment afterward. But people have forgotten how to actually take a rest; they prefer to find relief in pleasure of some sort.\n\nThen since Vice flourishes here and everywhere in every conceivable form of attractiveness, there is no earthly reason why Virtue should stalk through our homes or assemblies in a shroud. Tasteless has its beneficial side.\n\nThe world, including the religious world, has need of robust workers, and to work up to the best that is in us we have need of the best of recreation. Let us learn through the Indian Institutes the possibilities the leisureed class have in this age of humanism to lift and cheer the conscripts of life\u2014the tired workers.\n\nWomen can do so much good in this way, and today for some reason they form the majority of Christian workers along these lines. Yet the work of association of ladies for meeting social problems of Indians or white men is not for women alone. There is\nplace for men-workers too.\n\nWe need men in our Association and everywhere in our everyday life of the type of Arnold J. Rugby. A man whose simple character and high ideals never set him on a pedestal so high that his down-stretched hands could not meet the weaker ones of his stumbling brethren.\n\nThe plan of the Association is not offered to you as a perfect one at all. It lies open and inviting amendments. It is only a beginning, but there must be some germs of the right method in it since so many different Indian workers have testified that the quickest way to develop the Indian is by bringing him into contact, industrially and socially, with white people, and as one cannot repeat too often, white people of the right sort. This is the underlying principle of our Association.\n\nThe Indian boys and girls at the Industrial Schools receive the training they need to fit them for work among us; their race is destined to become citizens of Canada with us \u2014 and who has a better right than they to the honour of Canadian citizenship when they are fitted for its responsibilities? And though that time is quite distant still, the sooner the work of fitting them is begun in every possible way the better the Indian will be prepared.\n\nI was talking recently of this and other matters of Indian education and\nProgress to a man, a clever man he is too, but who confessed he has not studied the Indian Question.\n\nHe suggested that I seemed anxious to have the Indians come on too quickly, more so than was practical; that in fact my enthusiasm outran common sense.\n\n\"Look at the centuries it took our own ancestors in Northern Europe to become even as civilized as these Indians are now,\" he said.\n\nAnd I did look back to our own \"flint-burling, hair-mantled\" ancestors, as Carlyle describes them, and acknowledged the truth of what he said.\n\nBut\u2014when our ancestors were coming out of barbarism the world was younger, and the nations were growing up together. The Indians are differently circumstanced now. They are a race of children constrained more and more each year to come into contact with a fully-developed race.\n\nThere is no time to wait with folded hands for their complete evolution, though it is true people might take them up more gladly then\u2014when the need for it was gone.\n\nThe highest ideals and standards of our civilization are none too good to set before the Indian. Our Schools recognize that but, when school life is finished, there is the Reserve before the young people, and to phrase it mildly, it is not always easy there to live up to the Schools' standard of health and industry and general progress.\n\nOutside of Churches and Schools\nthe white people Indians usually meet are not often best calculated to advance them, spiritually or materially.\n\nThey come in contact commercially with the close bargainer whose acts almost unconsciously suggest to the Indian that money is the highest good in life to white people; and that it is excusable to stretch one's conscience a bit to obtain it.\n\nSome of the men freighting in the West or jobbing in the East meet social good-for-nothings selling outside of saloons.\n\nVery friendly fellows, these white men, and for quite a small consideration they will go in and buy the Indian a flask of liquor! They do it warily, for in their code it is a sin to break the law if you permit yourself to get caught.\n\nIn the lumber camps from Lake Superior eastward you will find a great many Indians at work, but with all respect for some thoroughly good shanty men I have met in the west, I should say the gangs in most of these camps are not likely to edify anyone or elevate one's standard of life.\n\nAs to the women, in the East a few of them selling wares meet well-dressed women on the verandahs of summer cottages and hotels; and I know they come in contact with the trim exteriors of many good homes. But how can the Indian woman imitate what she has never seen\u2014the strict cleanliness and cosy appointments of a well-ordered home among her white sisters?\nThe Indian mothers are, as a rule, more affectionate than the white mothers of America; this is one of the beautiful traits of their character. But the great majority of them have a pitiful disregard for the laws of hygiene in bringing up their children and can not make their homes bright or attractive, because they often have not the vaguest idea of how to set about it.\n\nThe younger, educated generation feels this keenly.\n\nIndian girls from Kamloops, Regina, All Hallows and Qu'Appelle Industrial schools have been from time to time at service in the towns near those schools. They have given such satisfaction that there is always a demand for them.\n\nMadame Forget of Regina, who has an Indian girl in her employ at Government House, says there is no need of an organization to find places for Indian graduates at Regina, as the graduates of these schools, wishing to enter domestic service may practically choose their own places at good wages.\n\nBut the principals of the schools seem to have withdrawn their encouragement from the outward movement. A new plan has been taken up in the West to the exclusion of all others\u2014that of marrying the graduates and settling them in small colonies isolated from their uneducated relatives.\nIsolated, they say,\u2014yet on the same reserve, and that in a country where 20 miles is a mere jaunt.\n\nIt is a good plan and if a real desire and aptitude for farming could be developed in the Indians as a whole it would be practically the best and only plan. Its progress will be very slow however upon many reserves, because it depends greatly upon what manner of man the Agent is. As yet it has been introduced to any extent upon only one agency.\n\nFor the Eastern Indians this plan is not at all a suitable one. Most of the Quebec Indians have not the land to spare for this, and the North Shore Ojibways simply will not farm if there is a lumber-camp, a mine or a fishing station within fifty miles of their reserves.\n\nThe Agent for the Kamloops Indians reports them as industrious, sober, law-abiding, yet many of them are employed on railroads, fishing, mining and freighting.\n\nIn the last Report of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs we read that after years of opportunities for taking to agriculture the Micmac Indians have cultivated only 8 acres to each unit of the population.\n\nThe Oka Indians are the only really agricultural Indians of Quebec. Ontario has quite a number in the Western peninsula, but the North Shore, Lake Superior, Pat Portage and Manitoba\nIndians do little more than gardening. In a few inspectorates in the North-West Territories, where the land is very fertile and easily worked or suitable for ranching, the Indians may be classed as agricultural. In British Columbia again those near the Canning factories and railroads prefer these industries to farming.\n\nBut few races manifest a desire to be entirely agricultural and among Indians least of all is the desire universal. Perhaps when nature-study comes to be introduced into every Indian school a taste for agriculture may be developed in the Indians, but just now there is a generation of educated young people on the reserves waiting to begin life at some congenial work.\n\nAn Ethnologist recently discovered in the peninsula of India records inscribed in a form of Japanese characters similar to the few Siouan inscriptions that have been found in the Eastern States.\n\nWhen deciphered these records strengthened the former impression of ethnologists, American and Japanese, that the Indians of America and the Japanese are of the same stock.\n\nNow, the Japanese, as we know, are particularly clever in fine handiwork. So too are our Indian men and women at basket-work, bead-work, bark-work, mat and blanket weaving and in making lacrosse sticks and snowshoes. They have been fitted by nature and by\ncenturies of ingenious handiwork to become efficient workers at our various industries.\n\nThen the two schemes should be encouraged and permitted to supplement each other. The farming colonies for the majority, if you will, but others for those who want to come and see the world and take their place with us.\n\nThe boys could be placed at various trades, or as gardeners, and a few at more intellectual work, possibly. Most of the girls would find work at domestic service, but at least a few of the most capable and cheerful should be thoroughly trained as nurses, and then joined to the Victorian Order sent back to help their people. The good they could do therein preventing the spread of tuberculosis and other disease is inestimable. Indian women are usually left-handed, soft-voiced and sympathetic; they would seem to be particularly fitted for the nurses' profession and have in fact proven it after graduation from American schools.\n\nOur plan has also this recommendation\u2014that it will educate the public up to a knowledge of the capabilities and good traits and social needs of these people toward whom we will have undeniable responsibilities for many decades yet.\n\nIt is one of the remarkable things in connection with the Indian question that white people in general even the most cultured know nothing of the Indians of today.\nSummer tourists know the fat Indian perching under her load of baskets; fortunate men who go back to our Western hills and lakes each year, know there the \"Silent, Smoky Indian\" skipping there as guide. But these can not be taken as altogether representative types of a race that improves upon acquaintance. When their reserve is once laid aside we learn that they are honest, tactful, grateful, humorous, obedient and less quarrelsome than white races.\n\nAt the Congress of Indian teachers at Buffalo this year, Major Pratt, Superintendent of Carlisle, who has almost 1500 pupils under his supervision says that although 620 of his boys and girls are at work in Pennsylvania families more than 1000 applications for help had to be refused last year. The applications came from farms, shops and homes.\n\nThe Superintendent of Phoenix School Arizona, has over 300 pupils working out half their time as housemaids and laborers. The Indian girls from the school are so much in demand that he could send out 1500 more within a radius of 5 miles.\n\nWhat these men and other Americans have been doing with their Indians for the past 15 years surely we can also do.\n\nDescendants of various races, we Canadians are beginning to build up the fires\nA patriotic love for our own Canada. Yet back of us is a very substantial shadow of the people who love Canada as a man can only love his fatherland. They are the people whose birthright we are enjoying.\n\nWe have dispossessed them as amicably as possible, it is true, and handed them back on to Reserves, and, when we except the handful of missionaries and officials, have tried to forget the Indians' existence.\n\nBut he has been coming in to a stage of civilization, where we can and should help him new ways. Honor and justice demand of us everything we can do now for the people we have pushed back into an ignoble dependence.\n\nNothing that we purpose doing for the Indian is going to improve the prospects of the white labourer. The white man has 2000 centuries of civilization behind him; at any rate; if not quite worthless, he should be able to take care of himself industrially\u2014I do not say socially.\n\nThis work for the Indians is lying at our hands waiting to be taken up. Shall we refuse it?\u2014and to our own reproach and regret afterward let the responsibility slip from our shoulders to await more tragic workers? I think not; I hope not. For myself I shall never quit the work until these necessary steps have been taken for the Indians' advancement, and successfully taken.\n\nKatherine Hughes.\n\nAt meeting held in Ottawa, Sept. 15, 1901.\n\nIn interests of educated Indians.\nOttawa, Canada. Sept. 14, 1901\n\nEsteemed Lady,\n\nI have learned with great pleasure the interest which you are taking in the welfare of the Indians boys and girls, especially in the making of some arrangements whereby these boys and girls, after leaving the industrial school, should be provided with some employment.\n\nIt is indeed deplorable to see these boys and girls receiving a good education at many sacrifices on the part of the Government and the instructors, and then being forced back to their reserves, where it is almost impossible for them to avoid falling back into their former way of living.\n\nWhat a delusion for these poor children! They have been brought to the schools in order to educate them and to ameliorate their condition; and afterwards they are permitted, and even forced to relapse into their former ways, because there is no opening for them where their education could be of any benefit to them, and because there is a lack of persons who would be disposed to accept their services. It would have been better to allow them to follow the customs of their sires, than after filling their minds with ambition by a superior education, to blight their hopes and to allow them to retrograde into their former way of living.\n\nWishing you God's choicest blessings for the good work,\n\nI remain,\nSincerely Yours,\n\n\u2020 D. Falconis, Asch. of Langley\nApostolic Delegate\nCost of schools conducted by the Methodist Church\n\nto June 30, 1904.\n\n| School                  | Total Cost of School since Inception | Additional

I understand that one of these industrial schools in Manitoba\nand another one in the Territories are being closed, and that board-\nschools on the reserves are being substituted in lieu thereof. Is\nthat a new policy on the part of the Government?\n\nMr. Sifton: I have discussed this question of industrial schools\nin the House several times before and I stated that my views were, my\nviews have not changed and the policy of the Department is just the\nsame as it was when I explained it on a previous occasion. My own be-\nlief is that the system of industrial schools as I found it in opera-\ntion when I took office, is not the best, or the most effective, or\nthe most economic way of improving the condition of the Indians. I\nthought the system adopted was an artificial system. I found that In-\ndian boys and girls were being kept in these schools in some cases\nuntil they were 23, 24 and 25 years of age. The Dominion of Canada\nis not under any obligation to conduct a system of education for an\nIndian tribe, under which the education of each child became so ex-\npensive and artificial. I put in force a rule that children were not\nremain in the schools after the age of eighteen and that rule has\nbeen followed except in a very few cases where for special reasons\nit has been relaxed. We have substituted a less elaborate system;\na system of what we call boarding schools where a larger number of\nchildren can be for a shorter time be educated more economically and\ngenerally more effectively. What we desire to do is not to give a\nhighly specialized education to half-a-dozen out of a large band of In-\ndians, but if possible to distribute over the whole band a moderate\namount of education and intelligence so that the general status of\nthe band would be raised. While none of those engaged on behalf of\nthe different churches in Indian education were not of my view at the\ntime, I believe they have pretty well come to that opinion now. I\ndid not think it was justifiable for me to change the policy which had\nbeen\nbeen deliberately entered upon and in regard to which a large amount of money had been expended, so I stated to the House that while on the whole I held that view, I was not prepared to discontinue the industrial schools which existed. I thought I was bound to continue them on the existing lines, but that the rule should be enforced that pupils should not remain to an advanced age. I held, however, that in the establishment of further institutions the principle should be followed of contracting a boarding school rather than an industrial school system. My hon. friend (Mr. Laiviere) is probably aware that the authorities of St. Boniface Industrial School have found that the principle which I have advocated was the principle which should be applied in carrying out their work, because the Department accepted a proposition of theirs by which they agreed to take off our hands at a valuation the buildings and the property of the industrial school at St. Boniface and to build three boarding schools in lieu thereof. They agreed with my opinion that the boarding schools, where a less elaborate and lengthy system of education would be carried on and a larger number of children benefitted (those schools being placed at different points upon the reserve) was more beneficial than the carrying on of one industrial school at St. Boniface. We are carrying on the industrial school which exists at the present time. Our desire is not to multiply them but to inaugurate boarding schools wherever additional educational facilities are required. Experience shows that in order to get really effective results, the boarding school must be resorted to. In some places where we have day schools, and where we cannot incur the expense of a boarding school, the results are not as satisfactory as we could hope.\n\nMr. Laiviere: Do I understand that the boarding schools are as effective as the industrial schools? I would remind the hon. gentlemen that the education of the Indians does not merely consist of teaching them to read and write but that in addition they have to be civilized. In that case if you keep the Indians within their reserve I am afraid the civilization of the Indian will not be attained. I believe the best way to civilize them is to remove them from their reserves and get them to lead a civilized life at least for a certain time. I fear that the civilization of the Indians will not be attained by keeping them on their reserves, removed from the knowledge and influences of\nI do not think that the question of cost should be taken into consideration in such a case and I fear that we are going back on a system that was found to be good. I see from the last report of the Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs that he proclaimed the system of industrial schools to be far better than the other systems on that very account.\n\nMr. Sifton: The result of my observation and study in connection with the industrial schools was this, that the attempt to give a highly civilized education to the Indian child, keeping him in a school until he was 22 or 23 years of age and attempting to teach him a trade, was practically a failure. I have no hesitation in saying (we may as well be frank) that the Indian cannot go out from a school, making his own way and compete with the white man. Experience shows that when you give an Indian every possible chance until he is 22 or 23 years of age you cannot afford to turn him loose to look after himself; you will get no satisfactory result, an Indian cannot succeed in competition with other people. That was why the teachers in some of the schools insisted on keeping the pupils after the age when they ought to be sent out. Then I asked: Why do you keep these pupils here? The answer was we did not know what to do with them. If they go out they must either attempt to compete with other people or go back to the reserve. I am no doubt myself that a system between the day school and the industrial school whereby any child could be taken in at a moderately early age and kept for four or five years of training in the school, is the system under which you could get the best results.\n\nI may say that the inspectorate of Mr. Graham, the Qu'Appelle inspectorate, this system has been inaugurated. Mr. Graham has set apart a portion of the reserve where the pupils from the industrial and boarding schools are encouraged to settle and take up allotments, so that that have practically a separate settlement, one being alongside the other they have a certain amount of encouragement to continue a civilized life. That system has been in operation for a comparatively short time, but Mr. Graham is satisfied that it is going to prove successful and I myself am satisfied on general principles that it will probably be the most successful way of bringing about a higher state of civilization amongst them.\nMr. W.J. Hoche: Might I ask the hon. minister if it is the intention to continue the Elkhorn Industrial school and are the trades still being taught to the Indian pupils in that school?\n\nMr. Sifton: No change has been made in the Elkhorn school except that we are trying to cut down the expenses. The expense has been very high, I think unreasonably high, and there has been a contest between the head office and the Commissioner in regard to keeping it down. The expense was cut down a little during the past year. My hon. friend will find in the report of the Department the following statement:\n\n\"We are encouraging the boys to take up agriculture, as we feel that this is the most important industry that can be taught them. The boys are instructed in carpentry, painting, bootmaking, farming and gardening. A number are also employed in general work about the institution and in keeping the grounds in order. The girls are taught cooking, housework, laundry-work, dressmaking, plain sewing, knitting and crocheting. They perform all the necessary household duties in all of which they show great aptitude.\"\n\nMr. Clarke: When the idea of schools, day, boarding and industrial was up I intended to ask the hon. minister as to the percentage of Indian children that pass through the Indian schools who retain the veneer of civilization which they receive there? I visited the Indian school at Brandon, was very much interested in the work, and would like to know from the hon. minister if these children after passing through the school, are sent back to the reservation, and if so, how many of them lapse again? How many of them retain the polish they got in the schools and what becomes of them?\n\nMr. Sifton: I could not offhand give the hon. gentlemen the exact statistics.\n\nMr. Clarke: I just want the hon. gentleman to state generally.\n\nMr. Sifton: Speaking generally the result has been that the pupils of the industrial schools have not been able to go out in ordinary life and compete with white men. I have stated my opinion as to what was the result and what was likely to be the result of this form of Indian education. I am perfectly satisfied that you cannot take the child of the ordinary prairie Indian, put him in an industrial school, keep him there until he is 21 years of age and turn him loose to earn...\nThis living amongst white men. He has not the physical, mental or moral get-up to enable him to compete. He cannot do it. The result has been that to a large extent the Indians who have been educated in this way have gone back to the reserves. I do not think that this work has been in any way lost because I can say to my honourable friend from my own knowledge having lived in the Northwest since 1876, that there is the most marvellous change in the general character of Indian bands.\n\nMr. Clarke: Is that the result of the infusion of educated civilized Indians into the reservation?\n\nMr. Sifton: I think that is very largely the result of the educational work that is being carried on. I think we have got less per dollar from the money we have expended in the industrial schools than we have from any of the other schools. I believe in the day and boarding schools. We have got a great deal more for the money which has been expended on these schools, while we have not educated them to such a high point, we have infused a great amount of education amongst a larger number. A very promising experiment is being made by Mr. Graham, the inspector of the Sul'Appelle Agencies, who has been most successful in bringing about a better state of affairs amongst the Indians under his charge. He has made good practical farmers out of them; they raised 65,000 bush. of wheat last year; we are now buying cattle from them for supplying other reserves; they are most successful and we have ceased the distribution of supplies amongst them. Mr. Graham has adopted this plan: He has set aside locations on certain portions of the reserve and he encourages the young men and the young women who come from the schools to marry and settle down on these locations. He endeavours to see that they are not interfered with by any of the rest of the Indians. As a matter of practice, one of the most serious difficulties in improving an Indian band is that just as soon as an Indian couple show an inclination to thrift and gather a little property around them, all their Indian relations think it necessary for them to work just in proportion as this couple is prosperous. Their relations take their supplies and consequently they have no encouragement to accumulate property. Mr. Graham has been most successful in this experiment. A few years ago I put him in charge of three different agencies.\nAgencies and lately I have promoted him to be inspector, so that he has a larger scope for his activity. I believe Mr. Graham will solve the problem if it can be solved, and he will solve it by endeavouring to promote settlement in a separate locality of those who come from the schools, and where they can have as much higher or civilized life as they could if they settled amongst other Indians.\n**STATEMENT**\n\nShowing expenditure on industrial schools for year ended June 30, 1905\n\n---\n\n### ONTARIO\n\n- Mohawk Institute ........................................ $ 5,460.00\n- Mount Elgin Institute .................................... 6,000.00\n- Shingwauk Home ......................................... 3,585.00\n- Wikwemikong Schools ..................................... 2,112.00\n\nTotal expenditure ........................................ $17,157.00\n\n---\n\n### BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\n- Alert Bay .................................................. $2,389.14\n- Coqualeetza Home ......................................... 8,876.78\n- Kamloops .................................................... 6,497.83\n- Kootenay ..................................................... 6,508.98\n- Kuper Island ................................................ 6,500.00\n- Lytton .......................................................... 400.86\n- Metlakahtla ................................................... 4,441.18\n- Williams Lake ................................................ 4,650.75\n\nTotal expenditure ........................................ $35,456.81\n\n---\n\n### MANITOBA\n\n- Brandon ...................................................... 14,733.02\n- Elkhorn ....................................................... 18,671.48\n- Rupert's Land ................................................ 15,945.65\n- St. Boniface .................................................. 4,436.45\n\nTotal expenditure ........................................ $43,786.50\n\n---\n\n### NORTH WEST TERRITORIES\n\n- Battleford .................................................... 13,355.78\n- Calgary .......................................................... 8,287.15\n- Qu'Appelle .................................................... 27,266.01\n- Red Deer ....................................................... 8,176.61\n- Regina ........................................................... 13,809.59\n- St. Joseph ...................................................... 10,202.38\n\nTotal expenditure ........................................ $82,067.45\n\n---\n\n### Recapitulations\n\n- Ontario ......................................................... $21,935.00\n- British Columbia ............................................ $50,456.81\n- Manitoba ....................................................... $54,780.41\n- Northwest Territories ....................................... $82,067.45\n\nTotal expenditure ........................................ $208,241.67\nSummary of amounts contributed to the various Industrial Schools.\n\n---\n\n**Manitoba**\n\n| Location     | Amount       |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Brandon      | $148,523.90  |\n| Elkhorn      | $250,716.14  |\n| Rupert's Land | $225,978.71  |\n| St. Boniface | $157,698.71  |\n\nTotal: $782,808.76\n\n---\n\n**N.W.T.**\n\n| Location     | Amount       |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Battleford   | $44,476.78   |\n| Calgary      | $1,306.14    |\n| Qu'Appelle   | $17,053.53   |\n| Red Deer     | $28,688.09   |\n| Regina       | $257,289.24  |\n| High River   | $297,185.27  |\n\nTotal: $81,831,089.05\n\n---\n\n**British Columbia**\n\n| Location     | Amount       |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Alert Bay    | $30,311.11   |\n| Coqualeetza Hope | $74,207.11   |\n| Kamloops     | $84,667.54   |\n| Kootenay     | $82,492.30   |\n| Kupers Island | $94,008.43   |\n| Metlakatla   | $82,805.59   |\n| Williams Lake| $65,986.25   |\n\nTotal: $535,011.58\n\n---\n\nTotal: $82,948,494.04\nStatement showing amounts contributed to the various Industrial schools.\n\nManitoba\n\nBrandon .................. $16,907.58 was expended by the Department in the erection of main buildings in 1883-4, and $22,388 has since been expended in erecting outbuildings, and for repairs, additions, alterations and equipment.

General,\n\nWith reference to your memo. of the 20th August last,\nI beg to submit statements showing the total cost of operating\nA & B: the Industrial schools throughout the Dominion from their in-\nception to the 30th June 1903, returns are not yet in for the\nyear ended 1904, together with a statement showing the amounts\ncontributed by the Government towards the erection and equipment\nof boarding schools, and, so far as the records of the Depart-\nment go, the contributions made by the religious denominations\ncarrying on the work among the Indians.\n\nThe total cost of operating industrial schools amounts\nto $2,648,494.54, exclusive of Ontario, the expenditure in this\nProvince has been about $20,000 annually for some years past,\nwhile the expenditure for the year ended 30th June 1903 for in-\ndustrial schools was $208,241.67. This has been increasing\nannually. The accompanying statement shows the amounts expended\non each of the industrial schools in the different provinces\nfor that year.\n\nIn reply to your enquiry as to what benefit is derived\nfrom the training of pupils in industrial schools, I cannot do\nbetter than refer you to remarks of the Minister as contained\nin the Hansard of the 18th July of this year when discussing\nthe school estimates in the House. (See page 6956 of Hansard\nat seq., an extract from which accompanies this memo.) It\nhas never been the policy of the Department nor the design of\nindustrial schools to turn Indian pupils out to compete with\nwhites. The industrial schools were established for the pur-\npose of giving the Indian pupils a better education than the\nday or boarding schools afforded and to bring them more into\nthe ways of civilized life than the residence on the reserves\npermits; and I think I may safely say that they have succeeded\nin this. If they have not gone farther, it has been in part\nto the system in vogue at these schools. I have always main-\ntained that more lasting results would be secured if the system\nwere changed so as to necessitate the pupils working their\nown way through school instead of being carried on holens volens.\nThe returns giving the status of discharged pupils, who have\npassed through industrial schools, show in the majority of in-\nstances that the results have been satisfactory. The girls\nare\nin nearly every instance have turned out well and married and\nendeavouring to keep a comfortable home. The Indian boys where\nopportunity offers are working for themselves or others with\nfair success. Many of the reserves are unfitted for agricul-\nture and the returned pupils have to take up the occupations\nof the other Indians of the tribe, and in such case the train-\ning at the school has not been of any great advantage to them.\nWhere they are able to do a little farming the training\nhas been beneficial; but they are all handicapped for want of\nmeans to make a start, and I claim that if they had the oppor-\ntunity of earning something while at school instead of depend-\ning upon the generosity of the Government to supply them, much\nbetter results would follow.\n\nSince the industrial schools were established consider-\nable modifications have been made from the original design,\nwhich was formerly to give them trades instruction in addi-\ntion to farming; now the efforts of all these schools are devoted\nto agriculture, and such trade instructions as they receive\nis merely to supplement this design and make them handy all\nround farmers, carpentering and use of tools being taught to\nall the male pupils. The girls are all instructed in house-\nhold duties and should make excellent housekeepers. These\nschools are not designed to turn out servants or employees.\nLIST SHOWING CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOARDING SCHOOLS.\n\nOntario.\n\nPort William Orphanage .......... $1,500 paid from band funds towards cost of buildings in 1895.\n\nR.

The experimental stage has had its day and if the results have not been all that was desired or hoped, yet the experience gained may be very useful as indicating wherein past methods have been defective, and whether any of them are capable of improvement or should be discarded for something entirely different.\n\nDuring the past few months several informal conferences have been held between representatives of the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian churches for the purpose of comparing views, giving the results of experience in Indian educational work, and ascertaining how far the Churches would be prepared to co-operate in bringing the matter to the attention of the Government, and, if desired, in helping to outline a uniform policy applicable to the whole Dominion. These conferences have shown important that on many points there is a general consensus of opinion among the churches, and a sincere desire to co-operate with the Government in any comprehensive plan that will promise better results than have been secured in the past.\nWe recognize in common, we believe, with the Head of the Indian Department that the present annual expenditure in that Department is very large; and it has occurred to us that by a careful revision and modification of the educational policy a considerable reduction might be effected, or at all events, such a system inaugurated as would result in far better work. The latter point is the more important; for even large expenditure for the benefit of these wards of the nation should not be objected to if only the work accomplished is in some good degree commensurate with the outlay, but unless good results on a larger scale can be secured, the present expenditure can hardly be justified.\n\nAs the object of this memorandum is to invite the attention of the Government to the general question of Indian education with a view to such action in the future as may be deemed wise and expedient, it is unnecessary at present to go largely into details, but we respectfully beg to submit a few suggestions to indicate certain lines along which, in our judgment, changes might wisely be introduced.\n\nAs the result of a somewhat lengthy experience we are convinced that the ordinary day school on an Indian reserve is of very little use, and in most cases might be dispensed with to advantage if more efficient provision can be made in some other way, which we deem quite feasible. It seems to be practically impossible to secure anything like regular attendance at the ordinary day school, and the difficulties in the way of inducing the children to use the English language are insurmountable. To secure useful results it is essential that the Indian children during the educational period, should be kept entirely apart, wherever possible, from the associations of life on the reserve, and that the educational process should be continued until an age is reached when they will be capable of taking care of themselves.\nAs an alternative for the day school we would suggest a system of well equipped and properly conducted boarding or industrial schools, supplemented by a limited number of institutes where further training might be given to the most promising pupils from the boarding schools. These schools should be, as a rule, at some distance from the reserves, but so located as to be of easy access to the largest number of Indian children, and the equipment should depend, to some extent, upon the surroundings of the school. Where good land is available and climatic conditions are favorably, the chief, if not the sole industries should be:\n\n(a) For the boys:\u2014Mixed farming, including the raising and care of live stock, cereals, field and garden vegetables, etc. The teaching of ordinary trades seems practically useful.\n\n(b) For Girls:\u2014All kinds of housework, including care of rooms, making of beds, cooking, laundry work, sewing, knitting, butter-making, poultry raising and ordinary garden work.\n\nThe age limit for pupils in boarding schools might be from six or seven to twelve or fourteen years, according to circumstances, but each pupil should have at least five years of continuous residence. In view of the suggested age limit, farm work would be on a comparatively limited scale at the boarding schools, but quite sufficient for a good beginning. In localities where farm work is impracticable other forms of outdoor industry for boys would have to be considered. But as the raising of cattle and the cultivation of the soil constitute the forms of industry to which the Indian, under proper training, will most readily adapt himself, and are physically and morally the most wholesome, we respectfully submit they should receive special attention wherever possible.\n\nIt is probable that boarding schools such as are here referred to would meet the needs of the majority of the Indian children; but doubtless there will be a certain number for whom further\nfurther provision should be made. We would suggest, therefore, the maintenance of a limited number of well equipped industrial institutes to which pupils from the boarding schools, who have reached a prescribed standard, might be sent for further training. If taken in at the age of 12 or 14 years they should not be allowed to depart (save under exceptional circumstances) till they have attained their majority, or say 18 years for the girls and 21 years for the boys. We also deem it important that during their stay in the institute the older boys and girls should receive, under careful regulations, a graduated scale of remuneration for their work, and thus be encouraged to cultivate habits of thrift and have something wherewith to begin life when institute days are ended.\n\nAnd this leads to a point perhaps the most important of all, touching the Indian educational problem,\u2014namely the entire lack of provision to start the young Indians in life when the training time is over. When leaving the institution, at the very door-step there is a yawning chasm without any bridge by which it may be crossed and into which even the most promising pupils must inevitably fall. That is to say, when the institute is left behind, the only refuge is the reserve, or worse still, the hunting lodge, where a few years will undo, in most cases, many years of careful training and frustrate the best efforts of those who seek to raise the Indian into independent manhood. This does not mean that it is useless to educate the Indian. The fatal defect,\u2014the missing link\u2014is just at the point where his education ends and his independent industrial life should begin. We venture to say that if a given number of foreigners, on their arrival in this country, were put upon a reserve and treated in all respects as Indians, in less than a generation they would be Indians to all intents and purposes. So long as the Indian is treated as a ward and a minor, he never can be developed into a man and a citizen.\nAs a remedy for the evil referred to what we would respectfully suggest is this: That when an Indian youth has reached his majority and has graduated with credit from an institute, he be given land in his own right, 40 or 80 acres to begin with, and the promise of the balance of the quarter section when he has shown his ability to use it properly. The title to the land to be given at the end of say three, four or five years, when the occupant has proved his capability to maintain an independent position. But the land alone will not suffice. The occupant should receive assistance to provide necessary but inexpensive buildings, a few head of live stock, necessary farm implements to begin operations with, seeds of various kinds and provisions to tide him over the first year at least till the returns from the land begin to come in. Unless this or some analogous plan can be adopted, we see little hope for the industrial future of the Indian tribes.\n\nIn regard to the boarding schools we would respectfully call the attention of the Superintendent General to the impossibility of maintaining them on the present per capita basis, and as these schools, at least those within treaty limits, are established in furtherance of the treaty obligations of the Government, there does not seem to be any sufficient reason why the churches should meet the deficit out of moneys contributed for purely religious purposes. If the whole cost is borne by the Department this may raise the further question whether these shall be Government schools pure and simple, and what part, if any, the churches should have in their management. In cases where the Indians belong chiefly to one denomination the case might be met by allowing the authorities of the church in question to nominate the Principal, provision for religious instruction (which we deem most important) to be a matter for mutual arrangement between the Department and the churches concerned.\n\nThere are other aspects of this question worthy of careful\ncareful consideration which we have not touched upon, but if the Government is disposed to go into the whole question, either by commission or directly by the Indian Department, we shall be most happy to render any assistance in our power and to cooperate in plans that may be deemed most advantageous to the Indian youth of the country.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nHon. S.A. Blake\n\nEx. msscc\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 11th January, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe memorial hereunder which is undated and unsigned, regarding the question of Indian education, purports to set out the joint views of the three Protestant denominations engaged in this work among the Indians, but before a uniform policy applicable to the whole Dominion could be considered, the Roman Catholic Church would have to be asked to co-operate as they have charge of a larger number of schools and have been longer in the field than any other denomination. They also have more intimate acquaintance with the Indians.\n\nThe Minister himself has recognized the desirability of a revision and modification of the educational policy and if the co-operation of all the churches interested can be secured, a better system might be devised than the one at present in operation, one which would give more satisfactory results for the money expended. The memorial then proceeds to offer a few suggestions indicating certain lines along which changes might be introduced.\n\nIt is suggested that a day school on an Indian reserve is of very little use and in most cases might be dispensed with to advantage if more efficient provision could be made in some other way which is deemed quite feasible. This is at present to a large extent correct as out of the 228 day schools in operation on the 30th June last, 98 had an average attendance of less than 10, but the chief failure of day schools in obtaining satisfactory results is owing to\nto the class of schools established. Many of these schools should be discontinued for lack of attendance but the others should be improved, as a properly conducted day school can make its influence felt on a reserve. Better equipment and larger salaries would be required to put them on a sound basis. Chap. 32, 57-58 Victoria, Sections 167-168 provide for the compulsory attendance of all Indian children between the ages of 7 and 16 at a day school, and for the punishment of parents or guardians who refuse or neglect to cause their children to attend. Regulations were made by His Excellency, the Governor General in Council on the 10th Nov. 1894 for the carrying out of this Act.\n\nThe alternative suggested for the day school is a system of well-equipped and properly conducted boarding or industrial schools where children from 6 or 7 to 12 or 14 years might be placed and receive the training indicated in the memorial. We have 46 boarding schools now in operation in the Dominion which have been established at the solicitation of religious bodies. They have provision for 1523 pupils and had an average attendance for the year ended 30th June last of 1449, and are in receipt of a per capita grant of $60 in the Provinces of Ontario and B.C., and $72 in Manitoba and the North-West. Nearly all the schools of this class are in financial difficulties and are poorly equipped and badly placed. The Government grant not being sufficient to carry on the schools under the most economical, the missionary societies find themselves hampered in their efforts to improve their condition.\nAlthough these boarding schools have been established and put up by the different churches, the Department has contributed large amounts towards the cost of the buildings, and if these suggestions are approved of a number of the present boarding schools should be abandoned, as it would never be possible to make them successful. With regard to the industrial training to be given in all such schools, it should be with the end in view of fitting the pupils, if they are to return to their reserves, for the conditions they will encounter when they leave school.\n\nThe age limit suggested in the memorandum is rather young. It would be a hardship to take children from their parents at such a tender age, even if the law permitted this to be done. It is doubtful whether the Act gives power to compel Indians to send their children to industrial or boarding schools, and the Courts have held that even when admitted to such schools with the parents consent, they cannot be held under the present regulations if proceedings are taken for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. See Judge Richards opinion re application of Roderick Cameron to secure the control of his two sons who were pupils at the Rupert's Land Industrial school, file 117377---10. This being the case, it would seem wiser to improve the system before extending the schools. The present schools are not popular among the Indians.\n\nThe most valuable suggestion made in this memorandum is the one referring to the starting of the young Indian in life when his school career is ended and it should receive most careful consideration.\nThe question of increasing the per capita grant to boarding schools should also be considered, as it is plain that they cannot be maintained at the present allowance, and it would appear to be better to raise the grant than have to pay deficits. If, however, the grant is raised, some more definite arrangement should be made with the churches conducting these schools, which would relieve the Department from responsibility for their financial management, and they should in all cases be placed in charge of the most competent men, who should devote their whole time and attention to their management.\n\nThis memorial is worthy of careful consideration and the sooner the whole Indian school question is gone into the better.\n\nIn conclusion I may state that Rev. Dr Sutherland, when here last spring expressed himself in favor of the views enunciated in this memorandum and the Presbyterian Church authorities have also expressed similar views.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 9th March, 1905\n\nTo Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the different matters touched upon by Mr. Blake in his letter to you of the 27th ult., I beg to say that his analysis of the different statements shows that he has gone into the Indian question very thoroughly. I can explain the apparent discrepancy on page 84 of the appendix, to which he calls attention. While the census returns for B.C. give the number as 26,334 Indians for that province, no account is taken in the analysis of the religious belief or ages of 3500 nomadic Indians. But this, added to the 21,734 Indians of whom details are given would make the total number shown on the census return. The difference in the census of the N.W.T. Territories is accounted for in the same manner, no details being given as to religion or age of the Indians in Treaty 8, comprising 3535 souls. These two items would make up the aggregate of 7312 short of the total number shown in the census of these two provinces.\n\nMr. Blake then refers to the summary of the school statement which shows that there are in the provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba and the Territories a total of 175 schools, of which 111 are day, 46 boarding and 18 missionary. Out of the 111 day schools in the three provinces, 68 had an average attendance for last year of less than 10 pupils. Twelve of these schools were in B.C., 21 in Manitoba and 20 in the N.W.T. Out of the 46 boarding schools in these three provinces, 16 are in receipt of a grant.\ngrant for 20 pupils and under. Without taking into account the small number of boys in the whole of our 24 industrial schools (not 19 as mentioned by Mr Blake) who are learning trades in addition to farming this would show a large expenditure for a small result. The 30 day schools, which have an average attendance of less than 10 might better be closed, and it is almost a waste of money to attempt to carry on a boarding school with a per capita grant for 20 pupils or under. There is no church engaged in this work that can afford to employ first class qualified teachers with normal school certificates for schools receiving $1440.00 a year or under. If it could be possible to diminish the number of such schools, it would be a wise move, but it would be next to impossible to do so as the Department would be confronted with the opposition of the different religious denominations carrying on these schools.\n\nMr Blake is quite correct in his estimate of the requirements of our schools, but in order to meet his views it would be necessary to obtain the cooperation of the different religious denominations carrying on educational work among the Indians. To do this would entail more outlay for salaries and a larger per capita grant, but the difference might be met by reducing the number of schools. I think that the only way a workable scheme for improving the present school system can be arrived at is by discussion and consultation with the authorities of the denominations interested.\n\nThe last page of Mr Blake's letter deals particularly with the Indian Trust Fund.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 17th July, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nAs requested by your memorandum of the 19th ultimo, I beg to submit herewith a statement showing the Boarding and Industrial schools in each Province, when started, the number of pupils allowed, the per capita grant, the amount expended, the number of pupils in attendance, the number graduated, the financial condition, what has become of the graduates and the extra financial assistance rendered.\n\nIn regard to the four industrial schools in Ontario, I beg to say that no returns are received of the status of their discharged pupils, but out of the 1613 pupils discharged from these schools, nearly all are in a fair way to make their own living. The bulk of them are on the Six Nations, Mohawk, Muncey and On- reserves in Ontario, with a number from Caughnawag now alive may be classed as\nAs I understand you wish to use these statements in connection with the proposed interview between the Minister and the Secretaries of the Missionary Societies engaged in school work on Thursday next, I send you a copy of the unsigned memorandum which was received in January last from Toronto, outlining the views of the Missionary Societies in regard to the Indian School Policy, as well as a memorandum prepared by myself on this subject and one on Mr Blake's letter to you in regard to the same matter.\n\nWith regard to the day schools I may state that on the 30th June 1904 there were 228 in operation, and upon referring to Page 36, Part 2 of the Annual Report for 1904, you will find full details of these schools. I may mention that out of these 228 schools, 98 had an average attendance of under 10 for that year, 58 being in Manitoba, B.C. and the N.W.T. The reports of our inspectors and agents show that many of these schools are doing little, if any, good, owing to the small enrollment and irregular attendance.\n\nThe statements and memoranda, other than those which I am sending you, are not very satisfactory, and I would be glad if you would\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\nRG 10, Volume 6001\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 1\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1879 - 1905\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 2\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1904 - 1928\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 3\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1928 - 1936\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 4\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1922 - 1941\nThere is such a notably weak feature in nearly all Indian Schools that I wish to direct attention to it. It accounts, in my opinion, for much of our educational effort which is admittedly wasted. For it is beyond doubt that Indian children have the capacity to learn and that the reason of non-success in education is not to be found in want of intelligence.\n\nFrom the moment they enter schools, whether day, boarding, or industrial, teaching should commence which is directly aimed at making them understand the difference between the status of a reserve Indian and an Indian who has all the rights of a citizen. Such teaching could no other be given, would be of greater practical value than all other combined. Yet I have never known a school in which it was given, and this is the weak feature in our schools to which I refer.\n\nNothing in the least approaching invidious or disagreeable comparisons should enter into such teaching; but the lesson should be learned as completely as may be before children leave the schools.\n\nIf education does not mean character development\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ndevelopment it means nothing. In white schools we aim to teach what is not taught in the homes not what is taught there for that would be superfluous. The school teaching plus the home teaching is designed to produce the character.\n\nTeachers are trained to do the school's part of teaching in white schools; curriculums are framed to systematize that part of the child's teaching; Inspectors are appointed to see it done.\n\nBut put these same teachers, curriculums and Inspectors into operation, as we do, on Indian children and no matter how well they operate the Indian children's character is left unmade. What the white child learns in his home and at his mother's knee remains unlearned. Yet this is the most important part of life's lesson to the child.\n\nIt is some seventeen years since, having in view the strengthening of this weak feature, I drafted a course of study for Indian Schools which had as an end in view the teaching of Indian children what they could not learn in their homes. I now, with seventeen years added experience assure you of the absolute need of such teaching, and that it has not been given. It was complained that a text book was needed. One was written and was sent to print, but was subsequently withdrawn for reasons unnecessary to relate, but which had nothing to do with the needs of the case. The needs were recognized and admitted.\n\nThe best teaching given on lines of white education, except on one or two reserves where home teaching is sound, has failed and must fail to have ultimate good effects commensurate to its excellence, because knowledge without character must always be in great degree a dangerous thing. Our experience has shown that it is so.\nOTTAWA, 29th July, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General)\n\nI beg to say that I do not see anything in Mr Macrae's memorandum hereunder that calls for action. The boarding and Industrial schools certainly afford better home training than it is the privilege of the average white child to receive, and the reports of the Public School Inspectors of the different Provinces, and of our own Inspector in Manitoba and the North-West, show that many of the teachers are obtaining very good results in moulding the characters of the pupils committed to their charge. I do not consider that the Department would deem it politic to do away with the system now followed of employing Provincial Inspectors of white schools to inspect our Indians schools, and if I am correct in this opinion, it would be a work of supererogation to have the same ground covered by Inspectors from the Department.\n\nWith regard to the Manual for Teachers, which Mr Macrae says was suppressed some 17 years ago, I beg to say that there is nothing on file to show that it ever reached the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 21st., 1908.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the Memorandum of resolutions agreed upon by a Joint Committee representing the Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican Churches in the month of April 1907 with additions made on the 29th of October; comprising altogether eight sub-heads.\n\nThese resolutions embody certain recommendations which you have thought proper to submit to the Department on the subject of Indian education, and since their receipt they have been the subject of careful consideration. Before dealing with the present position occupied by the question of Indian education it seems desirable to give a short review of the whole subject in order that it may be seen how the existing establishment has arisen, and why it is maintained. It is self-evident that the prime purpose of Indian education is to assist in solving what may be called the Indian problem, to elevate the Indian from his condition of savagery, to make him a self-supporting member of the state, and eventually a citizen in good standing. The work of Indian education from the earliest times has always been experimental, having this object in view, and if these methods have been open to criticism in some important particulars, yet it can safely be said that the general effect of the policy has made for the betterment of Indian conditions throughout the country.\n\nThe first efforts to educate the Indians were undertaken by the early missionaries to this country. Probably the first regular school established was at the Grand River, after the Six Nations had been settled there by Governor Haldimand. The imperial authorities under whose direction Indian affairs were administered up to the year 1860 did not make any special grant for education. The first funds set\napart for these purposes arose from the commutation made by certain tribes of their annual distribution of ammunition. This formed the nucleus of what was called the Indian school fund, an account which was held as part of the Indian Trust Fund. This contribution began in 1848 and ended on the 30th June 1862. This Indian School Fund maintained Industrial schools at Mount Elgin and Alderville which were conducted by the Methodist Church upon a per capita grant. Thus, at the inception of the Indian school question, we find two main characteristics which have ever since continued, i.e., the principle of the per capita grant and the denominational interest. The Indian School Fund remained the sole financial aid to Indian education until 1875-6 when a grant to assist it was made by the Parliament of Canada. This financial aid enabled the Department to open day schools on various reserves in the Maritime Provinces and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The trust funds of the Indian bands also began to be made use of to a certain extent as the interest of the Indians themselves in education increased.\n\nThe early Treaties or Surrenders by which the Indians ceded territory to the Crown did not stipulate for education as one of the considerations for this cession. The first mention of education as an obligation to be met by the Government appears in the Indian Treaty known as Treaty No. I, which was signed in the year 1871. This provision for education was included in the subsequent treaties and it is in part owing to the endeavor of the Department to carry out these Treaty stipulations that the large expenditure has arisen. But these treaty stipulations have been more than fulfilled. As a rule the educational clauses of the Treaties simply state that teachers shall be provided when the Indians desire them. The inception of an educational policy was thus left to the Indians but has been initiated solely by the Government with a view to advance their general interests.\n\nThe first grant by the Dominion Government towards Indian\nIt was not until the year 1879-80 that any appropriation was made for Indian education in Manitoba and the North West Territories, and in that year the sum of $11,000.00 was granted. The Indians of British Columbia received no educational benefits from Dominion expenditure until the year 1874-5 when $2474.47 was spent from the general appropriations. In 1878-9 the question of establishing Indian Industrial Schools in the West was first taken up.\n\nThe first industrial school was established at Battleford in 1883. The Department adopted the principles which had long governed Indian education in the older Provinces and this school was conducted by the Church of England. In the following year industrial schools were established at Qu'Appelle and High River under the guidance of the Roman Catholic Church. The principle of the per capita grant was extended to the schools in the new district in the year 1891 as a step in the direction of economy. It may, therefore, be said that the Department in establishing these schools merely extended the system already in vogue in the Eastern Provinces. In the year 1887 the Department inaugurated the policy of expansion which resulted gradually in a very large increase in expenditure. No new principles of action were however adopted and the schools were conducted practically under the same rules and regulations and systems of payment. In the year 1878-79 the whole school appropriation for Canada was $16,000.00; in 1888-89 the expenditure was $178,980.93; for the year 1908-09 the appropriations will be $445,837.00. In addition to this expenditure from Consolidated Revenue the Indians themselves contributed an annual amount of over $10,000 from their own funds for the maintenance of day schools on their reserves, making a grand total of $456,000.00.\n\nIn the interval between 1882 and 1898 the Department had also completely wiped out the Indian School Fund, capital $39,148.83, and interest, and the account was accordingly closed on the 1st July 1898.\n\nThis large expansion in expenditure has been accompanied by\ninterest, and the account was accordingly closed on the 1st July 1898.\n\nThis large expansion in expenditure has been accompanied by increased educational facilities. In 1856 there were about 30 schools in operation; at the present time there are 230 day schools, 55 boarding schools, and 22 industrial schools distributed as follows:\n\nDay Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Ontario          | 75     |\n| Quebec           | 19     |\n| Nova Scotia      | 10     |\n| New Brunswick    | 6      |\n| Prince Edward Island | 1   |\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|------------------|--------|\n| British Columbia | 36     |\n| Manitoba         | 46     |\n| Saskatchewan     | 20     |\n| Alberta          | 8      |\n| Outside Treaty   | 5      |\n\nBoarding Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Ontario          | 3      |\n| British Columbia | 8      |\n| Manitoba         | 9      |\n| Saskatchewan     | 14     |\n| Alberta          | 16     |\n| North West Territories | 3 |\n\nIndustrial Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Ontario          | 5      |\n| British Columbia | 9      |\n| Manitoba         | 2      |\n| Saskatchewan     | 3      |\n| Alberta          | 3      |\n\nThe following is an abstract of the whole expenditure from Consolidated Revenue from the 1st of July 1877 to the 30th June 1906:\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\n| Type       | Total Cost |\n|------------|------------|\n| Industrial | $1,739,852.34 |\n| Boarding   | 632,867.07   |\n| Day        | 392,844.81    |\n| **Total**  | $2,765,064.22 |\n\nChurch of England.\n\n| Type       | Total Cost |\n|------------|------------|\n| Industrial | 1,369,115.60 |\n| Boarding   | 279,681.38   |\n| Day        | 409,680.30    |\n| **Total**  | 2,058,477.28  |\n\nPresbyterian.\n\n| Type       | Total Cost |\n|------------|------------|\n| Industrial | 311,049.79  |\n| Boarding   | 179,726.28  |\n| Day        | 33,672.35   |\n| **Total**  | 524,448.43  |\n\nCarried Forward, -----$- 5,361,980.63\nBrot.

The exact amount so spent is not available, but is doubtless known to the financial agents of the Churches interested. From statements furnished during the eight years ending the 30th June 1906, published in the Report of the Department, it is gathered that the denominations contributed during that time at least $435,000.00 toward this end; and from this amount some idea may be formed of the aggregate of the expenditure during the whole term. This outlay has principally taken place in connection with Boarding Schools which were for the most part established by the Churches, erected by them, and supported to a large extent from Church funds; the Department contributing relatively small amounts for buildings and equipment, and an even per capita grant of $60.00 and $72.00 per annum.\n\nThe growing inability of the religious denominations to finance the claims made by the Institutions which they have been largely responsible in establishing has led to the demands for increased grants and for a re-consideration of the educational methods referred to in your memorandum.\n\nThe financial aspect of the question is important as without\na very large increase in appropriations the present establishment could not be maintained; the number of pupils at present on the roll could not be provided for, nor the buildings at present occupied could not be rebuilt, enlarged or improved. If the policy outlined in the joint memorandum were to be adopted without any effort at rearrangement or retrenchment a moderate estimate of the necessary appropriation would be $981,979.00.\n\nIf there had been no doubt that the educational system heretofore maintained was best calculated to further the civilization of the Indians, the increased appropriations might be justified and probably an extension of educational work along the same lines, but it is clear that the present system with its large expenditure has not operated as was expected towards the civilization of the aborigines. The high death rate in the schools and the adverse influence of the reserve environment on discharged pupils has tended with other causes to minimize the effect of educational advantages. These influences have always been known to the Department and have been accepted as one of the inherent difficulties of the problem.\n\nThe Department has by regulations, enforced by medical officers, endeavored to prevent the admission to the schools of pupils tainted with tubercular diseases or children unhealthy in any other respect; and considering the extent to which disease is rife amongst the Indians, it may be stated that a fair measure of success has followed the efforts to select only healthy pupils for residence in the schools.\n\nThe Department has endeavored also to maintain an interest in pupils discharged from the schools, as it was early recognized that one of the great difficulties to be overcome was to prevent whatever degree of improvement had been received during the school life from being lost the moment it came in contact with the relatively savage life of the reserve. To this end the Department has assisted the most promising graduates with gifts of agricultural implements, cattle, seed\ngrain and material to build houses, and has endeavored to separate as far as possible promising young Indians from the influences of the ordinary Indian life; and these efforts have been reasonably successful. But despite all this official care and the interest manifested by the religious denominations it is open to question whether the very large expenditure from all sources has been justified by the result; whether as regards the Indians of the plains and British Columbia the system was not in advance of the needs of the case, and whether a better plan would not have been to proceed on a less extensive scale and to postpone the more elaborate system of residential schools until such a time as the Indian has become more or less civilized by the pressure of influences from without, and had shown the improving effect of the instruction and supervision in agricultural pursuits freely given by the Government.\n\nIt would seem to be good policy at this juncture to attempt to devise a better system of Indian education, applying to each locality methods which would best achieve the desired result and at the same time while not increasing the financial obligations of the Government would remove from the Churches a burden which they do not now find themselves able to bear. With these preliminary remarks the sections of your memorandum may be considered seriatim.\n\n(I) That the Government be requested to create an Advisory Board of Indian education to which all Churches and organizations engaged in Indian work shall have the privilege of nominating two representatives each.\n\n(I) - There would appear to be no objection to the Churches creating an Advisory Board, having two representatives from each Church, for the purpose of consulting with the Department on educational questions in which the Churches are interested. The Department has at all times been willing to give full consideration to the representations of the churches, but it has been found confusing to deal with a large number of persons in authority who are interested in the Indian work.\n(2) That in addition to the elements of an English education the Indian boys shall be trained in agricultural or such other pursuits in their different branches as may be possible where the School is situated, and also in such manual pursuits as may be useful to them in an outdoor life in the district to which they belong. Similarly with the girls that they be trained for domestic life and elementary nursing.\n\n(3) This has always been the policy of the Department with reference to Indian education in residential schools. Often from the difficulty of collecting pupils from districts where the curriculum of the school can be of direct benefit to them it has not been carried out, but as the future policy of the Department and the contemplated rearrangement of residential schools would have in view a closer relation to the policy, it is hoped that it may be carried out with greater strictness with better results.\n\n(4) That all the schools, resident and non-resident, shall be so constituted, equipped and conducted that the policy briefly outlined in the above clause may be most perfectly realised, and that the Government shall provide suitable buildings and equipments therefor.\n\n(5) This clause is germane to No. 2, and it follows wherever day schools or residential schools are established suitable buildings and equipment should be provided. The general management of the school should reflect as closely as possible the policy to be adopted.\n\n(6) That pupils, as a rule, shall be discharged at the age of eighteen, but it should be arranged that in exceptional cases, pupils may be retained longer on the recommendation of the Church in charge of the school and with the consent of the Indian Commissioner. Also it should be made possible for especially promising pupils to receive extra training for any special vocation at the expense of the Government, such pupils meantime to be under the supervision of the school.\n\n(7) The existing rule is that pupils should be discharged at the age of 18, and, until it is clear that some other age limit could be established with advantage, that age may be allowed to stand. Exceptional cases should be considered on their merits, and the recommendation of the advisory board would be considered when the general question for the further education of promising\npupils comes up for consideration.\n\n(5) While realizing the difficulties of administering a policy of compulsory education, we are convinced that such a principle is in the best interests of all concerned - of the parents, of the children, and of the State, and should be enforced so far as can be wisely and rightly done. If this becomes the accepted policy of the Government, is it too much to expect that the influence of Government employees be brought to bear in the kind but firm enforcement of the law?\n\nThe policy of funding the treaty money for children attending Boarding or Industrial Schools, having been found to operate against securing pupils for these Schools, should be discontinued, and all Government donations in excess of Treaty obligations should be withheld from such parents as refuse to send their children to school.\n\n(6) The question of compulsory education will receive at once full consideration. Sections 9, 10 and II of the Indian Act, Chap. 81 of the Revised Statutes, empower the Governor in Council to make regulations to secure the compulsory attendance of children at school, and under a previous enactment, Chap. 32, 57, 58 Vic., regulations governing the education of Indian children were passed by His Excellency in Council on November 10, 1894. These regulations are still in force and go as far as was deemed advisable, as it was not considered that attendance at boarding and industrial schools could be made compulsory, and that no rule should be adopted which would provide for the arbitrary separation of parents and children. It has always been the wish of the Department that officials and employees should give their active influence in furthering the educational policy, and the attention of Agents generally will be again directed to this very important phase of their general administrative duties.\n\nThe funding of treaty money for children who attend boarding and industrial schools (which were undertaken in order that, on leaving school, they might have a small amount of cash to expend in the purchase of some necessary articles to begin life on the reserve) might be discontinued. It has often been questioned whether the trouble which the administration of these small accounts\nentails was compensated by any genuine benefit to the mass of depositors, and if the withholding of annuity money from parents operates against the securing of pupils it may be thought well to reconsider this question.\n\nThe suggested step of withholding Government aid in excess of treaty obligations could hardly be adopted as part of a general educational policy. In very few agencies are donations given beyond treaty obligations and these are principally extended to destitute Indians, and it is necessary not to permit any harshness to Indians who cannot well provide for themselves.\n\n(6) That whereas the Indians are wards of the Government, and their education, at least in part, secured by treaty, it is only reasonable that the Government should bear all expenses involved in such training as is contemplated, which would include a larger per capita grant. The Churches anxious and willing to continue to co-operate with the Government in the civilization and Christianization of the Indians are convinced that the moral and spiritual side of education cannot be hoped for except by the appointment of teachers in every way qualified for a work so peculiar and important. The request is therefore made that the appointment of teachers be entrusted to the Churches on terms to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n(6) - The increased per capita grant suggested in Clause 6, if adopted, will virtually place the Government in the position of bearing all expenses involved in Indian education. The present establishment includes schools which while recognized by the Government were established in the first instance by the Churches, and it is thought that a rearrangement of these schools and the adoption of a new type of school would further the interests of Indian education and at the same time render it unnecessary to apply to Parliament for an increase in the gross appropriation. The expression of willingness on the part of the Churches to co-operate with the Government is noted with pleasure; and it is most important that teachers well qualified for the work should be appointed.\n(7) That sanitariums and medical equipment and nurses and medical attendance be provided in central or suitable locations for the treatment of tubercular and other contagious diseases.\n\n(7) - As you are no doubt aware the Department has a system of medical attendance which is intended generally to provide for this branch of the Indian work throughout the country. At a very early date it was recognized that this class of relief was one which would largely devolve on the Dominion Government and Parliamentary appropriations have since Confederation been obtained for this purpose. Of late years hospitals have also been established and in the older Provinces the hospitals for white communities have been made use of by the Indians. For the approaching fiscal year the Department has asked Parliament to vote the following sums for medical attendance, medicines and hospitals:\n\nMedical Attendance and Medicines.\n\n| Province                  | Amount   |\n|---------------------------|----------|\n| Quebec                    | $3400.00 |\n| Ontario                   | $2000.00 |\n| Nova Scotia               | $3700.00 |\n| New Brunswick             | $4000.00 |\n| Prince Edward Island      | $650.00  |\n| British Columbia (Including 8 Hospitals $4450.00) | $27450.00 |\n| Manitoba and the North West Territories &c (Including Hospitals $12,791.00) | $40827.00 |\n| **Total**                 | **$62,027.00** |\n\nWithin the last few years the experiment has been made of establishing tent hospitals for the treatment of tubercular diseases; one at Saddle Lake, one at Touchwood Hills, and one at Birtle, also a well equipped small hospital at Morley for the same purpose for the use of the Stony Indians and the pupils of the McDougall Orphanage. In British Columbia the Department has assisted in the establishment of five hospitals where Indian patients may be treated. It will be understood from these facts\nthat it will be necessary simply to extend the present provisions of the Department if thought advisable; no initiative is needed as would seem to be implied in this clause of the joint memorandum.\n\nIt might be wise however to test the results of the hospitals already established before increasing their number. Wherever well equipped hospitals are provided by municipalities which could be used by Indians it would seem a good policy to use these for treatment instead of multiplying the number of small hospitals intended solely for Indians; and this system the Department is following wherever the conditions warrant.\n\nIn addition to this professional attendance and supply of medical accessories the Department makes as large a use as possible of professional knowledge with reference to contagious diseases, tuberculosis, and sanitary measures generally. It issues to its Agents positive instructions in all matters of sanitation on the reserves and places them in possession of the simple and obvious methods of preventing the spread of tuberculosis; and they are made clearly to understand that a principal part of their duty is to enforce these regulations, and to keep constantly before the Indians the desirability of practising such preventive measures.\n\nThe question of nurses will be dealt with in remarks to be made on clause No. 8.\n\n(8) The salary for a day school teacher to be $500. The Church to appoint teachers who have Provincial certificates.\n\nWe agree to manage residential schools in Ontario at a per capita grant of One Hundred Dollars, and One Hundred and Thirty Dollars per pupil in all such schools west of the Great Lakes.\n\nThis grant not to include the cost of material for the plant, nor anything that may be regarded as a fixture in the building, such as any plumbing or heating apparatus, etc.\n\nAny deficits in the cost of management to be met by the Church managing the school. The Department to make the buildings of residential schools thoroughly sanitary and with sufficient\nventilation, supplying medical men and nurses wherever necessary.\n\nAs the suggested changes may involve larger financial outlay, attention is called to the fact that at present there are more residential schools than are necessary to supply the needs of the territory occupied, and that it might be a wise policy to reduce the number or to transfer some of them to more needy localities.\n\n(8) - This clause deals with the financial side of the question.\n\nAs stated in my preliminary remarks, if the present educational system could be shown to have justified the expenditure upon it, it might not be difficult to ask for increased appropriations; but as the consensus of opinion seems to be that such is not the case, I would find it difficult at present to justify the increase which would be necessary if the augmented scale of per capita allowances and teachers' salaries was to be adopted for the present enrollment; and if any change were to be made it would involve an increase of as before shown of about $166,142.00 and a capital expenditure of about $350,000.00.\n\nAt the outset it might be remarked that the question is complicated by the fact that the Roman Catholic Church while equally interested with the Protestant denominations in the evangelization and education of the Indians has not asked for any generally increased grants, and do not seek more favorable terms. You will recognize the impossibility of dealing with the question at all and overlooking the rights of a Church so largely interested in the work to treatment equally favorable.\n\nThe educational needs of the Indians vary in different Provinces and it would seem to be advisable to divide the subject into several classes geographically, and to deal with each separately:\n\nNOVA SCOTIA, NEW BRUNSWICK, PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND,\nQUEBEC, ONTARIO.\n\nThe day schools throughout Indian reserves in these Provinces are usually more or less in touch with surrounding\ncivilization and as the Indians themselves are more or less civil-\nised the conduct of the schools should approximate as nearly as\npossible to conditions which appertain amongst white people. It\nmight be laid down as a rule that the teachers of Indian schools\nwho are well qualified for the special work should be paid a salary\nof from $300.00 to $500.00, and the principle of annual increases\nshould be resorted to in order to give an incentive for diligence\nand application; and that the interest of teachers and pupils\nshould be stimulated in every possible way in order to increase\nthe average attendance.\n\nThe residential schools in Ontario situated in settled\ndistricts and drawing their pupils from Indians that are already\nwell advanced in civilization should be useful factors in improving\nthe standard of Indian life. The increase in the grant from $60.\nto $100. per capita does not seem to be excessive, and I would\nfeel inclined to recommend the Government to increase the grant at\nthese schools to that rate; if it were found possible to carry\nout the changes which will be mentioned later on and if the increase\ndoes not involve a general increase in the appropriations.\n\nIt may be remarked, however, that these schools within\nthe next few years should prove their usefulness as it might be\nbetter to allow the day schools on the reserves to furnish what-\never would be required in the way of literary education and to\ngive more attention to the improvement of general agricultural\nconditions throughout the older Provinces, as they are by no means\nin as forward a condition as they should be. After the increased\ngrant has been paid for a year or two an inspection of the school\naccounts will show whether it was larger than required.\n\nMANITOBA, SASKATCHEWAN, ALBERTA AND NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nIt is probably the fact that the educational system\nadopted for use in the unorganized territories in the year 1883 was in advance of the real needs of the case; that a more permanent influence for good would have been exerted by Industrial education carried on upon the reserves, and made up not only of tuition at day schools but of the generally civilizing influence of instruction given to adults in agricultural, ranching and domestic pursuits.\n\nIt must not be lost sight of that in several districts of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta the Indians are practically self-supporting, and as a basis of material progress is always necessary before education can have any lasting value, it may be said that the best interests of the Indians have been served by instruction carried out upon the reserves and not by the elaborate system of education. It would seem to be advisable to get back to these first principles and to expend whatever appropriations are placed at the disposal of the Department largely in improving conditions on reserves.\n\nIn line with the foregoing remarks it would seem to be advisable to close certain residential schools which have been for some time in operation. The Industrial School at Calgary has been abolished, the St. Paul's Industrial School at Middlechurch was not rebuilt after the late fire, and in considering a further reduction in the number of Industrial Schools it occurs that either the Brandon or Elkhorn School might be done away with altogether, as well as the School at Regina. The Brandon School, while well conducted, has not served the purpose for which it was established, as the pupils are drawn from districts where agriculture cannot extensively be carried on. The Elkhorn School while it is also well conducted is an expensive institution. The School at Regina while it draws its pupils from an agricultural district has been a source of considerable unforeseen expense to the Depart-\nand of late years has not been very successful.\n\nThe closing at the end of the present fiscal year of the following Boarding Schools might also be carried out:\n\nCrowstand, Emmanuel College,\nFile Hills, Gordon's\nRound Lake, Onion Lake,\nPeigan, Morley,\nOld Suns, Blood,\nSarcee.\n\nOn the reserves which have heretofore been served by these schools an improved type of day school might be established. The staff would consist of a married teacher, and, on the larger reserves, of a nurse also; and a nutritious and simple noonday meal might be served to the pupils at the school. The nurse might be occupied in house and tent visitation, directing sanitary measures, and the wife of the teacher should have domestic qualifications which would make her useful in instructing the Indian women in the ordinary domestic employments. Such a system might be given a trial for four or five years. Children of whose strong constitutions and general health there could be no reasonable doubt could be drafted into the existing Industrial Schools which would be placed in a thoroughly sanitary condition and the tuition at which would be especially designed for the localities where they are situated. The experience of the Department with the best Day Schools under its control has shown conclusively that most efficient work may be done through this medium. The best Day Schools in the older Provinces are doing an excellent work. Those at Lorette, St. Frances, Caughnawaga and the Six Nation Reserve may be specially cited; and in dealing with the school on Mistawasis Reserve,\n\nin the Province of Saskatchewan, the Indian Commissioner\nfelt called upon to remark that the report shows the school to be in a highly creditable condition. If we had Day Schools like this, our Boarding Schools might be dispensed with.\n\nThe experience of the United States Indian Department also shows that the Day Schools as conducted in that country, which include gardens and substantial hot lunches for the children, are considered the strongest civilizing influence that can be brought to bear upon the Indian. If it is to be considered any disadvantage that the children should remain with parents living a semi-civilized life, against this disadvantage must be weighed the positive gain which would result from the children being brought up surrounded by the conditions under which they must gain their livelihood.\n\nAs the sanitation of Indian dwellings is gradually improved, the Indian children who are tainted with tuberculosis will have a better chance to overcome the disease than if they were closely housed in Boarding Schools or sanitariums, and the danger to other pupils would be minimized. If this change was carried out with reference to the Protestant Schools just mentioned and certain Roman Catholic schools as well it would enable the Department to pay the increased grant to the industrial and boarding schools to be maintained in the future without asking Parliament for largely increased appropriations.\n\nSchools in unorganized districts which draw their pupils from the reserves where the Indians maintain themselves by hunting might be allowed for the present to continue, but it is thought that the number of pupils in residence should not be increased beyond the present provisions. As the Indians settle upon their reserves and as new conditions arise these schools might also be abolished and the new type of school substituted.\n\nIt will be observed that the new departure consists of\nmaintaining Residential Schools in the unorganized districts, where Indians spend their winter on their hunting grounds and are not settled on the reserves, and the provision of an improved type of Day School, with a few large residential schools for Indians who have already settled on the reserves and are supporting themselves to a greater or less extent by agricultural pursuits and ranching.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nThe situation in British Columbia requires special attention and it would not seem to be advisable to authorize the large capital expenditure which would be necessary if the establishment is to be maintained as at present, until the needs of each locality are carefully enquired into and the necessity of each existing school demonstrated. In some localities where the question of entirely rebuilding or enlarging and improving certain school buildings would have to be immediately considered it might be found advantageous to establish Day Schools. The location of several of the Boarding Schools was not considered with sufficient care when the buildings were erected, and it would seem hardly advisable to spend any considerable amount on their improvement. The closing of the Matlakatla Industrial School and the maintenance of an efficient Day School at that point are now under consideration. It will be necessary to spend in the neighborhood of $30,000.00 to put the present buildings in a satisfactory condition. There are now only 13 boys in attendance and the school accounts show a deficit. As all the pupils are drafted from Matlakatla it would not seem to be necessary to continue the large expenditure for this institution. It should be remembered that the British Columbia Indians are practically self-supporting, and the policy\nof removing the children from their parents and separating them from the ordinary vocations by which in their future lives they must obtain a living is questionable. From these general causes it seems advisable in this province to proceed with a good deal of circumspection before large expenditures are incurred which would tend to perpetuate the present system. It is therefore not at present proposed to extend the increased per capita grant to the Schools in this Province, or to provide for augmented capital expenditure.\n\nIf these changes were carried out the residential schools to be maintained would be thoroughly overhauled and increased ventilation and improved sanitation would be provided for. As the Department now provides medical attendance and medicines for the schools, no change is necessary in that regard, and the question of the possibility of engaging nurses as instructors would be considered.

As you are aware, this plan contemplated the payment of per capita grants at the rate of $100.00 to the pupils in residential schools east of the Great Lakes and $150.00 to pupils in residential schools west of the Great Lakes, excluding the Province of British Columbia. The payment at the increased per capita rate was in effect made conditional upon the closing of the Regina and Mikahem Schools, Emmanuel College and McDougall Orphanage, and the Old Sun's Church of England School on the Blackfoot Reserve. It was hoped both by the Department and the Churches interested that this new scheme could go into effect from the 1st of April 1908, but lack of funds in the existing appropriations and the inability of the Department to obtain larger grants rendered this impossible. The Estimates for the fiscal year 1909-10 have been made out without any increase owing to the urgent request that our Estimates should conform as nearly as possible to those of 1907-08; but it seems obligatory that the Department should take some steps either to obtain increased grants or to make some use of money already voted in the direction of the proposed change of plan and increase in grant to the Schools. I have, therefore, to make the following suggestions, dealing with the Province separately:\n\nONTARIO: As the Shingwauk Home, situated at Sault Ste. Marie, is in constant financial difficulties and as the Department has declined\nto be responsible for any further deficits, it is thought advisable to withdraw from the support of this School and to use the grant for other purposes. The institution is badly situated for agricultural operations and the pupilage is drawn not only from the Diocese of Algoma but from remote parts of Ontario. It is proposed with a portion of the money saved by this closure to improve certain Church of England Day Schools on Reserves in the Province of Ontario, to secure if possible a better class of Teacher at a higher rate of pay, and to modernise the buildings and equipment where necessary; and to increase the grant for pupils at Mt. Elgin (Maths.), Chapleau and Moose Factory (C. of E.) to $85.00 per capita. This is an increase of $25.00. The proposed rate for the Province of Ontario was to be $100.00 per capita, but the Department has not the funds at present to provide that rate.\n\nThe only other Schools that should be provided for are the Roman Catholic Schools at Wikwemikong and Albany and the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. As the latter School is supported by the New England Company, I do not think the Department should increase the grant. Sufficient funds can be found for increasing the per capita grant to the Roman Catholic Schools mentioned. This Church has not joined as yet in the new movement and it might not be thought advisable at present to increase any particular school without reference to a general understanding between that Church and the Department.\n\nManitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta etc.: If the Regina and Elk Horn Schools were closed before the end of the year the Department would have available $95,350.00 from this source with which to increase the per capita grant and to establish a certain number of Day Schools of the new type. It would be impossible, however, to increase the grant to Boarding Schools to $150.00 per capita, and after re-considering that rate I think it is probably higher than is necessary and might be reduced to $100.00 until the experience of a couple of years have proved that rate to be insufficient. There are 600 pupils estimated in Protestant Boarding Schools which at an increase of $100.00 would require\n$16,800.00 additional to pay the grant. I would recommend that the Institutions at Regina and Elkhorn be closed and that the per capita grant be increased to $100.00 for Protestant Boarding Schools in these Provinces.\n\nDealing with the Roman Catholic Schools in the same Provinces it will be necessary to provide $29,036.00 to place the grants to pupils on the same basis. I think that in advance of any expression of willingness to consider a reduction in the number of Boarding Schools it would be premature to offer this increase, but at the same time I think the authorities of the Church should be approached more directly on this question with a view to arriving if possible at a harmonious conclusion.\n\nThe Protestant denominations have suffered great diminution of their teaching forces without embarrassing the Department in any way, and I think that with reference to the savings effected or to be effected in the money voted or in any additional demands which may hereafter be made upon Parliament this fact should not be lost sight of. The following items have disappeared from the Estimates owing to Schools being closed, and the expenditure has been correspondingly reduced:\n\nSt. Paul's.................. $15,000.00 G. E.\nEmmanuel College........... 4,304.00 \"\nCalgary........................ 4,550.00 \"\nNewley.......................... 3,240.00 Meth.\nMetlakatla...................... 7,200.00 G.E.\n\nTotal reduction, $34,294.00\n\nIf the Shingwauk Home be closed $6000.00 may be added to this; Regina $14,700.00, and Elkhorn $14,550.00, making a total diminution in our Estimates on account of the closing of Protestant Boarding Schools aggregating $68,544.00. This is a prominent and outstanding fact that will not be lost sight of by the Protestant denomination and should be kept in mind by the Department.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA. Owing to the saving which has accrued on account of closing the Metlakatla School the Department was\nenabled to take preliminary steps toward establishing Day Schools of\nthe new type at Massett on the Queen Charlotte Islands and at Aiyumish:\nand possibly at Hazelton. These three Schools are under Church of\nEngland auspices, as was the Metlakatla School. It seems only fair to\ndivert any portion of the appropriation which may be thus saved to the\npurposes of that denomination. In Boarding Schools in British Columbia\nthere are 165 Protestant pupils and 160 Roman Catholic pupils. In\nthis Province the grant is only $60.00 per capita so that $40.00 would\nhave to be provided to raise it to $100.00, and this would necessitate\ngranting $6,000.00 in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nYUKON: Affairs in the Yukon are on the same standing as\nthey were before the Supplementary appropriation which last Session\nprovided $10,000.00 for the erection of a new Boarding School building.\nI am inclined to think that whatever may be the urgency of the Church\nof England for further expenditures for Indian purposes in the Yukon,\nthe Indians themselves will not suffer seriously if the Department takes\ntime to consider slowly and carefully the needs of the Territory along\nthis line. We have had some correspondence with the Rev. Mr. O'Meara\nand later on I will bring various matters to your attention.\n\nRECAPITULATION: I am of the opinion that if the action\nabove outlined is taken; that is, if the Shingwauk Home, and the Regina\nand Elkhorn Schools were closed; if the Brandon School was given a\nconstituency from which pupils could be drawn who would benefit by\nagricultural training; if the per capita rate was advanced to $200.00\nfor the Mt. Elgin Institute in Ontario and to $85.00 in Manitoba and\nthe North West Territories; and if a sufficient amount was provided in\nthe Supplementary Estimates to give British Columbia the same treatment\nfrom the Ist. of July prev., the Advisory Board would probably be\nsatisfied. In this connection I may say that in a memorandum dated\nthe 4th. of Sept. 1908 the Board stated that \"It is very earnestly\nhoped that even yet the Superintendent may see his way out of the money\nsaved by a concentration of the work and closing some of the schools, as\nsuggested in his proposals, and the cutting down of expenses in the Department, to make a reasonable beginning in the way of the improved schools and some increase in the per capita grants although not up to the full standard suggested.* I think it will also be possible from the general avail of the appropriation to begin three or four Day Schools of the new type in various localities; probably two in the Prince Albert district and one or two at points to be suggested by the Presbyterian Church, whose educational opportunities should be strengthened on account of the closing of the Regina School. If these suggestions meet with favor, I think that we may safely anticipate that the Advisory Board will be gratified that a start has been made.\n\nDeputy Supt.

EDWARD AHENAKEW, L.T.H., Missionary to the People of His Race\u2014The Indians\u2014at Onion Lake, Sask.\n\n\"I have been educated and I never have heard of any authority for treaty money. Half the time I forget I have anything to do with them. If my children had been educated I might today be under their support. Education will give the Indians self-support and give him self-support, and he will block to the roots of his hair if you offer him anything else. The only thing that savors of charity is helping the future of the Indians, the lives of the Indian children, on the reserves of which he knows our government has put them.\"\n\nAccording to the terms of our treaty with the government, any Indians who are educated are entitled to have it. I know one child who has for years asked for a school and who has never been able to get one. It is simply a question of money. Whatever the reason may be, the fact looks like a great injustice to the Indians who want to secure their chance of success in life. The race is not being supplied with its proper food.\n\nThe government is doing a great deal, but perhaps I have seen a more efficient way to educate a white man would. I remember my own boyhood. I can look back on my days at home and see how much education was gradually my mind and feelings. It is possible for other Indian boys.\n\nIt long to see the day when the government will make a special study of Indian conditions; find out the needs and study out the remedies. They are doing much, but not with as much personal interest as they should. Education is needed\u2014and this during youth. In the schools\u2014if our children won't come there, show them why. They know not what they need. If their parents want something for them, send them to the White people have to send their children to the schools. We are neither fair to the Indian nor to the white people who have to live in the same country with them.\"\n## Statement Showing Cost of Indian Day Schools in the West\n\n**For Year Ending March 31, 1918**\n\n| School                  | No. on Roll | Average | Salaries paid | Other Expenditure | Total on average attendance |\n|-------------------------|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **MANITOBA**            |             |         |               |                   |                             |\n| Big Eddy                | 26          | 15      | $340.00       | $5.00             | $345.00                     | $23.00                      |\n| Black River             | 15          | 9       | 500.00        | 25.00             | 525.00                      | 58.33                       |\n| Brokenhead              | 20          | 11      | 166.50        | 8.00              | 174.50                      | 15.86                       |\n| Berens River            | 41          | 17      | 501.00        | 69.40             | 570.40                      | 33.56                       |\n| Bloodvein (summer)      | 28          | 9       | 300.00        | 14.60             | 314.60                      | 34.95                       |\n| Chemawawin              | 30          | 12      | 500.00        | 9.65              | 509.65                      | 42.47                       |\n| Cross Lake (Prot.)      | 40          | 14      | 800.00        | 14.20             | 814.20                      | 58.16                       |\n| Fairford                | 24          | 14      | 900.00        | 408.36            | 1308.36                     | 93.45                       |\n| Fisher River            | 69          | 30      | 805.00        | 354.53            | 1159.53                     | 38.65                       |\n| Ft.

H. Smith,\nSeconded by Mr. C.

As the ladies are judging by what they see of the growth of the Cottage Indian school and as the resolution affects the schools of the Dominion, I begged them to defer the vote until we had more general information. From my own reading and from observation I would vote against the resolution, but there may be more in it than I think. So dear friend, I am seeking your opinion, knowing that you are deeply interested in these red rights and have had long experience among them. We vote on Sept. 30th, so write a letter before that date. Thank you for anticipation. I am yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nIndian Office, Winnipeg,\nSeptember 21st, 1918.\n\nDear Mrs. Burrows:\n\nI have your letter of September 20th this morning and hasten to make reply to so important a question as has been raised at the Portage.\n\nWhen the early navigators and discoverers first visited the shores of Canada, it was found that the new Eldorado was inhabited by a people who had at least the title of birthright. The Indian Question was therefore a first consideration with those who wished to live here.\n\nAs long as the new comers were merely traders in the offing the Natives were disposed to be friendly. \"Off shore\" relations were welcomed by the \"on shore\" people. When however Indians began to learn that we were not casual guests, but agriculturists who looked towards early settlement and permanent possession, the Indians assumed another attitude less favourable to the strangers. The history of New Canada became a struggle, leading up to final domination of the Red Man, by his White Brother.\n\nNow while Canada has been acquisitive, assertive and progressive she has earned the name of being just and generous. So with the passing of the years she made a Treaty with the Indians guaranteeing them protection and assistance, which would raise them to the status of white people, when the conditions were fulfilled. The Government took on a Paternal relation and the Native\nPopulation became the Wards of the Nation. This Treaty was extended from time to time until nearly the whole land has been covered by a Pact of Peace.\n\nSeeing the justice of provisions made for their benefit, the Original Inhabitants were willing to try us and finally came to trust us. So with the passing of time and the fulfilment of obligations, the old enmities died away, and erstwhile enemies became loyal friends. Canada proved that a peace policy was a paying proposition and that kindness brought contentment.\n\nOne of the conditions of this newer order of things, was the question of the education of the aborigines. Canadian Policy saw that if trouble existed, it usually arose through ignorance. The hardest people to deal with was the uneducated class. If an unschooled Native under Treaty Agreements could be counted as a friend he might under educational advantages become an intellectual friend, and a better ward of the country, for this advancement.\n\nSo the Day School on the Reserve was tried, but the Reserves were large, too large for one school. The distances from some homes were great, and boating was dangerous. Then the Indians moved about a good deal, taking the family with them. Winter attendance was not large, owing to cold and insufficient apparel. It was felt that we were not accomplishing enough by this method.\n\nNext followed the Boarding School on the Reserve, where children could be gathered, fed, clothed, educated and sent back to improve native society, at the age of eighteen. For\nsay four years or more, they would be under the good influences of christian teachers, whose example was as much as their teaching. They would not be too far away from natural scenes and surroundings, and old associations. Altogether this was an ideal project, which promised well.\n\nIn all this, there was a missing link. It was thought that education alone, was not all that was required. The next move was to teach the larger boys and girls, home and commercial industries, so they might be fitted to work their way through life, by the skill of their hands and the sweat of honest toil. This too has been carried out in the Industrial Schools.\n\nHere then you have a complete system of help, the DAY SCHOOL on the Reserve, THE BOARDING SCHOOL in some near by town or village, and the INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS in the midst of civilized society, with all their stimulus and training. The real object of all is to elevate the Indian industrially, intellectually, morally and this goes a long way towards making him a worthy citizen.\n\nThe work of these schools cannot but be helpful. We see it every day in the dress and appearance of the ex-pupils, in the tidiness of their homes, in the care of their children, in the preparation of their food, and in many other ways.\n\nCanada undertook this work with the conviction that it was good business, and she gave definite promise that she would not weary or fail in her purpose, as long as grass grows, or water runs, or sun shines. Our national\npromise is as good as our bond, but we are bound by covenant as well. Shall we go back on the history of the years? Shall we break our Treaty engagements? Shall we deny \"the least of his brethren\" the advantages promised in solemn avowal, and fulfilled at the present time in the most practical manner?\n\nTwo or three features of the case must not be overlooked.\n\n(1) Convinced that the Churches could supply better men and women to fill positions in these schools, that less extravagance would exist under religious management, and that the morals of the children would be more carefully guarded by Christian people, the Government transferred the control of these schools to the leading Churches of the land. In asking for the discontinuance of a given school, a blow is aimed at the Denomination controlling that Institution, and another organization might tomorrow petition against some other School, and where would all this end.\n\n(2) In opposing the education of the Natives, you come into opposition with the declared policy of the Parliament of the country, and the Minister directly responsible for the existing state of affairs, who may think that he and his coadjutors in office should know as much about such matters, as any women's organization, unfamiliar with all the facts of the case.\n\n(3) This is a broad question which should be approached in a very thoughtful and considerate manner. What will Indians, born in the wild woods, untaught, untrained, untamed be to us as the years pass? There are things\nthat might well be left alone, unless better things can be put in their places, and I for one, well knowing that many failures may be cited, would hesitate to destroy the foundations of education, which our wisest legislators have laid for the uplift of our Native Race.\n\nWith much respect,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nMrs. J. H. Burrow,\nHigh Bluff,\nManitoba.\n\nI am aware that the order of the schools is only negative not active.\nWinnipeg, Man., September 20th 1918\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott Esquire\nSuperintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa -- Canada\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nBecause some Woman's Organization at the Portage took strong grounds on the point of Indian Schools Mrs Rev J.H. Burrow wrote me a private letter which I enclose. I answered her and now send you a copy of my letter to her.\n\nI thought it best to send you a copy partly that you may know of the circumstances and partly that you may see what I had to say in reply. I hope I have taken safe ground, as I intended to do.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, December 4, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th of September, last, with enclosures, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the full and clear explanation furnished by you to Mrs. Burrow regarding the resolution of the Home Economics Society of the Municipality of Portage la Prairie in reference to Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nRe. Indian Education, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories.\n\nAfter the acquirement of the Northwest Territories and Rupert's Land by the Dominion Government in 1870 steps were taken to secure the extinction of the Indian title to these lands and treaties were entered into by the Government with the Indians with this end in view, the principal stipulations of which were the setting apart of reserves, the payment of annuities and the establishment of schools for the Indians.\n\nIn fulfillment of the latter agreement the Department set about formulating a school policy, the result of which was the establishment of industrial schools at Battleford in 1883 and at Qu'Appelle and High River in 1884, the first in charge of the Church of England and the two latter under the Roman Catholics. The cost of their maintenance and management was borne by the Department for about ten years, when they were put on the per capita grant system.\n\nIt was the intention of the Department that the boys should be taught trades in these industrial schools, preference to be given to carpentering and blacksmithing, and that the girls should receive instruction in domestic science. Many of the schools undertook, in addition to carpentering and blacksmithing, printing, shoe making, tailoring and other trades, and this necessitated the employment of skilled instructors. This policy, to a large extent, had to be abandoned. The cost of obtaining competent instructors in the various trades was found to be prohibitive and now more attention is given to agriculture and...\nand carpentering.\n\nIn the meantime day schools were established on some of the reserves and in 1883 there were thirty-five in operation for longer or shorter periods while the Indians were on the reserves. All these schools received Government grants, which were supplemented in many cases by the missionary societies working among the Indians.\n\nThe religious bodies engaged in Indian education, recognizing the nomadic habits of the Indians and the consequent irregular attendance of the children, inaugurated the boarding school system and the Department recognized their efforts by allowing them a per capita grant. In the early days the buildings were put up by the churches on the reserves in the neighbourhood of their missions, and they were allowed a per capita grant of $60.00 in the eastern and $72.00 in the western provinces. They were paid at these rates until the first of April, 1911, when, by the terms of an agreement between the Department and the management of Indian boarding schools, the grant was raised to from $80.00 to $125.00, according to the location of the schools, as set forth in the memorandum which accompanied the printed Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nThis agreement was the result of a conference between the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and the members duly appointed by the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist churches to represent them at the said conference. The lengthy correspondence which led up to this conference is on file 289032 and the result is embodied in the agreement.\n\nThe authorities of the churches engaged in educational work among the Indians signed the agreements, which were to run for a term of five years from the first of April, 1911. As the war broke out before the expiration of the time limit, the schools were conducted on the same per capita grant up to the first of April, 1917, when an additional $10.00 per capita was allowed to each school.\n\nThe churches claim that this extra grant does not, by any means, meet the increased cost of maintenance and management, and they are pressing the Department for a revision in the terms of the agreement. There is no doubt\ndoubt that the grant now allowed for the maintenance of pupils in residential schools is insufficient, unless liberally supplemented by the churches, who claim that a much larger proportion of the cost should be borne by the Department.\n\nIf the Government decide to increase the grant to residential schools while the present high cost of living prevails, it will require an additional vote of at least $60,000.00 to meet an increase of $15.00 per capita for the present enrolment, which is practically the limit the existing buildings can provide for.\n\nFinancial returns received from these schools show the per capita cost to be from $150.00 to $175.00. In the last report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the United States it is stated that a per capita grant of $200.00 is allowed there for schools of this class.\n\nAs appears from a statement showing the cost of the Indian day schools in the western provinces for the year ending the 31st of March, last, many of these schools might advantageously be closed, on account of the small average attendance and the high cost of maintenance and management. If this were done increased accommodation would be required at some of the boarding schools, as it would not do to deprive the children of an opportunity of receiving an education.\n\nTo improve the attendance at some of the outlying day schools the transporting of the children to school was tried, but the results obtained did not justify the expenditure incurred, and the Department was forced to discontinue the driving of the children. On some of the reserves no less than three drivers were required, and the children were insufficiently clad and often had to wait a considerable time for the conveyance.\n\nThe giving of a midday meal at the day schools, which was also tried, is still continued and has been found to give satisfaction, as it has no doubt increased the average attendance, but it has also largely increased the cost. The cost of maintaining the day schools in the western provinces will average over $1,000.00 each.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to assume additional expenditure\nexpenditure in connection with the residential schools new agreements should be made with the churches. Many of the schools which would require enlargement are at present the property of the churches and, if the Department has to spend money in enlarging and improving them, they should be acquired by the Department, or it should have a lien on the property for the amount expended.\n\nTo give effect to the suggested change the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children should be amended so as to empower the Department to place children in residential schools where no day schools are in operation on the reserve.\n\nThe School Estimates which have been prepared for 1919-20 call for a parliamentary appropriation of $735,515. apportioned as follows\u2014residential schools $576,885, day schools $128,775, repairs $22,355, assistance to ex-pupils $5,000, and salary and expenses of school inspector for British Columbia $2,500.\n\nTo carry out the suggested increased per capita grant, additions to existing buildings and new buildings would require about one million dollars for the next fiscal year.\n\nFrom the 1st of July, 1877, to the 31st of March, 1918, the Department has expended $14,428,709.25 from consolidated revenue for Indian education; the greater portion of this sum has been handled by the churches engaged in educational work among the Indians.\n\nUnless the Government is prepared to introduce legislation to expedite enfranchisement, the Indian problem will always remain unsolved, and a trial might advantageously be made on some of the reserves in the older provinces.\n\nAccompanying this memorandum is a statement showing the cost of Indian day schools in the west for the year ending the 31st of March, 1918, and a copy of the Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools.\nIt might be considered advisable to again investigate the subject of Indian Education, with a view to improvements. There is no doubt that there is room for improvement, and that the solving of the problem might be assisted by a general survey of the work, the introduction of some new methods, and an attempt to methods employed more directly toward the end to be accomplished. I would not, however, suggest the appointment of any commission to inquire into the matter. The facts are well-known to the officers of the Department and to those interested in Indian Education. It is only necessary to arrive at some consensus of opinion, in order to institute reforms. Mr. Graham and myself propose to take this action, and to present the results for your consideration.\nWhen we were considering improvements in Indian education, it was thought that the Day School in the Western provinces was susceptible of greater usefulness, and we endeavoured to increase it by establishing a grade known as the Improved Day School. The special features of these schools was a warm meal at noon and the transportation of the children from and to their homes. The teaching staff was to consist of a man and his wife. Several of these schools were established, but I cannot say that the beneficial results have been commensurate with the increased expenditure. The per capita cost is variable, but in some cases it is higher than the per capita cost of Residential Schools. I think it has been established that Day Schools on reserves in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are not a success, and it is questionable whether they should not be abandoned, except in the few cases where they are known to be vigorous and really useful, and the money devoted to augmenting the pupilage at the Residential Schools.\n\nApplications are now being received for permission to increase the number of authorized pupils, and the reason given is that the influenza has made many orphans, and that these must suffer unless the schools take the place of their parents. It must be said that this pressure upon the accommodation of the schools began with the war; the Indians at once found it difficult to provide for their families, and endeavoured to ease the burden by transferring part of it to the schools.\nThe highest per capita grant which is now paid is $135.00 per annum, and it is represented that we should increase our contribution to $150.00, that is, make an all-round further increase of $15.00 per capita for all pupils (4,500) of residential schools. This will necessitate annual provision by Parliament of $67,500.00.\n\nThe policy of the Government from the earliest date of Indian education up to the present time has been one of association with the religious denominations, that is, the evangelization and education of the aborigines went hand in hand. It is my opinion that we gain a great deal from this association, not only do we gain by reason of the zealous nature of the people who devote themselves to this work in a missionary spirit, but we gain financially from the large amounts which are collected by the denominations towards the maintenance of the schools. If the Churches were to withdraw altogether from their association with the Government, we would have to provide more generously for the present establishment. It, therefore, becomes a duty to consider carefully the present condition of Indian education, and to weigh most carefully and sympathetically the representations which are being made to us from the denominations that our share in the cost of maintaining the schools is not now proportionately borne by us, that the high cost of provisions and wages have told most heavily against the finances of the schools, and that there exist everywhere deficits, which it is difficult or impossible for the Churches to meet.\n\nOwing to the financial pressure on the management of the schools, the Superintendent General decided and Parliament provided funds to increase the per capita grants by $10.00 from the 1st of April, 1917. It must be remembered that the running expenses of these residential schools are not met by the grants from public funds alone, they are supplemented by the missionary societies, who have always been liberal in providing funds for the purpose.\nNext fiscal year, and it would be apportioned by and to the various schools according to their needs. At present all payments for the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches are made to Rev. Mr. Edmison and Rev. T. Ferrier, respectively. The Rev. Canon Gould is to be appointed to represent the Church of England. It would be important that the Roman Catholic Church should have such a representative. Only in Western Canada is their work conducted by one person, the Rev. Father Welsh, of Vancouver, B.C. By making the division in this way, the real needs and equitable claims of each school could be considered by those best able to judge. It would be understood that the increased grant was to apply only for the ensuing fiscal year, and that the Department could not become responsible for any deficits.\n\nNear centres of civilization,- in all- $56,400.00. For their schools situated in remote districts this increase will be inadequate, as the first cost of supplies, plus the increased freight rates has swollen the cost laid down to an extraordinary degree. For these schools I think $200.00 per capita is not too much, being an increase of $65.00 for each of 730 pupils,- $47,450.00. I would propose that this grant be paid to a fiduciary representative of each denomination for the\n\nThe boarding school at Carcross, Yukon, now receives $200.00. As yet, this school has not made any request for additional funds, and the claim can be considered if it arises.\n\nThese increased grants would require a provision by Parliament of $103,835.00.\nSince 1911 we have spent on buildings the following amounts:\n\nBoarding Schools ........... $546,223.00\nIndustrial \" .................. 305,316.00\n\n$851,533.00\n\nIf we are to continue the policy formulated in 1911, a long and expensive programme of reconstruction lies before us.

Mr. Meighen.\n\nNOTES ON INDIAN EDUCATION:\n\nIt has become urgent to review the whole subject of Indian education. The necessity arises from the financial difficulties which face the Department and the religious denominations interested in the schools, owing to the increased cost of living. The responsibility of the Government for Indian education has been recognized for many years, and is now part of the fixed policy of the Department. The earliest attempts to educate Indians were made by the Jesuit missionaries many years ago, but there was no co-operation between the missions and the Government until the Protestant missionaries of Upper Canada succeeded in enlisting the sympathy of the Government in the welfare of the Indians. They had experimented by taking Indian youths into their own families or providing lodging and boarding accommodation for them while they were under tuition, and, when the experimental stage was successfully passed, it developed into the establishment of regular residential schools, supported by financial assistance in the form of grants per capita from the public funds and from Indian funds.\n\nWhen, after Confederation, Canada took over the Northwest Territories, treaties were made with the Indians; these treaties provided that education should be extended to the aborigines. Although the form or method of the education was not definitely fixed, after a special report had been made by a Commissioner appointed to look into the question, the system already established in the East was, to all intents, transferred to the West, and the Government\nbegan to establish residential schools and day schools. The type of residential schools were known as industrial, but, ere long, the missionaries, in their zeal to evangelize, began to establish small boarding schools on the reserves near their missions, and as an integral part of their missions, and gradually the Department found itself supporting these schools, making grants for maintenance, buildings and other purposes. These latter schools developed, and in some ways were more vigorous than the industrial schools, but the need for normalizing the effort and making the establishments as uniform as possible became very evident about the year 1910.\n\nThe missionary societies were dissatisfied with the financial grants the Department was making, we, on the other hand, were dissatisfied with the nature of the appeals which reached us, and the difficulties of administration in the absence of any definite understanding.\n\nActing on the suggestion of the undersigned, who was then Superintendent of Indian Education, the Honourable the Superintendent General invited representatives of the Churches to meet him in Ottawa, and, after a thorough discussion, it was decided to increase the grants to the boarding schools, and to place them under a contract, in which the responsibilities of both parties would be plainly defined. It was clear that one of the chief causes of criticism was the condition of the buildings in which the schools had been established, these buildings were nearly all owned by the missionary societies, and the character of their construction had been influenced prejudicially by limited financial resources. The result was that the buildings in many respects were inadequate; they were unsanitary and they were undoubtedly chargeable with a very high death rate among the pupils.\nThe Churches became responsible under the contract agreement for improving their buildings, which were to be brought up to a certain standard before they could receive the increased per capita grant, the Department also undertook the responsibility of substituting for buildings owned by the Crown modern structures specially designed for needs of the service. The policy was formed that these schools, being public institutions, should be as well constructed as any other class of public building, and should be in all respects a credit to the Dominion. We pledged ourselves to spend reasonable amounts from year to year until this rebuilding programme was finished. The new arrangement provided for a material increase in the per capita grant, namely, from $60.00 in the eastern and $72.00 in the western provinces to from $80.00 to $125.00 according to the location of the schools and the nature and condition of the buildings. The Churches diligently carried out the scheme of building improvements, and the Department was able to do its share from adequate Parliamentary appropriations until the outbreak of the war.\n\nThe amount which we set aside for annual expenditure on buildings was about $150,000.00. Under this arrangement we had completed the following buildings:\n\nChapleau, Ont., C. of R., $45,000.00,\nGeo. Gordon's, Sask., $30,000.00,\nMorley, Alta., Meth., $30,000.00,\n\nWe had provided in the estimates for 1915-16 for the following new construction:\n\nRound Lake, Sask., Presbytn., $30,000.00,\nPeigan Res., Alta., R. C., $30,000.00,\nRed Deer, Meth., $25,000.00,\nStuart Lake, B. C., R. C., $60,000.00.\n\n$258,000.00.\nAs the war continued, all new projects were abandoned, these monies were not spent and the amounts were not retained in future estimates.\nAmounts expended by

Dominion of Canada.\n\nMay it please Your Royal Highness:-\n\nWe, the Chiefs and Headmen representing the Indian Bands living upon the shores of and adjacent to Lake Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, having failed to have received due and just consideration, through the prescribed channels for the administration of Indian affairs, in the matter of an attempt to deprive us of the hunting rights granted to our peoples and the encroachment upon the educational rights as embodied and written in the original treaties made between the British Crown and our Indian peoples, do herewith, humbly, respectfully and earnestly crave the help of Your Excellency and that Your Excellency will order that the hunting rights of Your Indian peoples be acknowledged and maintained, and that the education of Indian children be given under the sole management of the Government, as prescribed in our treaties, without any interference or influence from any source whatever, political, religious or otherwise.\n\nWe respectfully beg to quote the words written in the treaties made and concluded at Berens River on the 20th of September, 1875 and at Norway House on September 24th, 1875, with which the promises written in the treaty memorandum as promised by the Commissioner appointed to make a treaty with the Indians of the Stn Peter's Band, are identical,-\n\n\"Her Majesty\"\n\"Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as herein-before described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such tracts as may be from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes, by Her said Government of Her Dominion of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefore by the said Government.\"\n\nThe first movement to deprive us of our rights was made by the Missionary in the Fisher River Reserve who agitated with the Game Department of Manitoba, and we were notified by the Game Guardians that we were subject to the Game Laws of the Province of Manitoba. This movement has found favour with the Department of Indian Affairs and we have recently been notified by the Department that we must obey the Game Laws of the Province of Manitoba.\n\nAt the meetings of the Indians of the Peguis and Fisher River Bands with the Game Guardians, our Indian Agent pointed out the injustice of applying Game Laws to Indians at a moment's notice and without consulting the Indians or the enacting of proper legislation for such a purpose and further suggested to the Game Guardians and to the Department of Indian Affairs, that no definite steps be taken until a dis-interested person be appointed to accompany him upon the treaty trip in the Fisher River Agency, that it might be clearly seen, that any attempt to apply Provincial Game Laws to Indians living in a locality composed of granite rocks, muskegs and water, and where none could raise sufficient vegetables or grain to keep a family in food for a month, and where, in hundreds of square miles\nmiles there could not be found sufficient hay to maintain one cow, would be contemptibly unjust.\n\nA most casual inspection of the districts where thousands of our Indian people are living will corroborate these statements and at once establish the fact that, whatever laws are, or are not made that will operate to deprive the Indians of their right to hunt, the Indians cannot live where they now are without the right to hunt as given them in their treaties.\n\nIf the Provincial Game Laws must be applied to Indians, they, the Indians, must be removed to a locality where there is soil to cultivate or hay lands where they can raise cattle. And inasmuch as the Indians living in the localities referred to have no knowledge of any pursuits except hunting and cannot speak any language except that of their race a grave responsibility rests upon the Government of the Dominion of Canada.\n\nWe respectfully solicit the defense of Your Royal Highness in this matter of vital importance to ourselves and all our Indian people.\n\nIn the matter of our schools we respectfully beg to quote from our treaties made with the British Government:\n\n\"And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain schools for instruction in such reserves hereby made as to Her Government of the Dominion of Canada may seem advisable, whenever the Indians of the reserve shall desire it.\"\n\nIn some unknown way, perhaps with a laudable desire for mutual benefit, a system of education of Indian children has been arranged in the past between the Department of Indian Affairs and the different Churches or Religious Organizations, the Churches being given\ngiven the privilege of nominating the teachers, only, and the Government paying the teacher's salaries and all the expenses of the school management.\n\nWhatever may have been the imagined benefit to be derived from such a system, it condemns itself at once, inasmuch as it at once places the teacher under two masters and has also been the means of causing serious religious quarrels among our people.\n\nThis apparently small matter of granting the nomination of teachers to religious organizations has been sadly abused and has assumed such aggressive proportions that teachers are engaged and dismissed without any reference to the officials of the Department, and Indian Department Officials and regulations are ignored and defied. To such an extent has this been allowed and encouraged that at Berens River the Methodist Missionary boldly abducted two Roman Catholic children from the Roman Catholic school, in spite of the protest of the teacher in charge and the Indian Agent's warning against such a course of action, and placed the children in the Methodist Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nSome teachers have also complained that they do not receive the amount granted by the Government for their salaries.\n\nWe earnestly pray Your Royal Highness to order that all Indian schools shall be operated solely and entirely by the Government.\n\nWe will at all times welcome and assist to the very best of our ability any Church or Religious Organization who wishes to bring to us the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but we will not tolerate or uphold any who has any influence with our teachers, schools or matters pertaining to the treaty made with the Indians by the Government, or who by their determination to secure worldly power and material benefits, give the lie to their professed object\nof taking Christianity to the Indians.\n\nUnder the present system of Indian education the teachers do as they like, some of whom are incompetent, and many of our schools would be as well closed. Reports of progress and conditions by self-interested persons should not be accepted and an investigation will reveal the truth of our statements, and more.\n\nWe regret the trouble and loss of time we are causing Your Royal Highness, but we are at our wit's end to know how the affairs of Indians can be given due consideration, and we have wondered if it is because the Indian has no vote that his affairs are treated with contumely, his rights assailed and those who dare to lift a voice on his behalf, suppressed.\n\nOur only hope is in British justice and an appeal to the British Government to administer our affairs in accordance with the terms of the treaties made between that Government and the Indian people of the Dominion of Canada, and we still have faith in those treaties which the Commissioners appointed to make treaties with us stated, were alike binding upon the Government and the Indians.\n\nIn the further interests of Peace and Good-will, and that there be no cause for dis-satisfaction amongst our people, many of whom are unable to understand the differences of award according to merit, we respectfully suggest that the monetary recognition of the sacrifices made by many of our young men upon the field of battle in France, to the parents or relatives of the fallen, be equal.\n\nWith\nWith sincere regard, submission and loyalty to Your Royal Highness\nand the British Government we respectfully submit these presents\nfor Your Royal Highness to dispose of, by referring them to the\nGreat Peace Conference, or as Your Royal Highness may deem most\nexpedient, and subscribe ourselves\n\nYour humble loyal subjects,\n\nWilliam Pahkoo ..................

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with which you enclosed a copy of petition signed by Indians of the Peguis, Fisher River, Berens River and Bloodvein Bands.\n\nI cannot give you much more information as to the instigator of the petition than is contained in my letter of January 28th last, with which I enclosed copies of the petitions as advised.\n\nThe first I heard of the intention of the Indians to take their grievances to the Governor was from a returned soldier who had settled in the Fisher Bay district who stated that he had been warned by the people that the Missionary in the Fisher River reserve was a Game Guardian and that the Indians were forbidden to hunt.\n\nThis man had also a grievance against the Land Department for some mixup over his homestead being given to another while he was serving in the Army, and stated that he was taking this to the Commissioner of Immigration and said he would also present the case of the Indians being restricted in their hunting privileges.\n\nThen I heard of meetings of Indians had been held in the Fisher River reserve after which the meeting was held in the Halfway House on January 20th as advised. Then a meeting of the Peguis Council was asked for January 27th, and it appears the Peguis Council had invited the Fisher River Council to be present also, with Chief William Berens.\n\nChief Berens stated that he had told the North West Mounted Police\nthat he and all his people would not submit to the Provincial Game Laws, that they would all go to jail willingly as they might as well be there as to attempt to live where they are without the game, that he had so informed the Hudson's Bay Co. who had stated, \"go ahead and get the furs and we will buy them\".\n\nChief Everett of the Fisher River Band brought several cuttings from newspapers including one containing an alleged statement by Chief Game Guardian C. Farber, of Winnipeg, that the taking of game for food by Indians at all times was the Indian's indisputable right.\n\nThe Indians were most indignant and angry and stated that unless they received satisfaction they would wait upon the Governor General in person, condemning the Indian Department and Officials for \"taking sides with the Game Guardians instead of protecting the rights of the Indians\". I had always advised that the Peguis Band did not appear to have any such hunting rights claimed by the others, but at the meeting with the Game Guardian on March 29th, 1916, Mr. Game Guardian Joyce read a copy of the address of the Commissioner which was made to the Indians of the St Peter's Band at the first treaty, stating that the game was theirs, (the Indian's) and that they had right to hunt over all lands not enclosed. It was also argued that when the St Peter's people had their annuity changed from $3.00 to $5.00 it was by an agreement between the Government and the Indians, otherwise the Department would be taking their treaty money and reserves next, which was no more a part of the treaty than the right to hunt game, and no less.\n\nIt was quoted that the conviction of Andrew McPherson upon a plea of guilty was evidence that the Province had no power to punish a treaty man for exercising his right to hunt, as nothing was done to him, and the hearing of his case was refused by three or four local Police Magistrates because he was an Indian &c.\n\nIt would appear regrettable that at least, a pretense of treating with the Indians was not made in this matter and it is perhaps not too late for the Department to consider how this game question can be settled satisfactorily to all and in the meantime to advise the Indians of the receipt of their petition through the hands of the Governor General, but that, while the Department has always had the interests of its Indians before anything else, it has also many other Bands claiming its\nattention, and that this will be further carefully considered.\n\nI advise something like this as the Indians are impatient and I heard some of them talking in Indian that they had better come to Ottawa and publish their grievances in the press as have several other Indians. I have endeavoured to hold this down by advising that to do either would destroy any efficacy their petition may have, and would be an insult to the Governor General.\n\nIn reference to the St Peter's surrendered question it was stated that the Indians considered the Department was bribing those now coming out with the $70.00, that Mr Bradbury had been bribed to drop his defence of this question, and also other officials. Those who have come out stated that at the meetings held in St Peter's last winter they were promised in unmistakable terms that they would be paid the \"$90.00\" by the Agent in the Peguis reserve. At the treaty payments last summer, just before commencing to pay annuity I was asked by the Council if I would kindly step to the outside of the pay-tent; when there I was asked if I had any money, other than the usual annuity to pay them; if I knew or had heard of any being expected for them, other than the annuity, to which I could but answer, no. The interpreter then said that was all they wished to ask me.\n\nI really think there was no necessity to make any offer of payment for work on the houses ans less to advance the amount from $2.50 to $3.50 per day. Now the Indians no doubt have the idea that if they kick long and hard enough they will get something more, and as there is no doubt that several Indians in the Peguis Reserve received little or no building assistance, other than the materials, they are joining hands in voicing their dissatisfaction. It would seem to be a most necessary rule to give to all Indians alike, or nothing to any.\n\nIn the matter of the education of Indian children the greatest complaint has been from Fisher River; several times the Fisher River Council have been to see me to ask that the school business be taken out of the hands of the Churches, and at meetings I was asked what powers the Minister had in the schools, to which I could only reply as advised by the Department, - only the nomination of teachers. I was accused of assisting the minister against the Indians in this school matter upon one occasion, and the Indians took or sent a petition to the late\nChief Inspector Glen Campbell, who sent it to me, but I did not report this as I thought it was because the former Fisher River Chief was a \"Shaker\", but the present Chief who is a Methodist makes the same complaint and request that the schools be managed solely by the Government.\n\nThe Peguis Council also make the same request which I think is founded on the fact that some of the Council wished a friend of theirs to be given the South Peguis School and approached me about this and I informed them that I had no say in the appointment of any teacher.\n\nThe war has no doubt hastened this attitude, but any one of ordinary vision could see that the handling of school matters by the Churches in face of the enlightenment of the modern Indian could only result in the alienation of the Indians from the Churches.\n\nI have spoken to the Revd T. Ferrier upon this line but Mr Ferrier stated that if they could not have the appointing of the teachers his church would step down and out from any Missionary work in the reserves; some Roman Catholic Priests spoke to me on the S.S. Wolverine in reference to the situation at Berens, and I suggested the solution of placing the school business in the hands of the Department, only, which was replied that the Roman Catholic Church would never give up the privilege of appointing the teacher.\n\nIf this is the spirit of the Churches it will be the greatest blessing for all concerned if they will withdraw from the reserves, and it should not be a question of the Churches giving up this courtesy, but if the Department considers it advisable to terminate it; at any rate the school affairs should be either under the Church or the Department, but, as the Indians hold the original treaty and demand that they be treated according to the terms of their agreement it would seem they have some say in the matter. Cooperation seems impossible as the Missionaries in most cases, although they quote cooperation, really desire approbation of all they do, right or wrong, and to order all things.\n\nIn the case of Jackhead, the only man proposed for this school was a man who was a failure in the same work at another place.\n\nIn speaking upon the subject of Indian education with the late Lieutenant Revd Hetherington, assistant Principal of the Brandon Industrial school, he said, \"it is no wonder we have such poor results in our\nIndian school matters, for whenever we have a man who is a down and out failure, his name is brought up at conference, and he is given a school or mission with the Indians\". It seems impossible to avoid disaster if such persons have anything to say in the management of education. While I am quite sure aware that there are noble exceptions it cannot be expected that persons of intelligence will offer themselves for the position of teacher in an Indian school under the existing humiliating conditions.\n\nIn the statement of the Indians that some teachers have complained they do not receive the amount granted for their salaries I would say that Joseph Everett was reported to have been dismissed from the Bloodvein school through the efforts of the Revd F.G. Stevens of Fisher River. Joseph came to me in the early spring of 1917 and stated that he had applied for a settlement of what he claimed was due for his services and presented a statement signed by the Revd T. Ferrier in which Everett was charged for an amount due Miss Jotcham for her travelling expenses enroute to or from Norway House, and further made a claim that he was short some $200.00. This I was told was later paid to him. I entered into some lengthy correspondence with the Revd J. Arnup in this matter.\n\nGeorge Sinclair, who was at Pekangekum and Berens River made a statement that all that he had received for his summer work was $80.00.\n\nIt was stated at Fisher River that the extra grant of $50.00 given by the Department to Miss Royan would not be given her as she had made a contract with the officials of the Methodist Church to teach the Fisher River school for a certain sum which would not be increased. Miss Royan wrote me several letters after she had left the Fisher River reserve and finally advised me that she had been paid this amount.\n\nMrs Lowes of Berens River claimed to have never received but $500.00 for her services as teacher. At her request I took this up with the Revd T. Ferrier who stated to me that they only paid $500.00 to a female, and $600.00 to a male teacher. Mrs Lowes wanted to know what was the difference so long as she had the qualifications. Mr Arnup stated that the salary of the teacher and missionary was a joint one, but Mrs Lowes repudiated this and said she wanted the salary that was granted.\n\nA change from the present conditions could not possibly be\nworse and if I was asked what I would prefer I would say that, if the Churches wanted it so bad and the Indians could be satisfied thereby, by all means give the whole management into the hands of the Church officials of all Indian schools; but with the differences of religion among the Indians and that each denomination is against the other it seems there can only be expected an increase in the troubles upon the Indian reserves. One of the Peguis Councillors has upon more than one occasion urged the Council to request that the teachership be always given to educated Indians so long as they are proved to be competent.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that the Peguis Band particularly are a very persistent and \"want to know\" Band, and have many relatives and friends in Winnipeg who can give them every information upon law or anything else, and the questions asked in the Council meetings are often difficult to answer.\n\nHowever, the time appears to now be ripe for all classes of people to have their wrongs or grievances overhauled and adjusted with little consideration for the wants of the few that does not justly administer to the needs of the many. The Department of Indian Affairs has a most responsible task to administer the affairs of a nation almost helpless before the advance of civilization. While admitting my many shortcomings I consider it a privilege to be able to do something for the advancement of the Indians and should rejoice to be able to assist in so working that a contradiction may be made to a statement I have heard, that the Indians are progressing, not with the cooperation of the Department with the Churches, but in spite of it.\n\nI am sure you are tired. I enclose the petition herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\nMarch 18, 1919\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you kindly inform me as to the number of schools for the instruction of Indians in operation in each of the four Western Provinces of Canada with the number of pupils in each. Whether such schools are day schools or boarding schools.\n\nKindly note also the number which of these schools are under Catholic auspices or conducted as Catholic schools and how such schools are supported.\n\nThanking you for an early reply I remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant asking to be furnished with certain information in regard to the Indian schools in operation in each of the four western provinces of Canada.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I am sending you under separate cover a copy of the last Annual Report of this Department, on pages 80 to 95, inclusive, of which you will find the number and kind of schools in each of these provinces and the names of the religious denominations under which they are conducted.\n\nIn regard to your request to be informed how these schools are supported I beg to inform you that the Department pays the salaries of the teachers and all other expenses in connection with the day schools and the boarding and industrial schools are conducted on a per capita grant system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. A. McLean,\nThe Apostolic Mission House,\nBrookland Station,\nWashington, D.C.\nI have given consideration to your confidential report of March 7th with regard to the petition sent by the Indians of the Peguis, Fisher River, Berens River and Bloodvein Bands, to His Excellency the Governor General.\n\nThe part of the petition regarding education will be dealt with in a separate communication. In so far as the hunting and fishing privileges are concerned, I may only state again that the Indians must come under the provisions of the Game Laws the same as white people, except in so far as the Provincial Authorities may be willing to make special concessions in their favour. The Indians should be advised that this is done in their own interests, and in order to preserve the game for them as well as for other residents of Canada.\n\nThe Department agrees that there is no real necessity of making any offer of payment for work on the houses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

S.\u2014The red color plate is not used on III chart. There is nothing for sale by the writer and no denomination is represented. Bible patterns and scientific outline combined to keep central numerals compared with the unitarian universe for a universal language of God's handy writings. Nature and the Bible speak one.\n\n(This outline will be suggestive.) The meaning of numbers in the Bible and science and church and new school globe are outlined in primary grades. Then, in view of the other classes all can follow the same numbers outlined by this class and illustrated by placing each operation behind the scientific cross of our school globe circles.\n\nOur infant class lessons are four, made by 3 straight lines two perpendicular and the second one crossing the third. We will now make four dots in the form of a square. Hide these dots behind your crosslines. The next illustration is a square piece of paper hung by the corner or four corners hid. Now use 4 dots on your paper hung 45 degrees from cross lines. Explain: If we could stand anywhere in the universe these four dots are at the corners of a cube between the surveyors' spider-web cross and at cube corners.\n\nThe dots are now connected perpendicularly to make the letter H the 8 in our alphabet. Connect them the next time and make X. Now make the\nTHE INDIANS' TEPEE OR GREAT LODGE OVER JERUSALEM FOR CHRISTIAN UNION.\n\nThis is mechanical union first, social union second, and spiritual union third. In this Great Lodge Esau's descendants shout the Jews and Christians' yoke of servitude off their hairy necks. See broken yoke.\n\nIndia's figures of speech and through algebraic signs, numbers, forms and changeable signs given by India, philosophers bring all the ends of the earth together. This great Lodge has its totem sacrificial stage or post over Jerusalem 8 miles high to the smoke hole in the clouds through which Christ penetrated in His ascension.\n\nThe children with their sand box outlining Palestine will root out the Jewish Jerusalem and thus 8 miles on Joshua's and meteorologists' 7-mile stone northeast; 6 miles place a 10-inch lodge pole. North of west place another one 6 miles south at Abraham's Crossroads and on the rock Jacob dreamed on. His ladder place the third, 6, 8 and 10 miles square, everything on a square basis. These stones are reduced to scale as a carpenter marks and fits the 10-mile builder rafter for a 12-ft. house or a 10-mile ridge rafter. The Indian Pawnee Israel sees the angels ascend and descend as did Israel, because his face faces the true Jerusalem with his spinal column becoming the angel ladder. He sees white angels ascending in all white forms descending, while black angels in all forms are descending. There goes Indian up with his feather on God's side of the plumb line or left hip. He jumps from one side to the other as his spirrel tail guides him, like a helm to a ship or a bird to a telescope, eagle or aeroplane. When he jumps he says like \"My grandpa grows corn?\" Because he eats them \"clean things\" like the clean cud chewing and triangular hoof splitting buffalo.\n\nHe is now on his road to heaven and will rise through this giant buffalo skull. At the smoke hole Christ has pierced the clouds overhead with. If God took up the cloud of witnesses from over Jerusalem of the Jews, He has been ever the same to Esau's descendants.\n\nCOVER PEACE TENT OVER JERUSALEM.\n\nThis Family marriage tree is copied from Australian mythology, and strictly followed there. Abraham followed it in marrying Sarah, if our author's suggestion is correct. We know it was adultery and death for a Jew to marry an uncircumcised Gentile. \"What are ye seeking the tent of God?\"\n\nAt Bethel or Ur, Abraham kept travelers and charged them nothing, and when they thanked him, He pointed up and told them to thank God, as he was only a servant of the True God.\n\nZachus is up in our snow-white sycamore with three tales too short to even reach the Smoke Hole, let alone the Pleiades. With a four-fold heart genealogy loops he descends and dines with Christ, and the Pleiades Borneo universal brood at the center of the universe of his own \"household,\" to which salvation had come on this everlasting day.\n\nIndia's ideals, households, nations and universes are all analyzed by the Indiana School Globe pattern, Skeletons, Vestures, &c., &c.\n\nGen. 27, 40: Thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n\nMECHANICAL CHRISTIAN UNION BY A TENT PEACE LODGE OVER JERUSALEM.\n\nThis is like a clap of thunder from a clear sky in Christians' minds, as well as Jews, Mohammed or prophet led people. They knew the Bible talked of skeletons, bones, vestures and such mechanical forms of speech. They read of tabernacle patterns, \"rock cutters\" made armor and became the wall answering it. They read of \"the earth being full of the knowledge of the God as the waters cover the deep.\" They read of Lion and Lamb lying down together and a child leading them. These and many more Bible texts were visionary, poetical and unexplainable.\n\nThe knowledge of these things were the secret belongings of God's not man's sphere of knowledge. Man knew nothing of the future state after the first vale of death of body. All was blank and trusted to an unknown and an unknowable God.\n\nTo put the whole house together and map the universe from origin to destiny with these skeleton rocks and vesture sign was worse than blindness to the Church faith, logic, theology and science alike.\n\nIt stretched Christ's official agency from Jerusalem's temple in Palestine to Jerusalem now made by hands in three days. This belonged to Eternal daytime. People took up stones to stone Christ for blasphemy and making Himself God. So people today have stoned the interpretations of science and the Bible maps of Hell, Paradise, God and Christ's Kingdoms, separated from Eden's Sheepfold Gate at D.\n\nSo our first maps were burned in effigy. Our maps of death, Hell and the grave gave all a death rattle in their throats. They seemed to have met their angle right in sight of Christ's unbroken skeleton. All nature recoiled.\n\nThen to ask all Christendom to come back to Jerusalem and make peace with Esau like Jacob of old did, was an insult to all good people of \"God's Chosen Flock.\"\n\nTo think of smoking the Indian's \"Peace Pipe\" right under Jacob's Ladder, with Buck Indian angels going up to heaven before 12-hour Christians, is to humble us all.\n\nIn this Smoke Hole Raven's feathers all turned black, of course.\nNATURE'S SKY PILOT by EDEN PATTERNS\n\n\"Mine will be, too, if God ties me there by the laws of His heavens.\n\nHow strange to think of crossing ourselves like Pawnee Indians and send the first smoke up through the clouds that Christ pierces, and then call it Tirama's Smoke Hole!\n\nThe next puff to his \"mother earth that he lets us live on.\" Then to the four winds of heaven, where they have all assembled from to go to heaven, all their ways. This is the needles and that is the Sheep Fold gate where Tirawa calls his sheep and bids us follow to large pasture, where \"there is a living\" for both flocks of sheep.\n\n\"I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.\"\n\n\"I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"\n\n\"Other sheep have I. These I will bring with me. They shall come from the east, west, north and south, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and you shall be cast out.\n\n360\u00b0 of their hearts were \"whiter than snow\" and their characters were \"clearer than crystal.\" \"No law,\" \"no transgression.\" This is Christian union by God's plan. Can man accept it? Will God change it? Can man change it? If not, then let us have a League of Nations assembled under this Jerusalem Peace Tepee. Give and receive all nations as brethren in a League of Nations, remembering we are all God's poor children in one great physical, political and national bodies. This is equality. Church union by God and man's measuring reed\u2014the snowflake. According to the measure of man so is that of the angels.\n\nBut there is another reason for this Indian angel hopping like a grasshopper and jumping from one side to the other. He has to pass the Black Raven with his sun box in his hand. And if you look close you will see Black Raven's flashlight in White Indian's face, just before he hops on the sun box or over Black Raven's back.\n\nBlack Raven had silver change, but like the devil he was caught and tied in the smoke hole of limitation. His feathers have been black ever since. That is why he has been a bad omen. It was he in the form of Oden with his Hammer that controls the lightning as well as the sunlight in the Frost Giant's country of Alaska, Norway and Iceland.\n\nHe has to descend to earth, heaven or hell below the surface of rebirth in animal or feathered tribes. He goes down to earth heaven below Jerusalem that Mix Rising Sun from Tolko will describe to the children later.\n\nAll have heard so much recently about The New Jerusalem Free State. It is not necessary to stop to describe. Our Union will cover all of the two brothers' farms and threshing floors that Jesus cleans with His \"fan\" scourge of cords.\" See Chart 8.\n\nWe now enter the south temple doors and pass out to the north. Ezek.\n\nChildren now make a grave in your sun box and bury the rich man's mansion. Then build his grave draw the honey bees all in your sand rocks. Now at each point of the compass place a brother angel with his sword to protect Divas' grave. Bring four angels to carry Lazareth's body to hell south, where the \"worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.\" All medicine men get your sacred bundle of six sticks and tattoo 12 dots for buffalo bulls, Joseph's colored rocks, 4 arrows and 1 ear. Dress a sack cloth and mark which is the Indians' sign for a doctor. Humble yourself and tell us why you doctors in your apothecary prescriptions use the bee cell form to write your chemical prescriptions on? You seem to connect the 6 out points of the snuffake like a breeze, lament from the dead in a manner well like the bee cup. But your \"home in the rock\" signs are not sweet.\n\nIt did not pour oil into this dog of a Jewish Esau brother that died at your rich man's gate of opportunity.\n\nIndian Esau's eyes are not clouded. He saw war chariots in the clouds helping Titus' army destroy your city A. D. 70. He sees Divis' angel spirit down in Japan under heaven and hell like No. 5-II.\n\nHumble yourselves like a true Indian doctor. Lay your head on David's tomb with face south to the 8-mile tree of life, portrayed in the Grave Chart 3.\n\nCall Central and have her connect you with Christ's new rock town and call Lazareth to the phone. Hello! Yes; who is this? Divas? Who this is Lazareth? I did not expect to hear from you so soon after death. How is it with you since you left the material body before the grand funeral? Did you see your own funeral turn out?\n\nYes, but I am in torment and want to talk to Christ.\n\nVery good. I will give Him the receiver, because He is always here. Good-bye.\n\nIs this, Mr. Christ? Yes. Will you send Lazareth back to warn my five brothers not to come to this place of torment? Oh! they have Moses and the prophets to warn them. D.\u2014They will not believe them, but they will believe if one arose from the dead and told them. No; they will not for it has been 1900 years since I have warned them. There is a stiff-necked dual purpose set that pull away the shoulders. But the wrath of man shall praise me and every knee shall bow to me as yours do now.\n\nLook at my Esau flock of sheep that have come to Jerusalem and stretched forth my Great Christian Union Lodge. O Christ, pray send Lazareth to dip the tips of his fingers in water to cool my tongue.\n\nChrist\u2014Hellow, Jerusalem! Long distance, central. Yes, here is Divas (many), who wants her husband, Beelzebub.\nNATURE'S SKY PILOT by EDEN PATTERNS\n\n(Long distance, Hell center)\u2014Is this Hell Central? Yes. Give us the Great Chief. One of his wives wants to get to him from Gehenna. All right; I have rung him. Hello! This is Beelzebub's central office. Where is the Great Chief? He is too busy to be bothered, since the Kaiser called four years ago. Who are you? I am Miss Divas, his bride. Who are you? I am Haman, the Satanist, that governs due to lost tribes of Israel in purgatory.\n\nOh! yes; I see you got hung on your father's gallows, 50 cubits high\u2014yes. Would you mind telling me how you got hung? No. I was hung in effigy at the Pleides center. H.\u2014Oh! yes; I see you were Beelzebub's seventh blade, while he was his tent cock-crower. So, have you a triangular shoulder blade there, well burnt? Yes; everything is burnt here and I am naked. Yes; where must I look for your astrologer's sign on it? Mine is very legible, pointing to the fool's heart on the outside of the shoulder blade. When I married Miss Divas (Beelzebub) I did hang him on my hut. Oh, now, you are getting hot, like my shoulder blade a crack wide open, but before you leave tell me where to see your power of control on my shoulder blade burnt wond. Oh! yes. Yours is on the east side of the Bull in the heavens, and you use it on lucky days twice a year through Indians' \"hole in the wall\" over Jesus' shoulder. It warms. Now yours is on the inside of the shoulder blade just opposite. This is the reason our bridge-room could hide so many foolish brides. They were not seen by scholars till the Indian's yoke promise by blind Isaac was fulfilled. This shoots the beam from the wall out of our own eyes and allows us to extract the mote from our 6 or 9 spiritual brothers. The rocks from the wall answer it and fall on our own proud heads. Beelzebub knows his days are numbered at the little season beyond the material circles of 1,000 years.\n\nThen he and the God agree that the rocks and hills will fall on our dirty characters and our spirit and soul as the moth and rust leaves it will be given to the man with talent.\n\nOh! why should we thus be annihilated? Oh! that we had prayed in time.\n\n\"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom.\" This day (everlasting spiritual day) we see him in Abraham's bosom. Good-bye, Miss Divas and Miss Haman Bull. Ring off, and pay your bills.\n\nWhat is it? Ten lost souls and all you have, Miss Haman Bull. And more Jerusalem Central. Seven lost souls, Miss Divas Bull, outside of heaven?\n\nHello, Jerusalem Central; who keeps your office? I am Miss Cherry Blossom, right from Tokio. Who are you? I am Indian thief that railed on Christ on the cross, and want to pay Miss Bull Haman's bill and Miss Divas' along with my own.\n\nYou all sold yourself to Beelzebub. We have no business account and \"know you not.\"\n\nHello, Children! Who is this at your telephone office? This is Miss Bell, 12 years old, daughter of Jason, that Christ raised from the dead. I am now Isis, queen of the Mikado.\n\nWould you please read us a selection from the Oracles? With pleasure, as I like our heathen Bible quite as well as yours. I read from the Oracle of India's chief, Akbar. \"Of all the people of commerce knew not my name. Therefore, I was born into the visible and endured a base existence. In high heaven I am the Deity of the sun. In mid-sky I show my doings. I hide in the great earth and produce all things.\"\n\nIn the midst of the ocean (of salt) I am the eight Dragon Kings (of power) and my power pervades the four seas (2\u2014at compass points).\n\nIf the poorest of mankind comes here once for worship, show me their faces and declare their wishes within 7 days, fourteen days, twenty-one days, or it may be three years, or seven years, according to the person and its importance. In this prayer I will surely grant his heart's desire. But the wicked of heart must not apply to me. Those who do not abandon mercy will not be abandoned by me.\"\n\nMiss Apache, of Pawnee, Nebraska, will now show us Raven's Sun Box cube, \"containing sunlight.\" It has six square holes patterned after numerologist's cube and Apache's Animal heaven, where the animals at one time were kept until they all disappeared. Then the gods of control opened all six doors at once. The eagle got out at the top first; the mouse at the bottom; then the four side doors, like your temple here, we came through.\n\nWe also dress these six door animal signs in six colors and have images as you have here in the sand, but when we change these we add a light. We hang the totem image on the sun box door and give it a little light. The seventh totem is a prayer image and we dress it in blue cottonwood, glow worms or firebugs in season, so it shines like Moses' face did at night. I was the seventh wife of our great chief. The others, four of them, were killed by the Mexican. He escaped and burned all their lodges and property because we know then that we are not glad our friends are dead. Christians and Jews burn theirs in the court houses. We on the plains. We no fuss over our dead men's bones or sell our father's graves. Then I be great Chief's squaw, cause I love him more than his things\u2014what you call it.\n\nMiss Yucca will explain from her west corner of Jerusalem.\n\nI, too, have a cubical box and want you to stretch your tent cords to Joppey, where Peter the tanner had his tabernacle vats under his house. In this box vat we tan our hides to make them last 40 years like Israelites did in the wilderness.\n\nWe believe Father Esau had Adam's clothes Christ made in Eden. He had left them at home when\nNATURE'S SKY PILOT by EDEN PATTERNS\n\nbe went hunting and Great Squaw stole them for white brother Jacob to get the written law of blessing inheritance.\n\nFather Esau became humbled, but now we rejoice to know we have kept the law in our minds from Hagar and Ismael's circumcision at 13 years old. Thirteen full moons are on our sun dial here above our tanner's vat. Four of these sundials are made for our Jubilee year. 12 of these year signs yoke across the center of the circle and cube alike. The other is the golden wedge by which God controls the earth like we do an apple with our arrow head inserted to the core and a string attached.\n\nThe head of this wedge covers 45 acres at Titicaca, Chili, where your Christ and sister came down and gave us the fruit of the vine. Moses taught us how to raise corn. This is where we got our pedigreed seed corn from, as we would have you believe. I am so glad your God's like ours, are going to test our plan and Moses' 10-year horticulture on this Mount of Ascension and Descention. They will sure get three crops the sixth year and all can rest the seventh.\n\nMiss Pharow says the Son will bring her cube. This is the Spirit and before it was perfected it hissed like a duck and was your letter Z open at both ends. We have no snakes in Egypt. Moses is our prophet. He understood how to get out of our darkness that is felt all over the world. Mercurians taught him geometry and he numbered the Seven Plagues of holocaust. The seven years of snowflakes, flowing in the wind from the mysteries of the moon signs, taught him how Joseph the eleventh Sun line of the Zodiac cube, husbanded the 7 years of plenty to make the corn last for 14 years of rainbow signs. The 7 plague was in solid \"Ise\" center of control as in the Japanese \"Ise.\" This center controls as the hub controls everything. I am standing out of myself in ecstasy at seeing Indian mythology and Egyptian geometry united in this Peace Pipe Smoke and read Indian Powwow. The triangular blood signs are typical of Christ's blood of protection. The red man also has the typical vigorous color of Moses red heifer.\n\nThe triangular tenth plague (Chart 3) kills cattle and older swine alike. Leviticus 26:26. Ten women bake all the best gems out of bread as to men out of all languages take hold of this Jewish circle as if representing the 10 lost tribes.\n\nAll return to Jerusalem under this Christian union tent, which is one half of our buckwheat over all belonging to our school globe, emerged and patterned after our Egyptian pyramid. Moses taught Paul to destructure of material by burning the remnants after supper and by carrying the mixed dough out unleavened by dual purpose bacteria germs. We carry out characters out of a material world on our backs as they did the staff of life. God had taught him on holy ground at the burning bush what was asbestos, like the Hebrew children's clothes. This character must go naked before God, so \"Take off thy shoes,\" children, for the \"place where\" we stand today is also \"holy ground.\"\n\nIt is true Elijah ascended in a chariot of fire. He was caught up to be changed in the twinkling of an eye. \"The mortal must put on immortality.\" There is no reverberation beyond the smoke hole in the sky, where all must pass. Moses taught this and heathen observed the law and extinguished the fire once a year as we do here in our kindergarten sand box, mentally get out of God's material world and take these snapshot views. Help, then, to teach an unchangeable God by an unchangeable pattern.\n\nASTRONOMY BY THE NEW SCHOOL GLOBE. HOW WOULD IT APPLY? WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE GAINED?\n\nLet us make some applications and then practical men can correct what they see not practical. We are no professional expert, but see no reason why the following is not a better basic outline and should be adapted. The trouble is writers and teachers jump from one point to another, like Moses' grasshoppers, until they are out of track and locate the astronomical when found, speaking of different centers. With three right angle circles across the disk of the sky, we have the poles and four Royal Stars\u2014Formalhant, Regulus, Antares and Aldebaran\u2014crossed by the three circles at 6 definite places. This recognized ancient astronomy in a mechanical way.\n\nThe twelve signs of a circle and a cube and sphere universe are then to be contrasted from plain to solid geometry.\n\nWhen we know our three hoop snakes originated in water or one of these four rivers of life, then with tails in their mouths, we bound the universe with 360 of each combined.\n\nWhen the first offspring of reproduction doubles our number, we have 6 instead of 3. When they unite in the middle, we have twelve equalize signs. These located and yoked across a center in a clock face, give twelve hour signs of a circle or other names agreeing with our cube, 12 diamond flags, as we wish to apply to 90\u00b0.\n\nThe earth turns over all in 24 hours. Our 8 corners are 45\u00b0 from all six scientific crosses.\n\nThese are yoked to the hub center by the three snowflake diameters 90\u00b0 apart. Connecting our cube by one of its bases to one sign, we have the heart of the snake covering mineralogists' diamond flags 45\u00b0 from all our 14 points, yoked together by 6 diameters of the cube. These diamonds or triangular pieces of glass either of them cast the 7 rays of the rainbow like water spheres. These also have mechanical definite outline from a common center of control. This in the first signs of the Zodiac, yoked mail fish to the north with female of the south, and the reproduction in next\ngeneration is plainly shown in the \"knot center\" between on the ribbon attached to each loom.\n\nThe heavenly sea in the south contains the flying horse, dragon, whale and other sea forms.\n\nThese with the hind parts hid or changed into fish or sea serpents, nymphs, &c., represent our own and all animals in plotomorphous modes, where once as before we were severed from the navel mother of earthly cord existence. We drown in a sea of water after birth as the fish does in air. Before both lived in a sea of water all around.\n\nNoah's Ark stranded on a rock with two stories seen above water line, is located here also, close to Noah's dove.\n\nThese are some of the mysteries Revelations of Geometry clear up. Astronomy has much to say about the culmination of the Pleiades. Every 52 years in Peru and other parts of the heathen world all celebrate the North Pole catastrophe in November. November 17 is May 17 in Peru and south of the Equator, and is celebrated.\n\nFrench lunch on the graves of the dead and peasants call them a mosquito net, and the Finns a sieve.\n\nMATHEMATICAL EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.\n\nWhat per cent numbers on our ball covered by Chart 3 represents the one, two and five talented man?\n\nHave the child turn the ball and point as he answers.\n\nWhat per cent was the woman's lost piece of silver to her share?\n\nIf the five score of cattle proved good and sold for 1,000 dollars, what would the man's wife sell for to be in the same proportion as the two talented man?\n\nWhat must the man's land sell for by Ananias and Sophia to represent one talented man that went to see it instead of the great supper?\n\nIf Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver, what then did Ananias and Sophia sell their souls for?\n\nIf the woman's two sisters saved her soul, find the per cent of loss to Ananias.\n\nIf the widow's soul ascended from No. 10 Chart, 3 to D, and the hundredth lost sheep went by the zenith or line of right ascension, use the square or protractor and locate the lost sheep.\n\nHow many crops would our three farmers reap in May of the eight years if their Lord then settled with them and did not let them pull down and build new barns?\n\nIf the five talented man had 50 barrels of apples on the fifth year, what would they be on the 6th year?\n\nIf he \"opened his hand wide to the poor\" and gave away 50 per cent, what would the other 75 barrels at 9 dollars bring?\n\nIf we looked around all eight corners of a cubical earth, where would we look for Dante's ninth Inferno circle? Divide the earth's radius by nine and give the diameter in miles.\n\nA pie cut by three diameters has 6 points all to one center. How many points does three cuts of an apple make 90 degrees apart at the center? Which will best represent both forms of Noah's family in the flood of several ages, of affinity and evolution?\n\nIf we mentally locate a great lodge near Jerusalem 45 miles high and Peter is on the center of the tanner's house top, 30 miles from Jerusalem, what is the hypotenuse by the way angels or the birds fly to Christ's \"hole in the sky\"?\n\nIf the house is Moses' tabernacle, size in No. 2, Chart 1, how far is Peter from either angel that holds the corners of the animal sheet?\n\nWhat will be the distance if it is as large as Solomon's Temple, No. 3?\n\nWhat is the diagonal from Z to upper corner of 6 in either form? Also, the length of the Social Gulf in No. 5?\n\nTHE NORTH POLE CENTER OF CONTROL.\n\nThis center of control had been taught for ages before God chose Judah's Jerusalem in the heart of the Lion in Israel and in the heavens also. Read the following from Star Love of All Ages, while holding Chart 3 with the pointer stars in the heavens on the plumb line. Poise the balance on this plumb line also. A farmer on each each balances. The eleventh labour of Hercules was to procure Golden Apples from Hesperides.\n\n\"Right hand Pivot points to the north pole of the ecliptic.\"\n\n\"Judge of Heaven,\" \"High honored One,\" \"Proclaimer of right (the light of the world),\" \"High one of the chooser of life,\" \"The Favorable Judge,\" \"The Life of Heaven,\" \"The prosperous Judge,\" \"The Crown of Heaven.\"\n\nTo the Arabs the stars around the north pole were a shepherd with a herd of sheep, camels and goats near Cyphus, Cassiopeia or Lady of Corn, and Vigo was called the Maid of the Harvest, with their emblem or first fruit of the harvest (God's Hand on the left). These scientific positions are pertinent here, as well as the 5 virgins in Chart 3.\n\nThe Esquiman stone lamp supported by three stone star signs, belong also.\n\nThe Egyptians called Ammon \"the Lord of the Head.\"\n\nRig Veda had the first lunar station here in Castor and Pollux, The Twin Stars.\n\nThe April sign in Peru was an Ax and referred to the harvest and reaping of crops (South of the Equator).\n\nChinese white sheep.\n\nShepherd of the Life of Heaven, Keeper of Heaven and 13 Lunar Stations of India.\nNATURE'S SKY PILOT by EDEN PATTERNS\n\nThe northern gate of the Sun, on page 75 Bootes, is St. Silvester with Catholics. The Prophet Amos, by Caesins. The Great Shepherd and Harvester of Souls by Dr. Seiss. On the Emphrates star list, Shizitana is translated \"Shepherd of the Life of Heaven.\" These and many more ancient descriptions convince the writer's diagrams true in the Diamond's Flash of Revelations.

The Accadians imagined it to be a \"Great Serpent, and the River of the Divine Lady.\"\n\nPLEIADES.\n\nThe Iroquois Indian boy that got home sick in the sky was the lost chick in Malay's mythology. This chick made his visitation in moments of anger, descending to earth and getting something to eat. This again is duplicated by Christ weeping over Jerusalem. \"Oh! Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but ye would not.\" Your house is left unto you desolate. No wonder the horico hen got mad and threatened to destroy the chickens and men on the earth.\" Fortunately, Orion the Mighty Hunter, saved the people.\"\n\n\"When the Pleiades are invisible the hen broods her chicks.\" \"When seen the cuckoo calls,\" Chart 4, cover.\n\nBy one story it was Elektra, mother of Danaus, the founder of Troy, that hid her face from the city's destruction. Paraguay Abipones Indians were descended from the Pleiades and their grandmother was sick when not visible.\n\n\"Munder says the Babylonian seals and cylinders engraved them.\"\n\nThey were the seven daughters of Atlas the giant, that bears the world on his shoulders, and the Nymph Pleiades.\n\nJapanese, Hindues, Azteks, Persians celebrated this festival of the dead or \"death angel,\" while Noah was delivered and the Hebrews alone celebrated deliverance with joy.\n\nJapan's \"Feast of Lanterns\" and Hindo Agrin or flame of fire (7 colors), with Egyptian three days' feast, commencing on the midnight culmination, are other mentioned incidents by the author.\n\nThey were called the Great Towns of the Ecliptic. \"Joh's Kinah or cluster or heap (God) neath Arcurns Orion, and the Pleiades and chambers of the South.\n\nSOCIAL CHANGES.\n\nIn case the New School Globe was admitted, what would be the effect?\n\nIt is easily seen that all are on an equality before God in the grave.\n\nServant and master, vassal and king side by side lie without distinction. Character that can be glorified and not disturb the everlasting Spirit realm is all that is helped by Christ over and beyond His material creation. With this exception Revelations of Geometry brings all to one level, like the grave; King and priest, rich and poor, high and low, master and slave, are all of one dimension, like universe and ion. Like the condor and the sparrow, the ant and the worm, of one, two or three dimensions united in God.\n\nThe Kindergarten measurements have no respects to pay to capital or labor. The author has a few suggestions for all. Quit paying interest on public debts and improvements. Bond your local city or town and deposit these bonds in Washington. Pay one-tenth of them every year and be out of debt in 10 years. The government then can pay you all the currency you need. When the laboring classes demand this capital, can get all the money needed at lower rates.\n\nWhen you destroy interest this far you have hit the lords of creation a hard blow. Chartered privileges and land titles should be returned to the people every so often similar to what the Jews practiced. Moses forbade interest. The first Church sold their possessions and had things common like we see through geometry and in the grave.\n\nI am my brother's keeper and should prefer or push him before me and not make him to be my slave. I should be his willing servant and when he is thus treated he will be more. When we all can eat from the same dish, we will take no thought for the morrow. The morrow will take its own burdens. Then we will always be pure and sweet, when sowing and reaping without care as the Lily and Solomon dressed in glory or a character God will glorify. We will need no insurance companies. God pays all alike.\n\nDEATHS.\n\nThe distinction clearly taught between first and second death shows clearly a heaven to gain and a hell to shun. Just as we avoid offending a dear friend, so all will respect God. Just as we willfully offend a friend by having our own way, so do we offend Christ. Then we are dead in trespasses and sins to both. It takes two to make a bargain and two to settle a fuss, while three makes a trinity. Where two meet to-\nNATURE'S SKY PILOT by EDEN PATTERNS\n\ngether and settle a fuss, God is the third life-giving agency, as He was with Abraham and Sarah at the fullness of time, promises and time at too, Chart 2.\n\nWOOD SPIRITS.\n\nSome people do not believe in Spirits. Others see or believe in spirits in everything, like rocks and trees. Other names than \"ghosts,\" \"witches,\" and the like are substituted. Santy Claus and Fairies are thought more \"refined\" and up to date (?).\n\nWe would have you think of a salt witch that pulls by four corners. Yes, by four diameters or 8 witches considered all pulling from one hub center, when the first grain of salt is formed in midair or in the midst of a boiling salt brine vat. Then, when you think of these 8 witches all at work, add six more witches pressing in the sides of this cube.\n\nNow read Paul's address to the Greeks in Acts, telling them about the unknown God they worship ignorantly. \"Who is not far off with their poets alone: 'for in Him we live and move and have our being.'\n\nIf, then, salt is the preserving power of the earth, how long will he let our 14 witches live? When he can take the breath of life out of us any time, cannot he destroy you and me along with the 14 salt witches? Where does all power come from? We locate it all spiritually over Jerusalem; all men living on the south pole of earth, good and ungodly. Centrally we locate it hovering over the Borneo Pleiades universal brood of sick chickens, corresponding to the six outpoints of our snowflake, where Zachaeus' four-fold heart and pedigreed four-fold tale reaches. See front page cut. Christ came with Zachaeus and gathered his saved household together in Physic time.\n\nChrist draws it up through the Smoke Hole gate into eternal day, while the Jewish House hold he could boast off was left desolate.\n\nNow our fourteen witches in rock salt or loaf sugar and the like forms that are formed by nature's God are duplicated in our universal school globe because we have both forms in organic and inorganic Kingdoms of Nature, like the bodywork sugar and rice. This is why the prophet speaks of rocks crying out and a beam from the wall answering it (or to its six faces).\n\nIllustrations: Suppose we take a beam or green log and hew it square. Then cut it in two and place both halves above ground a little fire. One of the beam is set by the surveyors' compass north and south; the next one is at our 45 degrees angle. That is the corners are at 6 and 12 on our clock face when our prime meridian is on both. If we leave a little bark on at corners nature will make a better showing. When the drying sun power splits both 45 degrees from the common center we call these wood spirits instead of salt witches, all working by mechanical rule around our Universal School Globe center. Throwing our three right-angle circles over them to let the child see. The timber expert to destroy these wood spirits resorts to paint or bores out the center. Diamond dealers to keep their diamonds from cracking in transit from Boer mines in Africa to England ship them in potatoes. Now our contention is that God controls all from the Hub center axis or axletree.\n\nThis axis is taught by ancient as a giant World Tree is attested by many farmed seed names. Before citing examples, let us preface or observe all authors assure that the present is the best. That is to say they all differ from the author's views. They believe man sprang from a monkey or ape. We believe he descended from God's giants and degenerated since man knew much less than others till all ages. Because science sees a cell or bone in a frog or a monkey mechanically formed like that in our own bodies, is no proof that there is no impassable evolution vales that speak like Balaam's dumb brute and say the angel of death is in the way. \"Thou shalt go no farther.\" Again they try to connect harvest ship with vegetable life. In doing so they take no notice that all life commences in water or plasm, whether tree, vegetable, animal or human life. This is our universal base. Then they would connect harvest feast with Pleiades culmination without noticing November 17 and May 17 cross the same meridian. Yet harvest north of the Equator is six months earlier than in South America and the Antipodes.\n\nThis puts Jewish harvest in May 51. On November in the Aztec calendar of years. By Aztec revelations the world continued for 52 years more when the Pleiades zenith was passed. That is to say, Noah's flood destroyed the earth by water on that day and God was going to destroy it by fire at this Jubilee \"bundle of years.\"\n\nSix months' difference of time coming on the same moment and same parallel, is plain by this mechanical demonstration. You may think of a better one. Taking two cubes from our beams, stretch a black and white pencil from pole to pole, the black representing night and white sunlight.\n\nNow on the other cube unite them on the Equator and they represent summer and winter six months apart.\n\nMany other discrepancies may be solved in a similar mechanical way. It is generally agreed that there was a common source of revelations to all mankind. Either natural, oral or written, all derived as from the one source, center of control\u2014The Zodiac.\n\nIn Peru they thought the world was coming to an end and sacrificed humans.\n\nThe lost Pleiades is much talked of and all but one star can claim the title, I believe. This has been found by minerologists and placed aright in the center of the triangle of trigonometry on the snowflake cen-\nter. See inner triangle duplicated in Charts 3 & 4. These men are not aware of their own Key to the universe when they went on the mountains of Sinai like Moses and brought it down and directed Israel to camp around it as did also the twelve sister families of minerals in plain and solid geometry.\n\nThese twelve flooded stones from Jordan are used as a monument by our modern Joshuas. They, too, engraved the seven Pleiades on one stone as \"the seven eyes of the Lord that go to and fro through the earth,\" patterned after the thirty centers of the snowflake 6x6=36. Six cities of refuge on either side of this mineral Jordan flood are seen in the 6 diameters or yokes to Christ's missionaries companies. He sent them two and two to give refuge to all that would flee for safety. These are the 12 diamond signs.\n\nThe Hebrews believed Adam saw the earth and stars dance before them when in Eden. That was when the devil was tempting them and they had their backs to his throne at A.\n\nImages in Eden Chart 1 will speak louder than words and illustrate till all can understand.\n\nHaving, then, these definite outlines on our School Globe and celestial maps, the learner's mind follows the teacher's.\n\nThe writer claims these forms were taught Adam by Christ or God, who walked and talked together as teacher and pupil.\n\nThe evidences are many from varied sources. We wish to name and refer to a few as space will permit. Man has degenerated and forgotten much since he turned his back to his Mother Earth.\n\nIn Nine Winds of Stories, from Norse Mythology, by Mrs. Mabel Litchfield, Gunn Co., we have a world serpent. We quote from pages 107 and 108:\n\n\"Asa Thor, I owe myself beating Utgard Loki. When you lifted from the ground one paw of my cat, you were in reality raising the great Midgard serpent that encircles the earth. And you raised it high; that you nearly pulled his tail out of his mouth. We feared the foundations of Jotunheim would be shaken.\"\n\n\"You are a mighty giant Asa Thor, and I will take good care that you shall never find the giant's country again.\"\n\n109: \"Tyr, who stood near, turned to Thor and said, My father, the fierce giant Hymir dwells near heaven's end.\"\n\n\"He owns a caldron a mile deep (a cube). We can get it. My goats are ready, said Thor, and I long to see Jotunheim again. If I can meet the Midgard serpent on the journey, I will pay him well for deceiving me, as he did at Utgard\u2014Loki's\u2014making me lift him for a cat.\"\n\n113: \"They started out in Hymir's boat. It is child's play to fish so near shore, said Thor. When they were in the middle of the ocean the sea threw his line and drew up two whales with one bait.\n\nThor then took out his strong slender line. He fastened the gory head of the black ox firmly to the hook. Down below, where the whales sport, went the bait.\n\nThere lay the \"earth-encircler, the giant serpent of the deep. For years he had lain in the quiet of the deep sea with tail down his throat, waiting with slow-burning hatred for the time of vengeance, the Twilight of the Gods.\"\n\n\"Thor had secured a most tempting bait. The third time it came, the serpent pulled his tail from his mouth and swallowed hook and bait. Then the struggle commenced.\n\nThor grasped him in his arms. Compare this with the Serpent Bearer in the heavens as described by Star, Love of All Ages, on page 206, by W. T. Alcott.\n\nNow, the mile-deep kettle is a unitarian cube and the world Serpent is a changeable sign, as illustrated by one or more hoop snakes or circles of 360\u00b0 each. We would teach an unchangeable God of First Cause by an unchangeable pattern. Change your signs, but never change your 360\u00b0, 6 faces, 8 corners and 12 signs of the Zodiac. Take God's snap-shot view of these three forms of the universe with one hub center for all. Then speak like they do, always a unitarian language to all tongues and peoples alike. This is the object lesson taught to Israel when ranging with their faces towards Jerusalem, where God recorded His name in this dark star cube that now shines so bright as Thummin and Timnem, or Mineral Twin Sisters, from central cube split.\n\nThe Litchfield annotations show that a cat's paw was one-fourth of the Midgard serpent or 90 degrees of the circle of the earth.\n\n\"The fierce giant dwelleth near heaven's end,\" shows the universal application of all these scientific giants.\n\nJotunheim shaken by Thor, lifting the universal cat paw or 90 degrees of \"the world encircled,\" shows that each has a universal outline like our school globe.\n\nOur Bible tells us the shaking God is going to perform, too. When heaven and earth pass away there will be nothing left to measure.\n\nBut reduced in size these animals and snakes were all in Peter's sheet to mentally kill, eat and digest. See No. 3, Chart 1.\npart south of the equator and you have V, a triangle. How many triangles are formed by X? Dip your teddy bear's feet in ink, then your pet lamb's feet and place it on your X. Now draw 8 dots or two squares one above and one below. Now draw a large figure 8 around all. With a numeral cube this is the corners from your side and my side. Or from man's side and God's side of the snapshot of the universe. To compare everything then with this unit of the whole we get at a hint cease to think alike by pattern. Salvation from material destruction is of grace or the gift of God conditioned to the pure in heart that will walk in his face in peace and live in eternity. We will now have a report of classes and if the small ones are attentive they will learn much more.\n\nClass A on heathen mythology\u2014We found on an engraved shell Moses' four rivers of life coming from the scientific cross, Pism, Gihon, Hiddekel and Euphrates. We also found the head over footed sacred white elephant and head over cross in solid geometry. This is where we learned to change signs as the science of algebra came from India. X Y Z stand for the three unknown quantities. Geography class, we had a light to represent the sun in the center of the table surrounded by an egg shaped eclipse.\n\nAt 45 degrees we found our apple globes and revolved each one three times around because they were three months apart. Second geography class\u2014We had 12 apples and turned them once a month each year represented because there are 12 signs in the circle and Zodiac.\n\nHorticulture class\u2014We conducted an experiment station in Indian corn and Moses' orchard rule. Over the sun we planted the Adam apple tree and the next four years each we planted on the four universal corners. We could reap no fruit for ourselves until the fifth year. Lev. 19-23. Three years was to circumcision five of time. The fourth (year gloom) church was all was donated to God. The fifth year the topmost apple must be left for God's poor ret. We also experimented on Astets sacred 8 sowed seed corn. This was on 45 acres at Vera Cruz, Chili. To top our corn and fertilize the silks with 10 or 12 sowed pollen polluted our sacred seed corn given us by their God and forbidden by Moses in written kindergarten teaching. \"Mixed seeds in your fields.\" We penetrated our best topmost apple by 3 diameters of the snowflake 90 degrees apart.\n\nBlacksmith's Class\u2014We joined 12 rods together forming the outlines of a cube with mineralogists 12 diamonds red flags. In these we placed 3 diameters with square red flags and four diameters with triangular flags.\n\nUnitarian Language Class\u2014We found the Chaldee letters formed after the Indians' arrow head or triangular.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet formed squares as the dots. Alpha in Hebrew is the first letter and is formed by connecting diagonally upper left hand with lower right like the social gulf in chart I, No. 3, which Christ said could not be passed when the rich man in hell called for water to cool his tongue after death.\nThis A in Hebrew is our Z type to print with less the horizontal lines. In sound it resembles the hissing of a snake in the letter S and was a hissing duck in Egyptian alphabet.\n\nSecond Language Class\u2014We found in the 119th Psalm each of the 22 letters in Hebrew repeated 8 times in each of the 22 sections. Mechanically we used 22 inch boards divided in 8 parts with a verse on each. But the best way was by 22 mineral cubes with a verse on each corner. I am Alpha and Omega in all these letters, verses and corners of Hebrew mineral language and you must be square with God and man. Z in Greek had two sounds and one heart, two hearts and one beat at marriage feasts. See 25 and 75 on ball cover by chart 2. This makes one center for both parents or the same axis in offspring. 2 equals 1 in each.\n\nThese three diameters are further reflected applications in Hell for northwest and Ova'd and Jotuna frost giants and Oden's war father.\n\n\"Edda, the tangled garden or mind of nature laid bare,\" in unbroken skeletons of human and animal pathology is shown in Eden's patterns restored to us. Zuni Indians and Apache animal corals show 6 doors 90 degrees apart like mineralogists' square flag doors. They are further emphasized by different animal's and colors at each. The bald eagle goes out at the roof of this cube like Noah out of the Ark. The moe goes out below, the wildcat south, etc.\n\nSome Indians like the Pawnees followed this formula in the peace pipe smoke. Puffing the first smoke to Ti-ra-wa past our topmost apple on the 5 year tree of life over the sun on our table Ecliptic towards our needle's eye D, chart I. The second smoke towards mother earth's navel center, then to the four cardinal points of the compass.\n\nThis is duplicated by India measuring four corner posts and putting up walls of the universe. See D. A. McKenzie, p. 10. \"Nothing is excluded from these six broad faces (or cubes of the universe). This universe is the giant Purusha (man) and all that has been and shall be.\" One corner is hidden by the walls and one is on the plumb line as in chart 3.\n\nLev. 25, 8 to 10 and 26-11 all emphasize the tabernacle numbers by 7 Sabbaths of year to the square of 49 and 50 jubilee where the rams' horns proclaim jubilee on the tenth day of the seventh year, when they returned to their lost possessions.\n\nPlacing four dots in each one of our 30 circles we have the outlines of 30 universes by India's science. We place 36\u00b0 of the talents of the one man Christ speaks of giving this to in his parable of the talents. One talent is cut then by 5 diameters.\n\nTwo talents are cut by 2\u00bd diameters for the second man's and each piece is represented by 72\u00b0 taken 10 times. The 5 talents cut by 180\u00b0 or half moon circles for our lower large circles. When all double these talents all go to heaven like the woman taken to Tirawa, where the \"two were grinding at the mill\" of life. \"One taken and one left.\" The first of our men are changed to virgin signs in the women.\n\nAgain the signs must be changed to virgin farmers: 10 years till pay day when all hear the \"well done, thou good and faithful servants.\" Moses' horticulture rules in Levit. 19 are followed. The one talented man buys 10 ears of 10 rowed pedigreed seed corn of the celestial breed from Vera Cruz, Chili. He plants a row each year except the seventh row when the land is to rest over the Sabbath. The two talents are all invested in grape vines. Five crops are sold in ten years; 3 are circumcised years. The fourth all goes as a peace offering to the Lord along with the Sabbath year.\n\nFive talents are invested in apple trees and doubled in 5 crops, plus the Lord's one-tenth. \"God is spirit and hath no formal parts,\" but these are the manifest formalities of \"His hinder parts as seen by Moses and Pawnee disciples of Tirawa.\n\nChristian Pharisees and Sadducees, you are Christ's man among thieves on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho\u2014beaten and robbed. Let Christ pour in this mechanical oil into your wounds and take you back to Jerusalem hotel in his own and Indian eagles' aeroplanes by which Enoch, the seventh from Adam and Christ, ascended to the seventh heaven through the \"hole in the sky\" at D. He pays your hotel bill when he returns to earth through your own smoke hole and Jerusalem's gate to heaven by your own line of \"right ascension\" through astronomical, physical and material heavens. One talent, two talents and five talents must all be doubled by a glorified character garment when the twelfth hour circle containing the buffa'o skull sign gives you the man hired.\nGOD'S PLAN. Man proposes, but God disposes by the pattern of Nature and Revelations.\n\nThe following outline of Bible reading is suggestive and should be followed by pointing to the enlarged charts and new school globe complete. Follow the outlines and descriptions by pointing to charts as indicated. No one should object to the Bible descriptions read while one points to the forms described. Avoid scientific analogies that lead to debate of offence. Use these in all Bible classes and day schools, etc. Enlarge the references. Use the box light in the 12 foot room. Change from plain to solid geometry as shown in 7 eyes (at horn II). Also by 12 feet, perspective corners of cube layer on a clock face of 12 signs, for Zodiac, throwing another circle over the poles of the earth. You are ready to supply the maps on to a cube box with 8 corners 45 degrees from pole. Rev. 22:16\u20141, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things in the churches. And he showed me a pure river of Life, clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and the Lamb (at A).\n\nGen. 2:10\u2014And a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted in four heads (at D axis).\n\n3:24\u2014And He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword (of gravitation) which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of everlasting life.\n\nMythology engravings name these rivers at 45 degrees from the four cardinal points on the cube corners of the earth.\n\nRev. 7:1\u2014I saw four angels stand on the 4 corners of the earth.\n\nMark 14:48\u2014I will destroy this temple (3 and 5) made by hands and within 3 days I will build another made without hands (above A).\n\n62\u2014Ye shall see the Son of Man sitting (in 6) on the right hand of power, dull image at 7) of power and coming in the clouds of heaven. (This is Stevens vate rent.) I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God (No. 6).\n\nWhen the image of God is placed at A, I read of Moses seeing God's hinder part and all the universe is on his right. I, as God (thus) manifested made he hands (going to all). We have a building of God, a house not made by hands (in) eternal (day) in the heavens (above A). \"We know not the form we then shall wear.\" Spirits take any form they like beyond all formalities. We cannot confine spirit to form, so the second commandment (not to make no image) (on A). \"What man by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature.\" Let the thoughtful one that scoffs at the patterns try his hand fitting the square to correspond to two or four elevations. He will have to deduct heart love or head center and double one of them. Baalams ass horoscope also shows the same limitation in his head as well as skeleton. God says to man and oceans\u2014\"Thus far shalt thou go and no farther.\"\n\nRev. 21:16\u2014(This is John's holy cubical city). The\n\nHabak 2:2\u2014Write the vision and make it plain upon tablets that he may run that readeth it.\n\n3\u2014For the vision is yet for an appointed time (1919), but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tarry wait for it, because it will surely come; it will not tarry.\n\n11\u2014For the stones shall cry out of the wall and a beam out of the\u680b (corner) shall answer.\n\n14\u2014For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the deep.\n\nZephias 3:9\u2014For then will I turn to the people a pure language (universal) that they may serve him with one consent.\n\n11\u2014And thou (Christians and Jews) shall no more be haughty because of my holy mountain (No. 6).\n\n12\u2014I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted poor people, that they may trust in the name of the Lord.\n\nHaggai 2:16\u2014Doubt thou not and let thy foreskin be uncovered.

Mr. Meighen -\n\nWith reference to the attached communication from Mr. W. H. P. Saunders, of New Richmond, Wisconsin, I beg to state that the nomination of teachers in our Indian day schools rests with the authorities of the churches under whose auspices they are conducted. I note that Mr. Saunders has communicated with the head of the Oblate Order. There may occur some vacancy for which they will recommend him; it is also possible that they may find employment for him in the boarding or industrial schools. The staffs of these institutions are appointed directly by the church.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nFebruary 7th, 1941.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. McLean -\n\nWith reference to our conversation with the delegates from the Grand Council this morning, I beg to say that there are 77 day schools in operation in Ontario and at 15 of these nominations are made by the churches.

It was pointed out to the delegation that the Indians should avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the Department for the education of their children.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that provision has been made in the appropriations for Indian education for the fiscal year 1921-22 for the following increases in pupilage in various Indian residential schools:\n\nSt. Albert Boarding increased from 30 to 90 pupils\nThunderchild \" \" \" 50 to 90 \"\nFort Alexander \" \" \" 50 to 76 \"\nBeaverlodge \" \" \" 50 to 60 \"\nOnion Lake C.E. \" \" \" 33 to 36 \"\nKesora \" \" \" 60 to 70 \"\nFort Frances \" \" \" 60 to 70 \"\nPortage la Prairie \" \" \" 80 to 90 \"\nCross Lake Boarding \" \" \" 80 to 90 \"\nMuscowequan \" \" \" 50 to 60 \"\n\nPer capita grant for the increased number will be paid from April 1, 1921, and the Indian agents concerned have been advised accordingly and instructed to assist the principals in recruiting pupils to the number for whom grant is allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

September 16, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nAs you are aware, the Department desires to supply to the Indian schools in British Columbia, the same text books, etc., as are used in the provincial white schools.\n\nThe British Columbia Department of Education has recently furnished us with a list of the authorized text books for that province but they did not make any reference in their list to the drawing and writing books used. I would be pleased if you would state the authorized writing and drawing books for British Columbia schools, also the name of the firm from whom these can be purchased. I might say that in the majority of the requisitions from Indian schools the \"Natural Slant\" writing books are requested.\n\nThe Department also frequently receives requisitions from teachers of Indian schools for the \"Progressive road to reading\". This book is not mentioned on the list furnished by the British Columbia Department of Education, and I would be pleased if you would state if this is an authorized text book and also furnish the name of the publisher and the cost per copy.\n\nI trust that you will be able to furnish the information asked for in this letter as soon as possible, in order that the Department will be in a position to deal intelligently with all requisitions received from the schools in British Columbia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(revised) to provide these books at the date promised, it was impossible to complete the Courses of Study before the opening of the schools on the 6th of September. Gemmell's Canadian History, which has also been revised, and the Arithmetic will be available for distribution at an early date. These books will be issued to those pupils only who were advanced to the Intermediate or Senior Grade at the beginning of this term.\n\nThe author of the New Writing System has made provision for Certificates and Diplomas as follows:-\n\n(a) Grade Certificates for pupils of all grades up to the Entrance Class.\n(b) Senior Certificate for Entrance Class pupils.\n(c) Advanced Certificate for High School students, Normal School Students and Teachers.\n(d) High Honour Diploma presented annually to the class sending in the best Muscular Movement Writing. Seven of these diplomas will be granted to the public schools this year -- three for the classes of the Junior Grade, two for the Intermediate, and two for the Senior. One will be granted to the best penmanship class in the High Schools of the Province.\n\nAll Certificates and Diplomas above mentioned will be awarded for the first time in May, 1922. Further particulars will be given direct by the author at a later date.\n\n(e) Teacher's Diploma. This is granted to teachers who complete successfully the Teachers' Correspondence Course. Full particulars of this Free Course for Teachers will be given on application to Mr. H. B. Maclean, Provincial Normal School, Vancouver, B. C. The object of this Course is to improve the personal training of the teachers of the Province and to give them personal training in the technique and pedagogy of the new Writing Course.\n\nS. J.

In schools of the older settled parts of the province, the Department has been fairly successful in securing qualified teachers, but it has sometimes met with difficulties in doing so in schools situated on the reserves in outlying districts. In these latter cases, it has been found impracticable to insist upon teachers having certificates in all cases. The qualifications of teachers in Indian schools vary, some having no professional qualifications and others having certificates of the highest standard. Many of the teachers who have no professional qualifications have, however, had long experience and have met with a great measure of success in Indian school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

advancement in each year.*\nThis important feature of Canadian Education is, as already mentioned, the concern of the Dominion Government. What corresponds to a Department of Education exists as a branch of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa with a Superintendent of Indian Education at its head. As the Indian population of Canada exceeds 100,000, it will be seen that the task of this Education branch would be equal to that of one of the provinces of Canada even if this population were collected in one province, but the scattered condition of this population and the specialized nature of the work among it places the task beyond comparison with that of such a province. It should be mentioned at the outset that the Indians in each province are educated according to the curriculum, textbooks, etc., of that province, so that there is a basis of comparison between the status of Indian Education and that of the education of whites in the province.\n\nEducation among the Indians in Canada, especially in Lower Canada and the Western part of Nova Scotia, was carried on at a very early date by the French, chiefly through the efforts of the Jesuits and other orders. As these efforts will be discussed in more or less detail in connection with the movements in education in each province, it will not be necessary to describe them here.\n\nThe needs of the North American Indians were first drawn to the attention of the English people by tracts published by John Eliot, who came to the country in 1631. The effect of these tracts, and of the work among Indians by Eliot upon Cromwell and others and upon the Long Parliament was such that in 1649 an ordinance was passed enacting that there should be a corporation in England consisting of sixteen persons to be called \"The President and Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England\" with power to acquire lands, goods and money. A general collection was directed to be made in England and Wales for the purposes of the corporation and the equivalent of nearly \u00a360,000 was forthwith obtained. The Society at once appointed Commissioners and a Treasurer in New England who with income obtained from the corporation paid itinerant missionaries and school teachers among the natives. It is important to mention this Society at the outset, as considerable reference will be made to it in discussing the education of the provinces, especially the\nolder provinces of Canada towards which it directed its efforts after the American Revolution and played a part not only in the education of the Indians, but in that of the white settlers as well. The corporation was conducted for some time under the ordinance, but after the Restoration, a new charter of incorporation was granted by Charles II in 1662 under which the company called now \"The New England Company\" still conducts its operations. In what is now Canada this company was preceded by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign parts who had catechists and school-masters appointed in the Bay of Quinte district and at the Grand River, but who yielded the field to the well-directed efforts of the New England Company. The distribution of the latter's invested funds has assisted materially in the education and development of the Six Nations Indians. Up to 1834 the whole of the clear rents and profits of the company's trust estates and funds was faithfully applied for the benefit of natives in Upper Canada and New Brunswick. Assistance by way of grant was also given to education in the district of Rupert's Land and in British Columbia where (at Lytton) there is still an industrial school under the supervision of the company. The most productive work, however, was performed in Upper Canada at Rice and Mud Lakes and at the Six Nations Reserves, the latter place absorbing most of the funds and attention of the company. Day-schools, missionaries and an institution for the instruction of pupils in residence, which is still in a flourishing condition, have contributed very largely to the present advanced position of the Six Nations Indians.\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodists also have contributed and are still contributing largely to Indian Education. In 1829 these had eight day schools with 251 scholars in Upper Canada conducted under the direction of missionaries from New York State. Before long Wesleyan missionaries from Great Britain were in the field and a residential school near Belleville was operated at the expense of the British Wesleyan Conference. This school developed into an industrial school at Alderville, erected in 1848, and the Mount Elgin Institute, erected in 1851, was founded by the same Society. To establish and maintain these schools, the Indians consented to set apart one quarter of the amount received in commutation of their annual distribution of ammunition. This contribution had begun in\nand ended in 1862. At that time the annual payment of $6,879.75 had served to meet the expenses of conducting the schools and there remained $36,208.74. The Alderville buildings were burned in 1861 and not rebuilt, but the Mount Elgin Institute still survives. Both institutions were supported by an annual per capita grant for each pupil in attendance.\n\nWhen the attention of the British Government was called to the condition of the Indians in Canada, the status of those in Lower Canada was so high as to render effort there less necessary than elsewhere. In 1842 there were about 3,727 known to the government not including the hunting tribes of the Northern nation. This population was scattered between the seven permanent settlements and ministered to by the priests of the Roman Catholic Church. A school was established by Protestants at Chateauguay in 1829 where education included manual training. An agricultural school and experimental farm was established soon after at Christierville near St. Johns and the pupils were transferred there from Chateauguay.\n\nA scheme for civilizing the Chippewas and Ottawas of Lake Huron and Manitowaning, the first government attempt in Upper Canada to improve the condition of the Indians by direct instruction given to the whole community, proved a failure. Workshops and schools under the scheme were flourishing in 1844, but by 1845 all signs of progress had vanished. The experiment was not repeated until the modern policy of instruction in farming was instituted by the Dominion Government and spread to the Western tribes in 1879.\n\nThe first treaty with the Indians was formed by Lord Selkirk in 1811 and its sphere comprised nearly all the original province of Manitoba, a part of Saskatchewan and also of Dakota, Minnesota and New Ontario. In consequence of the discovery of minerals on the shores of Lakes Huron and Superior the Government of what was then called Canada deemed it desirable to extinguish the Indian title and in 1850 entrusted negotiations with the Indians to Hon. William Robinson who made two treaties which shaped the course of future treaties. The main features of the Robinson treaties were annuities, reserves for the Indians and liberty to fish and hunt on the unceded domain of the Crown. The number of Indians included in these treaties was about 2,700. In 1862 another treaty was made by Hon.\nWilliam McDougall, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, with the Indians on Great Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron. Eleven other treaties have been made with the Indians between the Great Lakes and the Rockies. A treaty in 1871 was made with the Indians in Manitoba providing for an annuity to each Indian reserve of about 640 acres for each family of five or 128 acres for each man, woman and child and an annual allowance of ammunition, seed grain, agricultural implements, etc. Schools were also to be established on the Reserves. The half breed was also given a scrip of 240 acres. The Sioux Indians being refugees from the United States were not given annuities, but were granted reserves and some help to start farming.\n\nThe last treaty was made in 1921 to protect the Indians from the results of the oil rush and covered the Mackenzie River District. No treaty has been made with the Indians of British Columbia, but their welfare has received no less attention on that account. The effects of these treaties and of the British North America Act have been to make the Indians minors and wards of the Dominion Government which is responsible for their education. It is worth observing that while Indians, with special exceptions such as those who served in the Great war, are without the franchise, those of them who qualify for the professions are ipso facto enfranchised.\n\nAt the making of the treaty of 1871, the provision made for education was understood to be day schools on the reserves. For a number of years this was the only system adopted. At present the Indian schools are divided into three classes: (1) Day schools situated on the reserves; (2) Boarding schools situated on the reserves or nearby; (3) Industrial or non-reservation schools. As the name indicates, the industrial school educates along industrial lines in addition to literary education. The same is true of the boarding school. Special attention is paid to the manual arts, domestic science, agriculture, and the training proceeds until the age of eighteen in the case of boys. For those who desire it the Government has provided a special reserve at Balcarres, Saskatchewan, where a boy graduate of an industrial school is given eighty acres of land and help in starting to farm. If he makes good, another eighty acres, and in some cases more, is given him. Crop returns indicate that the experiment is successful. A female graduate may be given a sewing machine or household furniture.\nMany graduates enter the general labour market and a few the professions. Field matrons are employed upon many of the reserves, their salaries being sometimes paid by the government, but usually by the church to which they belong. These, in addition to caring for the sick, instruct women in household duties. The Government provides medical attendance for the pupils in industrial schools and for nearly all the Indian people on large reserves or where a large number of smaller reserves can be reached by one physician. Hospitals are built and equipped sometimes by the Government and sometimes by the church interested, the Government usually rendering financial assistance to the latter.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, established in 1873 under the Minister of the Interior, who is also Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, controls the educational movement and conducts it either directly or by assisting the efforts of the various churches. The spirit of cooperation between these churches\u2014Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodists, Presbyterian and Salvation Army\u2014and the government in the work is admirable. It would probably be sufficiently close to the truth to say that the churches are the \"School districts\" or \"Sections\" that is, the local organization in Indian Education while the Government is the \"Department\". The Government pays a grant and certain amounts for capital expenditure, supervises the manner in which this grant is expended and insists upon properly qualified teachers, proper accommodation, equipment, recognized courses of study, in short sees that the education and care of the Indians measure up to a certain standard. In the case of \"undenominational\" schools the Government bears the whole cost and this is the only sense in which these schools may be said to be non-denominational; in the case of denominational schools, the church interested bears a portion of the expenditure. The churches on the other hand select the teachers in all the industrial and boarding schools and in most cases nominate the teachers in the day schools and carry on the work of education, and, in the cases of boarding and industrial schools, clothe and feed the Indian pupil throughout the year for eleven years. Appropriations by the Dominion Parliament for Indian Education in 1921 amounted to $1,112,410, of which $168,994 was expended on day schools, $601,969 on boarding schools and $269,249 on industrial schools, while $2,934 was expended\non ex pupils. Several bands of Indians assist in the work, and during the fiscal year 1921 the sum of $47,297 was available from this source, $13,485 of this being contributed by the Six Nations of Grand River.\n\nA total number of 326 schools were in operation in 1921, comprising 255 day, 58 boarding and 15 industrial schools. Of the schools, 53 day and one industrial were undenominational; 87 day, 32 boarding and 8 industrial or 127 in all were under the direction of the Roman Catholic Church; 71 day, 16 boarding and 5 industrial or 90 in all, of the Church of England; 38 day, 5 boarding and 3 industrial, or 46 in all, of the Methodists; 3 day and 5 boarding, of the Presbyterians and 1 day school, of the Salvation Army. In these schools there were 12,558 pupils, 7,775 being in day schools, 3,156 in boarding schools and 1,627 in industrial schools. In addition to these about 100 are being educated in public and private residential schools throughout the Dominion besides a number attending high schools.\n\nThe Indian day schools in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are inspected semi-annually by the provincial public and separate school inspectors. In New Brunswick and British Columbia Indian schools are inspected by officials appointed by the department. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the North-west Territories the schools are inspected by the inspectors for the different Indian agencies, but inspection by Department of Education inspectors in the Prairie Provinces is now under consideration. In addition to the inspectors almost all the schools are under the supervision of the different Indian agents who are required to make monthly inspections and reports.\n\nIt has been already stated that in the literary training of Indian pupils the curriculum of the province in which they are situated is strictly followed. The statistics of the standing of these pupils at school are given by \"Standards\", Stand I corresponding to First Reader, Part I or Grade I; Standard II, to First Reader, Part II or Grade II; Standard III to Second Reader or Grades III and IV; Standard IV to Third Reader or Grades V and VI; Standard V to Fourth Reader or Grades VII and VII and Standard VI to Fifth Reader or Grades IX and X. The statistics given below for the last mentioned Standard will also include those above that Standard.\nTo show the growth of the movements the following tables from the\nReports of the Department of Indian Affairs give various statistics of\nIndian schools for a few years back.\nIt will be quite in order to make any changes in the enclosed you may think fit and I shall be very grateful for any further suggestions you may be good enough to offer.\n\nM.C.M.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Education\nEducating the Indian\n\nTwelve Thousand Indian Children Attending School in Canada\n\nThere were 12,584 Indian children attending Indian schools throughout the Dominion during the past year, of which number somewhat larger portion were girls. According to the annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs there were 326 Indian schools in operation, 297 day, 50 boarding and 15 industrial. This shows a net increase of five schools over the previous year. The total enrolment in the day schools was 7,775; in the boarding schools 3,156, and in the industrial schools 1,653. The average attendance in the three classes of schools was 8,723, an increase of 1,094 over the previous year.\n\nThe course of study is that prescribed for the provincial, public and separate schools and is strictly adhered to.\n\nLand for farming and gardening purposes as provided at practically all the reservations. The pupils are thus enabled to get a general knowledge of agriculture. The granting of assistance to graduates is being continued. Upon leaving school an Indian girl may be given a sewing machine or other gift, while a boy may receive a grant of cattle, horses, implements, harness or building material. During the year under review 24 girls and 11 boy pupils were assisted to the extent of $2,933.84.\n\nThe outlay in Indian education from parliamentary appropriation during the year amounted to $1,112,409.65, of which $18,000 was for the province of British Columbia and $208,000 in Ontario.\nThis was prepared the incorporated into a memo to the Minister.\n\nR.J.F.\n\nOttawa, February 14, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION\n\nRecapitulation.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs had, during the past fiscal year, 326 schools in Canada, caring for the educational needs of 12,588 Indian children. 253 day schools situated on reserves had an enrolment of 7775 pupils, and there were in 73 residential schools 4783 of our wards. In addition, some 50 neglected Indian children have been placed in orphanages and about 120 promising pupils are receiving tuition in provincial public schools, colleges and in universities. The total expenditure from parliamentary appropriation was $1,112,409.65. Certain Indian bands in Ontario have contributed, during the same year, $47,296.53 towards the education of their children.\n\nCooperation with the various churches in Canada is the feature of our Indian educational work, and all residential schools and four fifths of the day schools are under the auspices of the Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist and Presbyterian churches. The expenditure for Indian Education is augmented, roughly 20% by these religious denominations. In addition, the wards of the Department receive a moral stimulus that undenominational schools would not impart.\n\nThe greater number of teachers engaged are professionally qualified and the work compares favourably with that in white schools similarly situated. The course of studies followed is that of the Department of Education for the province in which the school is located. The general plan is to have all classroom activities supervised by the Public and Separate School Inspectors.\nINDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nMaritime Provinces.\n\n24 day schools, all under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, meet the educational requirements of the Indian children in the three Maritime Provinces. The enrolment for these schools is 552. Special instruction is being given in sewing, hygiene and sanitation. About 50 children are attending white schools or have been placed in orphanages. The total expenditure involved is $23,542.30.\nONTARIO & QUEBEC\n\nIndian Education.\n\nIn Ontario and Quebec gardening and school fairs are emphasized in the 110 day schools under the Department of Indian Affairs. For these and the 11 residential schools in Ontario, there is a total enrolment of 4924. In addition, 106 Indian children are attending white schools, collegiates, or have been placed in orphanages. The expenditure for the last fiscal year was $264,814.32. Certain bands in Ontario augmented this by a contribution to education of $47,296.53.\nPRAIRIE PROVINCES AND NORTHWEST TERRITORIES\n\nIndian Education.\n\nWest of the Great Lakes the residential school has been more successful for our Indian wards than the day school on the reserve, due to the nomadic habits of the bands. There are in the Prairie Provinces 71 day and 44 residential schools, with a total enrolment of 4843. The Department has placed emphasis on farming, care of stock and domestic instruction. The expenditure for the past fiscal year was $498,241.41.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nIndian Education.\n\n40 day and 17 residential schools care for the education of 2393 Indian children in British Columbia. The residential school is the more successful type and endeavours to teach a smattering of fruit farming and basketry, in addition to the regular vocational and domestic instruction. During the past fiscal year $318,042.58 was expended.\nYUKON\n\nIndian Education.\n\nIn the Yukon the Department has 4 day and 1 residential schools, catering to 146 Indian pupils. Another residential school at Dawson is coming under the auspices of the Department of Indian Affairs at the time of this writing. The total expenditure for the past fiscal year was $7769.02.\nParis, Ontario,\nMarch 28, 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould the Department be willing to furnish me with information as to the average salary of teachers in Ontario in 1920 or 1921? I would greatly appreciate a statement of the average salaries of teachers in day schools, in boarding schools, and in industrial schools. Such a comparison would be instructive. In this same connection I beg to ask if the qualifications, academic and professional, of teachers in industrial schools and in boarding schools, are higher on the average than the qualifications of teachers in day schools.\n\nHoping that the Department will grant the information requested,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nElmo J. Macdonald\nParis, Ontario,\nMar. 27, 1922\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been unable to find in any of the reports of the Department of Indian Affairs a statement of the course actually authorized for industrial schools (Indian). It is also my impression that a course of study for day, boarding, and industrial schools was drawn up by the Department but that a few years ago this course of study was amended by the provincial councils? Why? If this is so, please inform me when this change was made. Also please refer me to a source of information regarding the course of study authorized for industrial schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nElmo J. Morrison\nOTTAWA, April 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo requesting to be informed as to the average salary paid teachers in Indian day, boarding and industrial schools in Ontario.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary allowed depends upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses. The salary scale ranges from $500 to $800 per annum in the day schools, plus a bonus of $150 during the past fiscal year. Bonus at this rate has been paid teachers since April 1, 1918. We are not aware at the present time as to whether this bonus will be provided by law for the fiscal year beginning today.\n\nThe salaries of teachers in boarding and industrial schools are paid by the church authorities under whose auspices these schools are conducted. These salaries are paid from the per capita grant, and are set by the church authorities themselves.\n\nTeachers in boarding and industrial schools possess, generally speaking, the same qualifications as are required in day schools, and these correspond with the qualifications required in the provincial public and separate schools.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo, I beg to say that the course of studies prescribed for Indian schools is the same as that used in the provincial schools of the provinces in which the Indian schools are located. You can obtain the course of studies authorized for the provincial schools from the Department of Education for the respective provinces.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nElmer Jamieson, Esq.,\nParis,\nOnt.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nParis, Ontario\nApril 5, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of April 1st requesting information as to salaries of teachers in the different classes of schools has been received.\n\nI sincerely desire to see the course of study which was prescribed for, and followed by, Indians schools, previous to the adoption of Provincial curricula, and to know when the change was made. Can you supply the information or refer me to a source of information?\n\nThanking you for information supplied I remain\n\nYours Truly,\n\nElmo J. Johnson\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOTTAWA, April 10th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with further reference to the course of studies prescribed for Indian schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are mailing you, under separate cover, a copy of the Daily Register of Attendance, on the back cover of which you will find the course of studies used in Indian schools previous to the time when the provincial course of studies was made obligatory. I may say that the change in the curricula was gradual, and it is only within the past two years that we have adopted the provincial course in all the provinces in Canada. As you were informed, the studies prescribed for Indian schools is now the same as that used in the provincial schools of the province in which the Indian schools are located. This change has been spread over the last five years, and was made mainly in order that we could utilize to the fullest extent the services of the provincial school inspectors in the inspection of our Indian schools, and also to obtain more readily the textbooks required.\n\nI understand that you are preparing a thesis, which, in the main, relates to Indian education and I would be very pleased, at a later date, to have a copy if you will be good enough to furnish me with the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nElmer Jamieson, Esq.,\nParis, Ont.\nApril 17, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire further information concerning the operation of Indian schools. Do how many reserves are compulsory school attendance laws enforced? Would not the demonstration of control practices interfere with a compulsory application of compulsory attendance laws?\n\nAwaiting your information.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nOttawa, April 24, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 17th instant, in which you request certain information in connection with the operation of the Compulsory Education clause of the Indian Act.\n\nIn reply to your question - on how many reserves are compulsory school attendance laws enforced? - I beg to state that from time to time it has been found advisable to put this clause of the Act in force. Whenever day school activities are more or less abortive, due to non-attendance, this Department takes steps to insist upon the presence in the classroom of those Indian children who should attend. The agents employed are known as truant officers. We may appoint an Indian to this position, or, in extremities, a R.C.M.P. officer. When the good attendance warrants such action, the services of the truant officers are frequently dispensed with. Often the persuasive powers of an Indian agent are sufficient to enforce the Act, and you will see that it is quite impossible for me to intimate the number of reserves where compulsion has been used. Whenever school facilities are provided, and the attendance is poor, this Department is prepared to take steps to keep the classrooms full.\n\nYour query concerning the denomination control interfering with the application of the Compulsory Attendance clause involves matters of policy which this Department is not prepared to discuss. I can inform you that, as a rule, the influence of the Church on the reserve is a power for good in connection with any departmental activity. You will understand that it is not possible for me to discuss this last matter at any length.\n\nThis Department would be grateful for a little more information concerning the nature of your thesis. If it is for publication, I feel that you should make an effort to get into personal touch with some of the officials of the Department. If it is an academic thesis, such as for Master's degree, it is not so essential that you are guarded in your remarks when referring to matters of policy. I will be personally pleased to see you at Brantford during the last few days of this week, and I feel that an hour of conversation would give you more information than a score of letters. If you would care to write to me, care of the Mohawk Institute, or telephone there on Thursday, Friday or Saturday (the 27th to 29th) I could give you an interview.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRussell T.

Scott, F.R.C.S.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are under the impression that your Department supplies the various Indian schools throughout Canada a certain number of suitable newspapers and magazines. We would very much appreciate it indeed if you would advise us if your Department would favorably consider placing the English publications known as \"Children's Newspaper\" and \"My Magazine\" sample copies of which we are sending you personally under separate cover. If you will examine these you will find that they are by far the finest young people's publications issued in the English Language. They have an enormous sale and the subscription price, including postage are respectively $2.75 and $3.25.\n\nWe are also anxious to handle the subscriptions you place for this Department. Our parent house has been in business since 1809, and we can, we assure you, handle your order to your entire satisfaction. At the present time we supply very many of the larger libraries and Departments, etc., with all of their technical, literary, and other publications, and we can refer you to some of the largest libraries in Canada.\n\nMay we not have the pleasure of hearing from you on this subject soon? We would very much appreciate it indeed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWM.

We pay the schools per capita grant only, for their maintenance. From this grant, they purchase all supplies - including papers and magazines - which they require. We are, therefore, not in a position to place an order for the newspaper and magazine mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Wm.

Soon after, the news of the discovery of this new continent was spread broadcast throughout Europe. European adventurers began to filter into the continent at first by tens, and later by hundreds. These Europeans came from countries which had been enjoying the fruits of civilization for centuries. Savagery had been dethroned and in its place were to be found educational systems, improved agricultural methods, merchant marines, governments, improved weapons of warfare, epoch-making inventions, a high state of industrial development, a Christianity, a science, a literature. The savage Redmen fought fiercely to retain their hunting grounds, but slowly they were pushed to the frontiers. They were outnumbered, out-fought, and out-generalled by the superior Europeans. These brought with them their culture, art, and ideals. European civilization was no longer confined to Europe, but was extended to the newly discovered continent.\n\nIndustrial and social development was very rapid and a wilderness was transformed into productive farms, villages grew into towns, and towns into industrial cities, in an incredible short time. Had the Redmen been transferred directly to England or to France, their maladjustment would not have been much less. True, they still had the plains but they could not roam over them so freely. They still had the rivers, but steamers now glided up and down these streams. It was a conflict between savagery and civilization, and a decisive victory for civilization was inevitable.\n\nCanada very early discerned the plight of the Redmen. They saw that they must be helped to adapt themselves to the changed and changing order of things. A laissez-faire policy may have been pursued and from this policy the fittest would have survived. How many would have survived is another question. Canada, however, saw fit to extend a helping hand.\n\nAt first Indian affairs were placed under the control of the Imperial military authorities. During the period of this military control (1763-1841) Canada was engaged in warfare and her people were scattered far and wide throughout the country. Canada naturally looked upon the Indians as potential allies or foes. Gradually, however, as settlement of the country increased and peace was once more restored, efforts to civilize, educate, and christianize, were substituted for the policy which was dictated by considerations of fear and self-interest. This gradual change of policy marked the second period of Indian affairs (1841-1867). The period from 1867 to the present time constitutes the period of control by the Dominion Government and since 1880 a Department of Indian affairs has had charge of problems relating to Indians.\n\nThe end toward which the Indians of Canada are being educated is full British citizenship. The Department of Indian Affairs has not wavered from this policy, although the method of executing this policy has been modified somewhat in adaptation to changing conditions. The problem is the citizenizing of the Indians in their settled communities or bands. The essential idea in full\ncitizenship is that of self-support. The Indians must progress from a position of dependency or of being wards, to a position of self-maintenance. They must learn, in addition, to cooperate in all legitimate activities, and to participate intelligently in the activities of the different institutions of the country. Psychologically, they must develop a social consciousness not opposed, but paralleling, the social consciousness of the assimilating group in order that they may become socially efficient.\n\nThe difficulties that lie in the way of the attainment of this goal of full citizenship are not a few and not insignificant. Discussion of some of the difficulties will lead to a proper appreciation of the task.\n\nRight at the beginning the Government had to grapple with the problem of organization. In a large country like Canada, to organize a people unaccustomed in a great measure to co-operative action in time of peace, for purposes of control, protection, and education demanded patience, firmness, and tact. Finally, however, the Indians were settled in bands on lands set aside by the Government and known as \"Indian Reserves\". Just in this connection it may be stated that since 1763, the title of an individual Indian in fee simple to land reserved to band or tribe has not been recognized except in the case of enfranchised Indians. The Indians are educated on these closed reserves, and they are permitted to sell any surplus land only to the crown, as direct purchase by white persons is prohibited.\n\nAt present there are scattered throughout Canada from Nova Scotia to British Columbia over 630 bands comprising in all about 105,000 Indians. To oversee, protect and educate these scattered bands adequately is the Department's task. There is a geographical difficulty arising from the scattered positions of the bands. This geographical difficulty has been partly overcome by the appointment of Government agents who reside near the reserve or reserves. Travelling superintendents and inspectors supervise the work of these Indian agents. It is evident from the nature of the difficulty that a great responsibility is placed upon these Indian agents. The Indian Department makes known its wishes to the Indians through its agents and the Indians make known their wishes to the Department through the same medium. The Agent acts as the representative of the Indian Department. Although this system which has been adopted is effective, yet the handicap arising from this geographical difficulty remains.\n\nIf there were any uniformity among the bands, in the number of people who constitute the different bands, in their languages or dialects, in their religions or aboriginal beliefs, in the sizes of the reserves upon which they live, and in their stages of progress, the task would be greatly simplified. But the greatest diversity exists. Among the 630 bands supervised by 114 agents a large number of languages or dialects are spoken. The largest band has a membership of about 5,000 people and the smallest, 3 or 4. The areas of the reserves vary from a few hundred acres to thousands of acres. Some bands in the older sections of the country have reached a stage in their advancement equal to that attained by progressive white people. Other bands,\nsituated on the outposts of civilization still live in the same kind of tepees as their forefathers lived in, and still wear the same kind of clothing as their ancestors wore. Between the most advanced bands and the most backward are other bands in different stages of progress. In religion, many bands are composed wholly of Roman Catholics while others are predominantly Church of England. There are Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, and Congregationalists. Paganism in its many forms still exists even on the most progressive reserves. Probably no two bands could be found where circumstances and conditions were the same, and where problems called for identical methods for solution. Most comprehensive principles for guidance in the method of treatment are necessary amidst such great diversity of conditions.\n\nBut the centre of interest is the Indian himself. It is here that the real problem is found. His changed and changing environment has wrought transformation on his physical appearance, in his ways of thinking, in his attitude toward his fellow-men, and in his conception of religion. His skin is not so copper coloured now. His eyes may be blue and his hair may be quite fair. The full-blooded Indian is fast disappearing. Legally a man may be an Indian although he may have only a trace of native blood. So long as his descent has been through the male line he is, by law, an Indian. But an Indian woman, by marrying a white man, relinquishes her legal status as an Indian, and her children are white also. In dress, he is discarding the buckskin, beads, and feathers and is quite content to clothe himself like the white men.\n\nBut perhaps the most striking effect of his environment has been made upon his way of thinking, and upon his habits of doing. It is probably true that at least among the early Indian tribes who lived upon a physical plane rather than upon an intellectual plane, their modes of doing determined their ways of thinking, and as their intellectual life developed, their intellectual activities were coloured by their motor activities. The early tribes depended for their existence upon the chase and upon their success in warfare. The wild animals which they hunted moved from place to place according to their instincts. Climatic conditions, ever changing, attracted and repulsed these roving animals from place to place. Hunting expeditions never set out without ceremonial invocations to their gods for success. In warfare there was the same uncertainty, the same dependence upon pure chance. In sickness, they called upon their mysterious medicine man who, by magic, drove the evil spirits away. There was no attempt to get at the cause of things. Occurrences which they could not explain were at once set down as the works of supernatural beings. This ignorance of the laws of nature and their dependance upon the operation of these laws for their very existence bred in this aboriginal people a superstitious temper of mind which determined in a large measure their mode of living. Education is dispelling superstition and their mode of living is being governed more and more by their knowledge of cause and effect. They have learned, for instance, that sickness is caused by the improper functioning or loss of functioning\nof some organ of the body and they call upon a doctor who is in the best position to determine the cause and the cure for the sickness. Medicine men are gradually retreating to the farthest reserves, and soon they will disappear altogether from the scene.\n\nThe Indian tribe in its primitive state pursued the path of least resistance. No determined or sustained effort was made to control circumstances or conditions. The behaviour of the tribe was largely determined by external conditions. True, the head chief exercised a certain amount of authority over the members of the tribe, but this authority was most evident, and most respected on hunting expeditions and in warfare, and the discipline within the tribe then was largely a discipline of fear, or a discipline arising from the instinctive desire for commendation. Social consciousness was an insignificant factor in this inculcation of discipline. When their food supply was ample, and their enemies were far away, idleness and festivals prevailed. If food became scarce on account of unproductive soil or scarcity of game, the remedy was migration to more favourable hunting grounds. Competition among the members, outside of competition for skill in the hunt, or for bravery in warfare or for wisdom and eloquence in council, was almost entirely absent. The food obtained was distributed throughout the tribe, and the soil of the whole continent was theirs. Accumulation of material wealth was unnecessary. Even large stores of food were unknown, for game was plentiful on the continent, and the tribes were virtually living from hand to mouth. Contentment prevailed if there was food for the immediate present, and the provision of food was left to the future. Necessity fell upon the tribe only when inveterate enemies were lurking near. Then, bravery, danger of death, grim determination and revenge, animated every member of the tribe to disciplined endeavour. Choice lay between discipline and annihilation and the instinct for self-preservation was strong. When they had defeated the enemy, or had attained safety by flight, inactivity once more prevailed in the tribe. In warfare the voice of necessity was insistent but in peace it was silent. Therefore discipline was lacking in the peaceful pursuits of the tribe. Nor could these conditions fail to be impressed upon the children. Disciplinary training of children was never attempted in a systematic way. The people of the forests and plains loved their freedom, and they were averse to deny that same freedom to their children. Corporal punishment was almost unknown. There were these conditions. A people, roving from place to place, living virtually from hand to mouth, and enjoying the freedom made possible by prolific nature, were comparatively free from the necessity of disciplinary training, except in the event of tribal warfare.\n\nSome of the most difficult problems in connection with the education of the Indians toward full citizenship arise from the transmission of traits developed by primitive conditions from generation to generation. Compulsion in any form has terrors for the Indians. They resent it with vigor. Before a compulsory law can be made effective, and can be enforced without\nmuch friction among Indians, they must understand that such compulsory law is absolutely necessary for the furtherance of their interests, and it is only fair to state that the bands in the older sections of the country have gone a long way towards recognizing the necessity for compulsory laws. But in some cases, resentment at trespass on traditional freedom has become so habitual that objection is made to compulsory laws mainly because they are compulsory. In the history of the development of societies, it has been found that compulsory laws are enacted by social communities where the need for such compulsory laws is felt by the majority of the members of this social community. In the meantime some harm may have resulted from the absence of these compulsory laws. Clearly Indian communities have had this advantage, that necessary compulsory laws have been enacted from without by a more highly developed community.\n\nThe Indian parents dislike compulsion from external sources, and they refrain as much as possible from using compulsion in the treatment of their children. An Indian missionary, who lived for over twenty years on a reserve, and had most favourable opportunities for observation, stated that in those twenty years of contact with Indians, he had yet to see an Indian parent chastising a child. Although this case is exceptional, let it be true that Indian parents are, as a rule quite lenient to their children. Former Deputy-Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Mr. J. A. Smart, stated, in speaking of Indian education, that \"Indian children not only possess this (natural aversion to monotonous work and confinement in schools) in its strongest form, but receive much sympathy from their parents, who dislike to compel their inclinations and to subject them to discipline, and the possibility of what (at any rate as far as the boys are concerned) they regard as the great indignity of personal chastisement.\" If disciplinary training is not a strong characteristic of Indian home life, then the task devolves upon the schools. Improvement, however, is taking place in the matter of the disciplinary training of children in Indian homes, and indulgent influences in home life do not now wholly destroy the work of the schools.\n\nThere still exist in Canada a number of nomadic bands of Indians. It is quite evident that nomadic tribes are under most serious disadvantages. Agriculture as an occupation is impossible among them. Regular school attendance of children belonging to nomadic bands is out of the question unless the children are placed in boarding or in industrial schools. However, this nomadic habit is now confined mainly to hunting tribes in remote districts and to tribes which move to lumbering camps during the winter. There are some bands situated in more settled portions of the country, many of whose members move off the reserve to flax fields, or fruit regions, for one or two months during the summer. But it is encouraging to note that this wandering, roving habit is rapidly disappearing, and just as quickly as roving tribes recognize the disadvantages of this mode of living, and see from experience and by example, the advantages of a settled habitation, will they discard this mode of living. The change has been gradual and will probably\ncontinue to be gradual.\n\nIt is not surprising, indeed it is to be expected, that a roving, freedom-loving people should lack an important requisite for success in modern society\u2014steadiness. It seems to be altogether against an Indian's inclinations to remain in one place or at one occupation for any length of time. Periodic changes in environment and in occupation come naturally to a people whose parents or grandparents or great-grandparents roamed the forests and plains of a whole continent in freedom. Whatever physical strength the Indian may possess, and whatever skill he may have for use in employment, is largely counteracted by this traditional feeling\u2014unsteadiness. Whether they are working for another, or whether they are working for themselves, they yield to their inclinations. Even at the present time, it may be stated that unsteadiness is an Indian failing, but to say that all Indians can be so characterized would be far from the truth. Gradual and continuous improvement can be noted in steadiness as education becomes more and more general among the bands.\n\nLove of freedom, resentment of compulsion, lack of disciplinary training, and unsteadiness do not exhaust the list of traits handed down from generation to generation. Truly primitive habits of thought and actions developed under primitive conditions have been transmitted with lavish hand. Their forefathers, numbered at approximately one half of a million, lived on a continent which now supports upwards of one hundred and twenty millions. Vegetation and animal life provided perpetual supplies of food for the roving aborigines, who therefore felt no necessity for provisions for the future. This lack of foresight for future needs still persists. Earnings of months are sometimes squandered in a few days. As soon as they have earned a sum of money, they discontinue work to spend. However, bank accounts are increasing, and their behaviour is marked by patient foresight concerning future needs. Of two alternatives, one providing cash almost immediately, the other necessitating patience for months before financial benefits are derived therefrom, Indians will very often choose the first even though the reward is smaller. But as stated above the Indians are improving in the matter of provision for future needs. If an Indian experiences discomfort for failure to look ahead, and sees comfort among those who are exercising foresight, the tendency is to adopt the more beneficial mode of living.\n\nThe Indians in their camps often surprised by sudden attacks from enemy tribes. In these attacks wholesale torture and massacre of men, women, and children took place, although usually the women and children were adopted into the tribe, or kept as ransom. Unsuspected by the tribe, enemy spies had lurked around the camp for days and nights and had ascertained their number. Perhaps these spies had gone about the camp openly, unrecognized by the tribe. The news had been carried back to the hostile tribe and a surprise attack had been planned. Naturally, the Indians became very suspicious. After the discovery of America unscrupulous traders and settlers practised all forms of deceit to obtain fertile land cheaply,\nto foment internal strife, or to befriend hostile tribes. Promises were made which were never carried out. Such condition of affairs did not at all tend to mitigate the already suspicious nature of the Indian. To-day, suspicion is a trait which has to be reckoned with in the management of Indian affairs. Well-intentioned purposes, unless supported by persuasive power, may fall by the wayside, discarded and forgotten because of suspicion.\n\nOther problems arising from the Indian's primitive or aboriginal habits present themselves. These will simply be mentioned but the brevity of the discussion must not be construed to mean that these problems are unimportant. As a matter of fact success in citizenizing the Indians of Canada depends in large measure upon an adequate method of solving the problems now to be mentioned. One of these problems is that of transforming the Indians into an agricultural class. Another is the christianizing of the Indians. As to the extent to which success has crowned the efforts of the churches and the Department in the solution of these vital problems, mention is reserved for a later section.\n\nThere are two later developments, psychological in character which must be mentioned at this point. One of these is the habit, especially prominent in older Indians, of looking back to former times. Pauline Johnson had that type in mind when she wrote in \"The Cattle Thief\":\n\n\"When you pay for the land you live in, we'll pay for the meat we eat.\nGive back our land and our country, give back our herds of game;\nGive back the furs and the forests that were ours before you came;\nGive back the peace and the plenty. Then come with your new belief,\nAnd blame, if you dare, the hunger that drove him to be a thief.\"\n\nThe problem here is the substitution of forward-mindedness for this habit of mind so inimical to progress. Each succeeding generation, however, looks more to the future as the time when realization of their destined end is to be found.\n\nBut the more pernicious of these later psychological developments in the Indian's character is that of expecting help from the Government. The origin of this development is not hard to locate. So deep-seated, or habitual has this way of thinking become that, in some cases, withholding of expected help is considered an infringement of rights. Such a temper of mind is bound to interfere with the exercise of initiative on the part of the Indians, and the sooner they learn to depend upon their own efforts, the more rapidly will they develop their native capacities in a direction that will make them self-supporting and useful citizens of Canada.\n\nAs to the moral problems we cannot do better than to quote former Deputy-Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nMr. J. A. Smart, who stated as follows in his Report for the fiscal year 1896, \"The enactment of special legislation recognizes the fact that the Indians require exceptional protection from their own natural fondness for strong drink, as well as from having temptation put in their way by unscrupulous miscreants whose lust of gain would outweigh every consideration of morality and humanity. While of course there are many exceptions, it may be said of the great majority of the Indians, that despite their natural proclivities, they would not go in quest of liquor if only left alone.\" Since the sale of intoxicating liquors to Indians has been illegal, and infractions of the law have been punished. That there have been difficulties in the enforcement of the law may be gathered from the following statement of Mr. J. A. Smart in the Report for 1899, \"Every effort is made to discover and punish the miscreants who supply the Indians with intoxicants, but, as the Indians who receive the liquor are as a rule the only witnesses of such transactions and to give information would cut them off from all hope of procuring further supplies, it is next to impossible to extract any from them. Under such circumstances the only other course left is to punish the Indian, but here another difficulty presents itself; because the chances are that his circumstances are such that whether he be fined or imprisoned the result is to render his family destitute; and the duty of affording relief falls upon the Funds, if possessed of funds to devote to such purpose, and, if not, upon the Government.\" Conditions are continually improving, however, and, at least among Indians living on reserves which are surrounded by communities where prohibitory laws are also in force, an intoxicated Indian is indeed a rare occurrence.\n\nMr. J. A. Smart, speaking of other aspects of the moral problem stated; \"As to other aspects of morality, and more particularly with regard to the true nature and obligations of the marriage tie, tribal customs and pagan views have to be overcome, and this has to a large extent been done, and every day is being further accomplished by contact with civilization, increasing familiarity with its views and customs, education of the young in the schools, but above all, by the earnest and faithful efforts of the missionaries of the various denominations.\"\n\n\"The Indians are beyond dispute a law respecting people, and when occasionally some serious crime is committed by one of their number, it attracts the more attention from its rarity, and causes alarm if of a character to suggest that racial antagonism may still be slumbering.\"\n\nA circular issued by the Indian Department tells the whole story of Indian marriages and divorces in Canada: \"A marriage between Indians or between Indians and others solemnized or contracted in accordance with provincial or territorial law is valid.\"\n\n\"The validity of marriages between Indians contracted in accordance with the customs of their tribes has been established by the courts, notably in the case of 'Comolly vs. Woolwich, and others', in 1867; nor does the fact that one or both of the contracting parties may profess adherence to christianity affect the matter.\"\n\"It is particularly deserving of notice that the validity of Indian divorces has never been affirmed in Canada, and Indian marriages, if valid, cannot be dissolved according to the Indian customs, but only in such manner as other marriages may be dissolved.\"\n\n\"If an Indian is validly married to one woman and has gone through a form of marriage with another which would make her his wife but for the fact that he was already married, he is guilty of bigamy and liable to the penalties for that crime (Section 308, Criminal Code, R. S. C., 1906), and the Department of Justice has expressed the opinion that, even if there has been no valid marriage but the Indian intended by complying with the customs of the band relating to marriage to make more than the first married his wife or wives, or if, even without such intention, he has complied in the case of two or more women with the requirements of the tribal customs, he may be successfully prosecuted under section 310 of the Criminal Code.\"\n\n\"With reference to a more or less prevalent idea that a man or woman can legally contract a fresh alliance if he or she in good faith and on reasonable grounds believes his wife or her husband to be dead or if his wife or her husband has been continually absent for seven years then last past and he or she is not proved to have known that his wife or her husband was alive at any time during those seven years, it has to be pointed out that, while such conditions would furnish a good defense against a charge of bigamy, they would not serve to legalize the second alliance in case of its being shown that both parties to the first marriage contract were alive at the time of the second purported marriage.\"\n\nThe ethical standard of the aborigines differed in important respects from the standard of Christian ethics. The process of approximation to the standard of Christian ethics has been gradual, as indeed has been the whole process of assimilation. The various religious denominations have laboured indefatigably in this process of adjustment in moral standard and their work has borne fruit in the gradual and continuous improvement that can be noted in this adjustment.\n\nThe most serious difficulties of the problem have now been indicated. While it would be utterly absurd and untrue to say that all Indians possess these traits of character, yet it has seemed that the number of Indians who can be so characterized is sufficiently large to justify an observer to place these serious defects at the door of the Indian people. It will be noted that such characteristics are labelled \"serious defects\". Now, if the Indian had remained savage and were to remain savage, these characteristics would not have been so serious. But under a changed social environment where certain characteristics are absolutely necessary for advancement, such characteristics must be so named. The fact cannot be emphasized too strongly that the Indian problem is the result of the great gulf which has developed between the Indian's adaptive powers on the one hand\nand the rapid change in his environment on the other. Had the Indian been able to keep pace with this abrupt environmental change, such ability would have been fittingly termed miraculous. It is well to remember that for centuries (how many will remain a mystery) these characteristics were being brought into the character of the Indians by continual exercise and were being transmitted from generation to generation with such persistency and regularity as to be called hereditary. It is now only about two hundred years ago since the process of assimilation began on a general scale.\n\nBefore we begin to examine the instruments, organized and unorganized, used by the Department, it is necessary to mention the close connection existing between the various religious denominations and the Indian schools. The religious denominations concerned are the Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Salvation Army. Before the bands were organized and settled on their respective reserves zealous missionaries were at work educating and christianizing the Indians, and the churches have continued their efforts to the present day. The Department frankly acknowledges the debt it owes to these missionaries, and almost all Canadian Indian schools are conducted under a joint agreement between the denominations concerned and the Department as to system and finances. This system of union between church and state is quite in contrast with the system adopted by the United States where the churches have no such direct connection with the schools. Commenting on the Canadian system, Frederick H. Abbott, secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners which was appointed to make an investigation into the administration of Indian affairs in Canada, has made the following statement, \"The difference between Canada and the United States as respects the attitude toward the churches which have engaged in educational and missionary work among Indians is, that Canada from the beginning has frankly recognized her debt to the churches and her need of their continued help, whereas the United States Government, by raising the fetish of Church separation has weakened the effectiveness of missionary work among Indians and has come near to depriving the Indian youth of really beneficial religious instruction in the schools. The Indians of Canada provided that the chief or chiefs of any band in council may, subject to the confirmation by the governor in council, make rules and regulations as to the religious denomination to which the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong. If the majority of the band belong to any one religious denomination, the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong to the same denomination. The Protestant or Catholic minority of any band, may with the approval of, and under regulations made by the governor in council have a separate school established on the reserve. Thus Canada has expressed in law her belief in religious education in the Indian schools and has protected her Indians from the dangers of skepticism and confusion in religious thought, which inevitably attend the system in the United States, where Catholic teachers may by chance be employed to instruct Protestant children and vice versa.\"\nVersa, and where Protestant and Catholic children thrown in schools together are exposed to the petty gossip and friction which too often finds place among missionaries and employees of different religious denominations in the same government boarding schools.\" Commenting upon the homelike atmosphere surrounding the Canadian Indian schools, Mr. Abbott states \"My judgment is that the main cause of this home atmosphere is to be found in the government's frank encouragement of religious instruction which makes the teachers feel responsible for every phase of the pupil's development, spiritual and physical, mental and moral.\" There can be no doubt whatever that benefits have been derived from this union between the churches and the Department. Had the union between the churches and the Department been less close, the christianization of the Indians of Canada would have been retarded.\n\nThat there has been in the past no serious friction sometimes attending the operations of different denominations in the same fields, has, no doubt, been partly due to the attitude of the Department indicated above and partly to the attitude of the denominations towards one another. All the denominations felt that the Indians were ready for christianization. This one purpose, christianization, deliverance from aboriginal religious beliefs, actuated all denominations with a zeal and tolerance which left little room for friction. That there has been no serious objection from the Indians themselves is due to several reasons. The transition from pagan beliefs to christian beliefs is slow and gradual. There is a new allegiance and new ceremonials and the Indian is very intently occupied accustoming himself to the new beliefs. The new religion is not yet wholly his, he is just in the transition stage, but when the transformation has been completed he will defend the tenets of his religion with fervour and conviction. In many bands, all the members belong exclusively to one religion. In other bands they are so divided in the matter of religious beliefs that separate schools are conveniently provided. But in many bands the minorities are so few in numbers that provision of separate schools for these few would be expensive, to say the least. The children of the minority therefore are obliged to attend schools which are only passively sympathetic to their religion if they desire an education. Strong objections would probably be made if the children of the minority were compelled by law to attend schools taught, attended, and governed by persons belonging to another denomination. The situation is further alleviated by the fact that no taxes are paid by Indians living on reserves for any purpose, and, therefore, no money paid by the minority are diverted to the support of these denominational schools. It is significant that the bands which defray some of the expenses of their schools from the funds of the band are those whose schools are undenominational, or whose members belong to one denomination, or where the denominations have provided separate schools for the education of their adherents and members. Under ordinary circumstances, enforcement of compulsory attendance laws is, and will be, extremely difficult, presupposing as it does an intelligent appreciation at the place of the school in a community.\nin a province, and in a democratic country. An adjustment of existing conditions will probably be necessary in many bands before compulsory attendance laws can be effectively enforced without violating individual rights in the matter of religion.\n\nToo much praise cannot be given to those missionaries who made and are making great sacrifices that through their labors, the Indians of Canada might become christianized. Nor have they labored in vain. Four hundred and thirty years ago, every Indian in the territory now included under Canada, was a pagan. In 1890 there were 15,621 Indians professing aboriginal beliefs. In 1921, there were still 8,414 pagans. The number professing Roman Catholic religion, 43,966 in 1921, gives a remarkable record of the results of indefatigable work on the part of the Jesuit missionaries and their successors. Similarly, the 20,182 Indians in 1921 professing Church of England religion, were won from pagan beliefs by John Eliot and by the New England Company, which grew out of the labors of John Eliot. 12,820 Methodists, 2,155 Presbyterians, 1,297 Baptists, 1,426 professing other christian beliefs, together with the fore mentioned figures, show the extent to which christianity has been accepted by the Indians. The comparative figures in Table I give a good idea of the progress of christian religions.\n\nTable I\n\n| Year | Church of England | Methodist | Presbyterian | Roman Catholic | Baptist | Congregational | Aboriginal Beliefs | Other christian beliefs |\n|------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1890 | 10723             | 11219     | 1435         | 38651          | 923    | 88            | 18621              | 475                     |\n| 1900 | 15679             | 11794     | 1427         | 35060          | 1103   | 102           | 14630              | 544                     |\n| 1905 | 17054             | 11553     | 1739         | 41512          | 1138   | 18            | 10906              | 807                     |\n| 1910 | 17826             | 12769     | 1913         | 42765          | 1377   | 16            | 10112              | 1625                    |\n| 1915 | 20122             | 12820     | 2155         | 43986          | 1297   | 20            | 8290               | 1426                    |\n| 1921 |                   |           |              |                |        |               |                    |                         |\n\nTable I - Showing the number of adherents and members in the different denominations from 1890 to 1921 as far as can be ascertained.\n\nIt is safe to say that such results could not have been attained, if the churches and the government of Canada had not co-operated in the work.\n\nThere is great danger that in a system depending largely upon voluntary effort salaries will be low. Enthusiastic missionaries and teachers are willing to accept comparatively small remuneration for the privilege and opportunity of working among Indians. The supply of that stamp of people is not equal to the demand. A consequent lowering of standards and requirements usually takes place under the circumstances, instead of increasing the attractive power of the work by further inducements. Under present conditions, the employment of properly qualified people is very difficult of attainment and it may be stated emphatically and unreservedly that before teachers with proper qualifications can be engaged in greater numbers in Indian schools, greater financial inducements must be offered.\nCompetition between communities in securing efficient teachers is keen and the supply of such teachers is not at all sufficient to fill all schools in white communities let alone the Indian schools. But the point raised here is that this close union between the Department and the churches has probably had a tendency to keep salaries low, and comparatively low salaries always bring with them attendant evils. The remedy, of course, is larger salaries. The right solution appears to lie in the direction of greater self-activity and self-help on the part of the bands and not so much upon larger grants from the Department.\n\nWith this preliminary discussion of the close connection between the churches and the Department in the management of schools we shall now proceed to the examination of the organized and unorganized forces brought to bear upon the Indians with a view to their citizenization. The organized forces are: the Department itself, the churches, and the schools. These of course very often overlap. The Department and the churches, although very often working directly with the Indians, do their work mainly through the schools. The unorganized forces at work are those which call into exercise the Indians' initiative and selective power. The manner of the Indians' external surroundings in adapting him of himself to conditions in the lower stages of progress at least, the most potent factor leading the Indians to adaptation to modern conditions appears to be that of their external surroundings. Where the schools have failed in endeavor to make an impression, external surroundings, the persistence of their influences lead and impel the Indians along right paths of progress. While the list below does not pretend to exhaust the list of the external forces, they will at least give an idea of the unorganized forces: Trade and other dealings with white men; newspapers, travel, influence of well kept farms in the immediate neighborhood; social and commercial intercourse among themselves; social and physical isolation on reserves.\n\nThere are three types of schools; day schools, boarding schools, and industrial schools. In day schools, the pupils attend during the school hours, but go home after school hours. They correspond to the elementary rural schools among white communities. In boarding and industrial schools, the pupils receive instruction on the subjects of the course of study and are taken care of by the school after school hours. That is, they live in the school. Hitherto, the distinction between boarding schools and industrial schools was that some industrial arts, such as carpentry, painting and cooking, were taught in industrial schools, but this distinction has now practically disappeared, and boarding schools now attempt to teach as many of the industrial arts as possible. These industrial arts are taught in addition to the subjects of the course of study.\n\nThe number of day schools has increased since 1901. Table 2 shows the number of day schools for each year since 1901 together with the number of day schools conducted by the various\ndenominations during the same period.\n\n| TABLE 2 | 1901 | 1905 | 1910 | 1915 | 1921 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of day schools | 226  | 232  | 241  | 257  | 253  |\n| Undenominational | 36   | 44   | 50   | 49   | 53   |\n| Roman Catholic     | 72   | 74   | 73   | 90   | 87   |\n| Church of England  | 77   | 68   | 70   | 71   | 71   |\n| Methodist          | 33   | 41   | 40   | 40   | 38   |\n| Presbyterian       | 5    | 6    | 6    | 5    | 3    |\n| Salvation Army     | 1    | 2    | 2    | 2    | 1    |\n\nCalculation shows that the percentage of schools conducted by the Church of England of the total number of day schools in operation during a single year has decreased from 55% in 1901 to 28% in 1921. With regard to Methodist schools the percentage has steadily decreased since 1905 when the percentage was 17.5%. In 1921 the percentage was 10.02%, but in the case of the Roman Catholic schools the percentage in 1901 was 32.29%, and in 1921, 34.39%, an increase of 2.10%, but the greatest increase is to be noted in the case of undenominational schools where the percentage has increased from 16.15% in 1901 to 30.95% in 1921 or the total increase has been 4.80%. Clearly denominational control is decreasing except in the case of Roman Catholic control, and undenominational schools are increasing although the increase or change is gradual. Diagram 1 shows the situation graphically.\n\nVery little can be said about the equipment of the day schools, as no statistics are available. The prevailing type is that of the one room school with cloak room for boys and for girls. The crudest kind of school buildings are usually found in remote districts, while in the older and more settled parts of the country, modern school houses comparing favourably with the best in white communities, are found. That the standard of school building is improving is quite evident; the older schoolhouses fall into disuse and no additional buildings are erected, a sense of civic pride exerts a strong influence toward the erection of modern structures which would serve most efficiently the purposes for which they were intended.\n\nThe most serious fact in regard to Indian education is that of the irregular attendance. It is serious because of its causes and because of its consequences. The reports of the Department of Indian Affairs are replete with instances of irregular attendance at the day schools. Statistics are available and they show the condition of affairs. The percentages of attendance of the total enrolment in all day schools in Canada for all years from 1897 to 1921 are given in TABLE 3.\nDiagram I - Showing the percentage of all day schools under denominational and undenominational control during various years.\n### Table 3.\n\n**Attendance - Day Schools**\n\n| Year | Percentage |\n|------|------------|\n| 1897 | 42.52      |\n| 1898 | 44.18      |\n| 1899 | 52.43      |\n| 1900 | 51.08      |\n| 1901 | 49.37      |\n| 1902 | 48.06      |\n| 1903 | 48.80      |\n| 1904 | 48.73      |\n| 1905 | 48.02      |\n| 1906 | 46.86      |\n| 1907 | 47.26      |\n| 1908 | 46.55      |\n| 1909 | 47.91      |\n| 1910 | 46.55      |\n| 1911 | 46.01      |\n| 1912 | 46.46      |\n| 1913 | 48.34      |\n| 1914 | 51.53      |\n| 1915 | 49.56      |\n| 1916 | 49.76      |\n| 1917 | 54.02      |\n| 1918 | 51.77      |\n| 1919 | 49.06      |\n| 1920 | 47.02      |\n| 1921 | 50.30      |\n\nDiagram 3 shows a comparison in attendance of various provinces and all Canada with the attendance in Indian day schools. While there is no noticeable improvement during the 25 years, yet calculation reveals a slight improvement if the averages of 10 year periods are taken into consideration. The average for the ten year period from 1901 - 1910 is 47.23%, while the average for the period from 1911 - 1920 is 49.35%, an improvement of 2.13%.\n\nWhat are the causes of this irregular attendance at the day schools? Clearly the most important reason for this condition is that the Indians have not yet realized the importance of education. Isolated on their reserves where a comparative simplicity and crudity of social and commercial life prevails, they have not yet felt the need of adequate preparation for the activities of life. In 1900 Mr. J. A. Smart, in his report to the Minister of the Interior on the condition of Indian education in Canada stated: \"So long as the Indians remain a distinct people and live as separate communities, their attitude toward education will in all likelihood remain much as it is today, which means that they will not be anxious for further education for their children than will serve as a convenience and protection with regard to such dealings as they have with the white populations.\"\n\n\"In the younger provinces the same motives actuate the Indians who are in contact with settlement, and the interest taken in education on the reserves bears a distinct relation to the extent of their intercourse with the outside world, and consequently is increasing.\" Mr. Frank Pedley, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1908 stated in his report to the Minister of the Interior for that year. \"Education is naturally followed by Indians as by most others rather as a...\"\nDiagram I.\u2014Comparison of the average attendances in percentages in Indian day schools, and in the publicly controlled schools of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and all Canada (nine provinces).\nmeans to an end than as an end in itself, and is appreciated in proportion as its material advantages are apparent to them and this bears a distinct relation to the comparative crudity of their social relations and commercial enterprises.\"\n\n\"Until the Indians amalgamate in a manner they have not so far done with other classes of the community, it need not be expected that beyond the rare exceptions occasionally met with, they will manifest any desire for higher education. In so far, however, as concerns direct material benefit, increasing contact with civilization extends their appreciation of a certain standard of instruction.\"\n\nOther causes, some of them bearing close relation to the basic cause mentioned above operate against regular attendance at day schools. The migratory habits of some bands in outlying districts do not conduce toward regular attendance. This instinct of migration is still strong among many present day Indians who are not yet far advanced from their former state, and this is only another instance where their former mode of living interferes with their adaptation to modern social conditions. Hunting, fishing, lumbering, agricultural operations especially in fruit regions entice many Indian families away from the reserves. Efforts have been made to adapt the school year in such a way that the holidays occur during the period when the families are away.\n\nIt is quite evident that people, who do not feel the need of education for themselves and for their children, will either keep their children at home, or will indulge their varying whims which in most cases means irregularity in attendance. Just as soon as a boy or girl is old enough to become useful in the work around the home, which usually takes place at the age of 13 or 14, their education by the day school is very often discontinued. Disinclination to attend on the part of the children for any cause or causes in may cases does not call forth words of encouragement or of compulsion from parents.\n\nOther causes are poverty, lack of suitable clothing, sickness, inclement weather, bad roads, and long distances from school. The ways in which these factors prevent regular attendance are quite evident. It may be mentioned in passing that irregular attendance through inclement weather, bad roads, and long distances, is more frequent among schools situated in remote and unsettled districts.\n\nWhile in the main the attitude of Indians toward schools is that of passive indifference rather than energetic reaction thereto, still there are instances where the attitude is entirely and unmistakably hostile. This hostility is based on the belief that children who have received a different education from their parents will be separated from their parents in the great hereafter. As is to be expected, hostility from this reason is confined mainly to pagans. Mr. J. A. Smart, quoted elsewhere in his report for 1869, stated in this connection, \"In the first stage, before instruction or education can be commenced, a great deal has to be done in the way of eradication...\"\nof superstition and prejudice, and in overcoming fear not unnaturally entertained by the parents that education will not only destroy sympathy between them and their offspring in this life, but through the inoculation of religion separate them in a future state of existence.\" Mr. Frank Pedley in his Report for 1903 stated in the same connection: \"Pagans outside the sphere of civilization are disposed to regard education as an attempt to erect a barrier between them and their children\". Needless to say, hostility to education is decreasing and the irregular attendance due to this cause is now comparatively insignificant.\n\nIt might be interesting to investigate if all the children of school age are enrolled at the different schools. Children of school age are those whose ages are anywhere from 6-15. Unfortunately accurate statistics are not available, but enough information can be gathered to show the situation in a general way. TABLE 4 shows the percentage enrolment of the total number of children of school age in Ontario for the years 1910 to 1916. The enrolment in all schools, day, boarding, and industrial, were considered in the calculation.\n\n| Year | Percentage Enrolment |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| 1910 | 71.30                 |\n| 1911 | 68.01                 |\n| 1912 | 71.48                 |\n| 1913 | 66.66                 |\n| 1914 | 69.42                 |\n| 1915 | 80.64                 |\n| 1916 | 74.10                 |\n\nThe question may now be asked, what measures are taken to promote regular attendance at day schools? The most important means and measures used to promote regularity of attendance are as follows:- provision of noon day meals to the pupils; conveyance to and from school when weather is unfavourable and where distances to school are great; distribution of prizes for regular attendance; distribution of clothing, appointment of truant officers. It would be extremely interesting to examine how these measures have affected the attendance at schools where they have been tried, and fortunately some statistical information, although not by any means exhaustive, is obtainable. The statistics refer to some day school in Saskatchewan, and while no systematic effort seems to have been made to watch the result of some of the measures taken to improve attendance, sufficient information is available to show that marked improvements usually attend sustained efforts in that direction. The following day schools in Saskatchewan; Mastawasis, Fort la Carne South, James Smith, and John Smith provided mid-day meals for pupils and also conveyed pupils to and from school during the winter, during the years 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913. Moose Mountain and Day Star schools provided noon-day meals only, during the same years. TABLE 5 shows how the average percentage attendance at these 7 schools compares with the percentage\nattendance in Indian day schools in Saskatchewan and in all Canada.\n\nTable 5\n\n|        | 1910   | 1911   | 1912   | 1913   |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Seven Schools | 52.50% | 56.83% | 64.95% | 60.35% |\n| Saskatchewan | 47.08  | 50.29  | 54.80  | 53.53  |\n| Canada      | 46.01  | 46.46  | 46.40  | 48.34  |\n\nIt would not be fair to say that the greater regularity in attendance was wholly due to the provision of mid-day meals and to conveyance, as other factors, such as the influence of an energetic teacher, and enforcement of compulsory clause, may have promoted the noticeable improvement. Much of the improvement, however, must be placed to the credit of these measures.\n\nThe cost of the conveyance of pupils is provided for by the Department of Indian Affairs, as is in most cases the cost of the mid-day meals. Very often the products of the school gardens are used to supply these mid-day meals. Most of the schools providing such meals have special equipment, and accommodation such as suitable kitchens, dining rooms, for such purpose, and a matron usually has charge, thus leaving the day school teacher free to attend to his numerous duties.\n\nThe prizes given take various forms, such as money, clothing, books, medals and so forth. It is clear that prizes do not constitute a potent factor in promoting regular attendance. The Indians live in the present and not in the future. A reward in any form a year in the future has very little attraction for the majority of Indian children. The important thing with them is present satisfaction. Furthermore, it has been found that a few zealous pupils will try to attend school regularly in spite of sickness in order that they might win the reward. For a great many pupils, the prizes lose their appeal early in the school year because of repeated or continued absence from school for various reasons, and all chances of winning have been forfeited.\n\nIn 1906 regulations relating to the education of Indian children were passed, and the substance of the regulations was to make attendance at school compulsory. Some of the clauses are as follows:\u2014 \"All Indian children between the ages of 6 and 15 shall attend a day school on the reserve on which they reside for the full term during which the school is open each year, unless excused for the reasons hereinafter mentioned.\"\n\nNo parent, guardian or other person shall be liable to any of the penalties of these Regulations in respect of any child.\n\n(a) If the child is under efficient instruction.\n(b) If the child is unable to attend school by reason of sickness or other unavoidable cause.\n(c) If there is no school within two miles, measured by the nearest road from such child's residence, if such child is under ten years of age, or within 3 miles, if over this age;\n(d) If the child has been excused as hereinafter provided, from attending school;\n\n(e) If the child has passed the entrance examination for high schools.\"\n\nProvision is made for the relief of any child from attendance at school for any period not exceeding two weeks during each of the four school terms or quarters if \"the services of such child are required in husbandry, or in urgent and necessary household duties, or for the necessary maintenance of such child, or of some Indian dependent upon such child.\" \"Indian agents may appoint one or more persons to act as truant officers on each reserve for the enforcement of these Regulations.\"\n\nThe penalty for neglect or refusal to send a child to school is a fine of not more than two dollars or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten days or both.\n\nThe enforcement of these regulations is attended with a great deal of difficulty, as many bands, especially those in remote parts of the country, have not yet reached a stage in their advancement when such laws are fully appreciated, and when the social feeling favourable to compulsion in educational matters is so predominant that the operation of such regulations is made easy, and delinquent parents are brought into line through pressure from the dominant social feeling. It is reasonable to suppose that the Department has been reluctant to enforce these Regulations rigidly in the case of bands which are not far advanced. But in the case of more advanced bands in well settled parts of the country, a firm enforcement would no doubt be attended with beneficial results. Future improvement in attendance hinges on the manner in which these compulsory regulations are enforced, and the situation, although perhaps not so serious as statistics seem to indicate, undoubtedly calls for a somewhat rigid enforcement.\n\nThe number of families who realize the importance of regular attendance is fortunately very large. Sacrifices are made and inconveniences are suffered willingly and happily by very many parents in order that their children might receive an education, and such parents are sources of inspiration for all those engaged in Indian work.\n\nBut unfortunately there are always a few delinquent parents whose children, by the great irregularity of their attendance, seriously affect the average attendance of the schools they attend. It is very probable, that the great irregularity of attendance shown by statistics appears greater than it actually is.\n\nThe compulsory attendance laws have been in force on the Six Nations Reserve for a number of years and to this Reserve we now turn to study the effect of compulsory laws on average attendance. TABLE 6 and DIAGRAM 3 show percentages for the years indicated. The percentages are lower than that of all Canada as shown by DIAGRAM 3.\nDiagram 3.- Comparison of percentage attendances of total enrolment in Indian day schools in Canada and in Six Nations day schools.\nTABLE 6.\nAverage Attendance in Six Nations Day Schools.\n\n| Year | Percentage |\n|------|------------|\n| 1901 | 44.58      |\n| 1902 | 46.35      |\n| 1903 | 41.01      |\n| 1904 | 39.83      |\n| 1905 | 39.89      |\n| 1906 | 35.93      |\n| 1907 | 38.71      |\n| 1908 | 43.49      |\n| 1909 | 45.49      |\n| 1910 | 44.19      |\n| 1911 | 44.05      |\n| 1912 | 37.54      |\n| 1913 | 40.59      |\n| 1914 | 46.01      |\n| 1915 | 43.35      |\n| 1916 | 44.40      |\n| 1917 | 55.22      |\n| 1918 | 56.60      |\n| 1919 | 46.90      |\n| 1920 | 46.90      |\n| 1921 | 47.70      |\n\nThat these percentages do not show the situation on the Six Nations Reserve correctly is beyond doubt. A number of families usually move from one school section to another during the year. Their children attend two or three months at one school when they move away and attend another school for the remainder of the year. Their names are kept on the register of two schools. When the report is made, the names of these children will appear on two reports. It is quite evident that the average attendance will be decreased as the attendance of these pupils are not transferred from one school to the other as should be done if the average attendances of the schools are to be shown correctly. The average for the ten year period (1901-1910) is 41.98%, and the average for the next ten year period is 45.76%, an increase of 3.78% which is greater than the increase for all Indian day schools in Canada for the same period.\n\nLet us now examine the courses of study which have been followed in Indian schools. At the present time the studies prescribed for Indian schools is the same as that used in the provincial schools of the province in which the Indian schools are located. Previous to the adoption of provincial curricula, \"the programme of studies\" which was followed was that prepared by the Department for use in Indian schools. The change to provincial curricula has been gradual and has been spread over the last five years. The change was made mainly to utilize the school inspectors of the various provinces in the supervision of Indian schools and also to obtain the required textbooks more readily.\n\nA copy of the programme of studies which Indian schools were obliged to follow before the change was made, is shown herewith.* Detailed comparison between this course of study and the courses of study of the various provinces would be interesting, but only general comparisons will be noted here. That there are differences both in the subjects and in the contents of the subjects is quite evident. Subjects present in some provincial curricula are not included in the list of subjects in the programme of studies for Indian schools, and\n\n*Note - In the original, at McMaster University, the \"programme of studies\" on the back of the Indian School Register, is attached on this page.\nSome subjects which appear in the curriculum for Indian schools do not appear in provincial curricula, although the same results may be obtained in an indirect way. For instance, under the subject of general knowledge, the Indian pupils obtain certain information which white pupils obtain in another subject or in other subjects. However, it is in the contents of the subjects that the most significant differences occur. This programme of studies prescribed for Indian schools is not a composite of the provincial courses of study. Whether or not Indian children in the schools would have done as far as their public school education was concerned is a matter of opinion. An examination of the course of study shows that a pupil in an Indian day school has not advanced as far in certain subjects, such as arithmetic for instance, at the completion of his public school education, as the white pupil who has followed, let us say, the Ontario course of study. It appears that the course of study was made simple and constructed differently to accommodate Indian pupils. The advantages that were gained from a simplified programme of studies were probably not so great as to disfavour the adoption of provincial courses of study. Needful subjects such as ethics and religious instruction, if considered necessary, might have been added. While the efficacy of a course of study must be judged by its developmental and content factors, and not so much by the closeness of its connection and co-ordination to the courses of study in higher institutions, yet it is clear that an advantage would have accrued to clever Indian pupils had provincial courses of study been adopted from the first, in that these pupils would have found entrance to high schools and collegiate institutes less difficult. Other things being equal, this consideration alone is sufficient argument for the adoption of provincial courses of study. The Department of Indian Affairs by making the change has recognized the extrinsic, if not the intrinsic, superiority of provincial courses of study.\n\nNormal school graduates, trained with a view to teaching in provincial schools, or having had experience in such schools, will now find adaptation to similar conditions in Indian schools comparatively easy.\n\nSewing, knitting, fancy work, cooking, house work, and manual training are taught in many schools. School gardens are cultivated also in many schools. Special efforts have been made by the Department to promote school gardens in schools and their efforts are attended with a great measure of success. These arts seem to have quite an appeal to the Indian pupils, as they are closely related to their predominant interests. It is to be expected that a people whose ideas of the purpose of education are largely utilitarian, whose life is lived largely in the realm of the physical and who are concrete minded, should find sewing, knitting, fancy work, cooking, housework, manual training, and school gardening very interesting. Indeed the logical approach to abstract ideas contained in a course of study is best made through concrete materials, especially so in the case of Indian children. In the first stage at least, the nature and characteristics of Indian pupils seems to demand a close correlation between everyday activities and common objects,\nand the subjects of the course of study. Indian languages or dialects are characterized by the abundance of the words denoting physical activities and objects, and by the scarcity of words denoting abstract ideas. The average attendance at schools where at least three of these arts are taught is usually greater than the average. Fifteen day schools in the provinces of New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, taught at least three of these arts during the year 1916, as far as can be ascertained from the Report of Indian Affairs for that year. The average attendance at these schools for that year was 56.2% of the total enrolment. The average attendance at all Indian day schools for the same year was 49.7% of the total enrolment. The difference was 7.5%. At least one of the causes of this difference must have been the attraction of these arts for Indian pupils.\n\nIn order to obtain some idea of the status of the teachers who teach in Indian day schools in Ontario a questionnaire was sent to each Public School Inspector who inspects these schools. Information was collected regarding 36 teachers. It was thought that the qualifications of teachers in Ontario Indian day schools would give a fair idea of the qualifications of teachers in Indian schools throughout Canada; Ontario is one of the most populated, and well settled provinces in Canada. At least, it is reasonable to expect that the average for Ontario, would not be below the average for the other provinces. Of the 36 teachers regarding whose qualifications information was received, 16 possessed professional qualifications. Of these 16 properly qualified teachers, 9 possessed Second Class professional qualifications, and the remaining 7 possessed Third Class professional certificates. The majority of the 20 teachers who possessed no professional qualifications had, however, certain academic qualifications. One had only a public school education, two possessed a commercial diploma, two possessed Entrance to Normal certificates, one Junior Matriculation and the remainder had High School education, the number of years spent in High School work averaging from one year to five years. The average age of the qualified teachers was 44 and the average of the non-qualified was 32. Of the 36 teachers, 14 were males. The following statement taken from the Department's Report for 1921 sums up the situation in a general way:\n\n\"Certified teachers with professional training are engaged wherever it is possible to obtain them. In the older settled portions of the different provinces, the greater number of teachers are so qualified. In the schools situated in the more remote reserves, it is difficult to secure teachers with certificates. Many of our teachers who have not professional qualifications have, however, long experience and are meeting with a great measure of success in Indian school work.\" The aim of course, is to have qualified teachers with professional training in 100% of the schools, and while it is unreasonable to look for such perfection for some time to come, yet it would be quite fair to hope for a certain approximation to the condition in rural schools among white communities in Ontario.\nTaking the figures given above as the basis it is found that only 44.4% of the 36 teachers have proper qualifications. In Ontario among white communities in 1919-1920, of 6149 teachers teaching in rural schools 5625 teachers, or 91.4%, had certificates qualifying them to teach in Ontario schools. The difference between 91.4% and 44.4% is too large even at this stage. The situation undoubtedly demands careful attention.\n\nHow long do Indian day school teachers hold office in one school? Here again the wide diversity exists. There are instances where teachers have remained in office at one school for quite a number of years and there have been instances of schools where two or three changes in teachers had taken place in one school year. In the matter of the tenure of office in Indian day schools, the Reports of the Department furnishes some information although the information is not exhaustive.\n\nThe day schools of Ontario were chosen again in this examination. The names of schools and the names of teachers teaching in these schools are given in each Report. For instance, the names of 69 identical schools are found in the Reports for 1910 and 1911 and 71 names of teachers appeared in connection with these 69 day schools. 46 names out of 71 which appeared in the 1910 Report appear again in the 1911 Report and 25 names are different. Table 7 shows the number of changes from 1910 to 1920. The average for the period is 32.74%. The average yearly change is almost one third. It is clear that a number of evils will attend such frequent changes.\n\n| Year       | No. of Schools | No. of Teachers' Names the same | No. of Teachers' Names Different | Percentage Change |\n|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1910-1911  | 69             | 71                              | 46                              | 35.21             |\n| 1911-1912  | 75             | 77                              | 48                              | 37.66             |\n| 1912-1913  | 72             | 74                              | 54                              | 27.03             |\n| 1913-1914  | 76             | 77                              | 54                              | 29.07             |\n| 1914-1915  | 75             | 78                              | 55                              | 29.46             |\n| 1915-1916  | 71             | 75                              | 56                              | 29.86             |\n| 1916-1917  | 70             | 74                              | 43                              | 41.69             |\n| 1917-1918  | 74             | 78                              | 57                              | 26.91             |\n| 1918-1919  | 74             | 78                              | 54                              | 30.77             |\n| 1919-1920  | 70             | 74                              | 43                              | 41.69             |\n\nThe question must now be asked; What are the reasons for the difficulty of procuring qualified teachers, and of keeping such teachers as are obtained, in Indian day schools? Ten Public school Inspectors answered these above questions placed on the questionnaire which was sent to them in the autumn of 1921. Eight of the ten inspectors gave low salaries as the reason. Five mentioned physical and social isolation. Other causes\nmentioned are the irregular attendance of pupils, the unattractive nature of the work, the difficulty of securing suitable boarding places, and the unsympathetic attitude of parents toward education.\n\nUnfortunately, information concerning the salaries paid to Indian day school teachers is lacking. The salaries paid to teachers depend on the qualifications they possess, and according to latest information, the salary scale ranges from $500.00 to $800.00 per annum, plus a bonus of $150.00 during the last four fiscal years. In Ontario the average salary in public elementary schools is $1348.00 per annum for men teachers, and $117.00 for women teachers. Salaries are however increasing and in some Indian schools, the salaries paid exceed those paid in neighbouring white communities.\n\nThey would be compelled, for the sake of convenience, to live among a people who speak a different language, and who have different customs and ideals. This unattractive prospect of social and physical isolation will probably operate against the employment of properly qualified white teachers for some time to come unless the salaries offered are sufficient to overcome this disadvantage. However, the difficulty of securing qualified white teachers due to this cause does not appear to be altogether hopeless. Settlement of the country is continually progressing and the extension of railways, both steam and electric, and building of good roads are continually overcoming physical isolation. As far as social isolation is concerned, that will gradually become less and less as Indian bands assimilate more and more the languages, customs, and ideals of the white people. No doubt the provision of teacher's residences have tended to mitigate social isolation, and to prolong the tenure of office of the teachers. The difficulty of securing suitable boarding houses is also thereby removed. Extension of this residence idea to more schools has not yet been attempted but therein lies the hope not only of Indian day schools, but of the rural schools of Canada in general. Difficulties would no doubt be encountered of the same kind as are encountered among white communities and, in addition, there would be the difficulties of adjustment inevitable in denominational control of schools. There are, however, a number of reserves where schools might be consolidated without the necessity of adjustment between the religious denominations. The Six Nations reserve may be mentioned as one reserve where consolidation of schools would be attended with beneficial results. The point here, however, is that gradual consolidation of schools would, in addition to many other advantages, provide social intercourse between teachers and would remove much of the unattractiveness of the work to some teachers.\n\nDiscouragement often assails a teacher because of the irregularity of attendance and because of the unsympathetic attitude of some parents. Diligent and painstaking work shows comparatively poor results in the face of irregularity of attendance. All that can be said about the unsympathetic and\nunappreciative attitude toward teachers' work not only in some Indian schools but in other schools as well is that such a thing is disappearing. One of the important qualifications that a teacher carries into the teaching profession is that of vicariousness.\n\nPupils in Indian schools are divided into six standards. An Indian pupil passes from standard I through the intermediate standard to standard 6. The correspondence between the grade system and the system adopted in Indian schools is shown in DIAGRAM 4.\n\nDIAGRAM 4.\n\n| Standards | I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Grades    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |\n\nIt may be stated, however, that the practice of showing the correspondence in the way indicated in DIAGRAM 4 is not by any means uniform.\n\nWe shall now examine the distribution of pupils by standards, and comparison will be made with the grade distributions of pupils among white communities in some of the provinces. We shall however, first examine the standard distribution for the past twenty years to note whether any improvement has taken place during that period or not. TABLE 8 shows the percentage distribution of pupils in the different standards in the day schools.\n\nTABLE 8.\n\n| Year | Standard I. | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  |\n|------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1901 | 55.65%      | 20.19% | 15.64% | 7.12% | 2.53% | .83% |\n| 1905 | 59.06       | 19.38 | 14.34 | 6.14  | 2.15  | .46  |\n| 1910 | 55.06       | 20.55 | 14.12 | 7.08  | 2.56  | .60  |\n| 1915 | 55.04       | 19.22 | 12.20 | 7.18  | 2.74  | .62  |\n| 1921 | 54.64       | 18.59 | 14.51 | 8.36  | 3.11  | .79  |\n\nIt is seen that there is a great disproportion in the distribution of the pupils in the different standards. DIAGRAM 5 shows the standard distribution for the years 1901, 1911, and 1921. There is a slight improvement during the 21-year period as shown by the more gradual curve for the year 1921.\n\nDIAGRAM 6 gives a comparison of grade distributions in Ontario for the year 1919 with standard distributions in Indian day schools for the same year. With regard to Indian schools, the school year corresponds to the fiscal year which ends March 31. The school year in Ontario corresponds to the calendar year.\nDiagram 5.\u2014 Standard distribution of pupils in Indian day schools for 1901, 1911, and 1921.\nDiagram b - Comparison of standard and class distributions in Indian day schools and Ontario rural schools (1919).\nIn the case of the grade distribution of pupils in Ontario only rural schools were taken into consideration.\n\nIt is quite clear that there is a great disproportion in the distribution of the pupils in day schools, especially so in standard I and standard II, and it is also clear that the improvement in distribution during the 21 year period is very slight. It simply means that a large number of pupils in Indian day schools go out into the world equipped with no more than the education provided in the course of study in the first two standards. A large number never get out of standard I.\n\nThere must be reasons for such a disproportionate distribution and it is to a consideration of these reasons that we now turn.\n\nOne reason which is self-evident is that of the irregularity of attendance through which pupils are not able to do the work of a standard in one year. Irregularity of attendance seems to occur most markedly in standard I. When pupils fail to make the next grade on account of their spasmodic attendance, they probably lose interest, especially so when the subject matter of instruction is really intended for pupils younger than themselves. While statistics relating to age-grade or age-standard distribution are not obtainable, and therefore comparisons cannot be made with age grade distribution in white schools, yet it is certain that there are differences. That is, the average age of Indian pupils in the different standards is certainly higher than the average age of white pupils in corresponding grades.\n\nOne other reason which causes this disproportionate distribution, and which in some bands is even more important than irregular attendance is that of the difference in language. The language of instruction is in the majority of schools, either English or French, which differs altogether from the native languages of the children. Consequently, instruction in the subject matter of the course of study is really impossible until the child has become able to express and understand ideas through the medium of English words and sentences. This disadvantage is most felt at the entrance of the pupils into a school, especially so when their parents use the native language exclusively. The influence of the child's environment on his progress in school is quite evident here. An Indian child who is in an English language environment from its birth learns to speak the English language, and not a trace of Indian accent can be noted in its pronunciation of English words.\n\nThese two reasons, irregularity of attendance, and differences in the native language of the pupils and the language of instruction, appear to be the two most important reasons regulating the distribution of pupils in the standards. And it is significant that both these reasons are closely related to the extent of the Indians' intercourse with white people. As has already been stated, the Indians' appreciation for an adequate education depends upon the benefits they derive therefrom in their commercial and trade dealings with white people.\nThe obvious remedy is the increase in the frequency of contact between the Indian people and the population of the assimilating group along all social lines. Such increase in the frequency of contact will not only improve irregular attendance, and make the English language more commonly spoken in Indian schools, but will generally accelerate the whole process of assimilation. In fact, the hope for an adequate solution of the Indian problem appears to be in that direction. However, this matter will be treated more fully later on.\n\nOther causes of the disproportionate distribution will now be enumerated:\n\n1. The number of pupils who are late in beginning school.\n2. The number of small children who commence before six and discontinue during the winter.\n3. Inefficiency (including inexperience) on the part of the teacher.\n4. Early school leaving age.\n5. Frequent change of teachers.\n\nThe Boarding and Industrial schools remain to be considered and they will be considered together as much as possible. As early as 1890 the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stated in his Report, \"The Indian youth, to enable him to cope successfully with his brother of white origin, must be dissociated free from the prejudicial influences by which he is surrounded on the reserve of his band. And the necessity for the establishment more generally of institutions, wherein Indian children, besides being instructed in the usual branches of education, will be lodged, fed, clothed, kept separate from home influences, taught trades and instructed in Agriculture, is becoming every year more apparent\". Again in the Report of 1890 the following statement is found, \"It would be highly desirable, if it were practicable, to obtain entire possession of all Indian children after they attain the age of seven or eight years and keep them at schools of the industrial type until they have had a thorough course of instruction, not only in the ordinary subjects taught at public schools but in some useful and profitable trade, or in agriculture, as the aptitude of the pupil might indicate he was best fitted for.\"\n\nThese quotations from the Reports of the Department of Indian Affairs indicate the considerations which led to the establishment of industrial schools. These industrial schools were, however, located at widely separated places and Indian pupils who were enrolled at these institutions, were separated from their parents for months at a time, if these pupils came from remote reserves. Naturally there was a certain reluctance on the part of the parents to allow their children to go to these institutions involving separation for months or even years. To overcome this difficulty, boarding schools\nwere established near many reserves where parents may see their children as often as convenient. At first, boarding schools did not attempt to teach any industrial arts in the way that they were taught in industrial schools. The relation between industrial and boarding schools is indicated in the following statement taken from the 1900 Report. \"There is, however, no doubt that in so far as obtaining pupils is concerned, the industrial schools are suffering somewhat at the hands of the boarding schools, which, instead of fulfilling the intended purpose of acting as feeders for the former, are to some extent supplanting them. Naturally, parents prefer to keep their children in the schools nearest their homes, and equally natural is it for the teachers of boarding schools to desire to retain their pupils instead of drafting them to higher institutions.\"\n\nProvision is made in the \"Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children\" for the placing of children in an industrial or boarding school if it is shown that the parents are negligent in the matter of education. The clause states \"An Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace on requisition from the Department of Indian Affairs or from one of its authorized officers on being satisfied that any Indian child between six and fifteen years of age is not being properly cared for or educated, and that the parent, guardian or other person having the charge or control of such child is unfit or unwilling to provide for the child's education, may issue a warrant authorizing the person named therein to search for and take such child and place it in an industrial or boarding school in which there may be a vacancy for such child, and a child so placed in an industrial or boarding school may be retained until the age of eighteen years is reached; but no child shall be committed to any industrial or boarding school before the parent, guardian or other person having the charge or control of such child is notified orally or in writing, by a Justice of the Peace, Indian Agent or Truant Officer of the intention to commit the child, and four days shall be allowed to lapse between the giving of such notice and the committal of the child.\" The parent, guardian or other person has the opportunity of showing that provision is being made or will be made for the child's care and education and under those circumstances the child remains in the custody of the parent, guardian or other person.\n\nTABLE 9 shows the number of industrial and boarding schools for the different years from 1926 to 1931. It will be seen that the number of boarding schools has steadily increased during the period, while the number of industrial schools has decreased steadily since 1905.\n### Table I.\n\n| Year | Boarding Schools | Industrial Schools |\n|------|------------------|--------------------|\n| 1901 | 42               | 23                 |\n| 1902 | 40               | 22                 |\n| 1903 | 45               | 23                 |\n| 1904 | 46               | 24                 |\n| 1905 | 47               | 24                 |\n| 1906 | 50               | 23                 |\n| 1907 | 55               | 22                 |\n| 1908 | 57               | 22                 |\n| 1909 | 57               | 20                 |\n| 1910 | 54               | 20                 |\n| 1911 | 54               | 19                 |\n| 1912 | 55               | 19                 |\n| 1913 | 55               | 19                 |\n| 1914 | 55               | 18                 |\n| 1915 | 55               | 18                 |\n| 1916 | 55               | 17                 |\n| 1917 | 55               | 17                 |\n| 1918 | 55               | 17                 |\n| 1919 | 55               | 16                 |\n| 1920 | 55               | 16                 |\n| 1921 | 55               | 15                 |\n\nTables 10 and 11 show the number of industrial schools and boarding schools respectively under the auspices of the various religious denominations for the years indicated. It will be seen that one or two of the industrial schools are undenominational. Strictly speaking, however, most schools are under the patronage of some particular religious denomination.\n\n### Table II.\n\n#### Industrial Schools\n\n| Year | Undenominational | Roman Catholic | Church of England | Methodist | Presbyterian |\n|------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| 1901 | 2                | 9              | 5                 | 4         | 1           |\n| 1905 | 3                | 10             | 5                 | 4         | 3           |\n| 1910 | 2                | 9              | 4                 | 4         | 3           |\n| 1915 | 2                | 8              | 4                 | 4         | 3           |\n| 1921 | 1                | 8              | 4                 | 4         | 3           |\n\n#### Boarding Schools\n\n| Year | Roman Catholic | Church of England | Methodist | Presbyterian |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| 1901 | 22             | 11                | 3         | 6           |\n| 1905 | 23             | 12                | 4         | 7           |\n| 1910 | 30             | 13                | 3         | 8           |\n| 1915 | 31             | 17                | 4         | 8           |\n| 1921 | 32             | 16                | 5         | 5           |\n\nThe relation between the Department and the churches as to finances and system is best shown by the following quotation from Mr. Abbott's Report already mentioned. \"The churches receive from $80.00 up to $125.00 per pupil and they keep pupils...\"\nthe year round, educate, clothe, and subsist them. If this grant from the government proves insufficient, the church organization makes up the deficit. Where only $80.00 is paid by the government, the government furnishes the building, and keeps up all repairs. When from $100.00 to $125.00 is paid, the church furnishes the buildings but the government keeps up repairs. The church selects the teachers in all the industrial and boarding schools operated by it and in most cases nominates the day school teachers. The Indian Agent makes a monthly inspection of the schools and reports the conditions to the Ottawa office. In two of the eastern provinces there is an additional inspection by the school inspector of the provinces, who also reports to the Indian Department. The contract between the churches and the Government provide that the teachers furnished by the church shall measure up to the standards required by the government; that the rations furnished shall be sufficient and come up to certain definite specifications; that the course of study followed shall be in close conformity to the course of study in the province where the school is situated; and that the church shall have the pupil for a period of eleven years.\n\nThe remedy of the government, should the church fail to live up to any of the requirements is found in a revocation of the contract.\"\n\nA brief account of the equipment and operation of the industrial and boarding schools will be given. There are of course, certain variations chiefly in the adequacy of the equipment. The method and the subject matter of instruction vary little in the different schools. Variations occur principally in the range and completeness of the instruction in the industrial arts. The half-day plan of academic instruction alternating with a half day of industrial training is the general rule. The number of pupils enrolled in these schools varies. Some have over 100 pupils and some have less than 100. In the larger schools, teachers, and instructors are engaged, and the principal or superintendent supervises and controls the operation of the institution. Some of these institutions work 1,000 acres. The boys do the work of sowing, planting and harvesting. Very often an institution is able to pay expenses of operation and maintenance from the per capita grant from the Government and from the proceeds of the produce of the soil, and still have a surplus left over. Extensive barns for the storage of crops, and for the raising and care of live stock, principally cattle and horses, usually form part of industrial schools.\n\nInformation concerning the qualifications, salaries, and tenure of office, of teachers in boarding and industrial schools, is not available, and therefore comparisons cannot be made. This much is certain, however, that conditions as to social intercourse and board and room, are generally more favourable in the residential schools than among day schools. It is therefore reasonable to expect that teachers who have inclinations toward work among Indians would probably be attracted more toward residential schools where social isolation, and in most cases, physical isolation, are reduced to a minimum.\nIn these residential schools, the average attendance is very high as compared to the average attendance in day schools. TABLE 12 gives the percentage attendance of the total enrolment in boarding and industrial schools from 1910 to 1921.\n\n**TABLE 12. Percentage Attendance of the total enrolment.**\n\n| Year | Day Schools | Boarding Schools | Industrial Schools |\n|------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| 1910 | 46.85       | 89.90            | 90.82             |\n| 1911 | 46.01       | 87.22            | 89.19             |\n| 1912 | 46.46       | 85.82            | 88.97             |\n| 1913 | 48.34       | 85.12            | 92.37             |\n| 1914 | 51.52       | 85.29            | 85.07             |\n| 1915 | 49.56       | 82.98            | 86.45             |\n| 1916 | 49.78       | 87.28            | 85.11             |\n| 1917 | 54.02       | 91.14            | 92.35             |\n| 1918 | 51.77       | 88.14            | 84.89             |\n| 1919 | 49.06       | 87.04            | 85.51             |\n| 1920 | 47.02       | 89.00            | 84.92             |\n| 1921 | 50.30       | 84.42            | 83.96             |\n\nDIAGRAM 7 shows a comparison in the percentage attendance in the different schools for the years 1910 - 1921 inclusive. It is clear that, in regard to regularity of attendance, the residential schools have a great advantage over the day schools.\n\nThe standard distribution is also not so disproportionate as in the day schools. TABLE 13 gives the standard distribution in industrial schools in percentages of the total enrolment for the years 1901, 1905, 1910, 1915, and 1921, and TABLE 14 shows these conditions in boarding schools.\n\n**TABLE 13.**\n\n| Year | I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1901 | 22.32 | 20.60 | 36.50 | 17.48 | 9.83 | 3.03 |\n| 1905 | 23.70 | 19.67 | 23.43 | 17.21 | 10.87 | 4.61 |\n| 1910 | 24.32 | 15.70 | 20.53 | 16.34 | 12.22 | 9.92 |\n| 1915 | 25.59 | 19.63 | 19.63 | 15.41 | 11.42 | 6.48 |\n| 1921 | 30.06 | 16.28 | 20.71 | 16.42 | 10.39 | 6.82 |\n\n**TABLE 14.**\n\n| Year | I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1901 | 39.93 | 21.95 | 19.97 | 12.20 | 5.05 | 0.91 |\n| 1905 | 35.53 | 19.43 | 23.15 | 13.23 | 6.85 | 2.23 |\n| 1910 | 33.20 | 21.31 | 18.57 | 14.48 | 9.38 | 2.79 |\n| 1915 | 39.57 | 18.64 | 18.45 | 13.64 | 16.76 | 2.62 |\n| 1921 | 39.20 | 17.03 | 19.11 | 13.27 | 7.59 | 3.53 |\n\nDIAGRAM 8 compares the standard distributions in day, boarding and industrial schools for the years 1910 and 1921.

More specifically, what percentage of the total enrolment in all are enrolled in day schools, in boarding schools, and in industrial schools, respectively? TABLE 15 gives the percentages for the years 1901, 1905, 1910, 1915 and 1921.\n\n**TABLE 15**\n\n| Year | Day Schools | Boarding Schools | Industrial Schools |\n|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| 1901 | 63.92       | 16.10           | 19.98             |\n| 1905 | 64.16       | 17.22           | 18.62             |\n| 1910 | 63.85       | 20.99           | 15.17             |\n| 1915 | 64.69       | 21.34           | 13.97             |\n| 1921 | 61.92       | 25.13           | 12.95             |\n\nThe downward trend of the percentages in industrial schools, and the upward trend in boarding schools is shown in Diagram 9. Day schools appear to hold their own in the proportion of pupils attending them.\n\nIn 1921, the expenditure for Indian education in Canada from parliamentary appropriations was $1,112,409.63 - Of this amount $102,993.86 were spent on day schools and the per pupil cost was $21.74 - The sum of $601,969.19 was spent on boarding schools and the per pupil cost was $190.74. The amount spent on industrial schools was $269,249.10 and the per pupil cost was $163.49.\n\nThe question may now be asked: What measure of success attends ex-pupils of Indian schools? Have the schools fulfilled the hope that was placed in them? There have evidently been doubts in the minds of Government officials as to the effectiveness of the system of schools among Indians. The Deputy-Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs reported in 1904, \"The questions have been raised repeatedly as to whether the existing method of education by day, boarding, and industrial schools as at present distributed and conducted is the best that can be devised for the education of the Indian youth, and again as to whether the potentialities of these schools are being exhausted.\" Again in 1906 he reports, \"The justification for the maintenance of industrial as compared with boarding schools depends mainly under existing circumstances upon an experimental solution of the question whether graduates who return to their reserves will retrograde under or elevate the conditions of their environment.\" In the Report for 1909 he stated \"The future of graduates from boarding and industrial schools also appear to demand close attention.\"\n\n\"An effort will be made to secure conditions which will make the most important event in a pupil's life, viz., graduation, a guarantee of fitness to assume its duties and responsibilities, and assistance financial and other will be provided to start the graduates at suitable occupations and in a fitting environment.\"\n\nAs has been already mentioned, the two principal ad-\nDiagram 9 - Showing proportion of pupils enrolled in the different kinds of schools for the years 1901, 1905, 1910, 1915, and 1921.\nvantages of boarding and industrial schools over day schools are the removal of pupils from retrogressive influences in the home and on the reserve, and the regularity of attendance made possible by the residence of pupils in these schools. So strong, however, are family ties, that graduates of these schools very often drift back to the reserves. There is no doubt that these graduates exert an elevating influence on the reserves not only on the contemporary generation, but the effect of the training received in these schools is also shown in the children of these graduates. But so powerful is the influence of environment, that very often graduates slip back to the ways and customs of their people living on these reserves. Methods of preventing this reversion to aboriginal ways have been considered, and probably the most interesting and significant is that of the establishment of a colony for ex-pupils at File Hills in the province of Saskatchewan. While this ex-pupil colony is still in the experimental stage, yet enough has been shown by results to warrant the expectation that the experiment is destined to be a successful one as far as the social adjustment of the Indian ex-pupil is concerned.\n\nIn 1901, 18,000 acres subdivided in 50-acre lots were set aside at File Hills in the province of Saskatchewan for the purpose of establishing a colony of the ex-pupils of File Hills Boarding School, and Qu'Appelle Industrial School. This colony, separate from any Indian reserve, is therefore free from any retrogressive influences that may be exerted by the parents of ex-pupils, or by the people of the reserves in general. In 1907 there were 20 families resident on this colony, and a total of 55 counting men, women, and children. A special report dealing with the File Hills ex-pupil colony was prepared in 1907 by Mr. W. M. Graham, Inspector of Indian Agencies. He reported in part as follows: \"I am happy to say that not only has the colony proved a success, but it has demonstrated, beyond doubt, that if the same methods were adopted in other parts of these territories, in twenty-five years the Indian population could be converted into thrifty and industrious people.\"\n\n\"Although the colony has been in existence only six years, the results obtained have been phenomenal, to my mind. I shall instance cases of young men leaving school seven years ago, at the age of eighteen, who are today settled in comfortable homes, married and have children, who are brought up as white children are, not even knowing the Indian tongue.\"\n\nThe special report then goes on to give the cases of the successes of ex-pupils. One case will suffice here. \"I shall next deal with the case of Mark Ward. This young man, after leaving the Qu'Appelle school, engaged with me as teamster and interpreter, and always drove me on my frequent trips to the colony. Seeing what was being accomplished, he became inspired with the desire to become a farmer here, and to my surprise asked me to be relieved of his position, which was worth $500.00 a year to him, so that he might go down and\nmake a home for himself. I persuaded the lad to remain in his position, for at least another year, and in the meantime to hire a man to drive his team, which he had bought with his earnings, and break land on the farm I allotted to him. In 1905 he went to the colony to reside.\"\n\n\"I visited this man's place the other day. He has a fine frame dwelling, two storeys high, containing five rooms and having a verandah round the front and side. It is plastered throughout and the kitchen is wainscotted (the house is worth $1500 at least). He has a large stable and four good horses, a complete outfit of farm machinery, consisting of a wagon, binder, seeder, walking and gang ploughs, sleighs, etc., besides the supply of tools usually found on a farm. He has an avenue of trees from the main road to his house. His barnyard presented quite a farm-like scene, there being in it pigs, poultry, calves and colts.\"\n\n\"Last year this man thrashed 2700 bushels of grain. This year his area for crop has been considerably increased over that of last year, as he had two outfits breaking new land all last summer. He will have over 150 acres in crop this summer.\"\n\n\"This man was brought to the Qu'Appelle industrial school from Poorman's reserve [Lougheed agency], and I am satisfied that, had he been sent back to that reserve at the time he left school, he would have fallen back to long hair and painted face and Indian customs as other Indian graduates have done who returned to that reserve about that time.\"\n\n\"Ward is now twenty-six years of age and is married to Margaret Duwent, who was for a number of years a servant in my house, and they have now a family of three small children, who are kept scrupulously clean and who cannot talk a word of Indian, which shows that that language is not spoken among these graduates in their homes.\"\n\nThis special report stated that there had been no infringements of the Indian Act in this colony, that these ex-pupils were strong supporters of the churches they now attend. It appears also that the remarkable progress made by these ex-pupils is not the result of spasmodic outbursts of initiative and industry, but that the progress is continuous and sustained.\n\nThese statements are found in various annual Reports on the colony since 1910. \"One of the most pleasing features of this colony is that it is practically out of debt. The whole guaranteed indebtedness to merchants at the time of writing this Report does not amount to $275.00.\" The population of the colony then was 134. \"Fully two-thirds of the doctor's visits to this colony are paid for by the Indians themselves.\" \"The parents evince a keen desire to have their children educated, and there is no need to canvass for them, as they are sent to school when of age without question.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to compare the per capita value of real and personal property, and also the per capita income\nof the colony with those of Saskatchewan, and Ontario. TABLE 16 shows the much greater per capita income of the graduates on the colony.\n\nTABLE 16.\n\n| Year | Colony | Capital & Personal Property | Colony | Income |\n|------|--------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n|      |        |                             |        |        |\n| 1914 | 3402.67| 1053.42                     | 167.44 | 306.68 |\n| 1915 | 2374.61| 1197.52                     | 325.48 | 302.60 |\n| 1916 | 2136.34| 1234.82                     | 331.48 | 106.08 |\n| 1917 | 2117.36| 1286.88                     | 332.35 | 436.34 |\n\nResults already appear to indicate that one of the most powerful factors in retardation or in progress as far as full citizenization is concerned is the social, physical, moral, intellectual, and spiritual environment. This experiment seems to show conclusively that environment and not heredity is the important controlling factor in the development of the Indians' native capacities in the direction of full citizenship. In a somewhat stagnant environment progress is slow, but in an environment where a spirit of industry and ambition prevail progress is rapid. It is fortunate that such is the case, as environment is subject to organized control, while hereditary transmission of characteristics is difficult to direct.\n\nBefore leaving the subject of the care of ex-pupils of boarding and industrial schools, it may be stated that at graduation pupils are sometimes given some material and practical help to start them on a career of usefulness and independence.\n\nFor the fiscal year 1921, $2,933.64 were spent in financial help for ex-pupils. The ex-pupils usually succeed to wipe out the debt in two or three years.\n\nThe industrial arts taught at industrial schools include carpentry, shoe-making, black-smithing, baking, and painting. The girls are usually taught sewing, general housework, in fact the branches of domestic science and economy which would be most useful to them. In some schools music is taught. The basic industry which is taught, however, is agriculture. The pupils are instructed in the care of live-stock, and in the growing and cropping of grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nThe Department has engaged instructors for the purpose of providing instruction and advice to Indian farmers on different reserves. Nurses are also engaged who travel from place to place rendering help and advice where opportunity offers. The Department has also from time to time issued circulars and pamphlets, written in a simple language, dealing with\nsuch questions as the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of children.\n\nTABLE 17 and DIAGRAM show the upward trend of expenditures on Indian education from Parliamentary appropriations since 1903. To these amounts should be added the amounts contributed toward Indian education by the various religious denominations, but accurate figures of these amounts are not obtainable. This is unfortunate as it is difficult to determine whether one of the reasons for the increasing expenditures from parliamentary appropriations is due to the heavier burden being placed on the Government by the decreasing amounts contributed by the churches, or not.\n\nTABLE 17\nAppropriation for Indian Education\n\n| Year | Amount ($) |\n|------|------------|\n| 1903 | 384,941.32 |\n| 1904 | 394,965.71 |\n| 1905 | 432,731.77 |\n| 1906 | 482,563.58 |\n| 1907 | 321,891.27 |\n| 1908 | 426,261.85 |\n| 1909 | 420,467.66 |\n| 1910 | 402,542.82 |\n| 1911 | 529,148.53 |\n| 1912 | 746,389.65 |\n| 1913 | 712,867.53 |\n| 1914 | 922,486.30 |\n| 1915 | 984,630.88 |\n| 1916 | 911,377.69 |\n| 1917 | 733,768.09 |\n| 1918 | 734,112.33 |\n| 1919 | 735,504.90 |\n| 1920 | 1057,662.74 |\n| 1921 | 1112,409.65 |\n\nSome bands willingly pay part or all of the expenses of education, paying teachers' salaries, and all expenses in connection with the maintenance of schools, from the funds of the band. In 1910 the amount contributed to education from these sources totalled $27,029.02 and in 1911, $47,296.53.\n\nDIAGRAM shows clearly that the Indians are becoming an agricultural class. The number of acres of land under cultivation has steadily increased. There has been an increase in the number of acres under cultivation per capita, as the population has been fairly stationary at 105,000.\n\nTABLE 18 shows the population for the different years.\n\nTABLE 18\nPopulation of Indians\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1880 | 105,690    |\n| 1890 | 122,585    |\n| 1900 | 99,010    |\n| 1901 | 99,527    |\n| 1902 | 106,112    |\n| 1903 | 106,233    |\n| 1904 | 107,978    |\n| 1905 | 107,637    |\n| 1906 | 109,394    |\n| 1907 | 110,345    |\n| 1908 | 110,265    |\n| 1909 | 112,043    |\n| 1910 | 104,314    |\n| 1911 | 103,661    |\n| 1912 | 104,956    |\n| 1913 | 102,490    |\n| 1914 | 102,774    |\n| 1915 | 103,931    |\n| 1916 | 105,561    |\n| 1917 | 105,998    |\n| 1918 | 105,998    |\n| 1919 | 105,998    |\n| 1920 | 105,998    |\n| 1921 | 105,998    |\nDiagram 10 - Showing upward trend in expenditures on Indian education from Parliamentary appropriations since 1923.\n| Year | Acres under cultivation |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 1931 | 221827                 |\n| 1920 | 218024                 |\n| 1919 | 216686                 |\n| 1918 | 177274                 |\n| 1917 | 178020                 |\n| 1916 | 173198                 |\n| 1915 | 168510                 |\n| 1914 | 170999                 |\n| 1905 | 136725                 |\n| 1901 | 106572                 |\n| 1890 | 96547                  |\n| 1880 | 73787                  |\n\nDiagram II\n| Year | Value of farm products including hay | Value of beef used for food | Wages earned | Rent from land rentals & timber | Earnings by fishing | Other industries and occupations | Hunting and trapping | Annuities paid and interest on trust fund | Total income |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 1900 | $765,145.87                       | $323,468.00                 | $781,495.66  | $30,489.79                    | $584,750.00         | $884,359.31                 | $470,279.21     | $8,432,701.10                           | $8,432,701.10|\n| 1905 | $1,129,267.89                     | $369,506.00                 | $1,621,729.74| $51,070.71                    | $406,958.55         | $692,180.98                 | $610,620.49     | $8,556,364.86                           | $8,556,364.86|\n| 1910 | $1,374,805.00                     | $307,779.00                 | $1,834,199.00| $94,215.00                    | $590,651.00         | $737,805.00                 | $827,826.00     | $8,691,991.41                           | $8,691,991.41|\n| 1915 | $1,813,619.00                     | $340,792.00                 | $1,419,244.00| $61,160.00                    | $586,781.00         | $632,118.00                 | $654,501.00     | $8,790,820.00                           | $8,790,820.00|\n| 1916 | $2,246,507.00                     | $346,782.00                 | $1,530,973.00| $117,128.00                   | $555,525.00         | $583,299.00                 | $790,820.00     | $8,900,488.41                           | $8,900,488.41|\n| 1917 | $2,351,607.00                     | $328,265.00                 | $1,748,588.00| $109,743.00                   | $721,988.00         | $608,218.00                 | $797,183.00     | $9,000,488.41                           | $9,000,488.41|\n| 1918 | $2,634,149.00                     | $484,419.00                 | $2,048,137.00| $137,468.00                   | $945,827.00         | $1,514,499.00               | $1,714,988.00   | $10,228,941.85                          | $10,228,941.85|\n| 1919 | $3,140,046.00                     | $490,418.00                 | $2,396,449.00| $166,289.00                   | $1,514,499.00       | $2,021,618.00               | $1,714,988.00   | $10,670,949.76                          | $10,670,949.76|\nThe aggregate number of bushels of grains and roots produced for the years indicated in TABLE 19 also show a steady increase.\n\n**TABLE 19.**\n\n| Year | Grain (Bus) Aggregate | Roots (Bus) Aggregate |\n|------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1880 | 268,773               | 152,577               |\n| 1890 | 427,487               | 270,394               |\n| 1900 | 666,012               | 481,888               |\n| 1905 | 816,487               | 448,918               |\n| 1910 | 1060,377              | 521,912               |\n| 1915 | 1048,107              | 592,451               |\n| 1920 | 1217,401              | 532,354               |\n| 1921 | 1496,229              | 611,976               |\n\nTABLE 20 shows the number of horses, cattle, other stock, and poultry owned by Indians on reserves for the years indicated. Evidently the increase in the number of live-stock raised by Indians has not kept pace with the increase in the area under cultivation, nor with the increase in the amount of grain produced. It would be safe to venture the opinion that instead of using the grain produced for the raising of more live-stock, the Indian farmers are selling the grain.\n\n**TABLE 20.**\n\n| Year | Horses | Cattle | Other Stock | Poultry |\n|------|--------|--------|-------------|---------|\n| 1900 | 35347  | 31478  | 16245       | 69310   |\n| 1905 | 33117  | 44972  | 15048       | 71586   |\n| 1910 | 32832  | 40743  | 14760       | 70936   |\n| 1915 | 33795  | 35760  | 12351       | 102857  |\n| 1921 | 35159  | 37656  | 15009       | 121074  |\n\nIn 1914, it was estimated that 18,849 Indians were still engaged in hunting trapping, and fishing, and in 1916 the number still so engaged was estimated at 11,348.\n\nTABLE 21 shows the sources and value of income of Indians for the ears indicated. During the 21 years the value of farm products including hay has been quadrupled; the wages earned have almost been quadrupled; the amount earned from fishing has been doubled; the amount earned from other industries and occupations has been also doubled; and the income from hunting and trapping has been almost doubled.\nTABLE 22 shows the per capita income of Indians in the different provinces from 1915 to 1921.

It is evident that even in the matter of shelter the Indians have had to adapt themselves to changing conditions. A roving people and a fixed abode are entirely contrary. Superstition has also prevented more rapid adjustment in the matter of shelter as can be gathered from the following words in the Report for 1899: \"In this as in almost all directions something has been undone before anything can be accomplished, for so long as the superstition which keeps an Indian from inhabiting a house in which a death has occurred prevails, he is not likely to go to much expense or trouble to erect what he feels he may have at any time to pull down or abandon.\" Where conditions are most adverse, the Indians are evincing an increasing readiness to den themselves in other directions in order to purchase lumber and shingles, and there are few if any reserves where in the course of a year one or two houses are not erected, and they are almost without exception, an improvement on those which they replace.\"\n\nDuring the same year (1899) a special inspection was made of the dwellings of the Indians on the Blood Reserve in what was at that time the North West Territories. In all 160 houses were inspected, over 100 of these houses had turf roofs, 44 had only the natural clay floors. In the Report of 1900, these statements are found. \"Varied as are the circumstances and surroundings of the Indians scattered over the Dominion, their dwellings range from the primitive one-roomed cabin built of logs, unheated, and roofed with mud to a class of residence, while inferior to some, are yet superior to many occupied by many white residents in the country.\"\n\nThe best houses are to be found among the farming com-\nmunities of Ontario, and in the villages in Quebec and British Columbia, a large proportion being excellent frame structures of modern pattern.\"\n\nThe influence of environment in the matter of dwelling houses as in other matters is again evident here. The Deputy Superintendent General reported as follows in 1922. \"The steady advancement of such of the Indians as live in contact with the whites and have adopted industrial methods, is clearly evidenced by improvement in their houses and other buildings.\"\n\n\"In the older provinces, where the Indians have through the long course of years become largely imbued with the sentiments, manners, and customs of surrounding communities, their houses, generally speaking, are, in proportion to their means, as good as those of their neighbours and meet the requirements of their circumstances.\"\n\nTABLE 23 will give an idea of the improvement in housing conditions. In 1880 there were 7032 houses and huts. Nearly half the Indian population must have been very inadequately housed at that time. From the figures in TABLE 23 it is evident that the stone, brick, and frame dwellings have increased in number since 1900. In 1900 there were 7660 log shanties and in 1915 there were 7603 log shanties.

This applies to both TABLES 24 and 25. Other cases such as those of toothache and diseases of the stomach, while numerous enough, have not been mentioned. In the Report of 1910 Dr. P. H. Bryce, Chief Medical Officer, stated \"It is apparent here, as in the general statistics of the past five years, that were it not for tuberculosis the Indian people would be exceptionally free from disease.\" Again in the Report of 1912 Dr. Bryce stated \"From the reports of previous years one would expect what we do find, that the reports of medical officers from every province again indicate that the one disease which everywhere dominates is, with a few exceptions, tuberculosis\". The death rate has been very high in some bands. That the death rate has varied can be seen from TABLE 26 which shows the death rate per thousand in different bands for 1908.\n\nTABLE 26.\n\n| Band                  | Death Rate per Thousand |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Six Nations           | 18.9                    |\n| Chippewas of Walpole Is. | 38.6                |\n| Chippewas of Saugan   | 15.1                    |\n| Chippewas of Currie   | 52.0                    |\n| Mohawks of La. of Q.  | 6.0                     |\n| Chippewas of Nama     | 52.0                    |\n| Chippewas of Nawash   | 23.5                    |\n| Pelicans of McLeod    | 70.7                    |\n\nEfforts have been made to curb the ravages of tuberculosis among Indians by removal to sanatoria, and by the circulation of circulars written in simple language and even in native languages calling attention to the simple laws of hygiene and the ways of preventing tuberculosis. Vaccination is practised extensively.\n\nTABLE 27 shows the birth rate and death rate for all Canada among Indians for the years indicated.\n\nTABLE 27.\n\n| Year | Birth Rate per 1000 | Death Rate per 1000 |\n|------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1901 | 29.2                | 26.4                |\n| 1903 | 24.8                | 24.9                |\n| 1905 | 31.5                | 28.4                |\n| 1907 | 26.5                | 24.5                |\n| 1909 | 27.7                | 25.6                |\n| 1911 | 25.3                | 24.6                |\n| 1913 | 25.9                | 23.9                |\n| 1915 | 26.9                | 24.0                |\n| 1917 | 26.9                | 24.2                |\nHere again in the matter of health environment had a powerful influence. Diseases disappear from among bands in proportion as these bands acquire the hygienic habits of the white people. Disease is evidently intimately related to the problem of housing. It is to be expected that, generally speaking, the healthier bands would be those which are contiguous to progressive districts. Dr. Bryce in his Report for 1912 stated, \"It would appear as before remarked that we have within the work of the Indian Department itself a practical example of how its most difficult problem is to be solved. In this it has been shown that agricultural progress has gone hand in hand with social advancement and both along with a steadily increasing and high degree of health.\"\n\nThere are unmistakable evidences that Indian languages or dialects are disappearing, and the English, and the French languages being substituted therefor. Here again the influence of environment is beyond doubt the important factor in this substitution. It is not rare to find Indian children in bands of well settled parts of the country unable to speak or even understand a word of the native language of their parents. Even in homes where the parents converse in their native language, the children are gradually forgetting the Indian language. To ascertain the extent to which the school children of the Six Nations are discarding their native language, a questionnaire was sent to each teacher on the Six Nations reserve in 1919. Returns were received regarding 330 school children. Of the 330 school children 132 or 40% could not speak their native language fluently and many of these could not even understand a statement in the Indian language. 317 of these 330 school children, or 96% could speak English fluently. Only 13 could not speak English fluently. It is significant that in one of the largest bands in Canada where the number of people would tend to preserve the native language, such a large percentage of the rising generation are no longer able to use the language of their fathers and forefathers, freely. In smaller bands where the frequency of contact with white people would be greater this process of substitution would be more rapid.\n\nThere are several reasons for this situation and only the more important reasons will be indicated here. In the first place the language of instruction in schools is the English or the French. In the great majority of cases the teachers cannot speak or understand a word of the Indian language. Even if the teacher is able to speak Indian, it is used only to elucidate the meaning of English words or sentences. In the second place a knowledge of English is absolutely necessary in commercial and trade dealings with white people. In the third place the English language is superior to the Indian language for the expression of ideas. TABLE 28 gives a comparison of the number of syllables used in native dialects and in English in the expression of common ideas.\n| Syllables | Mohawk | Tuscarora | Seneca | English |\n|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|\n| Go to school | 6 | 6 | 8 | 3 |\n| Ask the teacher | 12 | 8 | 10 | 4 |\n| Jump | 7 | 4 | 4 | 1 |\n| Run | 5 | 4 | 3 | 1 |\n| Hungry | 5 | 4 | 5 | 2 |\n| Throw the ball | 7 | 5 | 5 | 3 |\n| Lend me your pencil | 8 | 7 | 9 | 5 |\n| Read this | 9 | 8 | 7 | 2 |\n| Flour | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |\n| Bread | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 |\n| Potatoes | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 |\n| Sugar | 4 | 4 | 4 | 2 |\n| Horse | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 |\n| Cow | 3 | 3 | 4 | 1 |\n\nIf a school child can express \"Ask the Teacher\" in English in four syllables, and in eight to twelve syllables in native dialects, he will use the English language. Furthermore, the Indian language has not kept pace with the progress of knowledge. Consequently, the range of the Indian vocabulary does not at all compare with the range of the English vocabulary. For instance, there are no Indian words for telephone, automobile, aeroplane, electricity. Practically, the only books written in Indian languages are the translations of portions of the Bible. As far as can be ascertained, there is not an Indian grammar in existence. From a consideration of the reasons for their substitution, it would seem safe to predict that the Indian languages would eventually disappear.\n\nThe expenditures for relief, medical attendance, and medical supplies, and supplies for destitutes from parliamentary appropriations have increased since 1903 although not steadily. Expenditures increased steadily from 1903 to 1907 and since 1907 the increase has been gradual. Diagram 1 shows the steady rise in such expenditures for all Canada, for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and for New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia. There is a drop in the curve for 1907 as the expenditure for that fiscal year was for 9 months only. There is also a downward trend for 1917, and 1918, when the Government of Canada decided to cut down expenses on account of the heavy war expenses. Just when the curve will turn downward is hard to say, but there are indications that that time is not far distant. It may be stated that one important cause of the upward trend is the increasing number of Indians who are being brought under well organized control. From a consideration of these amounts expended on Indians, and from other considerations also, one is tempted to venture a suspicion that the Government of Canada has perhaps erred on the side of liberality and indulgence in the treatment of the Indians of Canada. Now is the suspicion confined to people living outside of reserves, but it shared also by observant and educated Indians living on reserves. Treaty moneys distributed annually to Indians sometimes prove a curse. Full development of native capacities under such circumstances...\nis bound to be retarded and sometimes even prevented.\n\nProbably one of the most difficult problems in connection with Indian Affairs is the task of persuading the Indians to take on the full responsibilities of citizenship. There is no doubt at all that there are individual Indians and even bands especially in the older provinces, who are ready to assume such responsibilities. Yet it has been found that instead of desiring the privileges of full citizenship, Indians as a rule prefer to remain as they are. It is probable that the years of Government protection which have had some influence in inculcating this attitude toward citizenship. It is extremely unfortunate that the appeal of this privilege to Indians is so weak.\n\nPrior to 1920 the clauses in the Indian Act which related to enfranchisement required a tutelage of six years before an Indian could be enfranchised. These clauses have been on the statutes since 1857 and only 102 persons have been enfranchised under these clauses during the period of 63 years.\n\nIn 1918 Parliament passed an amendment to the Indian Act with regard to enfranchisement enabling the Governor General-in-Council to enfranchise, on application, all Indians who have no land on reserves and who are willing to adopt their share of the funds of the band and to give up any title to the lands on the reserve. Under this clause 441 Indians of the Six Nations had been enfranchised up to March 25, 1923. While the clause applies to the Indians in any part of Canada the number of Indians in other parts of Canada who have been enfranchised under this section is only a fraction of the 441 Six Nation Indians enfranchised. Up to 1920 the total number of Indians enfranchised since Confederation was 360.\n\nAt the session of 1920 Parliament passed new sections relating to enfranchisement, giving the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs power to make inquiry and report from time to time as to the fitness of any Indian or Indians for enfranchisement. The Governor General-in-Council acting on these reports was given authority by these sections, to enfranchise an Indian and his wife and minor unmarried children forthwith. These clauses have never yet been put into operation. It may be mentioned that at the time of reading of the bill strenuous objections were made thereto by Indians, claiming that it was compulsory and that it meant the dissolution of reserves.\n\nWhile it would be exceedingly interesting to examine more minutely and comprehensively the influence of environment upon the Indians' progress or upon his retardation in the process of racial and social assimilation, still sufficient has been shown to warrant the statement that such process bears a distinct relation to the frequency of contact with the assimilating group. Adoption of agriculture is most rapid among bands in well settled parts of Canada. Appreciation of the value of education is greater among bands where commercial and trade dealings with the white people are most frequent, and the substitution of the English language for the Indian\nlanguage is affected more speedily also in such bands. Ex-pupils of boarding and industrial schools revert back to aboriginal customs if they return to reserves, but retain their advantage if placed in a suitable environment. Housing conditions, birth rate, and death rate, degree of self independence all are closely related to proximity of, and intercourse with, a more highly developed community. There is no doubt at all that the physical isolation resulting from segregation on reserves, and social isolation resulting from differences in customs and languages have in the past operated to retard normal social change. There is danger that under such conditions Indian societies may become static and stagnation prevail. Yet in spite of these disadvantages, the progress of the Indians toward usefulness and efficiency appears to have been rapid.\n\nFinally we must give a brief account of the part played by the Indians of Canada in the Great War. Over 4,000 Indians, or approximately 35% of the Indian male population of military age in the nine provinces enlisted for active service in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces. On some reserves only the old men and women and children were left to care for the work of the homes. The total contribution of the Indians of Canada to patriotic and other war funds amounted to $44,546.46. Red Cross societies and Patriotic leagues were formed on many reserves by Indian women. Innumerable various comforts for the soldiers, knitted socks, sweaters and mufflers, were made. The services of the Indians were absolutely voluntary, as they were exempted especially from the operation of the Military Service Act. Like their comrades, they also did acts of heroism, daring, and self-sacrifice. Quite a number did not return, as they found their resting places among their comrades from Canada, or from Britain.\n\nThose who have returned to the reserves are exerting a beneficial influence on the life of the reserve. Returned Indian soldiers brought back with them, a measure of the discipline of army life, an appreciation of the necessity of organization, a broad-mindedness, and a culture resulting from travel in European countries, towns and villages. In France they were Indian Canadians and their badge was the Maple Leaf. The range of their thinking is no longer confined to the boundaries of their reserves or even to the boundaries of Canada, but their minds turn quite often to Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany and especially to the grave-yards where rest those of their number who made the sacrifice. There is now a link connecting them to these countries of Europe. Indian fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and relatives feel this same bond. An education of incalculable value has been derived from the Great War.\n\nThe Indian Department soon after the war took the responsibility of administering the Soldier Settlement Act among returned Indian soldiers on the reserves. The Report for 1921 states, \"Since this work was undertaken by the Department, 330 applications for loans have been received and 184 granted. The total amount expended to date amounts to $321,269.51.\"\n\"The Indians have met their payments in a very satisfactory manner and the Department looks forward to much larger repayments next year. So far a large number have not yet fallen due, but the total repayment to date of $18,496 is very creditable. In fact very few Indians have failed to meet their payments, while a considerable number on all reserves, have repaid more than called upon to do.\"\n\nThe destiny of the Indians of Canada appears to be fairly well defined. Their identity as full blooded Indians is being lost. Among the Six Nations Indians not one can be found who has preserved his or her native blood from intermixture with white blood and this intermixture of white blood is going on throughout Canada. Consequently the copper colour is disappearing and brown and black eyes, and black hair, are giving place to blue eyes and fair hair. Beads, feathers and buckskin have practically been wholly discarded. Hunting and trapping as means of livelihood are now confined mainly to bands living on the outskirts of settlement, and agriculture, the trades, and the professions are claiming increasing numbers of the Indians. Paganism has been displaced from supremacy in spiritual matters by Christianity. Sometimes a language is forgotten in one generation, and each succeeding generation continues to substitute the English or the French language for the native languages. Social customs are conforming more and more to the social customs of the white race. It seems to be only a question of time when the Indians will have completely disappeared from Canada by racial, and social assimilation, and museums will provide the only material evidences of the existence of a former race. We must leave to future historians the writing of the account of the contribution of the Indians of Canada to Canadian life. However, long after the Indians of Canada will have disappeared, the Indian names which have been woven into the geography of Canada will remain, and it may be well to preserve the English equivalents of these place names while there is opportunity.\n\nAddendum:\n\nIn 1930 amendments to the Indian Act were passed relating to education. The substance of these amendments enables the Department to establish a system of compulsory education at both day and residential schools. Prior to the passing of these amendments the Act did not give the Governor in Council power to make regulations enforcing the residence and attendance of Indian children at residential schools, as the Department could only commit to a residential school when a day school is provided, and the child does not attend. The clauses apply to every Indian child over the age of 7 and under the age of 15.\n26 Gloucester St.,\nToronto, Ontario\nNov. 17, 1922.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI am sending by separate cover a copy of the thesis I prepared on \"The Education of the Indians of Canada\" for the M.A. degree from Toronto University. Any criticism or suggestions in regard to the thesis would be greatly appreciated. I may state that I have agreed to undertake, under the direction of Dr. Peter Macintosh of the Ontario College of Education, a much more exhaustive treatment of the subject. You can understand, therefore, that I am looking for helpful criticisms or suggestions. Suggestions on the lines of investigation or research are earnestly desired.\n\nI wish now to thank you and other officials of the Indian Department for the help which was given me. I sincerely hope that your services may not be in vain, and that the Department will not consider any further assistance misplaced.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nElmo J. Macdonald\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 20, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nWould you kindly read the attached thesis on the Education of the Indians of Canada and make any possible suggestions.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nPersonal.\n\nOttawa, Dec. 18, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Jamieson:\n\nI have yours of the first instant, enclosing a manuscript offered to you some time ago. Dr. Scott handed me your thesis on the education of the Indians of Canada; he advised me to write to you direct in this connection.\n\nIf you are going to prepare a more exhaustive treatment, I believe you would be well advised to spend some time visiting Indian schools, both day and residential, in the various parts of our Dominion. The problem divides itself, geographically, as follows: Maritime Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie Provinces, Northern Schools (Ontario, Prairie Provinces, North West Territories & Yukon) and British Columbia. In each of these six divisions the problem is fairly uniform but quite distinct from that in the other five localities. I have found in my travels that there is a distinct child psychology and a different attitude towards constituted authority.\n\nYour thesis, as far as an understanding of the Indian problem is concerned, has really an Eastern flavour and is sometimes not fair, particularly to the prairie Province Indian. On the other hand, the Maritime Indian presents a more sordid picture than you have painted, so I feel that if you are to prepare a further writing, you would be well advised to get into more personal touch with either the work itself or with Indian gentlemen from the various parts of the Dominion, who can give you an insight into the local native philosophy.\n\nI must congratulate you on your effort. I have enjoyed reading it and have taken the liberty to prepare a table of contents, a copy of which is enclosed. I did this for my own information, and I am also asking your permission to copy certain of the statistics and some of the diagrams. This may not be necessary if you are able to leave the copy we have at present with the Department. Kindly inform me in this connection.\n\nElmer Jamieson, Esq.,\n26 Gloucester St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nMy letter -\nMy letter is not complete and I am not fair to either you or myself if I do not offer my criticism regarding the thesis from the standpoint of composition. I am convinced you should have put more time on the establishing of a definite continuity. A thesis of this length should, I believe, not only carry with it a table of contents but the pages should be numbered and each main division of the writing should be clearly connected with the whole. I believe it is not sufficient in a lengthy article to take for granted that coherence will look after itself. Each portion bears a relationship to the whole - why not establish it? It might have been well to have divided your work into chapters, in view of its length.\n\nI make this criticism in a kindly way, and I wish to assure you that it is my sole aim to be of service to you. May the Department keep this copy that we now have? If so, both Mr. Scott and myself would be extremely grateful. In a later communication, I will be pleased to discuss with you three or four points in your thesis at which we are at variance. These are details but may form subject matter for profitable discussion.\n\nMay I wish you the Compliments of the approaching season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI received your communication concerning the thesis some time ago. I wish to thank you in the first place for your kindly criticism. It was because of a consciousness of the imperfections and the incompleteness of the thesis that I decided to undertake further investigations in this field. I have also enclosed a plan of the thesis. I wish to state also that I would be glad to have the Department keep the copy of the thesis, and, so far as I am concerned, there are no objections to copying some of the statistical tables and diagrams.\n\nI would indeed welcome discussion of some of the problems in connection with Indian work. In a later communication I wish to ask some questions raised by your communication.\n\nIf it is practically possible a determination of the intelligence of the Indians by means of some non-language test in the case of Indians who cannot speak or read the English language fully, and by some other intelligence test in the case of those who speak and read English will be attempted in the future investigations. It seems to me that much can be\nlearned by such a study. A study of this kind, so far as my knowledge serves me, carried out in either Canada or the United States, general ideas as to the nature and weakness of the Indians are not sufficient. Once the intelligence is fairly determined, perhaps practical applications could be made. However, I shall have more to say on this matter later on.\n\nIndians employed in Canada do not have noted with a great deal of satisfaction the past increase in Parliamentary appropriation for Indian education for this year. The solution of the Indian problem lies in education.\n\nThank you again for your suggestions and criticisms.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nElmo Jamieson\nPersonal.\n\nOttawa, Feb. 27, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Jamieson:\n\nI have your letter of yesterday's date, and in reply I wish to thank you for permission to keep the copy of your thesis. If I have occasion to use any of the statistical tables, or diagrams, I will mention your authorship. Mr. Scott joins with me in congratulating you again on your effort, and indeed, upon your general success. We have fought hard this year for a special appropriation, and a half million of an increase for educational purposes was our reward.\n\nI would be very pleased to learn of your plans in connection with the intelligence test you propose to undertake. Your suggestion that practical applications might be made is very true, and I always have one ear open for any suggestions that will indicate new methods in connection with my work, or new approaches to the problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

I wish to assure you that it is the aim of this Department to gradually employ better qualified teachers for our schools, and increased parliamentary appropriations are being requested from year to year.\n\nAs you are aware, we look to the various churches engaged in Indian work to nominate missionary teachers for many of the day schools, and the good general influence on the reserve, of these Christian workers often offsets any loss in classroom efficiency attendant upon inadequate or no professional qualifications. When Parliament is fully seized with the importance of educating our wards, we will be able to offer larger salaries to prospective teachers and we can then demand properly certificated workers.\n\nMay I wish you the Compliments of the Season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

You state that you have sent two registers to the teacher of this school and I presume you have also directed her to keep the registers up to date. I would suggest that when new forms of returns that go forward to the Department are made, a column might be added showing the number of days in which the pupils attend class room. This would be a source of a good deal of information to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 404-11 of the 3rd instant, with reference to the showing on the Inspector's Reports of the number of days on which the pupils attend the classroom activities. This would entail considerable of the Inspector's time, and, as our quarterly returns give these facts in detail, I am in doubt as to the advisability of having the information incorporated in the Inspector's Reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of April 9th No.1-1-1 regarding returns sent in from the Ermineskin Boarding school.\n\nInspector Fuller, in his report on this school, dated Dec. 11th, 1922, pointed out that as no registers were kept it was impossible to tell how many days the pupils were in the class-rooms. In forwarding that report I drew attention to this and asked that the teachers be instructed to keep registers and expressed surprise that the failure to do so had not been detected before by the Department, as I thought this information should have been embodied in the returns forwarded to them at the end of each quarter.\n\nIn your reply dated March 28th, No.11720--6 you stated as follows:\n\n\"Two registers will be sent to the school.\n\"I might point out that the Department cannot judge by the returns from the schools whether or not the registers are being kept.\"\n\nIn my reply dated April 3rd I recommended that the teachers be directed to keep these registers and suggested that a column be added to the returns from the school so that the number of days the pupils were in the class-room might be shown on the return, as I considered this would give much valuable information to the Department.\n\nI am now informed in your letter of April 9th that the quarterly returns do give these facts.\n\nI cannot reconcile your two statements. If these facts are given, the natural deduction would be that daily registers are kept and yet you say you have no way of judging from the returns whether this is done. I would ask, how else would it be possible to have this information for the returns? The Inspector stated that registers were not kept and my conclusion was that information as to class-room attendance would not therefore\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ntherefore appear on the returns and naturally I wondered why the Department had not noticed this omission. I am at a loss to know how the returns can show accurate information unless registers are kept.\n\nI did not suggest any change in regard to the Inspector's reports. My recommendations dealt entirely with the school returns.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 404-11 of the 14th instant, in which you refer to previous correspondence regarding the keeping of registers in the classrooms at residential schools and the quarterly return forms. I have noted that you cannot reconcile two statements contained in my communication No. 117201-6 of the 28th ultimo and my No. 1-1-1 of the 9th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that there is a column on the quarterly return form for residential schools, for the purpose of showing the number of days pupils were in the classroom. However, we are unable to determine whether or not registers are being properly kept from day to day. Registers should be entered regularly; if the column mentioned above is to give correct information; but it is only when an officer visits the school that we have any assurance that a daily tally is placed on the registers provided for the purpose.\n\nI agree with you that the quarterly returns will not give accurate information unless registers are kept. It is possible, however, that some principals of residential schools, where there is a regular routine of manual work and classroom instruction, fill in the column in our quarterly return with the number of school days for the quarter. Principals realize that the contiguous column, showing the number of days the pupil was in residence, is the important one on the return, inasmuch as per capita earnings are computed from the facts contained therein. The column showing classroom attendance should also receive meticulous care in the preparation thereof, and it may be necessary to direct communications to the principals of our residential schools if we find that the information is being supplied in a careless fashion and apparently without reference to classroom registers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

They are interested in this problem in Ontario only, as far as we are aware.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. C. Carlson, Esq.,\nC/o Frank Powell, Esq.,\nSopias, N. D.,\nU. S. A.\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I am speaking of the item of $15,900, which last year was $38,180. There is a decrease of $42,280 over last year's appropriation there, and that comes out of the general appropriation for repairs, fences, bridges and drainage. The other items are the same as last year.\n\nSir HENRY DRAYTON: What are they?\n\nMr. STEVENS: The minister is not quite correct in stating that the other items are the same. There is an increase of $15,000 for relief, and while speaking on this matter he has admitted to this most extraordinary coincidence right through. The increased relief in Nova Scotia of $14,000 more than doubles the vote for relief in Ontario and Quebec represents an increase of $15,000, and in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta the increase for supplies and so on is $18,000, and for hospitals, medical attendance, etc., $16,000.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The increased relief in Nova Scotia is made up by a corresponding reduction in miscellaneous. It is a changing of the allocation.\n\nMr. STEVENS: As far as Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are concerned, that is not so.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The increase of $18,962 in Manitoba and Saskatchewan is accounted for by the additional supplies provided to meet treaty obligations with the Indians of the Great Lakes and the Mackenzie river district numbering 3,000 Indians. It is the first time we have issued relief to these Indians who have come in under treaty obligations made by Mr. Conroy some two years ago.\n\nMr. STEVENS: Why the increase in Ontario?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): There is a decrease of $15,000 in the general vote. It is simply a transfer for book-keeping purposes taken from the general vote and applied to Ontario for relief purposes.\n\nMr. STEVENS: How much was spent last year?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): These transfers are confusing and give rise to difficulty in making explanations, but I am told by the accountant that the $15,000 has not been voted direct for relief purposes; it has been paid out of this fund for years. It appears now directly for relief purposes for Ontario and Quebec rather than in the general item number 278.\n\nMr. FORKE: Mr. Chairman, in referring to the Indians of Manitoba I do not suppose I am likely to say anything that the hon. minister does not already know, but I think it well to make a statement as to their condition. I live near a reserve, and some twenty miles distant, near Brandon, we have a small large reserve. The condition of the Indians on those reserves is deplorable; there is no denying that fact. While I was at home at Easter I received a deputation of eight or ten Indians who came in a very ill and indigent manner, the story of the conditions that exist upon the reserves. We hear a great deal about the hard times among the farmers in Ontario, Canada, men who have not been acquainted with the sort of work, who come down from generations of farmers, yet are hardly able to make a living. I found Indians on the reserve without stock, without implements, without anything with which they could make a living; yet they have been existing. It seems to me that we are slowly starving these people to death. It is a very hard thing to talk about the Indians and his characteristics, their lack of ability to take care of himself under modern conditions, but that is perhaps a rather hard-hearted way of looking at things. I have been into the north and taken the places of these Indians, people who have been used to a nomadic life, who from generation to generation have lived the life of the hunter, knowing nothing of modern conditions. They are put in a reserve and told to make their living.\n\nI remember a statement made to me by the late Glen Campbell, at one time a member of this House. He was commissioner of Indian police with jurisdiction over the Indians from the Great Lakes to the foot of the Rockies. I once had the pleasure of going with him over the Sarcee Indian reserve at Calgary, a splendid reserve, with good grazing, being capable of taking care of a great many cattle and stock of all kinds. I remember while admiring the reserve and the desirable place the Indians had there, that he mentioned the Indians to me were not for the red tape at Ottawa he could make all these Indians rich. I wonder if there was any truth in that statement? I do not know, but that is what he said. Possibly the Indians are ruled a little too much by red tape, without the application of any great knowledge of the conditions that prevail on the reserves. I am satisfied that it is no use to supply the Indians with anything except stock and seed and implements and then expect them to take care of their stock and make a good living for themselves. As long as these reserves are managed and operated from an office the business is run which is characterized by nothing more than red tape and accurate book-\nkeeping, we are going to have a continuance of the present conditions.\n\nRemember, I am not finding fault with any of the officials, nor am I directing any special criticism against the reserve itself; but it is not the proper system. The agent on a reserve should be something more to the Indians than an official; he should be their adviser, their friend, even more than that, he should almost be a father to them by giving his advice and assistance in all matters pertaining to their work. As those who know them say, the Indians have an almost childlike temperament. I do not say they are deficient in intellect; in fact, in intellectual ability they will compare with the white man. But they lack the white man's assistance, his stick-to-it-ness, his care about his work day after day and carrying out his agricultural activities. I also know that if the agent on a reserve has the confidence of the Indians they will all come to him for advice, and until the government appoint agents who will be something more than officials, who will do something more than carry out simply what the minister tells them to do, so long will the condition respecting the Indian continue as it is in Manitoba.\n\nI think it is a disgrace that Canada should allow its Indians to be in such a condition that they are in at the present time. It was almost pathetic to listen to the stories of some of these men. They went back many years and told me of the arrangements made whereby they became the wards of the government. They told me of how loyal they had been; that when the war broke out they sent their young men over to the front some of whom had done good service in Canada. Those who returned went back on the reserve; they have made a bad mess of it; they are unable to make a living and it is no exaggeration to say that there are starving Indians who live near them know the facts. At my own place we often feed the Indians because we know they are really hungry and need something more than they alone. Now I want the government to get acquainted with the facts; to look into the conditions that exists on the reserve; and when the inspector goes around, let him do a little more than enter the agent's office and see that the books are properly kept. I would like to see him get in contact with the Indians, find out what their complaints are, some of the actual conditions under which they are living, and whether something cannot be done to make life a little more pleasant for them. In the harvest time the Indians will go out and work well for a month or six weeks, and get big wages, but when they get a little money they go into the town and buy all the canned goods they can get hold of. They are improvident.\n\nII p.m., there is no use denying that, and therefore, someone to take care of them. I have no doubt that the minister is aware of these facts and is anxious to do something to help the Indians. I want to make this appeal on behalf of the Indians; I know them that the country do a little more for them; that something be done to help them to help themselves; to get them on the way to making a fairly decent living and not actually starve as they are doing at present on the reserve.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Shall the item carry?\n\nSir HENRY DRAYTON: I think we should hear from the minister; it is news to the committee that we have starving Indians.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The item is for Ontario and Quebec.\n\nSir HENRY DRAYTON: There may be some in Ontario and Quebec, though I do not know any.\n\nMr. STEWART (Annette): I had intended to make a statement with respect to the Indian department generally. The matter is a very important one to which I have given some considerable attention and I am prepared to make a statement with respect to the Indian department that I think the House should know. I am asking for a very considerable increase in the appropriation for the Indian education. Before I leave this country, in view of what I discovered last year in visiting a considerable number of the western reserves, I cannot speak with authority as to what has happened in eastern Canada because I have not visited those reserves. But as my statement would take at least half an hour, I might better give it to a fuller House to-morrow.\n\nMr. FORKE: I am sorry that I anticipated the minister's statement.\n\nProgress reported.\n\nADJOURNMENT\u2014BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.\n\nMr. FIELDING moved the adjournment of the House.\n\nSir HENRY DRAYTON: What business will be taken up to-morrow?\n\nMr. FIELDING: The French treaty. Then we might complete the Patent Act and go into supply on Indian Affairs.\n\nMotion agreed to and the House adjourned at 11.03 p.m.\nof trade who are favourable to it and who are congratulating the government on their courage in dealing with it.\n\nMr. BOYS: I understand the publishers are opposed to it. I at once admit that I am not sufficiently familiar with the subject matter to reach a conclusion at this stage as to who is in the right, but that there is no misunderstanding regarding the position of the publishers I will place on Hansard a letter addressed to the right hon. leader of the Opposition (Mr. Meighen) which reads as follows:\n\nHi. Hon. AUSTIN MEIGHEN, P.C.,\nLeader of the Opposition,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Hon. Meighen\u2014At a regular meeting of the Ottawa Typographical Union held on Saturday evening last, the proposed amendments to the Canadian Copyright Act were discussed. The meeting was presided over by Hon. J. A. Robb, Minister of Trade and Commerce, who expressed himself as being decidedly opposed to the opinion that the proposed amendments are not in the best interests of the Canadian printers. We most strenuously protest against these proposals and would request you to use your influence to have Bill No. 34 withdrawn.\n\nWe also respectfully request that the Canadian Copyright Act, as now in force, should be immediately carried into full force and effect.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your closest and most careful attention, I am forwarding you in anticipation. I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. A. P. Haynes,\nSecretary.\n\nI am not rising to offer any objection to what the authors think they are entitled to, but it looks as if there were a difference of opinion between these two important classes, and I should support the suggestion of the hon. member from South Ward (Mr. Guthrie) that a small select committee be at once appointed. I do not think it would take more than four or five days and this matter could be fully investigated. I have been requested to ask a number of questions for the purpose of securing certain information from the minister and I would very much sooner ask those questions through a committee, but if that cannot be done, I suppose the only course would be to ask them here for the purpose of eliciting the information which is wanted.\n\nMr. ROBB: We will allow this item to stand, and I will not give an answer at the moment as to whether we shall appoint a committee or not, but we will take into consideration the views of the members who have opposed this section. In the meantime may I suggest that, as the only objection apparently is to clause 2, we should pass the other clauses and get them out of the way?\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: Clause 2 is the whole act.\n\nMr. ROBB: Referring to the letter which my hon. friend has placed on Hansard, I desire to make this statement. There are two statements, one that the Typographical Union of Ottawa are opposed to this measure, and the other that they are offering indirectly a challenge to the leader of the Opposition (Mr. Meighen) in that he was Prime Minister from June to December when he had an opportunity of proclaiming this measure.\n\nMr. BOYS: The leader of the Opposition is well able to answer any question that may be directed to him, and if he were here to attend to that phase of the matter himself; he could do it better than I can. However, the minister says that he is prepared to let section 2 stand, and that he regards all the provisions, and that after all is the vital point.\n\nMr. FORRE: I am glad that the minister has come to the conclusion to let the section stand because a good many members do not know what it means, and I should hate to be called upon to vote upon it at the present time.\n\nSection stands.\n\nOn section 5\u2014Commencement of act.\n\nMr. ROBB: This section amends the act by striking out the words \"a day to be fixed by proclamation by the Governor in Council\" and substituting the words \"the first day of July 1923.\" I think we had better let that section stand.\n\nSection stands.\n\nProgress reported.\n\nSUPPLY\n\nThe House in Committee of Supply. Mr. Gordon in the chair.\n\nN.W.T., 474/723.\n\nMr. EVANS: The minister might explain the increase of $26,000 odd in this item.\n\nHon. CHARLES STEWART (Minister of the Interior): There is an increase of $36,491 in this item.\n\nOf this increase $18,962.00 is accounted for owing to additional supplies having to be provided for, in order to meet obligations resulting from the establishment of a post with Indians of the Great Slave lake and McKenzie River districts numbering 3,000 souls. The supplies furnished comprise flour, bacon, tea, blankets, clothing, tenting, tools, etc., for which tenders will be invited of the trading companies in those districts and contracts awarded in the regular way. There is also an\nincrease of $16,359.00 in the estimate for hospital, medical attendance, etc. This increase is due partly to the fact that necessity of establishing and maintaining a hospital at the Sarcee reserve in order to alleviate the condition of these Indians. They are in poor health physically, and unless some very thorough procedure is adopted it is evident that the band will disappear within a measurable time. To remedy this, vigorous prolonged and repeated measures are an absolute necessity. The Church of England has consented to close the Sarcee boarding school, and the department is using the building as a hospital under the supervision of a doctor who also acts as an Indian doctor and a staff of nurses. There is also an increase of $17,000 in the estimate for triennial clothing which is inevitable, as a greater number of chiefs and headmen of stations Nos. 4, 7 and 10 are entitled to suits next year than those of stations Nos. 4, 7 and 10 who received suits this year.\n\nI promised a short statement yesterday in dealing with this matter with respect to my personal observations of last year in dealing with Indians of western Canada. I stated that I had no personal knowledge of the conditions in the East, and I may remark with regard to the West that I did not by any means cover anything like all the reserves. I simply got an impression which might be accomplished amongst the Indians of western Canada particularly if we were able to carry on different educational methods. I am not criticizing the educational work put forth so far by me to do that. The first desire of the various church organizations who were carrying on work among the Indians was naturally to Christianize them, and that is a laudable purpose. They need education, and Indians an education, which in my opinion is not of a character that would change them from their aboriginal habits to the habits of the white man, but where they must enter into competition if they are to make their livelihood in other ways than they formerly followed, namely, of hunting, fishing, and so forth.\n\nI am asking for a considerable increase for educational purposes believing, after discussing the matter with the Oblate Fathers and those concerned with Indians, that if we should give their education a more technical character and, so far as agriculture is concerned, devote more attention to that aspect of our educational activities that has been the case in the past. Let me give an instance of the splendid results that can be obtained where effort has been put forth to educate the Indian, particularly for agricultural pursuits. I refer now to what I observed in Saskatchewan on the File Hills reserve. For a period of about twenty years there have been carried on there educational methods that are now showing admirable results. The work was done under the supervision of the department here, and more particularly I presume Mr. Graham, who has been in charge of the Saskatchewan Indians for a number of years. There the boys and girls were taken from the schools after having been educated and were placed upon the farms. One of the things I objected to was the fact that there was no provision in the estimates for advancing sums of money to support these young people in their most cases, although I was not aware in all success was due to the fact that these people started up as young married couples upon their own particular holdings; in one or two cases I discovered young men who were bachelors and so remarkable. Indeed, from my observation these young people I found were making as great a success of farming as well as their white brothers in the surrounding territory; and one could not expect more than that. But unfortunately this is not the case throughout the other provinces. The work has not been carried on in the same manner in other places. However, what I have described is evidence of what can be done with the aborigine in educating and training him so that you change his mode of life.\n\nIt cannot be denied that in northern Ontario, northern Manitoba, and indeed in the northern portions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the white man is becoming a very strong competitor with the Indians in trapping and in hunting. We are receiving constant complaints from the Indians that they are being driven off their hunting grounds. It is generally conceded that the white man is a much more reckless hunter covering a vast extent of territory, and takes more fur than the Indian, and is denuding the hunting grounds of the red man to such an extent that it is becoming a serious problem. Indeed, this is true even in the far north where the Eskimos find themselves in similar plight. Therefore, unless we take definite action to change the mode of life of the plains Indian, and in the case of the northern Indian, we are within a measurable distance of the time when we will be bound to vote large sums of money for the subsistence of the aboriginal tribes. It is with that thought in mind that I am prepared to ask for increased grants for educational purposes among the Indians.\nI am not criticizing my predecessors in office; I need only refer to the remarks of the right hon. leader of the Opposition (Mr. Meighen) last year during the discussion of the Indian Estimates, when he said that the preceding government had been in a zone of point of being penurious in carrying on educational work among the Indians. I think it is our first business that we should attack this problem from the right standpoint and try, if possible, to give the younger generation among the Indians such a training as will enable them as well as enable them to take their place alongside their white brothers and sisters, and in some cases, going a little further, give them the necessary practical training to enable them to engage in pursuits other than agriculture. That is all I have in mind.\n\nI have a great admiration for the services performed by religious missionary organizations among the Indians, especially in the way of education. When I visited the Indian school at Kamloops I found the Fathers and Sisters in charge working under the most discouraging conditions. Although the building was heated with stoves it was freezing cold, the windows were in a dilapidated condition and almost falling out, and the school building was weakly constructed the fire hazard was very great indeed. Yet he and the Sisters were doing their best to educate the Indian children within a hundred-mile radius of the school. We are asking you this year to vote a sum of money to build a new institution at Kamloops to serve that whole territory. Similar remarks may be applied to many of these schools. The churches have spent a good deal of money in the construction of school buildings, but most of them are in good shape. It will be remembered that on this occasion we asked for a vote to take over one of the newer buildings in order to relieve the religious organizations of the capital charges they had taken upon themselves in connection with this work. I do think, Mr. Chairman, that if the religious organizations are willing to hang up the ancient banner and let the teaching staff practically free of charge to us, it is our clear duty to provide the buildings for the carrying on of their work. It will be my desire to see that there are no exceptions among the 120,000 odd Indians so that no Indian child shall be denied the right to a good, decent public school education at least.\n\nThere are many and varied difficulties in the administration of the Indian department. In answer to my hon. friend (Mr. Meighen) I am free to admit that in some cases not enough care has been exercised in selecting our local agents. A great deal depends upon the man who is placed upon a reserve and in whose charge the Indians must be. In many cases not nearly enough consideration has been given to the selection of a suitable man, because after all he needs to possess a good tempered, patient and sympathetic disposition, to be meet with a great deal of discouragement, his object to at once change the habits of these people. Year by year as subsistence by hunting becomes more and more difficult the Indians must apply themselves to agriculture or other occupations pursued by the white man; otherwise they will be entirely dependent upon grants from the government and capable local agents can help them to accommodate themselves to changing conditions.\n\nMr. FORKE: I should like to add a word or two. Mr. Chairman, to what I said last year on this subject I know the minister is very sympathetic towards the Indians and his problem. I think perhaps I would be the last to say anything against teaching the Indians to work, but I do think our first duty is to teach him how to make a decent living. We all know how puzzled white people become sometimes in regard to problems of Christianity, well, the Indians get into the same difficulties only a little deeper sometimes. I remember a good many years ago meeting an old Indian friend, and he immediately informed me that he was a Christian. He was taking some wood to market that had been cut into stove lengths, and I was conversing with him and turned over a few pieces and discovered some bones beneath. I tried to explain to him that this was not Christian practice. He replied, \"Well, you see what people all do today. So you see some of the difficulties the poor Indian has to meet in dealing with Christianity. I believe that I believe the great thing in the beginning to teach the Indian how to make a decent living.\n\nIf we are to have successful Indian agents I believe what the minister says: they must be of good character and the right stamp of men. An Indian agent must be able to go out among the Indians and settle their little quarrels and encourage them to continue at their work. Upon the Indians to look after our Indians I do not care how much money we spend it will only be wasted. At the present time in the little reserve near my home I find there are a great many healthy young men, but they have neither stock nor seed to make their land of any use to them. What are they\ngoing to do all summer? There is a problem. The department might provide the Indians with some stock and assist them unless there is an agent possessing the proper qualifications to look after those Indians and see that everything is done in the right way I think the assistance will be thrown away.\n\nJust a word in connection with the education of the Indian. The Indian is different from the white man in a great many respects. The Indians who have never met Europeans come over to see me about their difficulties. I can talk a little Indian and perhaps I may do so for a time; then I suddenly recollect that I cannot be bothered to try to talk English and I tell whoever I am conversing with that unless he speaks English I will not carry on the conversation any longer; and immediately he goes back to his own language. English. But he will not speak English as long as you will talk to him in the Indian tongue. Indians who have been educated at Elcho or at Borden will go back to the reserve, and in a twelve months' time unless they are given some attention, you will not be able to tell the difference between them and the Indians who have never had any education. I submit again that the Indians, to be properly looked after, must have an agent who takes the trouble to go among them who can see their mediators and their controllers and friend right along. That is the only way I can see in which we can arrive at a solution of the Indian problem. I really feel sorry for the Indians and their treatment in Manitoba. I would like to see the money devoted to the Indians well spent; I would not be niggardly at all in the matter of an appropriation for the purpose if I only knew that the money was being spent as it should be.\n\nMr. EVANS: I would like to say a word in support of what the minister has said. I do not think we should be stingy in the matter of voting money for the purposes of the Indians. If we are going to throw money at them when the money is well spent we are well repaid in the effort. My own experience in connection with the Indians dates back to some thirty years ago, in the case of the reserve in Saskatchewan. The Indian agent who went among them at that time found the conditions very unsatisfactory indeed, so that they were unable to carry on without an Indian agent, although there are not as many Indians there now as there used to be, and they are in a very fair way. Some of them, I know, have fine herds of cattle, are following the occupation of farming and are living a civilized life in every respect. The boys and girls are being educated, and they are intensely loyal. Some of them served in the Great War, and one I know particularly has gone out as a missionary to his own people. They are capable of being educated; they are capable of uplift, and I think we would make a mistake if we did not do our duty by them.\n\nMr. KENNEDY (Edmonton): What is the policy of the department with regard to some of these large reserves where the Indians have nearly all died? In my own constituency there are some very large reserves which used to be occupied by a few hundred Indians but now there are three or four hundred. Then, there are small reserves which, after being farmed to some extent, were abandoned, and are now producing a splendid crop of weeds. I should like to know whether the department considers the leasing of such land as that? I would ask also if it is the intention to retain the larger reserves where the numbers of Indians are continually decreasing, or will the department dispose of some of them, and if so under what conditions?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): If the land is fit for agricultural purposes and is not required by the band, the practice of the department has been to try to secure a surrender from the band and sell the land to white settlers.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): I wish to call the attention of the minister to the dissatisfaction which prevails among the Indians on the Blackfoot reserve in Alberta. They have many complaints, the chief of which is that under the terms of surrender agreement that were induced, they say, a considerable reduction in the rations during the war from seven pounds of meat and seven pounds of flour a week to five pounds of meat and five pounds of flour a week, and a pound of flour a month for two months. They were under the impression that when the war was finished they would go back to the old scale, but they are dissatisfied too; that more has been charged since the conclusion of the war and they are still on the war rations. The minister will realize that adults can hardly be expected to subsist on five pounds of meat and five pounds of flour a week\u2014it seems miserable. If the minister has any explanation to offer I would like to have it.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I had no knowledge, until the matter was brought to my attention by the hon. gentleman some weeks ago, that there was any difficulty about\nrations on this reserve. My own idea is that we should carry out to the letter our contract with the Indians; that is the first principle we should lay down. On the other hand, the Indians and the Blackfoot reserve should be rapidly brought to a point where they are self-supporting. They are on splendid land; they can raise cattle; they have every opportunity of getting along well. It is not my fault that they are not self-supporting; I am not saying it is theirs. However, as I have said, I am prepared to carry out to the fullest extent any arrangement that was made with the Indians.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): The Indians tell me, through their chiefs, that during the winter and spring they actually go out into the woods and gather up pine needles and eat it, because they cannot get any other food. Of course, that is obviously improper. There are a number of other complaints that I would like the minister to investigate. One of them deals back in 1923, a complaint for greater production. The Indians tell me that they were charged $35 a set for harness that could have been purchased from any mail order house for $18. At that time I should be glad if the minister would investigate that complaint. There is one other complaint, which is more sentimental than anything else. Suppose the deceased Indian chief had the right to delegate to a successor at the time of death the chieftainship or honour which they may collectively possess. A man named Povesh, an Indian, claimed to be elected by a minor chief his chieftainship; this was about two years ago when the chief was dying. The agent informed the Indians that he had communicated with Ottawa that the reply had been received; and no reply had been received up to last fall when I was there. Incidents of this kind are very keenly felt by the Indians. Before I come from that, may I ask the minister whether he has any knowledge of that particular incident?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Yes. In nearly all the western provinces an Indian chieftainship is not hereditary but elective, so that it would be a direct contradiction of the elective system to attempt to pass the chieftainship down in hereditary line. We have a great deal of difficulty on the Six Nations reserve about this very thing. They have an hereditary system there and a very strong exception is taken to it by a great many of the Indians on the reserve, and as a result there are continual goings on all the time. With all due deference to the wishes of the chief, I might say frankly that I would oppose the hereditary system as against the elective, which I think is much more modern and much more in the interests of the Indian.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): The chief did not give me to understand that they desired the hereditary system. If asked the question they pointed out that the matter was brought to my attention. Was the chieftainship delegated to this new man by the will of the late chief? I was informed yes, and that the agent had been instructed. So it would not be the hereditary system.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have no knowledge of that particular case. It would appear that in that case he had been elected by the members of the band but not confirmed by the agent.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Owing to the delay at Ottawa, according to the agent's reply.\n\nMr. KENNEDY (Edmonton): Is there an amount provided in this item for improvements or extensions to the school at St. Albert north of Edmonton?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No. There is an amount of $145,000 for the instruction school at Edmonton, which was formerly the Red Deer school.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Is any provision made so that the agent will have power to relieve illness or cases of emergency?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): That is always done. If there is not a resident doctor, there is a doctor whose duty it is to go to the reserve on call. That is the case with all the reserves.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Do I understand the minister to say that the agent has power to allocate to a sick Indian additional supplies of food and so forth?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Oh yes. That is his duty. He must not allow the Indians to starve.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): I am glad to hear the minister say that because these chiefs have reported to me that on complaint to the agent at GHQ they could receive no other reply. They wrote to GHQ and giving this complaint as I got it, \"I have no power. I must get that power from the commissioner.\"\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The Indian is pretty much of a white man when it comes to describing his difficulties. He does not minimize them at all. I discovered that last\nyear when I was on a visit westward. When I brought the officials and the chiefs together I found that the stories I had heard were borne out by the testimony. I would be very glad to do the same in this particular case. We will bring the chiefs together, and if they have legitimate complaints we shall be glad to clear them up.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Thank you. May I ask how much capital was used in the purchase of equipment, lands, stock and so on in connection with the Black Foot reserve?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have not the figures at hand but will give them to my hon. friend.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): You will let me have them?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Yes.\n\nMr. LEWIS: Why are the general expenses under this item for Manitoba and Saskatchewan so great, much larger than any of the others?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): This, of course, covers the salaries of all the agents in the northern reserves and the expenses in connection with them. It covers the Northwest Territory, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. I have the figures in detail, but it would take considerable time to give them.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): That was the Blackfoot reserve complaint of this fact: When these crews is thinned they are compelled by the agent to dispose of all of it except one load, which they are allowed to keep for seed. Now, if these Indians have one hundred acres or more ready for harvest, one load, of course, will not nearly suffice for seed. The result is, they say, they have to go back to the agent in the spring and purchase at an enhanced rate the additional seed required. Would the minister look into this?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I can hardly conceive of an agent being so improvident as to allow the Indians to sell his grain down to a point where he would not have enough left to seed his land. I think when we came to investigate that complaint we would find it was not based on the facts. However, we will investigate it. One of the things we are endeavouring to teach the Indian is prudent management; his great failing; he does not provide and that is one virtue we are trying to encourage him in. It certainly would be a very foolish procedure to sell beyond the point where his requirements for feed and seed would be fully met.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): That was the way in which it struck me. What provision has been made on that reserve for the education of the children? I understand the school has been closed since July. It was alleged to be closed for repairs, but apparently it has not been opened up yet.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The school was closed simply for the purpose of remodeling and repairs. It is now open again and in operation.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): How long has it been in operation?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): About two months.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Is there any age at which the children are supposed to leave the school? I am informed, but I rather doubt it myself, that when the children reach the age of from thirteen to fifteen they are discharged from school and told to go to work.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I can scarcely believe that because those I spoke of who are making such a splendid success in Saskatchewan, that the Indians are not able to carry on farming operations on their own account. They are kept at the school until the age of eighteen. I can hardly believe that any such thing is true. If such mentions would have been issued in connection with the schools, I am free to admit that perhaps there is some ground for complaint in Alberta. On the Morley reserve our education was becoming neglected and in many cases the closed the boarding schools and attempted to educate these children in day schools. The department, however, has abandoned that idea altogether and now seems to be a waste of money. The children attend the school regularly and during their absence go back as far as they have progressed practically, in order to get instruction. The only effective way is to get them into a boarding school where you can have some control over them and keep them under supervision until they have had an opportunity to get an education.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): I have seen two crews of Indians at work threshing last fall. I stayed a week in one district where one of these crews was working and they gave me the satisfaction. They were more satisfactory than the white men, and I am glad to say that the employer paid them exactly the wages of the white man. They did splen-\ndid work. Can the minister give to the committee the terms of the agreement entered into with the Indians in regard to ploughed land, that has been left when the greater production scheme comes?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Where the Indian is equipped and ready to farm the land he is charged at the rate of $6 an acre for broken land; land that is broken and broken under cultivation under the greater production scheme. In regard to what my hon. friend has said with respect to selling supplies, harness, implements, I may say that a considerable proportion was turned over to the younger Indians who gave evidence of a desire to go farming. In some cases these things were sold, but in the majority of cases they were given to the Indians as an encouragement. One of the difficulties I found when I took charge of the department was that as soon as the young people graduated from school and began farming operations there was no provision for loaning or giving money to start at farming; and one of the rather vexing things that was happening was that Indians would go out and get credit from the merchants in the vicinity. This led to considerable difficulty in getting adjustments made. Now we are adopting another method. The department are loaning sufficient funds to these young Indians to start farming in a moderate way, and in that manner we hope to maintain them in the service and encourage them in agriculture.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): In the first place, under the greater production scheme, the land was leased for five years. The chiefs endeavoured to make a more generous offer\u2014$10 a lease\u2014that is, $10 for each Indian on the reserve. Objection was taken to that sum, and it was cut to $6, which was accepted. However, on the expiry of that lease the department were about to be released without asking the consent of the Indians.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): That is released to white men?\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): I think so. The Indians objected, and subsequently a further agreement was arrived at\u2014with the local agent that any land through I think must have been with the departmental officials\u2014that, in return, the sum of $4 per head would be paid for these second leases. Is that substantially correct?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I am afraid not.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): Well, what are the facts?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I would like to say to my hon. friend that I cannot speak with much regard to what has been done in the past, but the policy pursued now is this: The moment an Indian is ready to take this land we are prepared to turn it over to him. What I mean by this is that most of the land has been leased, and where if there are Indians ready and available to farm it. Just as fast as these young men wish to settle down we will place them on this land, not only on the Bow River reserve but on all the reserves on which the policy of greater production was carried on, in order to encourage the Indians to work these farm lands. So far we have not been able to get a sufficient number of Indians to farm the area that was under the greater production scheme. Therefore, we have to lease to the white men temporarily year by year.\n\nMr. GARLAND (Bow River): But is there an amount of $1 being paid to the Indians?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Not that I know of.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Shall the item carry?\n\nMr. MANION: No, Mr. Chairman. I want to ask a few questions and if I do so after eight o'clock it will probably be just as well.\n\nAt six o'clock the Speaker resumed the chair and the House took recess.\n\nAfter Recess\n\nThe House resumed at eight o'clock.\n\nPRIVATE BILLS\n\nSECOND READINGS\n\nBill No. 119 (from the Senate), to change the name of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo Telephone Company to \"Brazilian Telephone Company.\"\u2014Mr. Ryckman.\n\nBill No. 120 (from the Senate), respecting Montreal, Joliette and Transcontinental Junction Railway Company.\u2014Mr. Denis (Joliette).\n\nBill No. 121 (from the Senate), for the relief of William Steele.\u2014Mr. Shiner.\n\nBill No. 122 (from the Senate), for the relief of James Forbes.\u2014Mr. Spence.\n\nBill No. 123 (from the Senate), for the relief of Julia Travers Kay.\u2014Mr. Duff.\n\nBill No. 124 (from the Senate), for the relief of Charles Philip Roy McCabe.\u2014Mr. Ross, (Kingston).\nBill No. 125 (from the Senate), for the relief of William George Haden\u2014Mr. McMaster.\n\nBill No. 126 (from the Senate), for the relief of Gertrude Irene Wood\u2014Mr. Chisholm.\n\nBill No. 127 (from the Senate), for the relief of James Murray\u2014Mr. Stewart (Hamilton).\n\nBill No. 128 (from the Senate), for the relief of James McAllister\u2014Mr. Sheard.\n\nBill No. 129 (from the Senate), for the relief of David Albert Clayton\u2014Mr. Sheard.\n\nBill No. 130 (from the Senate), for the relief of Hugh Russell Fulton\u2014Mr. McKillop.\n\nBill No. 131 (from the Senate), for the relief of Mayville Elizabeth French\u2014Sir Henry Dayton.\n\nThe House again in Committee of Supply, Mr. Gordon in the chair.\n\nMr. MANION: Has the position of Indian agent at the head of the lakes been filled? I know that the vacancy existed a month or so ago but I do not know who has been given the position, if it has been filled.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The position has been filled by the Civil Service Commission, the appointee being Mr. J. Garry Burke.\n\nMr. MANION: Mr. Burke was never in the Indian service before?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No.\n\nMr. MANION: Is he a returned soldier?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Yes.\n\nMr. MANION: I desire to say a few words in regard to the Indians in this country. Ever since the white man entered Canada his race has been pushing the Indians farther and farther into the interior of this country. I do not say this in any critical spirit because I believe that Canada has been treating her Indians probably a great deal better than other people to the south of us have treated theirs. It is undeniable, however, the fact that throughout the time we have dealt with our Indians there have been practically no difficulties in the way of dealing with them, whereas in the United States the authorities have undoubtedly met with many difficulties in the way of guerrilla warfare and so forth. I believe, therefore, that it is well for us to bear in mind at all times that after all the Indians were the first Canadians; at least they were here before any of the rest of us came to settle in this province or Quebec. It should, therefore, be the wish of the Canadian people to show them every consideration possible; and indeed I believe that it has been the policy of the Department of Indian Affairs under all governments to treat the Indians in a reasonably fair way.\n\nIt is true that the Indians throughout this country, at least in many bands, have been decreasing in great numbers. At the head of the lakes in the neighbourhood of Fort William and in the Arctic there are a couple of bands as well as one at Nipissing which, from what I have been given to understand, are decreasing to a great extent, their numbers down to about two hundred and another. We are all aware that practically every disease to which the white man is subject attacks him more harshly with the Indians when it attacks him. This is why the white race, probably because the Indians have not become as immune, during a long period of years, is the white man such diseases as diphtheria, tuberculosis, which has been attacking the Indians at the head of the lakes and also in British Columbia, where the number of the Indians are decreasing in numbers, is so serious. I have watched the progress of these people at the head of the lakes for the last thirty years, and I know that they have been decreasing in numbers to a very large extent from this cause.\n\nThere are other diseases, of course, which levy a heavy toll on them, even including consumption, which is very prevalent, and there is another unfortunate evil from which they suffer, which is not perhaps exactly a disease but rather an injurious habit which they have acquired. I refer to the use by the Indians of alcohol. I mention this fact because I fear we have not perhaps been doing enough to protect the Indians against these evils, so far particularized, as we are concerned. I remember that in conversation once with a Jesuit priest, who lived among the Indians, he told me that they were healthier both physically and mentally when they became associated with white people. I believe he was telling the exact truth. The point I wish to make is this. While I understand that the government does a certain amount of educational propaganda is carried on amongst the Indians to inculcate some of the hygiene, have had a view to preventing tuberculosis at least the most common forms of consumption, and while through the missionaries of different religious denominations much credit the Indians are not acquainted with the harmful effects of alcohol upon themselves especially\u2014for they are affected to a greater extent by it than others\u2014and while I am not disposed to feel that perhaps we might increase our efforts to educate these people to the importance of protecting themselves, more particu-\nlary against tuberculosis. It is important that we should teach them the means to prevent this disease to as great an extent as they possibly can. So far as alcohol is concerned, after all the laws of most provinces, if not of all provinces, the Indians are somewhat less against the alcoholic evil so that they can obtain liquor only illegally. As regards tuberculosis, however, while there is a continuous campaign being carried on against this disease among the Indians, even in their own districts, still we might do more for them than is now done. The Indians are really a very unfortunate race in Canada. In the past, it is true, in the early history of the country, they were rather aggressive; but today I think, speaking at least of the Indians around me, I have seen much that I have grown up in their midst, so to speak, practically in all relations of life they are much less offensive citizens of this country, certainly less offensive than are the white men. It is for that reason, therefore, that I urge upon the minister the question of conferring upon active propaganda to be carried on in whatever way the deputy minister and the different officials of the department may deem advisable, to educate the Indians to take better care of their health, and thereby other reasons besides humanitarian for undertaking work of this kind. For example, there is the point of view of the predominance of Indian life in this country. I believe that the Indian life of Canada is of value to the Canadian people, particularly to those people in this country who have come from lands where Indians, the peoples we understand and desire to desecrate, have not existed. I wish therefore to impress upon the minister the value that there is in preserving to the people of this country the Indians as they are, and as they are, as I have said, of an inoffensive character, and from the humanitarian point of view, if, from no other reason, I think we should do more than we are doing presently to take care of them. I think that with a little more money expended in this direction than we are now devoting to the Indians we could protect them against disease to a much greater degree. I should be glad if the minister and the officers of his department would take such steps as would result in the best interests not only of the Indians themselves but of the people of the country as a whole.\n\nMr. McBRIDE: I have no complaint to make on behalf of the Indians regarding the minister, but rather I wish to thank him and his deputy for the way in which they have treated the Indians, particularly in the vicinity in which I live. Last year I spoke to the minister and his deputy with reference to the school at Kamloops, which was in a dilapidated condition. That school would have been built years ago had it not been for the war. The minister and his deputy visited the district and visited the reserve last summer. They looked fully into the matter, went through the old school, and were at once convinced that it was not fit place for children to be educated in. I can assure them that the people in that vicinity, not only the Indians and the reverend gentleman who is in charge of them, but the people generally appreciate very much the action the minister and his deputy have taken to improve the conditions for the children on the reserve.\n\nMr. CALDWELL: Owing to the fact that I was on a committee this afternoon when the minister and his deputy walked in under consideration, I would ask the indulgence of the committee for five minutes to refer to certain conditions in that province. I want to refer to the road in the Indian reserve near Victoria, county of New Brunswick. This reserve is in the neighbourhood of a good-sized town and is situated in a populous part of the country. It takes about three hours by train to get into the main town, and it is quite a hardship, especially in winter, to pass through the reserve because the Indians are not in a position to break the road along these roads or farms. There is a great deal of snow in New Brunswick in winter and people experience considerable hardship in passing over that road to go to the main town. In summer, the condition of the road is not so bad, but in winter it is very difficult to get over it. Part of the road is dug out of a side of a bank, and when the spring comes the road is in a very bad shape. Will the minister be instructed to see that the road is kept open during the winter?\n\nMr. BANCROFT: I would bring to the attention of the minister the necessity of an early settlement concerning the hay fields on the St. Peter's reserve. That reserve is on the Red river just north of the town of Selkirk. These hay lands have been the principal source of supply of hay for local farmers ever since the district was first settled. They enjoyed this convenience until about five years ago when the lands were broken in a block of 160 acres for speculative purposes, thus of course cutting off the other settlers from their hay supply. The district is only about thirty miles from the city of Winnipeg, the train service is excellent and in every way the conditions are highly\nfavourable to dairy farming, but I am told that since these lands were leased five years ago the number of stock in the locality has decreased by about 60 per cent. This indicates a great deterioration to the local farmers; has been their exclusion from the hay lands. The lease runs out next month, and I would impress upon the minister the importance of his renewing them. These hay lands should be available to the local farmers in order that they may be able to build up a stock-growing industry. I have already taken this matter up with the department and with the minister, and I again take this opportunity of emphasizing the importance of this hay supply to the local farmers. I think it is the duty of the government to keep these lands out of the hands of speculators and make it possible for the actual settlers to buy them in small lots. If arrangements cannot be settled in time to make a sale this year before the hay crop is cut, I would suggest that the lands be leased in small lots to the settlers for this year's cut, and that arrangements be completed for a sale on the lines I have indicated so that the actual settlers may benefit instead of being sacrificed in favour of the speculator. This point of view I may say is shared not only by all the settlers in the settlement but by the residents of the town of Selkirk which is the largest urban centre in the district.\n\nMr. CARMICHAEL: What is the explanation of the increase under this item?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): In answer to my hon. friend who has spoken of the scourge of tuberculosis among the Indians, while I would not say that we are taking adequate steps to this end, because it would cost an enormous amount of money to wipe out this plague among the Indians, yet we are trying by propaganda and education among the Indians to make them acquainted with the best methods of combating the disease. Of course there will be no chance of success among the children who attend the schools. Undeniably our Indian people, in common, I suppose, with those who have lived as they have in remote locations, are in rather a bad way so far as tuberculosis is concerned. We hope by the means I have indicated and by employing nurses to help the Indians to get away from this scourge.\n\nIn reply to my hon. friend from Victoria and Carleton (Mr. Caldwell) I do not think it is the duty of the agent or of the department to keep open a public road, but in so far as we are responsible as a property holder in the vicinity we will be prepared to do our share both in the construction and the maintenance of these highways passing through the various reserves.\n\nIn reply to my hon. friend from Selkirk (Mr. Bancroft), we have had the matter he referred to under consideration. As soon as possible these hay lands will be put up for sale by public auction in small lots. We cannot guarantee that they will be sold to the local farmers, but at least they will be given the opportunity of bidding upon the various parcels that constitute this rather large hay meadow. In the meantime as soon as the lease expires we will offer this year these same parcels to parties who may wish to lease them and get the hay, as it will be impossible to arrange for a sale before the hay harvest.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Would the land be leased by favoritism or by tender?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We will lease the parcels by tender.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: What will be the difference between that contract and what has already prevailed? The present lease and the lease by tender\u2014he was the highest bidder. I understand that what the hon. member complains of is that the lands are not available for farmers in the neighborhood. They will not be available to them after the minister leases them by tender this year, nor after he sells them.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I do not wish to get into a controversy between my right hon. friend and the hon. member for Selkirk.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: There is no controversy.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): \u2014But I know of no other system by which the department can protect itself.\n\nMr. BANCROFT: I would suggest that the lands be leased in small lots, not in one whole block, but in small lots here. In either case the lands will inevitably fall into the hands of speculators. If these lands are leased under the system known as hay permits every man who has stock will be able to make use of the land according to the number of his stock. That method would help the local stock-raising industry and would keep the lands out of the hands of speculators.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: That is not the tender system; that is the permit system.\n\nMr. BANCROFT: Well, that is the system the local settlers want.\nMr. MEIGHEN: That is what the minister says he is not going to do.\n\nMr. BANCROFT: The people there want the permit system.\n\nMr. JACOBS: Has the minister had any complaints from the residents living near the St. Pie reserve in regard to the fencing of the reserve? A road has been cut through this reserve, and in the fall many of the settlers lost their crops and their roads. Trouble resulted, the cattle straying into the Indian reserve and being impounded by the Indians, which put the settlers to considerable cost and a great deal of inconvenience. I suggest to the minister that some fencing be put up on that reserve. There are very few Indians there, and they have had a great deal of trouble. Has the minister had any complaints?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No.\n\nMr. HANSON: Shortly after the last election the Indian agent at Perth, New Brunswick, under whose immediate care the Tobique band of Indians came, was dismissed from office without any reason being assigned. I happen to know that he is a man of more than ordinary intelligence, and that he was perhaps one of the best Indian agents we ever had in that part of the country. Will the minister inform us why he was dismissed?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The information is that the services of this gentleman were not satisfactory.\n\nMr. HANSON: No such reason was ever assigned. But I can tell the minister the real reason; it was because he did not support his hon. member for Victoria and Carleton (Mr. Caldwell). I do not know that he was very active against him, but that was the reason. Were any complaints against Mr. Wootton on file in the department, and if so, were they investigated by the department?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I cannot answer offhand whether or not there were any complaints.\n\nMr. HANSON: The secretary of the department is right in front of the minister; he knows Mr. Wootton personally.\n\nMr. CALDWELL: Perhaps I may be able to help the hon. member for York-Sunbury (Mr. Hanson) a little.\n\nMr. HANSON: I want the information from the minister.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: I draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that this vote is for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. However, if the committee has no objection I suppose a brief explanation might be made.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No objection.\n\nMr. CALDWELL: I am surprised to learn that the minister does not support me. I understood from him that he did.\n\nMr. JACOBS: The hon. member for York-Sunbury said he was a man of more than ordinary intelligence.\n\nMr. CALDWELL: Then he should have supported me as a matter of course.\n\nMr. MARTELL: There was no Liberal candidate, so he was the next best thing.\n\nMr. CALDWELL: However, the chief of the Indians' tribe at Tobique pointed out to me something over two years ago stating that great timber was being cut on the reserve without a permit. I reported the matter to the department, and I discussed it with the Indian agent, who reported back that there was no such thing going on. All this will be found. I am sure the departmental files will record a communication to this effect from the deputy minister, a copy of which I sent to the chief, thinking there must have been some mistake. By return mail I received a reply from the agent saying that at least 600 green logs had been cut, as well as a large amount of green pulpwood. I again communicated with the department, and I think they sent an Indian agent from another reserve to look into the matter. They found that it was true that this cutting had been going on, although the agent at that time denied it. I am convinced that he did not know anything about it, because I know the man; he is very conscientious and an excellent man in every way\u2014and a very good friend of mine by the way. As I say, I was surprised to learn that he did not support me in the last election, because a man of his good judgment would naturally, I should think, follow that course. If the minister looked into the facts of this, he will find that that is the reason Mr. Wootton's services were dispensed with. Mr. Wootton was leaving the locality, I believe; he is up in Northern Ontario at present.\n\nMr. HANSON: In this month; he was dismissed a year ago. I should like to ask the minister if any complaint was ever made against Mr. Wootton, and if so, whether it was investigated by the department?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I am informed that this timber transaction was about\nthe only thing concerning which his occupancy of the position was questioned. I am also sure that he did not give his full time to Indian affairs; that he was engaged in other business.\n\nMr. HANSON: How could you expect him to do so, on the miserable salary you paid him?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We expect to get service, even for miserable salaries.\n\nMr. HANSON: Not his full time.\n\nMr. MICHAUD: I know something about this gentleman, and I am here to explain why York-Sunbury wants to know in what respect he did not fulfill his duties. I can enlighten him on the subject. In the first place, the hon. member will know that Mr. Woosten got the position of Indian agent as a reward for his activities as Conservative organizer in the county of Victoria. I know that county very well, and I have known Mr. Woosten for some time. Then, Mr. Woosten was so active as an insurance agent that he had hardly any time to give to the affairs of the Indians on the Portage reserve. As he was doing his duty in connection with the work on behalf of the Indians, he was, therefore, dismissed for a good cause.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: It would look as though he had been dismissed by the hon. member for Miramichi instead of by the minister. The minister did not know anything about the reason for the dismissal, but\u2014\n\nMr. MICHAUD: Who is the member for Miramichi? I would like to know?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Restigouche\u2014they are pretty close together.\n\nMr. ARCHAMBAULT: The Miramichi is an old boat.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I would like to ask the minister what is doing and what he proposes doing in regard to the greater production work in the reserves.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have not changed my mind with respect to the matter since last year. With the single exception of the farm near Regina, we propose turning those lands over to the young Indians who qualify as farmers. Of course they cannot be done in a moment; we shall have to continue until such time as these young Indians are in a position to take over these lands. Each year will show, I think, a very substantial reduction in our farming operations.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I read in a return brought down in answer to some questions a statement which indicated very gratifying results from the greater production operations. I think it would be well if these were more known to the committee. I do not object to the enterprise being put into an enterprise, but I would not want to see it closed out any more rapidly than suitable Indians are able to utilize the lands that have been brought under cultivation. Otherwise these lands would be worse than wasted; the cultivation would be harmful instead of beneficial, because the crops would all go to weeds.\n\nIf I caught the minister's meaning, that farm he proposes commencing within the scope of the enterprise is the one near Regina. What is the name of the reserve?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Miscowequan.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: About 4,000 acres?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Yes.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: It will be some time before they are withdrawn.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We are always having difficulty in connection with Indian farming. What I mean by that is that every year there will be reserves upon which seed will be required, and I think a farm of that character might very well be determined by the department in order to provide the necessary seed. It might be said that there is no reason why the reserves should not provide seed for themselves, and that does happen once in a while. With the exception of that one farm, I think we should close out these farms as rapidly as we have Indians qualified to take them on. Of course we must continue to operate until then, otherwise the lands would grow up in weeds.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: What are the results so far as they can be known now?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I will give that information, which is in the form of answers to some questions that were asked. I do not know by whom. The quantity of grain grown on the Indian reserves in the three years preceding during the last five years was 5,368,939 bushels; the proportion of this grown by individual Indians was 3,532,347 bushels; the proportion grown by white farmers 1,106,000 bushels; the proportion grown by the reserve proprietors 787,992 bushels; the quantity of grain grown on these same reserves during the five years previous to this year was 5,586,938 bushels; the area under fallowed and broken by Indians during the last five years was 112,294 acres; area during the previous five years, records\nnot available for breaking and summer following, but total area under crop 1913-1917 inclusive 184,202 acres; amount of rentals collected during the last five years $440,000.88; amount received during the previous five years $54,324.66.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: What is the amount still due and collectable?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have not that here, but it will be a fairly considerable amount I imagine.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps I did not get the minister's figures right. If I understand them properly his figures were wrong as to the amount grown in the previous five years. I have it as about three and a half million bushels, not five million odd. The increase is something over 100 per cent.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): My hon. friend is quite correct. The quantity of grain grown on these same reserves during the five years previous was 3,860,938 bushels, not 5,586,938 bushels.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: The minister read 5,000,000. There should be about $130,000 due and collectable still, and if so that amount added to the $440,000 which the minister has just given would make a total of $550,000 of direct cash resulting from an investment of about $250,000. In addition, of course, there would be the buildings. They will be needed now by the Indians that are promised to take possession of the land, the tractors and farm machinery that the greater production enterprise has, and as such they would be some outstanding item would still be left. I mean aside from the rentals. So the whole enterprise would be a very profitable one from every standpoint. Of course, I am quite aware that a large share of the profits come from the leases, but even without the leases there is a very gratifying result from the whole greater production enterprise. I would like to know if the minister's interest and his mind on this subject or has he something in his mind that modifies or in any way tempers his enthusiasm with regard to the results attained?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I was not speaking on the leases at all, but I do not think it would be wise to stop the greater production of grain enterprise now. I do not see any necessity for continuing it. All I am endeavouring to do is to get the Indians to take over the land as fast as they are able to do so and to get down to one reasonable-sized farm close to Regina, where the work can be looked after by Mr. Graham, and a store of grain be kept available at that central point for use as required.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I think the greater production work is good, but I think the Indian on the farm is better, and consequently while the greater production is good, to proceed standing by ready to take the land, I agree with the minister that the right thing to do is to let him take it, but save for that, and only as the land is needed by the Indians, I would say continue the greater production operations. In that way some use is made of otherwise almost abandoned land, the very best waste land in the West. There is need of the greater production enterprise for the purpose of utilizing that land. Why, the minister could get a very considerable sum towards his Indian estimates by continuing this to the extent that he proposes, provided with not shutting out any Indian ready to farm, and at the rate of increase of these estimates I would think that would appeal to the minister as a very desirable thing to do.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I might say in reply that when farming under the greater production scheme you might have a period of years when you would be very prosperous then you might strike a period of years in which your expenditure would far outweigh your revenue.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: You would hardly strike any worse than we have had lately.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Do not make any mistake. That could be done very easily. These lands evidently completely did not strike the greater production and very seriously.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: They struck me right between the eyes. The big greater production farms were hailed, and drought came and brought down the yield to about seven bushels an acre on the larger farms on the Blood reserve and on the second largest nearby. I think it encountered pretty nearly everything that western farming encounters and yet it has succeeded.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): It has succeeded largely because you have been very successful in Saskatchewan. They have been very fortunate in getting splendid crops, and they have got a great harvest of management crop in Saskatchewan. I saw it. But on the whole it is rather a precarious undertaking. These lands were broken at a time when stress was being put upon the government to increase production in Canada, and it was a laudable scheme to enter upon at that time, but so far as\nI am concerned when my hon. friend points out that this is a way in which we might obtain revenue I would say that we are obtaining all the revenue we can from the leasing of these lands. But after all, it is fearful what might be the most doubtful way of obtaining revenue taking one year with another, breaking up these lands and taking them off leasing that I am speaking of lands they ought to be otherwise able to utilize. Part of the difficulty complained of by my hon. friend from Bow River arises from the fact that these lands during the period of cultivation were leased at high rentals, and the leaseholders were unable to pay. The Indian knows what these lands are worth, and he is disappointed and thinks somehow that the money that rightfully belongs to him. I have gone pretty thoroughly into all these matters with the Indians themselves, and I know that it is partly the cause of their failure, and that the rancher, and in many cases the renter, has lost all that he put into the enterprise. Take the case of the leases, the very Glicher survey that my hon. friend from Bow River is speaking about. The rancher who had that lease is practically bankrupt owing to the severe losses on the price of cattle and the very high rental he was forced to engage to pay for the lease. Yet the Indian expects to get that money.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: It is not so much a matter of what the Indian expects as what is best for him. Suppose the Indian does see that he gets the benefit of the money all well and good. Better do the best that can be done with the land and let the money go to the Indians as far as I am concerned. We should not want to see the land being given up and the whole enterprise abandoned even if somebody did pay too much. That is always going to happen and, of course, the man who loses has to take his loss. I do not want to see everything simply put aside, the tracts stacked up, and the enterprise left in the lurch, any more rapidly than is necessary to take care of the Indians.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I am not sure that my right hon. friend realizes exactly what is being done. I assure him that we are trying to make the best use of every acre of land that can be used by the Indians. I would like to see the Indians there encouraged, as far as possible, to utilize their grazing land. There is no use blinking at the fact that they have not nearly the number of cattle they had some years ago and we must get busy and encourage them to own and raise their cattle on these reserves. Not only that but we must encourage the young men to engage in agriculture in order that they may maintain themselves. It can be done. I pointed out this afternoon a very clear evidence of that in Saskatchewan where the Indians are making splendid progress, and I see no reason why the same thing cannot be done on every one of these western reserves.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I agree with the minister in that. I agree with him that the right line of education for the Indians you get after the three R's are mastered: reading, writing, and arithmetic and no excessive amount of any of those things. You get to teach them how to farm, particularly to teach him to earn a living. I am inclined to agree with the leader of the progressive party on this subject. I do not think there is any use trying to make a white man of the Indian\u2014whether in education or, possibly, in religion; it cannot be done. The thing to do with the Indian is to cement him to his land\u2014a few acres from the bush. Keep him in the open as much as possible, children as well as men\u2014that for the sake of their health\u2014and utilize the funds of the government to teach them to earn their living. I am afraid to think we spend too much money on certain forms of education, and I have doubts whether the additional millions now asked for in this vote is necessary providing we confine the application of public moneys to the essential educative needs of the Indian. I would sooner see the money spent in the way of policy as to education, providing such education as fits the Indian to help himself. There is no easier way of wasting money than to give school equipment, teachers, and so forth, and unnecessary curriculum for Indian children. As the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Forke) said there has been a tremendous amount of waste, but do not forget what a portion is but a very large proportion are right under the blanket in a month from the time they get out of the school, and unless the federal and the provincial work follows the school, the money of the government has gone within a short time after graduation. I think the efforts of the department should be directed toward endeavoring to bring the individual Indian into a regular working job as he gets out of the Indian school. If such is the policy it is going to bring far better results than to send him in the school and then abandon him when he gets through. So, while I do not object to the extra grant\u2014providing the officers of the department and the minister have thoroughly thought the subject out\u2014I really, if I had to do it myself,\nwould go over the estimates again and see if the half million could not be struck off, and the moneys already voted\u2014I mean the moneys that have been voted in previous years\u2014applied to the improvement of the academic curriculum to some extent, the balance being used for more practical purposes and for the continuation of the File Hills work.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I would just like to say in reply to my right hon. friend that that is what I have been trying to tell the committee this afternoon.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I heard some of it.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): \u2014and I agree most heartily with it. I think the mistake that has been made is, that we have been trying to make the Indian fit into the schoolroom door. I do not see how you could expect any different result. I cannot very well tell how a certain boy who has only given him an education; you have not equipped him at all to take his place in the difficult walk of life and you have spoiled him for the ordinary avocations of the people. Now, what else could be the result but in many cases he would be a failure such as has been deplored by the leader of the Progressives? It is our object to put in front of us should endeavour to shape our policy accordingly. I am not anxious to give the Indian a very extended education, but I do earnestly desire to give him a sufficient education in order that he may be able to take his place with the white man in the ordinary avocations of life.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: But there is an enormous increase in the number of Indians.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): My right hon. friend must bear in mind the fact that the late government spent no money on educational institutions during the whole period of the war.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes, we spent some.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I would like to show the right hon. friend to some institutions in which the Indians really are being educated; I would like to show him some of the institutions in which the work is being carried on. Such as in File Hills, if we are to do this work, if we are to ever make an attempt to do it, we ought to have reasonable places in which to house these children and that has not been the case. I saw some examples of this. I saw some splendid institutions. I saw an institution at Qu'Appelle of which the Canadian government, or any other government, can well be proud; a splendid building well conducted, and the pupils that saw there demonstrated the advantages of an institution of that kind. It is not my policy to build institutions of that character. At the same time I think that much better work could be done in an institution of that kind than in others in which they cannot keep water from reaching in, in which the floors are worn out and the windows are falling out of the building, and where there ought to be 150 or 175 pupils. That is why I asked for this money. I am now asking it for the purpose of building elaborate establishments and putting in elaborate equipment. What is needed is to have a reasonable kind of a building with the very simplest equipment in order that this work may be carried on. If we cannot make any progress in sending the Indians in Canada through a reasonably traditional method, I am afraid that the red man will deteriorate and that he will be a bigger burden on the way of mankind than upon the people of Canada than he will be owing to make him sustain himself by this method.\n\nMr. KNOWN: In following this subject a little further I would like to say that I have in mind one institution to which I might refer as a fine example of what gets away from the abuse. I refer to the boarding school at Duck Lake, where not only educational work is carried on, but agricultural education is also in connection with it. It is under Father Duff, who is doing exceptionally good work. I was struck by the remarks of the hon. member for Cariboo (Mr. McMillan) a little while ago when he spoke about the Indians. He had just received a visit from the minister and his deputy last summer, and I would like to impress on the minister the necessity of paying a visit to the Duck Lake mission. I feel sure if he went there there provisions would be made for better buildings in that location. The buildings there are not adequate for the work that is being done. They are out of date and getting out of repair and need immediate work. It was hoped that something would be done this year but I understand it is impossible to get anything of any attention just at present. I would like some assurance from the minister that this point will be kept in view for the future and that we may look forward to something being done there.\nMr. TOLMIE: Can the minister tell the committee what is being done in the way of stimulating the Indians in the production of beef cattle on the plains?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Unfortunately the Indians on the plains have not as many cattle as they had ten or twelve years ago.\n\nMr. TOLMIE: Does the minister know the reason?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No, but they had some very bad seasons, and for some reason or other they do not appear to have as much cattle as they formerly had. I think we should take steps to improve that condition. Instructions are given to the farm instructors and agents on the reserves to encourage as much as possible the production of live stock. The government would not have to buy beef to maintain the Indians upon the plains. We should not have to furnish beef particularly to bands located where there is plenty of excellent grass available. The Indian can very well be taught to take care of his stock. He is perhaps improvident and all the rest of it, but it is part of the business of the agent and farm instructor located on the reserve to assist him in that respect.\n\nMr. TOLMIE: Is the government doing anything to improve the quality of cattle? What is the government doing in the way of providing hay, seed, hay and so on? Is the pit silo used in that locality at all?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No, we have not had to resort to a pit silo. The Blood reserves in the West have always had plenty of grass and hay to maintain stock during the winter. Indians there have sold great quantities of hay during the winter instead of having the stock consume it. But every year it has been the policy of the department to provide proper facilities for distribution on these reserves where they are required.\n\nMr. TOLMIE: What prices has the government to pay in the purchase of these bulls?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We have to buy them in competition at the sales.\n\nMr. TOLMIE: There is no limit as to price.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We have to pay what the other buyers have to pay.\n\nMr. FORKE: Will the minister explain that item of $8145 for the Sioux Indians? Nothing is stated except the word \"Sioux\".\n\n[Mr. Knox.]\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): This is a large number of small items. However I may say in reply to my hon. friend from Prince Albert (Mr. Knox) that we have had many representations made with regard to the Louis Lake school. We know it is in rather a serious state, and it will probably take ten years to catch up with the construction and improvement of the various schools throughout Canada for Indian education, and we will attend to those just as fast as we can afford to do so.\n\nIn reply to my hon. friend from Brandon (Mr. Forke) I would say that the estimate was worked up as follows: the Birtle agency got $15 worth of flour, $30 worth of bacon, $10 worth of tea, $1 worth of rice, $1 worth of rolled oats, and medical attendance $20. The Portage la Prairie agency got $30 worth of flour, $12 worth of bacon, $10 worth of tea, $2 worth of rice, medical attendance $200, medicine $150, and $50 was given to relieve the cases of destitution. The salary of the concierge at the Sioux village was $90. Then the Griswold agency item is made up in the same way.\n\nMr. FORKE: The Sioux Indians are not treaty Indians. They are only getting this money, I think, from the government. I think that amount of $8,000 will hardly cover a good deal more than 1,000 Indians. You can figure out how much is coming to an Indian from the government when you consider it is that little sum that he is supposed that there is no treaty money paid to those Indians, and this is all they get. I think it is therefore plain why the condition of these Indians is such as it is today. The government practically starves them to death. They supply the agent and that is all. The flour and feed that is handed out amounts to nothing. Although they are not treaty Indians, they have lived here for 60 years in Manitoba, and I think they are entitled to just about the same treatment as the other Indians in the Dominion of Canada.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I do not know that they get any different treatment from the Indians on the plains. The treaty Indian is largely in the same position.\n\nMr. FORKE: Do the Saskatchewan Indians not get anything in the way of treaty money?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Five dollars a head.\n\nMr. FORKE: The Manitoba Indians do not get that.\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The Sioux Indians.\n\nMr. FORKE: No, I do not think so.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: The minister read an item for medical service. Is it a fact that the appointment of doctors in the reserves has been taken away from the Civil Service Commission and is once more under patronage?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Not that I know of. There has been no change, so far as I know, in a medical official who is appointed permanently, he is appointed by the Civil Service Commission, but, as formerly, where it is a case only of payment for attendance by the doctor residing in the village, he is paid for the visit.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: What is the case at Portage la Prairie? Which class does he come under?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): He is not a permanent official. He gets $200 and his fees.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: So that he is under patronage?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Well, I suppose he is under patronage if that is the definition of it. But I may tell my hon. friend that that would not be the definition I should place upon it.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: It very distinctly applies\u2014\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Let me ask my hon. friend this question: If it were necessary to appoint a permanent official he would be appointed by the Civil Service Commission, but if it is merely a case of a part-time cut-off official and he is simply paid for his visits, does that indicate that there is patronage?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: No, I was just going to indicate why it was patronage. The minister has fired the incumbent.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): At Portage la Prairie?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Yes.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I was not aware of that.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Yes, and he has appointed another. The incumbent who was there was one of the leading physicians of the town. He was a married man with a family and his two partners were returned soldiers. They had been partners for many years and still hold the minister's appointment in the place of this man a gentleman who had no connection with the militia or war in his life, so far as I know, nor has he any partner who has had such a connection. In other words, the minister has virtually taken the position from returned soldiers. Of course, he has given it to a leading Liberal, and if such a man could be called eminent the adjective might apply. That is the indication of patronage.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Is the present incumbent not a medical man?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Oh yes, he is a medical man. I did not dispute the fact of his being a medical man; indeed, I said that he was in a leading position so far as Liberal medical men are concerned.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Then the implication is that a Liberal could not be eminent?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: No, I am not saying that at all. What I am complaining of is that the minister, the exercise of patronage has taken the advantage of the work, from those who were entitled to it under what is supposed to be government policy, or at least is alleged to be such, of giving the preference to returned men. That is what I complain of. Does the minister agree that is right? If so, whose recommendation did it done? Perhaps I should apologize for asking any question about Portage la Prairie.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I was going to ask the hon. gentleman if he was speaking on behalf of the people of Portage la Prairie or on behalf of the representative of the district.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I am speaking for the public, the great people. Will the minister let me know why that was done and on whose recommendation.\n\nMr. FORKE: I would suggest that we send for the member for Portage la Prairie (Mr. Leader).\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I cannot answer my hon. friend because apparently any changes of this character must of necessity, in the opinion of hon. gentlemen, be changes brought about by patronage.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: It looks like it.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I may say to my hon. friend however that there was good and sufficient reason for the change although I have no recollection now of its having been made. Undoubtedly I am responsible for it.\nbut I cannot give any information in regard to the matter because I do not now recollect how it came about. It is very evident, of course, that it was not brought about at the request of my hon. friend.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Perhaps the other representative asked for the change?\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Do the minister's officials not know? I recollect why a medical man who was giving good service was dismissed?\n\nMr. McBride: I might say a word in connection with a medical man appointed in my district.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: We had better get through with this one first.\n\nMr. McBride: I might inform the committee that one of my strongest opponents, a prominent Conservative, was appointed and no one had any objection to offer.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Can the minister not ascertain any reasons at all for the change that was made in this case? Are we not entitled to know whether or not the most honest and conscientious in the matter, or whether the change was made from purely party interest? What is the House for if the minister can simply say he does not know and no one else knows? That does not help matters.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): All I can say is that I have been in the habit of dismissing people for partisan purposes. I have no recollection of how the change came about; although I recollect the name, I am sure. I assume also that the Indians are getting the same kind of service now that they got in the past. I do not think it is incumbent upon me to give further reasons.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: What about the returned soldier phase of the question? Does not that apply to the minister?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Almost in every case, yes.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Why not in this case?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have already told my hon. friend that I have no recollection of the change having been made, and therefore it was quite in order and proper. If it was not, why, I have no information to give about it.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I do not know why the minister qualifies his remarks with the phrase, \"no doubt.\" Has the deputy no recollection of the change at all? I can scarcely think he has not. I think the change was wrong. I do not want to be understood as complaining about the medical qualifications of the new doctor, nor at all. But if the government really considers the returned soldier in matters of this kind, they should not have made that change; and in any event, when they make the change they should have made sure that a returned soldier would get the benefit.\n\nMr. JACOBS: It might be consoling to the leader of the Opposition to know that firing good men seems to have been epidemic in Portage la Prairie.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: That is right.\n\nMr. GOULD: Can we ascertain from the figures given by the minister regarding the total productions or reduction during the last year what resource shows the best returns? Are the various amounts given separately? I have in mind the White Bear reserve where my hon. friend says that the Indians should be given better school facilities on the principle laid down by the member for Prince Albert (Mr. Knox). Last year I visited the reserve, did some visits to many reservations throughout the western country, but I find that the White Bear reservation was passed over. He did not visit the honourable member's district. There are many things there not altogether connected with the Indians that might come under the department. There are three or four questions connected with the Indian reservations, such as pleasure resorts and so on, which the department might consider. I might state that on that reservation the Indians have facilities for production which are better than can be found on the average reservation. They have an open area for the raising of cereals as well as fish, which provides pasturage and facilities for the raising of cattle, an industry which the Indians go in for extensively in that locality. The Indians make one complaint particularly in regard to that reservation. There are large sloughs on which there are vast quantities of hay, but outside of that area there is very little. The white people, when they fail to get their share of hay to put the hay up, endeavour to rent these hay areas from them, but in all cases they have been refused. With the result that hundreds of tons of hay are grown each year in these sloughs. I do not know whether the minister has any jurisdiction in this matter, or whether the question wholly rests with the Indians. I think it would be found, if...\nthe various returns were segregated, that per\nexample, the White Bear reserve, which we\nare to the end of the day in the matter of pro-\nduction; and when Indians show such a state\nof progress I think they should be given\ngreater encouragement in the way of facilities than is evident now by the quality\nof the buildings that are to be found on\nthat reservation. While I am about it I wish\nto express the minister's hearty invitation\nto come this summer and pay this reserva-\ntion a visit.\n\nMr. KNIGHT: Is there any expenditure on\nwhat is known as the Round Plain band of\nSioux Indians north of Prince Albert?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We have an\nexpenditure at the Carleton agency of $552\nin respect of that particular band.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: Does the minister con-\ntemplate any reorganisation of his depart-\nment in the West? Has he in mind any\nchange of status of any of the inspectors out\nthere?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Not at the\nmoment. The inspectors appear to be doing\ngood work. I speak particularly of the two\nwho operate from Regina. I think some\nchange might be made which would be bene-\nficial to the service, but I have not arrived\nat a definite conclusion about it yet.\n\nMr. MEIGHEN: I would like to see this\nand it has to do with what has been member\nfor Victoria City (Mr. Tolmie) impressed\nupon the minister a few moments ago in re-\nlation to the improvement and the multipli-\ncation of the work upon the reserves and the gen-\neral farming among the Indians. Every-\nthing, or nearly everything, depends upon the\nefficiency, energy and fidelity of the agent.\nOur Indian agents are selected by the Civil\nService Commission, and I think taken all\nthrough, the commission are as likely to get\nefficient agents as the minister would be if the\nappointment were made in his hands\u2014in\nfact more so. They are as able to make\na mistake\u2014no more so; but they are not subject to the same pressure to appoint\nsomebody who is merely efficient. But unless\nthere is an official of necessary judg-\nment, and not only a good judge of the suc-\ncess or failure of an agent, but with the\nbacking behind him that the agent does his\nwork or, if not, to recommend that the\nfact that his services be dispensed with, there will\nnot be any multiplication of Indian stock and\nthere will not be any improvement of In-\ndian farming. I have in mind, of course,\nMr. Graham. I learned to know something of\nthe actual work of Mr. Graham in that re-\ngard, and the minister is not fortunate in\nindeed in having a man who has the mastery\nover agencies that Mr. Graham has. An\nagent who fails should be discharged, because\nhe will be deprived from his failure, and con-\nsequently there should be no principle of\nmercy whatever in dealing with him.\n\nAn agent ought to succeed or he ought\nto be discharged. The minister himself can-\nnot nor should he be a judge anywhere else\nin Ottawa, be a correct judge of the work of\nan agent. You can tell a lot, I know, from\nthe reports sent here, but it is only by being\nin constant touch with the men themselves\nthat the quality of the agent's work can be\ngauged. This work is under observation from\nmonth to month and from year to year by the\nminister and the agent is aware of this\nand knows that he must be constantly visited\nhim. Unless that is the case there is likely\nto be laxitude and lethargy on the part of\nthe agent and perhaps the minister. That\nis the suggestion I make to the minister.\n\nHe states there has been a diminution of\nIndian stock in the last ten years. I believe\nthis is correct. But what I think is also\ncorrect is that up to the time the jurisdi-\nction of Mr. Graham was extended, about\nfive or six years ago, the diminution had\ngone on pretty rapidly. In certain agencies\nwhere efficient men were put in charge and\nthe droves were moved by or moved away\nand better men put in their places, there was\nan improvement in cattle production. I do\nnot know what the result has been for the\nlast year or two. I should think the im-\nprovement had continued, because, as every-\none knows, there has been a general diminu-\ntion of stock all over the West, and the\nagencies which have had the same experience as\nothers, the depression which has operated\namong them with the same result as it has\noperated among the white people. But, sub-\nject to that consideration, there was an im-\nprovement for quite little time, and the\nminister will never be able to maintain the\nimprovement or advance upon it unless he\nsucceeds in weeding out poor agents and\ngetting efficient men in their stead.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nBritish Columbia, $399,850.\n\nMr. MacKELVIE: What has been done re-\ngarding the appointment of an inspector of\nagencies in southern British Columbia to\nsucceed the late Major McGraw?\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): It is still before the Civil Service Commission.\n\nMr. MacKELVIE: And Kamloops?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The same.\n\nMr. GARLAND: What is the explanation of the increase of $278?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Statutory increases of salaries to the officials.\n\nMr. LADNER: How many Indians are at present in jail on account of pot-latching?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I am informed there are not any.\n\nMr. LADNER: I saw by the press a few days ago that Magistrate Halliday of Alert Bay had sent down some Indians.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We have no report.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nGeneral, $147,500.\n\nMr. JACOBS: I do not know whether under this item I can ask the minister respecting the sensational reports that appeared in the newspapers a few days ago regarding the expulsion of certain halfbreeds from Caughnawaga reserve near Montreal. It was reported that some of these people who had been living on the reserve for a considerable time on the reserve were expelled without notice and were becoming public charges on the adjoining municipalities.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have rather a large item here on the mainhead, but part of it is that a white man married a native woman on the reserve, and an arrangement was made with the Indian father-in-law under which the white man undertook to maintain him in return for a lease of land. This arrangement the white man did not carry out to the satisfaction of the father-in-law, who wished to have an agreement fulfilled. The outcome was that the council of the Caughnawaga Indians took action by resolution asking for the removal of the white man from the reserve and in connection with that request the constable was sent down to take the man. In the meantime he disappeared across the boundary and unfortunately his wife and children, who were living for some time on the reserve, had to be ejected at the request of the council. That is all that happened; there was nothing sensational about it. It was merely carrying out the request of the council itself. There is no intention of going any further with the matter or of removing anybody else.\n\n[Mr. MacKELVIE]\n\nMr. JACOBS: The newspaper report was highly sensational; it stated that about 2,000 people were ejected by this expulsion.\n\nMr. KENNEDY (Glengarry): I notice in this item the sum of $50,000, payments to Indians surrendered to the lands under certain provisions of the Indian Act. In connection with the St. Regis reservation, certain islands in the river St. Lawrence were held in common ownership, which in the last few years have expired. What islands are there in the St. Lawrence near the St. Regis reservation the leases of which have expired, and what is the policy of the department in that connection?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): This question is before the courts for decision and in the meanwhile we cannot give a very direct reply.\n\nMr. KENNEDY (Glengarry): What islands are involved in the controversy?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): We have not that information, but we shall be glad to get it for my hon. friend and send it to him to-day.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nIndian Affairs\u2014Indian education, $1,945,702.\n\nMr. MANION: Would the minister explain the item of over $1,000,000 for Indians?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): The appropriation is for buildings, and includes the following: new school building at Edmonton, $145,000; Blood reserve, residential school connected with the mission of the Church of England, to be built at a cost of $125,000; Coqualeetza industrial school improvements, $115,000. This institution has had a most successful record, and is conducted by the Methodist church; it enjoys popularity among the Protestant Indians in British Columbia. Keseseconse, a Roman Catholic school which closed two years ago, to be reopened at an expenditure of $40,000. We are spending on St. Mary's mission school, British Columbia, $30,000; Birtle school at Birtle, Manitoba, $15,000; Crow Lake, northern Manitoba, additions to main building, $10,000; Portage la Prairie, additions to main building, $5,000. We are also constructing a new building for each of these schools. There are also two items, one of $35,000 and one of $27,000, with which it is proposed to purchase, for the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches, two Indian residential schools in Saskatchewan, to be adequately equipped and modern in every respect.\nMr. MANION: The minister spoke of a school being reopened. How did the Indians get along without that school, and why is it that just at the present time it requires to be opened? I am only asking for information.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): There have been a number of cases in which day schools have been found to be entirely ineffective because you could not get an attendance. That applies particularly to the reopening of this particular school. The department attempted to carry on the educational work on some of these reserves by day school, but it was found that proper results could not be obtained except by the boarding school method.\n\nMr. MANION: The teachers are mostly white girls and men, are they not?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Yes. They are practically all qualified teachers.\n\nMr. MANION: Some of the Indians have taken teachers' courses and are teaching in the schools.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): Some in Ontario, but none in the West.\n\nMr. MANION: The cost of building materials is now from 69 to 70 per cent in excess of pre-war prices. There is no doubt that within the next two or three years these prices will drop considerably. In many parts of Canada both private and public construction building is being held up for that very reason, and I was wondering whether, by occupying other buildings temporarily for a time there could not be great saving to the country by not proceeding with these building operations just now. I do not suppose the prices will come down to a pre-war basis, but they will undoubtedly be reduced by about 40 per cent in the next two or three years. It would be well worth while, I should think, for the minister and his department to consider holding these buildings up for the present, when costs are so very high.\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I have exactly the same ideas as my hon. friend, but this is an acute situation. I have pointed out to the minister that since the beginning of the war have any improvements been made to any appreciable extent to any of these buildings. As to the building at Kamloops, I am sure my hon. friend would not house his staff in the building there until such time as they are attempting to carry on educational work, and I think my hon. friend from Calgary will bear me out in that. I examined the building myself. Many of these appropriations that I am asking for so far as buildings are concerned are being asked for because the buildings are absolutely tumbling down. For that reason I do not think the word received by letter from a good Catholic priest who is doing a splendid work in northern British Columbia when he declares that the buildings there will not stand for another year, and the minister has not replied to him, and the school is likely to fall down upon them at any time. I did not see that building myself, but having seen some of the others I am unable to say he is wrong for it. In the case of Edmonton, the Red Deer school has been closed with the promise of a school at Edmonton, and we have to provide the accommodation. All these are cases of the utmost urgency, or I would not have asked for these appropriations.\n\nMr. MANION: I quite understand the minister's position, and I do not doubt his word for a moment. I also quite understand the difficulties attending the erection of northern British Columbian, it may not be possible to get other quarters temporarily, but it would seem to me that in a large city like Edmonton it does not take very long to obtain temporary quarters in which to carry on until the prices of materials come down and the buildings could be built more cheaply. I do not intend to raise any further objection, but I do suggest to the minister that in the larger centres such as Edmonton, where no doubt temporary quarters could be obtained in which to carry on this school work, the department should proceed in erecting buildings until prices reach something like a normal figure. I do not want to suggest, because a little while ago I was taking the part of a Hindu in a certain way, obtaining them of the necessary education they require. I would be the last to do that, but I believe that under certain circumstances and in certain centres the same education might be given in temporary quarters until such time as prices reach a normal level.\n\nMr. McBride: I have been engaged in the building supplies trade for twenty-five years and I can see no prospect of building material coming down. When you talk about building material coming down, I say that expenses and taxes have got to come down first. In pre-war days my taxes at Vancouver were less than $100. Now they are over $200, and that has to be added to the cost of the material. That is only one item. Indeed I can see no chance of building material coming down.\nMr. MANION: I admit that what my hon. friend says about building material is true to a certain extent. The rate of wages are being paid today which are materially higher than we paid before the war and I hope for the future in this country that even the cost of materials may be lowered so that perhaps wages will come down below one dollar an hour which is being paid to certain trades at the present time. I hope that will happen for the good of the country, and I think it will happen in the next few years. We have had the privilege recently of reading the opinions of those who have given this question lifelong study, and it is their opinion and advice in the case of any large buildings involving a considerable expenditure to wait for prices to come down.\n\nMr. JACOBS: Change your immigration regulations and then I think you can go on with the work.\n\nMr. MANION: They are not mine.\n\nMr. WARNER: While I have sympathy with the position taken by my hon. friend from Fort William, I happen to know the conditions at Edmonton. It is almost impossible at the present time to get quarters for the white population in the city, and it would be impossible to get any building in the city of Edmonton for an Indian school. I believe that it would be the part of wisdom to postpone expenditure on buildings where temporary quarters could be obtained, as they have been done at Edmonton. They have carried on under such difficulties that I believe the department is justified in going ahead and building this school for the Indians who have been moved to Edmonton from the old Red Deer school.\n\nMr. JACOBS: Would the minister explain why the change is being made from Red Deer to Edmonton?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): I cannot give my hon. friend full information because it was done prior to my coming into office, but I am told that the reason was in part that Edmonton is more central, easier of access and better for the children.\n\nMr. JACOBS: I thought it was perhaps for the same reason that Sir Hughes ordered the arsenal to be brought from Quebec to Lachine.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nIndian Affairs\u2014salaries $183,239; contingencies $19,000.\n\nMr. BANCROFT: Will the minister explain the increase in this item?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): It is made up purely of statutory increases. There is no change in the number of officials.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nFurther Supplementary Estimates, 1923\u2014Department of Indian Affairs\u2014salaries\u2014\n\nTo provide for one Accountant, Grade 2, at $2,580 in lieu of one Accountant, Grade 2, at $2,000.\n\nTo provide for one Accountant, Grade 1, at $1,620, in lieu of one Senior Clerk-Bookkeeper, Grade 1, at $1,100.\n\nTo provide for one Senior Clerk-Bookkeeper, Grade 1, in lieu of one Clerk-Bookkeeper at $1,100.\n\nTo provide for one Senior Law Clerk-Stenographer at $1,320.\n\nContingencies\u2014further amount required: $1,000.\n\nMr. KENNEDY (Glengarry): Are these permanent employees?\n\nMr. STEWART (Argenteuil): No, they are temporary employees. Increases are being provided by the Civil Service Commission as follows: $120, $50, $270 and $45.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nPensions\u2014European War and Active Militia, $50,000.\n\nHon. H. S. BELAND (Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment): I suppose that hon. members would like to have a few statistics placed before them as to the number of pensioners and other matters.\n\nMr. MANION: May I interrupt the minister for a moment? I do not know whether my point will be well taken or not but this is one of the paramount questions before the country today. There is also the fact that a royal commission has been sitting and taking evidence on the matter of pensions and its interim report has not been made available. I am just suggesting this to the minister in the interest of his own department, in the interest of publicity and in the interest of making the matter thoroughly understood. I suggest that he might hold this item over and make a statement regarding pensions\u2014giving the statistics he wishes to give and explaining any regulations which may have been changed before a larger House, and perhaps earlier in the day when the discussion would receive a certain amount of publicity which it would not get tonight. I see the interest of the minister himself and his department. I suggest that it would be well to hold up this item until we can get a report from the royal\nIncreased appropriations for Indian Education have given the Department an opportunity to further develop its plans for the education of the youth of our wards. Several new residential schools have been completed, or are under construction, and some of the increased appropriation has been used to better conditions in existing institutions.\n\nThe policy today is to care for all capital expense at Indian residential schools, whenever funds can be found for the purpose. This releases the finances of the missionary societies and orders, that are active in Indian education, for better instruction, food and clothing. It should be mentioned, in connection with residential school work, that there is now unified church control for all Anglican residential schools and an unofficial central clearing-house for all special requests and matters of policy in connection with the Roman Catholic institutions. For some years, the Methodist and Presbyterian residential school work has been controlled by officers of the missionary societies. Centralized control, on the part of the churches, has now practically eliminated the necessity of negotiating with local diocesan, synod and conference authorities.\n\nFor many years the religious status of applicants for admission to residential schools has been a vexed question. Some months ago the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, prepared an interpretation of that section of the Indian Act, which refers to the school attendance of Indian children. I am pleased to report that our rulings in this connection have of late been more clearly defined and have been the occasion for quite favourable comment.\n\nLarger appropriations have enabled the Department to make a definite effort to provide more attractive instruction in the classrooms of the day schools. We have raised the salary schedules and are securing the services of better qualified teachers. Further, an academic inspection has been arranged for the schools in all provinces except Yukon. We have also arranged with several of the Provincial Departments of Education to have teachers of Indian schools attend, and participate in, local teachers' institutes, conventions and demonstrations. Throughout the Dominion the Provincial courses of study for public and separate schools are being used in the Indian school classrooms. In line with this effort to make the instruction more attractive, more classroom and recreational equipment is being supplied.\n\nYour attention should be drawn to the fact that continuation and high school work has been conducted in several of our day and residential schools during the past few years. In the case of several of the residential schools that are situated close to municipal high schools and colleges, the more advanced pupils in residence are\nbenefiting by secondary training, in competition with white children. More grants are being made to assist promising graduates of Indian schools to secure academic and vocational education in colleges, business colleges and universities.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to inform you that the attendance of Indian children at all classes of schools is steadily increasing, and if Parliament continues to make appropriations that will permit of our programme, this generation of Indian children will receive a general training which will make their wardship in the future more nominal than heretofore.\nCOPY of enclosure forwarded under cover of letter received from Mr. Commissioner Graham, dated June 21, 1923.

Several new schools are under construction, and better accommodation and facilities are being provided at existing institutions.\n\nThe policy today is to care for all capital expense at Indian residential schools whenever funds can be found for the purpose. This releases the finances of the missionary societies and orders, that are active in Indian education, for better instruction, food and clothing. More centralized control and better supervision, on the part of the churches, also has resulted in more efficient administration of the individual residential schools. It should be added that departmental inspection of the academic and vocational work has never been as thorough as at the present time.\n\nLarger appropriations have enabled the Department to make a definite effort to provide more attractive instruction in the classrooms of the day schools. Salary schedules have been raised and the services of better qualified teachers are being secured. Further, an academic inspection has been arranged for the schools in all provinces except Yukon.

In addition, the Department assisted in the maintenance of 13 combined white and Indian schools. In the tabular statements in Part 2 of this report will be found a list of the schools, showing the reserve, agency and province, and indicating the enrolment in each case.\n\nCompared with the previous year, there is an increase of one residential school and 5 day schools. The Department has assumed the responsibility for the St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson, Yukon, and has opened several new day schools. Certain day schools on reserves have been closed, because of no progress, and the Indian children recruited for residential schools.\n\nThe total enrolment for the year was 13,723 pupils\u2014an increase over the preceding year of 702. Nearly one-half of this increase is accounted for by larger enrolment at residential schools, the pupilage of which has had to be increased. The average daily attendance was 9,106\u2014an increase of 482 over the preceding year. A study of the grades of the pupils shows that 1,529 are in Standard 5, or higher\u2014an increase in advanced pupils over the preceding year of 141. The percentage of attendance has increased slightly, from 66.46 to 66.58, showing that with increased enrolment there develops an interest on the part of parents and guardians.\n\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools, as follows:\n\n- Roman Catholic\u20147 residential and 52 day schools;\n- Church of England\u20147 residential and 52 day schools;\n- Methodist\u20147 residential and 52 day schools;\n- Presbyterian\u20147 residential and 52 day schools;\n- Salvation Army\u20141 day school.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned in the tabular statements, there are some 150 Indian students enrolled in high schools, colleges and universities in Canada. In the case of most of these, the Department assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation. In this connection $10,327.56 was expended during the past year. The policy is to make grants to the most promising graduates of Indian residential and day schools. If church and department representatives consider a graduate worthy, the Department provides a grant, when the bona fide intention of the pupil is evident and provided proper supervision can be secured for the period of advanced study. These tuition grants are continued only when satisfactory reports are received. The practice of assisting ex-pupils of residential schools to start farming and housekeeping has been continued; grants for stock, implements, building and household equipment have been made to some promising graduates.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1923, amounted to $1,437,642.03, as follows:\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe Department wishes to arrange for a careful and accurate keeping of classroom daily registers. It has been found that many Indian residential schools do not observe this practice; and still others, in the classrooms of which the registers are carefully kept, make no reference to them when the quarterly return is being compiled. In this return there is a column for the purpose of showing the total number of days the pupils attended the classroom during the quarter, and this should be carefully filled in, after reference to the classroom daily register.\n\nThe Department considers that every pupil in a residential school should attend classroom, no matter how pressing the work may be in other departments, at least five half days per week, except in the case of illness or absence from the school. In a quarter of, say 91 days there are approximately 65 school days. Junior pupils, who may be in the classroom both morning and afternoon, will attend a total of 65 days during the quarter: older boys and girls, who have regular duties on the farm or in one of the departments, will attend classroom perhaps only 32\u00bd days; other pupils will show 35, 38\u00bd, 43, 49\u00bd, etc. A separate register must be kept for each classroom and both morning and afternoon an accurate tally should be made.\n\nIt is extremely desirable that the Department have this record; and the column in the quarterly report, showing classroom attendance, should receive meticulous care in the preparation thereof, after careful reference to the classroom registers.\n\nThe column, showing the total number of days pupils were in residence during the quarter, should be made out as heretofore, and the per capita earnings will be determined solely by the figures shown. The classroom attendance column should be prepared just as carefully, so that a discontented parent, or any other interested correspondent can be given correct information without delay.\n\nIf you have not on hand a daily register for each classroom, please make immediate application to the Secretary for copies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Farrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Oct. 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for the attention of yourself and Inspectors Christianson and Murison, copies of circular letter which has been directed to all principals of Indian residential schools. I shall be pleased to have the cooperation of your office in connection with more complete quarterly returns from this type of institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 19th instant enclosing copy of a circular sent to the various principals of residential schools, regarding the matter of keeping a class room daily register. I think this is a splendid idea and I will see that our Inspectors pay particular attention to this matter.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be a good idea to have a copy of this circular handed to the various Provincial School Inspectors so that they will know what to expect when they go to a school. As you know these letters regarding schools are never brought to the attention of Provincial inspectors but are kept in the office and unless they knew what the rules are they will not be able to tell us if they are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Nov. 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-11 of the 29th ultimo, in which you suggest that a copy of the circular relative to the keeping of classroom registers be given to the various Provincial Public School Inspectors. I have to inform you that this action is being taken today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNEARLY 14,000 INDIAN CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL\n\nNearly 14,000 Indian children in Canada attend the day and residential schools. Of this number more than 5000 are in residential schools, which are the most important factor in the development of our Indian youth. In these institutions provision is made to supplement academic instruction with vocational training.\n\nThe industrial and boarding schools\u201474 in number\u2014are financed and managed jointly by the Department of Indian Affairs and the various churches engaged in the work. The institution workers are nominated by the church authorities and the activities supervised by them and by the department. There is a classroom inspection by properly qualified school inspectors. The vocational training and the institution generally, are inspected by the department officials. The major portion of the capital equipment is met by parliamentary appropriation, and for current expenses there is a per capita grant from the same source. When the per capita grant is not sufficient for the conduct of the school, the mission or society in charge provides sufficient funds.\n\nAn institution of 125 pupils has on the staff, in addition to the principal and his assistant, two classroom teachers, a farm instructor, a general mechanic, a matron or sister superior, and four or five other lady workers or sisters, who supervise the kitchen, sewing room, laundry and other household classes and duties. One member of the staff is qualified to do practical nursing. Indian children are admitted at the age of seven or eight years. An annual vacation of ten months is allowed and is enjoyed by all pupils whose homes are within reasonable distances.\n\nPupils in primary grades devote both morning and afternoon to class-room exercises; but the school day is divided for older pupils, between academic instruction and vocational training.\n\nThe boys receive, in addition to a public school education, instruction in farming, gardening and the care of stock. In some schools carpentry, shoemaking and blacksmithing are taught to a few boys. The girls have domestic duties and instruction as well as classroom exercises\u2014the aim being to graduate young women who can be good housekeepers. A portion of each day and all of Saturday afternoon is devoted to organized play and other supervised recreation. In addition to irregular Sunday worship and instruction, religious services are conducted both morning and evening, and days off the work.\n\nAn increasingly important activity is the high school instruction of older pupils resident at Indian schools which are situated close to cities or large towns. When an Indian boy or girl shows academic promise, the department allows an increased per capita grant, if the school can arrange for the regular attendance of the pupil at a neighboring high school. Indian children for whom these arrangements are impossible attend secondary schooling in competition with white boys and girls and at the same time live in Christian institutions where their evening activities are thoroughly supervised.\n\nThe churches engaged in residential school work have, in the past, erected some modern buildings that are adequate and suitable for the purpose of Indian education. The government is, at the present time, rapidly replacing unsuitable institutions with well equipped school buildings. Architects and engineers, the department architect gives the major portion of his time to the erection of institutions that gives the requirements for our Indian wards. At the present writing 47 of the 74 Indian residential school are lighted electrically, heated by one unit, and are equipped with modern plumbing.\nSome Points on Indian Education\n\nBy R. B. Heron\n\nIn The Regina Leader, a news item from Ottawa states that the Social Service Council of Canada passed certain resolutions; one of which was to ask for better enforcement of the School Attendance Act, as it applied to the Indian schools.\n\nCompulsory school attendance is quite familiar to us, but as applied to the Indian children it presents something quite different from the law which governs the attendance of white children at the ordinary public school. In one case it means the attendance in the classroom\u2014in the other merely the taking up of residence in a particular School or Industrial School. But this is a point the Social Service Council may have overlooked: viz., Indians may be in a school, living in it day and night, in fact, yet not be in regular attendance in the class-room.\n\nIndian children are compelled to leave their homes at the age of seven\u2014to remain in school, with only an occasional holiday, until they are eighteen. The parents have no voice in the selection of the teacher nor in the selection of the course of study the children are to pursue, nor in the number of hours they attend the class-room.\n\nThe Indians, as a rule, are anxious to have their children educated, but they complain that they are not kept regularly in the classrooms; that they are kept out at work, the proceeds of which go for the school; that when they return to the Reserves, they have not enough education to enable them to transact ordinary business\u2014scarcely enough to enable them to write a legible letter.\n\nThere are farms and gardens and laundries and shops and kitchens in connection with Indian Schools; the parents claim their children spend time at work there that should be devoted to the class-room.\n\nThe scholastic standing of many of the graduates of these schools would indicate that the parents have considerable ground for complaint.\n\nIt is doubtful if the majority of these pupils, leaving school at eighteen years of age, could pass a higher examination than that set by a fourth or fifth grade class in a school for white children. To say that white children are more intelligent and learn faster, does not dispose of the complaint, nor explain the difference in the standing of white and Indian children after the same number of years of school attendance to their credit. Indians have shown over and over again that they are capable of holding their own in class-room and college halls, and also in literary work of very great value. I have met a Cree Indian, gold medallist at the University of Munich, who later translated the Gospel of Luke from the Greek to the Cree. Another, Pauline Johnstone, whose verse and story are a lasting delight to Canadian hearts, was a leading artist. Lately appeared in the Regina Leader, and also in McLean's Magazine, articles of great historic value, written by a blood Indian of Alberta, Capt. Long Lance. This man, while a Canadian Indian, had to go to the United States to procure the education that enabled him to write so good a story. These are only a few names selected from a great number, that have proven the Indians are just as capable of grasping them, if given the chance.\n\nThe ex-pupils of our Indian Schools have such faulty education that very few of them are capable of interpreting Cree into English or vice versa. A story is told of a clergyman who was invited to preach to an Indian congregation through an interpreter, from the text: (Matt. 14:27) \"It is I; be not afraid.\" When this came to the ears of the congregation in their language, it was: \"Hit him in the eye, don't be afraid!\"\n\nOne has only to attempt a conversation with these ex-pupils to find how very meagre is their English vocabulary, and how painfully limited their knowledge. This is further emphasized by the fact that very few of them subscribe for a paper or magazine of any kind. Any system of education that leaves young men and women without a desire to read, is open to criticism.\n\nI would point out too, in passing, that men with years' experience among the Indians agree that the younger men have not so high sense of honor as, and are less self-reliant than the old Indians who have never been in school.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church is conducting a number of Indian schools in Saskatchewan and Manitoba; it is most important that, as a Church, every possible effort be made to fulfill obligations to these parents whose children we have taken, and that we give these children the training that will best equip them for a place in the citizenship of the country.\n\nAvonhurst, Sask.\nIndian Schools in Western Canada\n\nBy Rev. J. R. Watts, D.D.\n\nAccording to the last census there were resident in Canada 105,000 Indians, of whom 75 per cent were living west of the Great Lakes and 2,155 of whom were classed as Presbyterian. The work among these aboriginal Canadians is done by the chiefs of the Western Missionary Society and the Board of Home Missions, and if one considers what the history of the Indian has been since he has yielded possession of the continent that once was his to white settlers, it becomes evident that no greater obligation can rest upon us as a nation or a Church than our debt to this dispossessed people.\n\nFor some reason, and whatever the reason is, it is not a good one, the Church has largely ignored this phase of Home Mission work than of any other in which we are engaged. In consequence the men and women who have devoted their lives to this service are less known and their efforts are less appreciated than the duty of any other class of workers in the Church.\n\nThe honor of initiating religious work among the Indians of Canada belongs, of course, to the French race and the Roman Catholic Church, but the heroic efforts of their early missionaries have been made familiar to most readers in the matchless and fascinating narrative of Parkman. For obvious reasons English and Protestant effort began much later, and the drama of the struggle and the flavor of romance that distinguishes Brebeuf's story and that of his associates. Nevertheless, there is written into Protestant effort a devotion and consecration that we will do ill to forget. The story may be long for the reader, but it is worth setting down here that it exists, even though it is not often retold.\n\nPresbyterian effort at the present time is centred in seven residential schools and six-day schools, all west of Lake Superior. The object of these agencies of missions, whose first and single purpose was to evangelize the Indians, and they have expanded into their present form without losing their primary purpose or displacing it, because of the efforts of the missions, to educate as well as to evangelize, and to confirm in the faith as well as to convert their charges.\n\nThe oldest of the existing residential schools is at Round Lake. It was established 13 miles from Stockholm, in the Qu'Appelle Valley, in 1887. The present staff consists of the principal and seven assistants. The others in the order of the date of their founding are: Birtle, on the edge of the town after which it is named, in 1888; Ahousaht, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, in the same year; File Hills, 12 miles from Saskatoon, in 1893; St. Albert, near the Tresahit Reserve, in 1894; Alberville near the west side of Shoal Lake, 40 miles from Kenora. The combined staffs number forty-seven. There is a total area of about 2,000 acres connected with the farms. Last year there was an enrollment of 500.\n\nIn addition to these, six day schools were under our charge last year\u2014Swan Lake, in Manitoba; Cold Moon, Ontario; File Hills, and Round Plain in Saskatchewan, and Uchelet in British Columbia, with an enrollment of 165.\n\nBecause of its national importance the support and maintenance of these schools is shared jointly with the Dominion Government. In the case of the day schools both building and salary is provided by the Government, while the Church nominates the teacher, for whom the attraction is not the salary, but the opportunity for missionary service. In the case of residential schools four are owned by the Church and three by the Government. In the matter of maintenance the Government makes a grant of $145 per capita. The present policy of the Government is to provide equipment and maintain all buildings, leaving the management and conduct, under supervision, of course, to the Churches engaged in this work. The Department of Indian Affairs, under the superintendence of Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott, is genuinely interested in the welfare of the Indian wards, and is seeking by every means in its power to promote their interests.\n\nThese two facts explain why residential schools are preferred to day schools, and why the day is divided as it is between labor and study. In the day school, after a few hours of study the children would go back into the very conditions out of which an effort is being made to elevate them. The simple routine of home life would very largely undo the six hours of school influence. Helping the Indian to fitness for civilized conditions is a slow and laborious process at the best, but this method makes it slower than is necessary.\n\nFor that reason residential schools are preferred wherever possible. The pupils come under their care as early as the parents can be persuaded to send them. For twenty-four hours a day they are open to Christian influence. By actually sharing in the labor of the farm under competent instruction, the boys acquire new habits of steady industry and the knowledge necessary for successful farming in its various branches. Thus they are helped to combat the urge of old instincts and to fit themselves for a civilization whose social alternatives are adaptation or extinction. The girls, by their labors in the kitchen, dormitories, and hospital ward, acquire by practice as well as instruction, the knowledge and experience that fits them for making better homes than those on which they came, and to be the mothers of a healthier and more virile race.\n\nIt is not to be inferred from this that books are neglected. The course of study followed is that prescribed for the white schools in the province in which they are situated. They are inspected semi-annually by the provincial inspectors, and not infrequently these reports show that in spite of the handicap of race and habit they measure up to the standards of the white schools.\n\nA word at the end in appreciation of the men and women who have devoted themselves to this work. At the recent meeting of the executive of the Home Mission Board, Indian work was reviewed with marked enthusiasm. The principals of the various schools had been asked for their opinions on methods and results. The members of the Board heard with keen pleasure letters after letter on the problems of Indian education that showed an insight and understanding that might well make the Church proud of the men who have undertaken this difficult work, often in surroundings that call for firm courage and noble endurance. We do well to remember with gratitude, to encourage with our interest and aid with our prayers these men who are helping to meet what again, let it be said, is our primary missionary obligation.\n\nOttawa.\nMr. Russell L.

H. Campbell, Esq., M. P.,\nPelly,\nSask.\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI am informed that at the Duck Lake Indian School, which school is under the control of the Rev. Father Delmas, not a word of French is taught to the Indian pupils.\n\nThe management of the school assures us that orders have been received from the Department to this effect.\n\nIf this is true, and it certainly seems to be so, we must protest against a circumstance which is above all a flagrant violation of the Act of Union. This school is subsidized by the Federal Government, and is only maintained thanks to the subsidies from the Federal Government, and as the French language is certainly still an official language, it has in this case the same right to be taught and spoken to the little Indians as English.\n\nWe hope that orders will rapidly be sent to this effect, and if it is otherwise, we would have to bring the matter before Parliament through one of our friends.\n\nHoping for an acknowledgment, we remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nL'Association Interprovinciale\nRaymond Denis,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 4th, I have to say that it is not the policy of the Department to teach French in our Indian schools except in the Province of Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRaymond Denis, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nL'Association Interprovinciale,\nVonda, Sask.\nHOLY FAMILY CHURCH\n\nOttawa, Ont., April 14th 1924.\n\nMr. Roch Lano\u00ebt, M.P.\nMember for Laprairie-Saperville.\n\nSir,\n\nreferring to my request of the other day for an interview with the Minister of Indian Affairs, and acting on your advice, I beg to submit in writing the claims which we believe proper.\n\nFirst of all, you know that the Indians, in all the provinces, have been evangelized and educated by French-Canadian religious orders. On the other hand, it seems that the Government provides for the teaching of the English language only in the industrial and catholic boarding schools established in the various reserves of the different provinces of the Dominion.\n\nI think this is most unfair because:\n\n1. This course of action offers no recognition of the work, the devotion and the sacrifices of our people.\n\n2. The religious orders are thus obliged to employ in the Indian schools and churches, and for the ministry, only priests and nuns who have a perfect knowledge of the English language. This constitutes a heavy burden which will have to be borne a long time if the present policy is adhered to.\n\n3. Catholic Indians have always considered the French or French-Canadians priests as their fathers. The ignorance of the French language in which they are kept will hasten their separation from their benefactors. It is already generally recognized that this estrangement has had bad results both from the moral and the religious standpoints.\n\n4. The Department of Indian Affairs being under the federal administration, the expenditure incurred on its account has to be borne by all the taxpayers of the country. This banishment of the French language from the schools constitutes a wrong against the French-Canadians. Officially, the Indians are considered as English speaking catholics, to the prejudice of the French-Canadian section which has evangelized and educated them. The resulting change in the statistics is most unfavorable to the claims of the French-Canadians, especially in the western provinces.\n\nFinally, the Indian schools are under the federal jurisdiction where the two languages are official. Therefore, we request the Government to redress those grievances by having the English and French languages taught concurrently, and to appoint a school inspector under the Department at Ottawa, who would see to the carrying out of this program. This would be proper recognition of the sacrifices of our people in favour of this class of citizens.\n\nHoping, Sir, that you will have no trouble in gaining the object of the present petition, I have the honour to be,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

So I would like to know, whether children go to these schools by the own free will of their parents or guardians or whether these schools are a kind of Reformatory Institutions to which children are committed.\n\nI also would be interested to learn, whether at the day schools in the reservations the Indian languages are taught as well as the English.\n\nIf you would be in a position to help me with some literature and illustrations about the Indians in general, I should be very grateful to you.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir, to be\n\nyours faithfully:\n\nEmil Mischik-Droonberg\nAuthor of \"Laughing Water\" (London 1913, by John Lane.)\nDOMINION OF CANADA\n\nINCOME TAX\n\nMEMORANDUM RE FORMS T. 1, T. 1A AND T. 2\n\nReturns should be prepared in triplicate.

I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of the last Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs as well as a copy of the Indian Act, 1906, with amendments. By reference to Section 10 of the Act you will obtain the information you requested.\n\nThe teaching of the English language is compulsory in all Indian schools except in a few schools in the province of Quebec, where French is the language used in the classroom instruction. We have no photos available for distribution, which could be sent you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nEmil Muschik-Droonberg, Esq.,\nWittstockstr., 7,\nLeipzig, Germany.\nIndian Educational work is increasing and the results of the activity are more encouraging. Buildings and other physical equipment have been prepared as funds were provided for the purpose and qualified teachers, whose activity is carefully supervised, are engaged in the various schools. Centralized control, on the part of the four churches which are actively associated with the Department in the work, has resulted in standardized maintenance and instruction. Residential schools are filled to the limit of their capacity, which is indicative of an awakened interest in education on the part of Indian communities. During the past fiscal year 5,673 Indian children were maintained and educated in the residential schools. Compare this figure with 4,783, the enrolment of three years earlier, and the increasing importance of the activity is apparent. In addition, 8,200 Indian children were enrolled in day schools and 136 young men and women were assisted in courses at high schools and colleges.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOriginal memo to Prime Minister.\n| Province          | Day Schools | Residential Fee | Scholarships | Tuition | Transport, etc., Laundry | Total |\n|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|--------------------------|-------|\n| Nova Scotia      | 10,278.84   |                 |              |         |                          | 16,297.34 |\n| Prince Edward I. | 837.72      |                 |              |         |                          | 836.02 |\n| New Brunswick    | 32,873.88   |                 |              |         |                          | 35,720.58 |\n| Quebec           | 44,555.88   |                 |              |         |                          | 55,497.91 |\n| Ontario          | 43,693.41   |                 |              |         |                          | 55,497.91 |\n| Manitoba         | 170,794.45  |                 |              |         |                          | 235,386.28 |\n| Saskatchewan     | 41,342.42   |                 |              |         |                          | 50,455.28 |\n| Alberta          | 28,579.00   |                 |              |         |                          | 318,917.07 |\n| British Columbia | 9,305.82    |                 |              |         |                          | 412,436.49 |\n| N.W.T.          | 65,230.35   |                 |              |         |                          | 492,493.05 |\n| Yukon            | 1,434.78    |                 |              |         |                          | 28,062.03 |\n|                  | 2,995.23    |                 |              |         |                          | 17,853.04 |\n|                  | 201,197.33  |                 |              |         |                          | 15,299.33 |\n|                  | 1,593.310.52|                 |              |         |                          | 6,583.61 |\n|                  | 5,481.11    |                 |              |         |                          | 43,317.04 |\n|                  | 7,997.15    |                 |              |         |                          | 1,943,486.08 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Closer association with the four Churches actively engaged in the work has resulted in better and more standardized maintenance and instruction for the 13,872 Indian children that were enrolled during the year. There was a record Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education of $1,943,702.\n\nLarger appropriations have permitted the replacement of old physical equipment and the engagement of better qualified teachers. Instruction is becoming more attractive and compared favorably with that in public and separate schools throughout Canada. In the West, residential schools are the most important factor in the programme. Main buildings were erected at the Edmonton and Coqualeetza Residential Schools, in Alberta and British Columbia, respectively. The central wing of a large institution at Kamloops, B.C., was finished and commencement was made on the St. Paul's School, near Cardston, Alta. An addition was started at the Cross Lake Residential School, in Manitoba, and barns were erected at several institutions.\n\nDuring the past fiscal year, 5,673 Indian children were maintained and educated in the residential schools. Compare this figure with 4,783, the enrolment of three years earlier, and the importance of this phase of the activity is apparent. It was considered in the interests of economy, from the standpoint of both Department and Churches, to increase the pupilage at residential schools to the limit of their accommodation. There has been a determined effort to secure the services of better qualified academic and vocational instructors for the boarding schools. The classroom and other departments are inspected by qualified officers.\n\nAn awakened interest in education on the part of Indian communities has resulted in more applications for admission to residential schools. Orphans, children from destitute homes and those living some distance from day schools on the reserves are given the preference, when the number of vacancies is limited.\nIn the Prairie Provinces, the Department has carefully supervised the health of the pupils in residence. More medical and dental attention will result, no doubt, in a more robust type of graduate.\n\nConsiderable attention has been directed to those day schools where there is a good average attendance. Provincial curricula are followed and fully qualified teachers engaged. When teaching services are being engaged, preference is given to Indians who are qualified. Workers are encouraged to attend conventions, institutes and summer courses. A special effort has been made in the matter of physical education and in the correlation of classroom exercises with vocational training and home interests.\n\nIndian children throughout Canada are studying more advanced work than in the past. During the past fiscal year 2710 children were enrolled in Grade 4, or higher. Three years ago the number was 2258. High school subjects are taught in several residential schools and in a few day schools. In the case of several of the residential schools that are situated close to municipal high schools and colleges, the more advanced pupils in residence are benefitting by secondary training in competition with white children. During the fiscal year 1923-24, tuition grants amounting to $16,299.33 have been allowed for approximately 485 Indian young men and women who are studying in normal schools and colleges in the different provinces.\n\n73 residential and 242 day schools were in operation during the year - a total of 315 Indian schools. In addition, the Department assisted in the maintenance of 9 combined white and Indian schools. In Part 2 of this report will be found a tabular statement, showing the location and indicating the enrolment in the case of each school.\n\nCompared with the previous year, there is an increase of one residential school. St. Joseph's, in southern Alberta, was closed and Edmonton and Elkhorn opened. Certain unprogressive day schools have been closed and the children recruited for residential schools. The loss in attendance at day schools in Manitoba and British Columbia is due to an increased enrolment at the residential schools of these provinces. The total enrolment for the year was 13,872 pupils - an increase over the preceding year of 149. The average daily attendance shows an increase of 82 pupils.\n\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools, as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Residential | Day Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 39          | 78          |\n| Church of England       | 21          | 70          |\n| Methodist               | 6           | 39          |\n| Presbyterian            | 7           | 5           |\n| Salvation Army          | 1           |             |\n\nIn addition to the 13,872 pupils shown in the tabular statements, there are some 125 Indian students enrolled in high schools and colleges in Canada. Further, approximately 50 Indian children are attending public schools which receive a small grant.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1924, amounted to $1,943,486.09, as follows:\nIn addition to the above, the various bands of Indians, whose funds are sufficient to meet the expenditure, contributed the sum of $87,915.69 towards the payment of teachers' salaries and for the establishment and maintenance of schools on their reserves. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1924, the amounts so contributed have been as follows: -\nSeptember 8, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nA teacher of an Indian day school has requested that he come under the Superannuation Act. This brings up the question of the status of teachers at our day schools. I consider these workers are Civil Servants; but, as they appear to be exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned, I believe they should be classed as \"temporary\".\n\nOnly permanent Civil Servants are eligible for superannuation and I propose, with your concurrence, to inform those teachers that enquire that they are ineligible.\n\nI have discussed this question with the Accountant and the Acting Assistant Deputy and they concur in this opinion.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| Province          | No. of Teachers | Total Salary | Average Salary |\n|------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Nova Scotia      | 12              | $6,350       | $529.16        |\n| New Brunswick    | 11              | 5,850        | 531.82         |\n| P.E.I.

MCREADY\nOrganizer\n\nAddress:\nThe Ontario Junior Red Cross\n410 Sherbourne St.\nToronto\nThe Children of All Nations UNITED\n\nFor Health, For Usefulness and For Friendliness\n\nWhat is a Junior Red Cross Auxiliary?\n\nA Junior Red Cross Auxiliary is an Club. The club is organized in the school under the direction of the Junior Red Cross organization. It gives the pupils the best possible opportunity to be useful, and directs their efforts toward the highest service to humanity. It is a plan of self-government.\n\nH for Health. A H.I.C. Club is a school Literary Society. In addition to the regular program of essays and speeches, the members meet once a week to discuss health topics, etc. The meeting takes the place of the formal Hygiene lesson. The pupils learn to control public houses.\n\nH for Heart. A H.I.C. Club is a junior Canadian Club or a young Grimsby League. It fosters love of country through patriotism, citizenship, and school spirit. It also helps the pupils to realize the importance of democracy.\n\nH for Hand. A H.I.C. Club is a Work Club or Pioneering Club. It helps the pupils to develop their physical and mental powers. It teaches them the value of youth for helping others. It strengthens desires for making things better about their school for the best welfare of all.\n\nH for Health. A H.I.C. Club is a Good Health Club. It makes it easy for pupils to keep healthy by encouraging them to go to school clean, to eat food that is good for them, and to sleep well.\n\nDo You Realize That To-day there is a World-wide Humanitarian Force which will be called upon in every Great Crisis to serve All Men, Everywhere, whatever their Race, Creed or Color, save that enabled under the Banner of the Red Cross?\n\nThe Junior Red Cross invites You and Your Pupils to share in this Great Adventure in the World's Great Crisis.\n\nThe Ideal\n\nMake the Work of the School fit with the Affairs of Life\n\nHere the only kind of control worth while is referred to the people who are to be controlled. Government must be by those who are governed, for representatives of a whole government must be elected by the whole government.\n\nThe teacher is the leader in bringing the power of education to bear, only when he has educated an independent and self-supporting youth.\n\nThe best influence for the children is the child, the best teacher is the child, and the best school is the school where the children are the teachers.\n\nThe Junior Red Cross HELPS in education. It refines the teacher. It brings up the pupil. It equips him with service to humanity. It enables him to be a true citizen of the world.\n\nOntario Manual on School Management\nWhat Junior Red Cross Offers to Ontario Teachers\n\nS. B. McCREADY, B.A., B.S.A.\nProvincial Organizer, Junior Red Cross\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to accept the invitation of THE SCHOOL to tell what Junior Red Cross is doing and what it can do for the cause of better training for health and citizenship in Ontario schools.\n\nTested and Proven Useful\n\n\"It gives me much pleasure to state that I have been using your Junior Red Cross during the past year in my junior classes. I have found it most interesting, impressive and practical way of teaching Hygiene. It has been no less valuable in the good government of the school. Through your hearty cooperation and assistance I have been able to make a wonderful change in my school. I consider myself fortunate enough to be connected with a school in the Province. My only complaint now is, 'Why did not some think of the Junior Red Cross?'\"\n\n\"Please send Miss Alice Smith, teacher in the Sota school, one of your 'trial-packages'. She has become interested in what I have been telling her and says she is willing to try anything once\". She has put herself into a group so deeply that she cannot attempt a new adventure in pedagogy.\"\n\nTo The Ontario Junior Red Cross,\n\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) MARY GOAHEAD,\nTeacher, Progress School.\n\nThis is not a recommendation for a patent medicine. It is a composite letter that could be duplicated many times in the letters of thanks and commendation received at Junior Red Cross headquarters from Ontario teachers during the past two years.\n\nReprinted from Vol. XII., No. 6 of \"The School\", February, 1924.\nIn Normal and Model Schools\n\nMaking no extravagant claims for Junior Red Cross as a cure-all, it may fairly be asserted that it has proven and is proving itself a useful help for many teachers, and an improved method of teaching.\n\nThe recent commendation of Mr. F. F. Macpherson, principal of the Hamilton Normal School, may be quoted in support of this claim. Pleased with the work that he had observed at a meeting of one of the Junior Red Cross Auxiliaries in the Strathcona Model School, he invited the class to repeat their meeting before the Normal School students. The Auxiliary in a business-like way discussed the invitation and formally agreed to accept it. The meeting was held again before the teacher-training classes. In Mr. Macpherson's words it provided \"one of the biggest eye-openers the Normal School students had ever had.\"\n\nOne of the best hopes for the further extension of the work is based on the fact that several Normal and Model Schools are using and testing it, apparently with satisfaction. Many of the teachers using the method this year learned about it last year in their Normal training and saw it in use in the Model Schools. Mr. H. G. Martyn, a member of the Stratford Normal School staff, in a recent letter quotes from a teacher in Bruce County, \"Do boost the Junior Red Cross!\" Then she told of the work being done in her school. Any teacher may have this same help. It is free for the asking. And using it is good school teaching.\n\nThe Status and Aims of the Ontario Committee\n\nTeachers who may be considering a trial of Junior Red Cross do not need to fear it, nor even to suspect it. Ensuring the proper educational direction of the work, the Committee in charge has as Chairman, Prof. J. A. Dale, formerly Professor of Education at McGill University and now head of the Department of Social Service at the University of Toronto. Dr. J. T. Plintz, Chief Medical Officer of the Schools' Health Division of the Department of Education, is also a member of the Committee while Dr. Waugh, Chief Inspector of Schools, has been from the commencement an adviser in all phases of the development. The Department of Education approved and recommends the method as a means of promoting good health and high ideals of service. It permits and encourages its use in lieu of the text-book method of teaching hygiene.\n\nThose in charge of Junior Red Cross in Ontario claim no place for it in the schools merely because it is the Red Cross. They realize that the acid tests of its right to recognition are its usefulness and its useableness for right educational purposes. Junior Red Cross seeks to give and not to get. It aims to serve and not to exploit. It uses its influence to improve the health of school children by the use of safe and sane pedagogical methods.\n\nJunior Red Cross Shows a Steady Growth\n\nThe growth of the Ontario Junior Red Cross in the past three years is significant. At the close of December this year our records showed that 515 classes had enrolled during the year. For the year 1922, the number was 256, and for the first year, 1921, the figure was 108. There\nis nothing remarkable or sensational in these figures. But they show promise. The steady growth indicates that increasing numbers of teachers are finding Junior Red Cross a help. The work is past the period of suspicion. It has made friends for itself with many school inspectors as well as with teachers.\n\nThe distribution of Junior Red Cross is province-wide. There is not a county or district in which it is not represented in one or more class rooms. In Hastings County there are at the present time, 27 active auxiliaries including groups in the graded schools of Madoc, Bancroft and Coe Hill; the township of Sidney with 7 auxiliaries in rural schools has more than any other township in the province. In the County of Peel there are 25 auxiliaries including 9 in the Brampton P.S., and 3 in the Middle Road School near Port Credit; Brampton is the most completely organized town or city school in the Province. Middlesex, including London schools, has 23 classes formed into Auxiliaries; Dundas has 18 with 8 groups in Morrisburg, Winchester, Chesterville and North Mountain graded schools. The work is well represented also in the schools of Bruce, Huron, Grey, Kent, Perth, Renfrew, Welland and Wellington.\n\nTen of our twenty-four cities have a total of 63 Auxiliaries. Toronto with 27 in 7 schools, Hamilton with 15 in 6 schools, Kitchener and Guelph with four each in two schools. In Hamilton there are signs of an early expansion throughout the entire city. The Niagara St. P.S. and the Normal Model School of Toronto with ten and nine Auxiliaries respectively are the two city schools with the largest number of groups.\n\nGreat Possibilities for Collegiate Red Cross\n\nJunior Red Cross is finding a place of usefulness in secondary schools as well as in the elementary schools. The future will likely show extensions also in what has been called Collegiate Red Cross. At present there are nine groups enrolled. Both class rooms in the Eganville Continuation School are organized and two of the high school classes in the Toronto Normal Model School have Auxiliaries. In the Hamilton Normal School there are five auxiliaries formed in the teachers' classes.\nTeachers in collegiate institutes, high schools and continuation schools who have class groups carrying on under schemes of class-organization will find an affiliation with Red Cross stimulating in the promotion of social services. The Red Cross can inspire boys and girls in worth-while usefulnesses. Its international features are also attractive. It is being developed in the schools of thirty countries.\n\nFor Humanity as well as for Health\n\nThe charitable side of Junior Red Cross must not be overlooked. Through the Ontario Crippled Children's Fund it pledges itself to secure for every poor crippled or handicapped child the special treatment needed with an especial interest in cases reported from remote hinterland parts where municipal or community support is not obtainable. At the present moment three cases, one from Parry Sound and two from Thunder Bay, are being attended to. Last year nine cases in all were treated. Donations to the amount of $8377.18 were received from about 156 schools for this work last year. Help from any school is welcomed; so is information about cases that should be looked after.\n\nThe Northern Fire Children's Fund of 1922 was an accomplishment creditable to Ontario schools. A total of $6,354.51 was received. With this, in addition to generous Christmas cheer sent the year of the fire, every crippled child in the fire area has been treated and every child handicapped with visual, dental, throat (tonsils and adenoids) or other defects will be cared for.\n\nThe recent Japanese Children's Fund for earthquake sufferers has been a credit to Ontario schools also. A total of $9,337.13 has been received and is being administered through the Japanese Red Cross. In international as well as national appeals to schools, the Junior Red Cross has an important place to fill.\n\nSpace does not permit of much more being said here. Anyone wishing to join in the work will be welcomed. Many schools have enrolled since New Year's. It is never too late to join. Address the Ontario Junior Red Cross, 410 Sherbourne St., Toronto.\n\nJUNIOR RED CROSS - A WORLD-WIDE SCHOOL CHILDREN'S MOVEMENT\n\nUnites All\n\nThe Red Cross, the world-wide emblem of service, is made up of five squares. The one in the center serves in burying the four others that reach out their arms to the South, the East and the West.\n\nServes All\n\nThere is in the world today no humanitarian force which can be called upon in such a way as to serve all men everywhere, whatever race, language or colour, save that enrolled group, the banner of the Red Cross.\n\nUnites the Children of all Nations for Health, for Usefulness and for Friendliness.

If you will examine the 1922-23 Report of Indian Affairs, you will note that we have discontinued the use of the words \"Boarding\" and \"Industrial\" in connection with out residential institutions.

The Sections of the Indian Act are the only laws, but regulations are made from time to time in connection with specific problems or efforts. There is no comprehensive set of Regulations, with the exception of the brief statement which we print on the back of the classroom register. I am having a register directed to you. If there are any specific questions, I shall be pleased to answer them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

How many schools are established and what? How many teachers, Dr., and nurses are appointed and how much for yearly appropriation for the welfare of the Eskimos from Demeratation point to Labrador?\n\nWill you be so kind as to explain the above matters in order to obtain the desired information.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nArthur Kidr.\n\n[Stamp: Department of Indian Affairs]\n\n[Stamp: Records]\nOttawa, January 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th ultimo, requesting certain information regarding this Department's work among the Eskimo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have no reports available on the educational and other work carried on. As yet no very large financial aid has been allotted for the education of the Eskimo. At the last Session of Parliament the affairs of the Eskimo were, by amendment of the Indian Act, placed under the direction of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. In the past the establishment of schools was left in the hands of those interested in the evangelization of the people; however, this Department recognized certain obligations in the matter and paid a small grant for current expenses. Educational work is being carried on intermittently in the Herschel Island district under the auspices of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. At the present time there is a day school under the auspices of the Anglican Church at Aklavik, and schools have from time to time been in operation at Herschel Island and Kittigagjuit. Besides several Eskimo children are receiving an education at the Hay River and Carcross Indian Residential Schools. The future policy for the carrying on of the educational work and other matters in connection with the Eskimo is now under consideration.\n\nThis Department has recently appointed a medical officer to be stationed at Aklavik. There are no nurses employed at the present writing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArthur Eide, Esq.,\nR. 1, Box 56,\nPearson, Wash., U.S.A.\nThe Federal Government is responsible for the education of the youth of the Indian people. Several churches are actively interested and are associated with the Department of Indian Affairs in the maintenance of 38 day and 10 residential schools for Indian children in the province. At the boarding schools, vocational training is provided in addition to the regular classroom activity. In the fiscal year 1923-24, 1139 and 934 pupils were enrolled in the day and residential schools, respectively. Indian children who show academic promise are given tuition grants to enable them to secure secondary education - other successful graduates of Indian schools are given assistance to establish themselves on the reserves, and their activity is supervised by field workers.\n\nPrepared for publication \"Manitoba\" Mar 3/25 P.J.O.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, requesting information concerning Indian schools and hospitals in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nI am having directed to you, under separate cover, a copy of our last annual report. On Pages 86 and 87 will be found a list of day schools in these provinces, and on Pages 90 and 91 a list of residential schools.\n\nThere are three hospitals for Indians in these provinces - one on the File Hills Reserve in Saskatchewan and one on each of the Blood and Blackfoot Reserves in Alberta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Enclosed you will find a list, by provinces, of the Indian residential schools, showing the pupilage in each case as from April first, 1925.\n\nThe pupilage at the Duck Lake institution has been increased to 150, as the new building has ample accommodation for this number. The File Hills school has been voted at 90, but the present pupilage is 80. You might let me have a special letter with reference to the accommodation that is now available in the dormitories at this institution. The Department has had correspondence concerning increasing the pupilage at the Gordons, Qu'Appelle and Thunderchild schools, but no decision has been reached in any case and no additional pupilage has been voted. At Birtle and Cross Lake, where additions or alterations have been made during the fiscal year, the accommodation may be more than the pupilage allowed; but requests for an increase have not been received, nor have arrangements been made in the Estimates for a larger number of children. In the case of the Thunderchild school the pupilage has been 90 for some years until lately, when the Department decided to reduce it to 82. The management, however, had recruited up to an earning capacity of over 90 before receiving the official notification of the decrease, and it has now been decided to allow the original 90 for the time being. When this school complies with the Department's requests, which were made known to you in other correspondence, consideration will be given to increasing the pupilage to 110.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 8, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Health of Animals Branch, Department of Agriculture, tests for tuberculosis, without cost, the milch cows at Indian residential schools. Only a few of the schools have \"Accredited\" herds (6 registered animals) and the Department of Agriculture pay compensation for those animals they kill, only when the herd is accredited. Dr. Westgate writes to learn if the Department will replace milch cows that are killed when the school is not entitled to the regular compensation. The inspection by the Health of Animals Branch to date has not been at the request of the Department but upon the invitation of the respective school management.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDept. of Indian Education.\nApril 15, 1925.\n\nEDUCATION OF ESKIMO CHILDREN.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has recognized and is giving financial assistance to two day schools for Eskimo children. During the past five years the enrolment has averaged as follows: Herschell Island 43 and Aklavik 7. The Herschell Island Day School is conducted at certain seasons of the year at Shingle Point. The activity at these two day schools has been intermittent and the annual cost an average of only $525. Both schools are conducted by Church of England missionaries. A missionary of the same church has commenced a day school for Eskimo children at Lake Harbour, Baffin Land, and the Department has allowed texts, scribblers, etc. The school has not been officially recognized nor are we allowing any grant for teacher's salary.\n\nDuring the past five years 16 Eskimo children have been enrolled at three Indian day schools - Rampart House, Ross River and McPherson. The Eskimo children share of the expense at these schools has been $290 per annum.\n\nDay school activity among the Eskimos has cost the Department an average of approximately $625 per annum. The enrolment of Eskimo children at this class of school has been 63 per annum. If the parents of these children were not so nomadic in their habits, the activity would have been steady and the annual cost appreciably more.\n\nAt three Indian Residential Schools, Carcross and St. Paul's Hostel in the Yukon and Hay River in the N.W.T., there has been an enrolment of 16 Eskimo children per year. They have cost the Department $3150 per annum for current expenses and $1700 per annum (estimated) for capital expense - an average yearly expenditure for Eskimo children at Indian residential schools of $4850.\n\nTo recapitulate - during the past five years the Department of Indian Affairs has provided educational advantages for 82 Eskimo children at an annual cost of $5375.\n\n| Day Schools for Eskimos | Indian Day Schools attended by Eskimos |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 1.

Residential schools would be a very costly experiment and the graduate might be quite unfitted for life in his natural community. Day schools would be intermittent in their operation.\n\nWe might recognize and support the educational schemes which missionaries who live among the people initiate, provided, of course, there was any worth or success in the individual activity.\nCOPY\n\nP.

Rest assured that we will not press for standards of instruction and care which will not admit of attainment because of any inadequacy of physical equipment. It is our aim to provide the necessary buildings, etc., at all Indian residential schools, so that the work among the youth of our wards will make progress. As funds are available, this intention will be carried out and all we expect of your Society and the management of the individual schools is to do the best possible under the circumstances. You will understand, however, that the efficiency of personal services is not largely dependent on physical equipment at these institutions; and from time to time I will draw to your attention, when necessary, reports concerning the qualifications of members of the staff at this and other schools that are managed by your Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I have to inform you that there is no report or list showing the schools with the names, addresses, qualifications and salaries of the teachers. In Canada today there are 342 day schools and 76 residential schools for Indian children. I have a list of the residential schools, showing the names of the principals and their addresses. There is also in our Annual Report a list of the day schools showing the names of the teachers, but the post office addresses of these workers and the other facts mentioned in your letter are not given.\n\nResidential school grants are paid quarterly, on a basis of the number of children in residence. Day school teachers' salaries also are paid quarterly.\n\nI should be pleased to send you a copy of our Annual Report or the list of the residential schools or both, upon application, and I will give you any further information available. Your stamped envelope is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMessrs. W. F. Quarrie & Co.,\n34 King St. E.,\nToronto, Ont.\n### APPROPRIATION\n\n#### INDIAN EDUCATION\n\n#### RECAPITULATION.\n\n| Item                        | 1918-19 | 1924-25 |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Per Capita Grants           | 579,160.| 901,775.|\n| Day School Salaries         | 131,635.| 177,100.|\n| Inspection                  | 2,500.  | 9,000.  |\n| Tuition & Assistance        | 4,000.  | 12,000. |\n| Buildings & Repairs         | 16,820. | 695,102.|\n| Fuel, Rental, etc.          | ....    | 27,000. |\n| Medical & Dental            | ....    | 6,000.  |\n| Transportation of Pupils    | ....    | 8,000.  |\n| Classroom Equipment         | ....    | 19,000. |\n\nTotal: $734,115. $1,854,977.\n| Province         | No. of Teachers | Total Salary | Average Salary |\n|------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Nova Scotia      | 12              | $6,350       | $529.16        |\n| New Brunswick    | 11              | $5,850       | $531.82        |\n| P.E.I.           | 1               | $450         | $450.00        |\n| Quebec           | 45              | $22,300      | $495.55        |\n| Ontario          | 76              | $50,800      | $668.42        |\n| Manitoba         | 38              | $25,700      | $676.32        |\n| Saskatchewan     | 25              | $16,050      | $642.00        |\n| Alberta          | 7               | $4,850       | $692.86        |\n| N.W.T.           | 5               | $2,400       | $480.00        |\n| Yukon            | 2               | $1,420       | $720.00        |\n| British Columbia | 46              | $35,280      | $766.95        |\n\nTotal: 268 teachers, $171,450 total salary, $639.74 average salary\n### EXPENDITURES FROM PARLIAMENTARY APPROPRIATION IN BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR INDIAN EDUCATION\n\n| Year   | ALL CANADA | B.

All four totals are therefore not necessarily accurate to the dollar.\n\nFor all 10 years, but one (1919-20), the expenditure from Parliamentarian Appropriation for Indian Education was larger for British Columbia than for any other province and of course the expenditure for the 10 years for British Columbia was much larger than for any other province.\n\nIt is interesting to note that whereas the Indian population of British Columbia is 23.18% of the Canadian population (Indian) the expenditure of public money in British Columbia for the 10 fiscal years under review was 24.47% of the total for Indian Educat.\nJuly 4, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIndian Education in British Columbia.\n\nAccording to the latest census, there are in British Columbia 23,782 Indians. Details are not available as to the ages of 2,500 of this native population; but there are known to be 4,566 children of school age. In all probability this number will not decrease during the next few years, as there are at the present time 3,349 children under 6 years of age. A study of the statistics leads me to believe that approximately 22% of the 2,500 Indians whose ages are unknown are of school age. There are, and will be for some years, approximately 5,000 Indian children of school age in the province of British Columbia. Some of these children are physically unfit and others could not profit if there were a comprehensive establishment of schools. I therefore estimate at 4,500 the number of Indian children in the province who should be receiving an education.\n\nDuring the past fiscal year, 2,725 children were enrolled in the 44 day and 16 residential schools which were in operation in the province. The enrolment at the day schools was 1,322 and the average attendance 643 - a percentage of attendance of 49. This does not compare favourably with the record for all Canada. The enrolment at residential schools was 1,403 and the average attendance 1,219 - a percentage of nearly 87 - which is somewhat better than the general record of Indian residential schools. Only an inconsiderable number of Indian children in this province are attending white schools and colleges.\n\nThe above figures show that educational facilities should be provided for approximately 1,900 more Indian children if our programme in the province is to be complete and they indicate that the majority should be enrolled at residential schools if success is to attend our efforts. The poor attendance at day schools in the province generally suggests that they should be established only when there are suitable centres of permanent population. Some day schools have to be maintained for the children who are physically unfit for residential institutions.\nFrom the general statistics alone, it would appear that existing residential schools should be enlarged and others established to care for an enrolment of 1,200 more pupils than are at present being educated in this type of institution. Further, the majority of the other 600 Indian children who are not being educated could be enrolled in day schools. This would mean the establishment of 10 or 12 new day schools.\n\nIt must not be argued that the Indian children in B.C. have been neglected. The native population of the province is 23.18% of all Indians in Canada. The expenditure for the education of Indian children in B.C. for the past 10 fiscal years ($2,949,186) is 24.47% of the total expenditure of Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nI am of the opinion that improvements and additions should be made to the programme at both classes of schools. All residential schools and successful day schools should give more definite vocational training. The academic and vocational instructors should be fully qualified for their work. In the light of the experience of one or two residential schools in the province, it is considered advisable to take special precautions to safeguard the health of the pupils in boarding institutions.\n\nI strongly recommend the establishment of an undenominational technical residential school, where boys who have done well at regular schools can be given an intensive two-year training in carpentry, gas engines, gardening and perhaps one other course. Such an institution should be located near the Indian Commissioner's office, so that a responsible officer of the Department will be in close touch.\n\nThe last census shows the religion of all but 2500 Indians in British Columbia and is as follows. There is also indicated the present number of residential and day schools for each denomination.\n\n| Denomination       | Population | School Population | Residential Schools | Day Schools |\n|--------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Roman Catholic     | 11,375     | 2,445             | 9                   | 14          |\n| Church of England  | 4,640      | 992               | 3                   | 12          |\n| Methodist          | 3,840      | 825               | 3                   | 14          |\n| Presbyterian       | 459        | 99                | 2                   | 1           |\n| Others             | 500        | 104               | 0                   | 3           |\n| Pagan              | 470        | 101               | 0                   | 0           |\n\nIt appears from the above figures that four Roman Catholic, two Church of England and one Methodist Indian residential schools and several day schools for Roman Catholic and Church of England Indians are urgently required.\nA study of the school population, religious denominations and existing schools by agencies shows the following:\n\n**BABINE - 1943 -- School age 400**\n\n| Religious Denomination | Number | Residential | Day |\n|------------------------|--------|-------------|-----|\n| Roman Catholic         | 155    | 0           | 2   |\n| Church of England      | 103    | 0           | 2   |\n| Methodist              | 88     | 0           | 2   |\n| Others                 | 56     | 0           | 1   |\n\nOne Roman Catholic and one Protestant residential school are evidently needed.\n\n**BELLA COOLA - 1119 -- School age 245**\n\n| Religious Denomination | Number | Girls' Residential | Day |\n|------------------------|--------|--------------------|-----|\n| Methodist              | 223    | 1                  | 4   |\n| Roman Catholic         | 22     | 0                  | 0   |\n\nA boys' wing should be added to the girls' residential school (Methodist) at Kitimat.

Further, the religious denomination of the schools does not vary a great deal with what was estimated as required following a study of the religions of the Indian population.\n\nTo ascertain the costs of a complete programme, I have reviewed the figures of recent years. The expenditure and enrolment in connection with Indian Education in British Columbia for the past ten years are as follows:\n\n| Year    | Current | Capital | Total   | Residential | Day | Total |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|-----|-------|\n| 1915-16 | $123,600 | $78,000 | $201,600 | 1,006       | 1,808 | 2,814 |\n| 1916-17 | 137,100  | 32,664  | 169,765  | 983         | 1,883 | 2,866 |\n| 1917-18 | 152,000  | 7,588   | 159,588  | 1,064       | 1,855 | 2,919 |\n| 1918-19 | 161,800  | 14,597  | 176,397  | 1,066       | 1,079 | 2,147 |\n| 1919-20 | 167,100  | 9,247   | 176,346  | 1,115       | 1,197 | 2,312 |\n| 1920-21 | 184,600  | 123,442 | 308,042  | 1,147       | 1,841 | 2,988 |\n| 1921-22 | 207,600  | 271,043 | 478,643  | 1,203       | 1,908 | 3,111 |\n| 1922-23 | 229,800  | 124,992 | 354,791  | 1,276       | 1,860 | 3,136 |\n| 1923-24 | 234,100  | 258,393 | 492,493  | 1,240       | 1,356 | 2,596 |\n| 1924-25 | 254,650  | 167,500 | 422,151  | 1,403       | 1,322 | 2,725 |\n\nTotal: $1,851,750 $1,097,436 $2,949,186 Average: 1,160 1,298 2,458\n\nI have made a study of the figures for the past three years, in order to ascertain the current costs per pupil. At residential schools, the average current cost per annum per pupil enrolled is $151 and at day schools, $34. Of course, the average current cost per unit of average attendance would be somewhat higher in the case of the residential schools and much higher in the case of the day schools.\n\nThe provision of residential school facilities for a more complete programme would do away with only two existing day schools and the saving in current costs, because of the dropping of two day schools, would be negligible.\n\nIf an immediate effort was made to educate all the available children of British Columbia and the building programme completed within the next six years, each succeeding year there would be an average of 175 more residential school\npupils and 70 more day school pupils. The current costs would therefore show an average yearly increase for the six years of nearly $20,000. If the figure is set at $30,000, it would allow better teaching services and more definite vocational training. If a technical school to accommodate 100 senior teen-age boys was erected in 1927, the current costs for the fiscal year 1928-29 would show an extra increase of $25,000, as I estimate $250 per pupil as the current cost of such an institution. A table showing comparative current and other costs is hereunder. It will be noted that the current costs per annum would be approximately $460,000, which is $805,000 more than next year, when the proposed building programme would get under way.\n\nThe regular capital expense in British Columbia, without any new or large building activity, is approximately $40,000 per annum. If a building programme of\n\n- 6 new residential schools - $750,000.\n- 3 replacements, residential schools - $300,000.\n- 2 enlargements, \" \" \" - $60,000.\n- 10 new day schools - $50,000.\n\nwas spread over six years, the average capital expense, inclusive of the regular yearly $40,000, would be $233,000. If a technical residential school were erected in 1927-28, that year's capital expense would be $383,000.\n\nIf this building programme, totalling $1,310,000, is undertaken during the next six years, the expenditure would be approximately as is shown hereunder:\n\n| Year    | Current Costs | Capital Costs | Total Costs |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n| 1922-23 | $30,000       | $125,000      | $155,000    |\n| 1923-24 | $34,000       | $250,000      | $284,000    |\n| 1924-25 | $36,000       | $167,000      | $203,000    |\n| 1925-26 | $32,000       | $52,000       | $374,000    |\n\nIf the proposed building programme is carried out, in 1928-29 we would be educating 2575 children in residential schools, 1742 in day schools and 100 in a special technical institute, or a total of 4417.

Harvie\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMO\n\nJuly 15, 1925.\n\nIndian Education 1921-22\u20141924-25\n\nDuring the past four years definite efforts have been made to improve and expand the educational activity among the youth of our Indian wards. Larger appropriations have permitted the replacement of old buildings and equipment and the engagement of better qualified instructors. Departmental supervision of the academic and vocational training has been more thorough than heretofore; and further, in all parts of Canada except the far north, public and separate school inspectors or other qualified officers check the classroom activity in Indian schools. Better trained teachers are being engaged and more classroom, vocational and recreational equipment is being supplied in an effort to make the instruction more attractive.\n\nIn connection with the purely academic part of Indian education, arrangements have been completed for the active cooperation of the Provincial Departments of Education. In addition to the inspection mentioned above, in several provinces teachers of Indian schools now attend and participate in local teachers' institutes, conventions and demonstrations. Vocational training is being offered to pupils at Indian residential schools. During the past four years both the Department and the Churches have made a special effort to give better vocational training to pupils at Indian residential schools. In different parts of the Dominion different training to boys is given, so that they will become self-supporting members of their respective communities. Instructors have been asked to correlate classroom exercises with vocational training and home interests.\n\nThe health of Indian children, particularly those in residential schools, has been the subject for considerable thought and activity. A special effort is now being made in the matter of physical education and the Department has arranged for fairly comprehensive medical and dental supervision and treatment. Milk herds are being tested and the children's diet at these institutions carefully controlled. In the Prairie Provinces, travelling nurses visit Indian schools regularly to this end. We are now associated with the Canadian Junior Red Cross in the promotion of better health for Indian children.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is closely associated with the four largest churches in Canada in the management of the majority of Indian schools. This is particularly true in the case of residential schools, which form a very important factor in the programme. During the past four years the churches interested have arranged more centralized control and this has resulted in a much closer cooperation with the Government\u2014a cooperation which has been a constant source of much gratification and of much profit.\nprofit to our wards. Better supervision has obtained because of this centralized control on the part of the churches; and their forces and those of the State combined to create steady progress.\n\nThe policy of the present administration is to care for capital expense at Indian schools whenever funds can be provided for the purpose. This releases the finances of the missionary societies for better food, clothing and instruction. During the past four years 7 old Indian residential schools and many day schools have been replaced by modern buildings adequate for the purpose of Indian education. Major alterations and additions have been made to other boarding schools. Further, 4 new large institutions are in course of erection. At the present writing, 51 of these residential schools are lighted electrically, heated by one unit and are equipped with modern plumbing.\n\nThe graduate problem has lately been the subject for much thought. Many older Indian pupils of promise are being given an academic or vocational training in public schools and business colleges in competition with white children. The Department has stimulated and will continue to quicken an interest on the part of our field workers in the graduate who is desirous of establishing himself on a reserve. No effort will be spared to make young Indian men and women self-supporting and economically independent.\n\nA few years ago the compulsory attendance at school of Indian children was placed on the Statute. The law has been enforced in many Indian communities. This action, with an awakened interest in education on the part of parents generally, has resulted in residential schools being filled to the limit of their capacity and an increased enrolment at day schools. For the fiscal year 1920-21 there was a total enrolment at all Indian schools of 12,558 with an average attendance of 8,723, a percentage of attendance of 69.47. In the past fiscal year there was a total enrolment of 14,222 and an average attendance of 9,879, a percentage of attendance of 69.6. As the same number of residential schools (75) and a few less day schools (247) were in operation during 1924-25, the expansion in Indian educational work generally will be noted. Comparing the important figures - those showing average attendance - there is an increase over four years ago of 1,156, a percentage increase of 13.25. Further, the residential school enrolment was 6,031. Compare this figure with 4,783 - the enrolment of four years earlier - and the increasing importance of this phase of the activity is apparent.\n\nThe affairs of the Eskimo people have lately been placed under the Department's jurisdiction, but the best course to pursue in the matter of their education has not yet been determined. In the past four years the Department has educated some 80 Eskimo children in Indian residential and day schools that were accessible to these people. It is not the present intention to establish boarding and other schools for Eskimos until the real need and the desirability of such action are evident.\n| Province          | Day Schools | Residential Schools | Total |\n|------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------|\n| Nova Scotia      | $7264.65    |                    |       |\n| Prince Edward Island | $362.38   |                    |       |\n| New Brunswick    | $19189.28   |                    |       |\n| Ontario          | $45504.06   |                    |       |\n| Quebec           | $42831.63   |                    |       |\n| Manitoba         | $37508.74   |                    |       |\n| Saskatchewan     | $27258.73   |                    |       |\n| Alberta          | $5993.49    |                    |       |\n| British Columbia | $44992.84   |                    |       |\n| Northwest Territories | $963.01  |                    |       |\n| Yukon            | $1999.76    |                    |       |\n\n| Province          | Tuition | Miscellaneous Total |\n|------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Nova Scotia      | $6849.23 | $1112.94            |\n| Prince Edward Island | $30.11   | $746.80             |\n| New Brunswick    | $737.05  | $529.40             |\n| Ontario          | $9,000   | $4,500              |\n| Quebec           | $388.18  | $3499.64            |\n| Manitoba         | $101.75  | $223.00             |\n| Saskatchewan     | $2071.17 | $491.90             |\n| Alberta          | $29428.05| $256.18             |\n| British Columbia | $366757.47| $384.60             |\n| Northwest Territories | $25330.73| $255.16             |\n| Yukon            | $16556.72 | $82818.88           |\n\nTotal: $232072.54 $159489.72 $82818.88 $6283.73 $16377.70 $5226.78 $36999.53 $884608.86\nIn addition to the above, certain bands of Indians, whose funds were sufficient to meet the expenditure, contributed the sum of $65,495.84 for school purposes. The interest contributions were for current expenses, salaries of teachers, minor repairs and tuition grants. The expenditure from Capital was for the erection of a teacher's residence. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1924, the amounts so contributed were as follows:\nFive years ago the Indian Act was amended to provide for the compulsory attendance at school of all physically fit Indian children from 7 to 15 years of age. The law has been enforced in certain Indian communities. This action, together with an awakened interest in education on the part of parents generally, has resulted in residential schools being filled to the limit of their capacity and an increased enrolment at day schools. A comparison of enrolment and attendance figures for the past five years shows a general expansion in Indian educational work.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1919-20, there was at the 247 day schools then in operation an enrolment of 7477 and an average attendance of 3516. The same number of day schools were in operation last year and there was an enrolment of 8191 and an average attendance of 4601. Five years ago, at 74 residential schools there was an enrolment of 4719 and an average attendance of 4133. Last year, at the 73 residential institutions which were in operation, there was an enrolment of 6031 and an average attendance of 5278.\n\nIn 1919-20 the total enrolment at all classes of Indian schools was 12,196 - last year it was 14,222, an increase of 2,026. The important figures, however, are those showing total average attendance: 1919-20, 7649; 1924-25, 9879; or an increase of 2230. The increasing importance of educational work among Indian children will be noted when it is pointed out that each day of the school year there were 2230 more pupils at their desks than five years ago. The percentage increase since 1919-20 in work actually done is 29.15, or an average increase per annum of 5.83%. The increase in average attendance is larger than in enrolment, the percentage of attendance in 1919-20 being 62.56 and in 1924-25, 69.46. In short, from year to year, not only are more Indian children attending school, but they are attending more regularly.\n\nFurther, Indian children throughout Canada are studying more advanced work than in the past. The total enrolment by standards is shown for the two fiscal years under review:\n\n| Standards | I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  | Total |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| 1919-20   | 5869| 2162| 2018| 1258| 616 | 271 | 12,196|\n| 1924-25   | 6251| 2707| 2250| 1692| 836 | 486 | 14,222|\n\nFive years ago 2147 pupils were enrolled in Grades IV, V and VI. Last year the number was 3014. High school subjects are offered in several residential schools and in a few day schools. Further, 125 Indian students were enrolled in high schools and colleges in Canada.\nThere were 73 residential and 247 day schools in operation during the year\u2014a total of 320 Indian schools. In addition, the Department assisted in the maintenance of 13 combined white and Indian schools. In Part 2 of this report will be found a tabular statement showing the location and indicating the enrolment in the case of each school. In addition to the 14,222 pupils shown in the tabular statement, there are 125 advanced students and some 50 Indian children who are attending public schools. A total of approximately 14,400 of the youth of our wards received a schooling last year.\n\nSeveral of the churches are associated with the Department in Indian educational work and are engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools, as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Residential | Day |\n|-------------------------|-------------|-----|\n| Roman Catholic          | 39          | 78  |\n| Church of England       | 20          | 72  |\n| Methodist               | 7           | 39  |\n| Presbyterian            | 7           | 5   |\n| Salvation Army          |             |     |\n| Undenominational        |             |     |\n\nLast year 21 Church of England residential schools were shown. The decrease of one is accounted for by the amalgamation of the Alert Bay Girls' and Boys' Schools.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs and the churches interested have made special efforts during the year to give better vocational training to pupils at Indian residential schools. It is the aim to make graduates of these institutions self-supporting members of their respective communities. Instructors have been asked to correlate classroom exercises with vocational training and home interests. To this end more and better equipment for these schools is being provided from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nThe graduate problem has lately been the subject of much discussion. Many older Indian pupils of promise are being given an academic or vocational training in public schools and business colleges in competition with white children. The Department has stimulated and will continue to quicken an interest on the part of our field workers in the graduate who is desirous of establishing himself on a reserve. No effort will be spared to make young Indian men and women self-supporting and economically independent. Assistance is given to worthy ex-pupils who are starting out for themselves.\n\nThe health of Indian children, particularly those in residential schools, has been the subject for considerable thought and activity. A special effort is now being made in the matter of physical education and the Department has arranged for fairly comprehensive medical and dental supervision and treatment. Milk herds are being tested and the children's diet at these institutions carefully controlled. In the Prairie Provinces, travelling nurses visit Indian schools regularly to this end. We are now associated with the Canadian Junior Red Cross in the promotion of better health for Indian children.\nThe affairs of the Eskimo people have lately been placed under the Department's jurisdiction, but the best course to pursue in the matter of their education has not yet been determined. In the past four years the Department has educated some 80 Eskimo children in Indian residential and day schools that were accessible to these people.\n\nDuring the year there was considerable building activity. New classrooms or teachers' residences were provided at certain successful Indian day schools. The old buildings at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, Sask., and at the St. Paul's Institution, Alta., were replaced by modern structures adequate for the purposes of academic and vocational training. One wing of the new Kamloops Indian Residential School, B. C., was erected during the year. The reconstruction of the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, Sask., was commenced and additions were erected at the File Hills, (Sask.) and Cross Lake (Man.) boarding institutions. Educational facilities for the Indians of the Lac Seul area, in western Ontario, have been quite inadequate and a small residential school was erected during the year at McIntosh, on the main line of the C. N. R.\n\nIn many parts of Canada, the present younger generation of Indians is clamouring for an education. A special effort has been made, since 1916-19, the last year of the war, to improve the programme and expand the educational activity. Larger appropriations have been necessary and have been used for the replacement of old buildings and equipment and the engagement of better qualified instructors. Departmental supervision of the academic and vocational training has been more thorough than heretofore; and further, in all parts of Canada except the far North, public and separate school inspectors or other qualified officers check the classroom activity in Indian schools. Better trained teachers are being engaged and more classroom, vocational and recreational equipment is being supplied in an effort to make the instruction more attractive. The churches interested have arranged more centralized control and this has resulted in better supervision from their standpoint and closer cooperation with the Government.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1925, amounted to $1,854,608.86, as follows:\nIndian Education.\u2014During the year ended March 31, 1924, there were in operation a total of Indian schools of which 86 were day schools, 5 residential and 1 combined public and Indian. The total enrolment was 1,497 pupils, of whom 1,386 were boys and 111 were girls. The total enrolment for the previous year was 1,502 pupils, of whom 1,400 were boys and 102 were girls. The average attendance was 82% or an increase of 8% over 1923. The enrolment was distributed among the day schools (86) residential schools (5) and combined (1). The average attendance was 82% or an increase of 8% over 1923. The enrolment was distributed among the day schools (86) residential schools (5) and combined (1). The average attendance was 82% or an increase of 8% over 1923.\n\nThe schools were operated by the following denominations: Roman Catholic 1 day and 1 residential; Church of England 1 day and 1 residential; Methodist 30 day and 7 residential; Anglican 1 day and 1 residential; Presbyterian 1 day and 1 residential; Baptist 1 day and 1 residential; United Church 1 day and 1 residential; Mennonite 1 day and 1 residential; and Independent 1 day and 1 residential.\n\nThe total expenditure for Indian Education from national and provincial appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1924, was $1,943,486. In addition to this, various bands of Indians contributed $87,915 towards the payment of teachers' salaries, etc. (Superintendent, Russell T.

The Department has decided that whereas they appear to be in the class known as 'Temporary Civil Servants', they are not eligible for superannuation under the 1924 Act. (See file #129-18).\n\nI have learned that in the past there have been payments of a gratuity or retiring allowance in the case of 9 teachers. (See list attached). The amounts of the payments varied from 2 to 6 months' salary. Vouchers were prepared showing that the payments were retiring allowances or gratuities. No authority was secured other than that of the Deputy Superintendent General, and on one or two occasions that of the Hon. the Minister. The Auditor General to my knowledge - and I have carefully examined the files - has never questioned these payments.\n\nIt was the Department's wish to give a gratuity in the case of the teacher of the Skawah Indian School, who suffered from ill-health during the last few months of his incumbency, and died during the summer months. Mr. Paget and Mr. MacKenzie are of the opinion that authority is necessary before any payment of more than 2 months' salary can be given. I phoned Mr. Douglas, of the Auditor General's Department, and he concurs in this opinion.\n\nOn at least three occasions (see list attached), teachers of Indian day schools, who have given long service, have been granted not only two months' gratuity but an annuity. Authority of His Excellency in Council was secured for each of these actions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nthe relocation of their children.\n\nJovilay\n\nWacusee B.

The following is the outline:\n\nChapter 1: The Problem of Indian Education.\nChapter 2: Organization and Administration.\nChapter 3: The Cost of Education.\nChapter 4: School Buildings and Equipment.\nChapter 5: Courses of Study.\nChapter 6: The Teaching Corp.\nChapter 7: School Attendance.\nChapter 8: Classification, Progress, and Welfare of School Children.\nChapter 9: Measurements of Pupil Performance.\nChapter 10: Summary of Findings and Recommendations.\n\nAs you can see from this outline much of the material cannot be obtained from the Government Reports. I am therefore begging the assistance of Department. I shall only ask for information which may be in the possession of the Department. If the Department has not the information needed, no doubt there will be no objection to obtaining the material by means of letters, questionnaires, etc.\n\nI have already collected considerable material from the Reports but would like to know what material the Department has which is available and which is not contained in the Reports. I think the report blanks which are sent to the different schools to be filled in would provide this information. Will you please send me copies of the report forms. Is there a form for the day schools and another for the residential schools?\n\nIf you desire any further information about the thesis, I shall be glad to give it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Nov. 26, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the preparation of your thesis on \"The Education of the Indians of Canada.\" Before answering your communication in detail, I beg to state it has occurred to me that a visit to the Department would be of considerable value to you in this connection. If you would inform me concerning a date, I would give you as much time and assistance as possible. The printed matter available could be examined, with a view to determining what would be needed for your purposes, and you could scan circular letters, returns, general files, etc., which would be of interest.\n\nInfinitely more could be done in a day in Ottawa than in weeks of correspondence. What do you think of the suggestion? If it is impossible for you to visit the Department, then I will consider the subject matter of your letter and send you an answer in detail as well as any material that I think you will require.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nElmer Jamieson, Esq., M.A.,\n26 Gloucester St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDecember 28, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nLyman W. Fisher was teacher at the Back Settlement Day School up to June 30th, last. He was replaced by a professionally qualified worker. Mr. Fisher has been employed by this Department continuously since January 1, 1906 - a period of 19\u00bd years. His service might be characterized as faithful. He is now 45 years of age.\n\nMr. Fisher has applied for a gratuity and he wishes it applied on a Soldier Settlement loan of $1500 which he took over in 1922. He has made payments on this loan to the amount of $384.89. There was due and payable in November an instalment balance of $57.66 and when this is paid there will be a total owing of $1041.04.\n\nI wish to recommend that a gratuity of $260, which is equivalent to four months' salary, be allowed. Precedent for such a payment is established by eight gratuities, equivalent to more than two months' salary, in the case of retiring teachers of Indian day schools since 1907 - which payments have not been questioned.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you please forward to this office one copy of \"The Educational Regulations for Indian Schools\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nOttawa, January 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B-ll of the 28th ultimo, requesting a copy of the Regulations relating to Indian Schools. In reply I have to inform you that, in the past, there have been two publications in this connection, viz.: Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children - 1908; and Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools - 1912. These regulations are now out of date, and, while they are a guide, yet they are no longer used as reference. The only current printed regulations are those contained in Sections 9, 10 and 11A of the Indian Act. Sections 97, 98 and 194 also have reference to day school activity.\n\nAny questions concerning the education of Indian children should be referred to the Department. There are several circular letters, which are in part or wholly in force at the present time and copies of those which relate to residential school activity are being enclosed for your file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, February 19, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPursuant to my recent conversation with Mr. Roche and Mr. Putman, I have now to request that you will arrange for a general change in the Classification of \"Teacher (Indian School)\". It is extremely desirable that the compensation read \"From $300 to $1200 for the academic year, the exact amount to be decided by the Department and the Civil Service Commission in each case.\"\n\nI should be grateful if you would secure approval to adjust as from April first, last, the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools, who, during the year 1924-25 were in receipt of special bonus. It is desired to add the amount of bonus paid during the said year to their salaries for 1925-26.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Five of these are studying at Macdonald College. At the present time, as far as I am aware, there are no Protestant Indian girls in training in Quebec hospitals.\n\nWith reference to safeguarding the health of our wards, I may say that medical officers are appointed for all Indians who are settled on reserves. At Caughnawaga we have a hospital for Indian cases. The Department has not found it necessary to provide field nurses for Quebec Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 29, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 20th instant, enclosing a letter from Dan Kennedy, an Indian of the Assiniboine Reserve. I suggest that you inform this correspondent that the Department from time to time assists promising graduates of Indian schools with tuition grants when such assistance is recommended by both Church and Department representatives. We ask a pupil to prove the bona fide nature of his intentions and insist on supervision by some responsible party living at or near the Institution or Home where the pupil is studying the advanced course. The Department requires from time to time a report from the registrar or other official of the school selected, to the effect that the pupil is making progress and is capable of satisfactorily completing the course for which he is enrolled. Again, we insist that the recipient of a tuition grant be physically fit. Preference is given to students who wish to enroll for definite vocational training. You will understand that each individual case is decided on its own merits, and the appropriation for tuition is used only whenever there is reasonable promise of permanent helpfulness.\n\nAt the present time, there are but two graduates of Indian schools in Saskatchewan who are receiving grants for higher education. I speak of two girl graduates of our File Hills School, who are taking a teacher's course. Last year, two graduates of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School completed Second Class teacher's training - one securing professional qualifications as well.\n\nWith reference to the more advanced academic training at our own Indian schools, the Department authorizes and encourages principals and teachers to give the more\n\nM.

The old \"Standard\" divisions are still used in our quarterly forms and reports. The sixth standard is equivalent to the eighth grade, or Entrance work. I am now preparing a circular letter to all schools in Canada, with a view to changing the language of our forms and reports to conform with the modern division into grades. Because of this period of transition, I cannot definitely state the number of pupils in Indian schools in Saskatchewan who are studying the work of Entrance to High School. After a careful examination of the reports, I believe there are not more than forty in the Province who could be considered Entrance students.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The total enrolment for the year was 14,222 pupils, of whom 7,068 were boys and 7,154 were girls, being an increase of 350 over 1924. The enrolment was distributed as follows: Day Schools, 7,997; Residential Schools, 6,031; and Combined, 194. The average attendance was 9879, or an increase of 691 over the preceding year. In addition there were about 130 Indian children being given secondary education in high schools and private institutions throughout the Dominion.\n\nThe 333 Indian schools in operation during the year were conducted under the following auspices: Undenominational, 52 Day and 13 Combined; Roman Catholic, 76 Day and 39 Residential; Church of England, 72 Day and 20 Residential; Methodist, 39 Day and 7 Residential; Presbyterian, 5 Day and 7 Residential; and Salvation Army, 1 Day School. The expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1925, was $1,864,609. In addition to this, various bands of Indians contributed $65,496 towards the payment of teachers' salaries, etc. (Superintendent, Russell T.

Africa.\nWhile the responsibility for the education of Canada's youth is in the provinces, there is an interesting people that looks to the Dominion Government for the establishment and maintenance of its schools. The training of Indian children is one of the important activities of the Department of Indian Affairs. There are nearly 15,000 Indian boys and girls enrolled in the 344 Indian schools under the direction of the Department.\n\nA three-fold training is the aim - the inculcation of good habits, an elementary academic education, and vocational instruction to fit the graduate for his or her later life.\n\nThe schools which the Department supervises and the number of children in each kind of school are as follows:\n\n| Enrolment          | Number |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Day Schools        | 254    |\n| Residential Schools| 74     |\n| Combined Schools   | 16     |\n\nTotal enrolment 14,782\n\nThe names \"day\" and \"residential\" sufficiently differentiate these two classes of schools. A combined school is one which both Indian and white children attend and is found in districts too sparsely settled to support two schools. The Department of Indian Affairs in such cases cooperates with the local school board in the upkeep of the school. Average attendance in day and combined schools is about 60 per cent of enrolment and in residential schools 90 per cent.\nThe residential schools are directly managed by the church and are under constant inspection by the Department. The financial assistance given by the state is a per capita payment voted by Parliament. This revenue is augmented by contributions from church funds whenever necessary. The cooperation of the churches is shown by the following table:\n\n| Church          | Residential Schools | Enrolment |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Roman Catholic  | 40                  | 3,514     |\n| Church of England | 20                | 1,448     |\n| Methodist       | 7                   | 794       |\n| Presbyterian    | 7                   | 571       |\n\nTotal 74 Residential Schools: Enrolment 6,327\n\n(As the figures are for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1926, they are not affected by Church Union.)\n\nFurther analysis shows the following:\n\n| Province       | Residential Schools | Enrolment |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| P.E.I.         | 1 with 26 pupils    | 26        |\n| N.S.           | 13 with 318 pupils  | 318       |\n| N.B.           | 10 with 274 pupils  | 274       |\n| Quebec         | 35 with 1598 pupils | 1598      |\n| Ontario        | 82 with 2736 pupils | 3630      |\n| Manitoba       | 46 with 1239 pupils | 2263      |\n| Saskatchewan   | 25 with 602 pupils  | 1692      |\n| Alberta        | 4 with 103 pupils   | 1283      |\n| N.W.T.         | 5 with 87 pupils    | 254       |\n| B.C.           | 44 with 1346 pupils | 2882      |\n| Yukon          | 5 with 126 pupils   | 192       |\n\nTotals 270 8455 - 74 6327 - 14,782\n\nIndian life is so diversified that one cannot indulge in generalities. Statements concerning Indians in one part of Canada are not applicable to Indians in other sections, therefore, the educational problem is most varied. A course of studies suitable for Indian children on reserves near Brantford and London has few points of contact with the thoughts and needs of the hunting and fishing groups north of the main line of the Canadian National Railway. A school suited to the requirements of the Manitoulin Island Indians is only partly efficient if placed...........\nplaced at the Lake of the Woods. Similarly in other provinces, the Department's educational programme must be prepared with a view to the particular needs of the various Indian groups.\n\nThe comparison is often made and theories advanced, that day schools are more valuable than residential schools for Indian children. It is quite true that in some localities they are very efficient and excellent results are being obtained. However, the training given at a residential school is of such an all-round nature that the graduate is a better Indian than the day school product. His or her activity has been thoughtfully supervised for twenty-four hours of the day. Ordered habits and respect for the interest of others are learned. The day school cannot compete with the boarding institute in the organization and supervision of the Indian child's play activities. The churches and the Department are placing more and more emphasis on systematic vocational instruction which, of course, is possible only in residential schools.\n\n(Prepared under the direction of Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs by Mr. Russell T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education.)\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nReferring to your memorandum hereunder, I wish to suggest that the following be substituted for the earlier instructions to agents concerning education:\n\nEDUCATION.\n\n27. Educational advantages are provided for Indian children in day and residential schools. The annual report of the Department shows the number and locality of these institutions by agencies. Agents should give careful attention to the administration of the schools and should bend every energy to increasing their efficiency. Department representatives should familiarize themselves with Sections 9 to 11 of the Indian Act, which relate to the education of Indian children.\n\n28. Agents should report monthly on the work of each day school, using the form provided for the purpose. There will be found on the cover of classroom registers detailed instructions to teachers concerning the routine of the day school. The attention of agents is also drawn to the printed matter on the quarterly return form of this type of school. Agents should give special consideration to the matter of regular attendance of pupils. Truancy and lack of interest has, in the past, seriously militated against the success of day schools on Indian reserves.\n\n29. Residential schools should be visited as often as is necessary in the conduct of Department business. Agents are asked to make a careful study of the conditions at each institution and to report from time to time concerning the activity generally. Please read the printed instructions on the quarterly return form for residential schools. Your special attention is drawn to circular of November 9, 1914, concerning recruiting pupils for the residential schools. This activity and the return of delinquents is an important feature of the duties of Indian agents. Circulars dated November 9, 1922, and February 23, 1925, have reference to applicants for admission to Indian residential schools and agents are asked to make a careful study of these writings. Circular dated May 20, 1925, concerning the annual leave is also drawn to the attention of agents.\n\n30. The Department assists deserving ex-pupils of Indian schools whenever there is assurance that such assistance will be of permanent value. Grants are given for more advanced academic or vocational training and material assistance is granted to young couples who are establishing a home. Whenever an agent believes that a tuition grant or assistance should be allowed, he should correspond with the Department, giving full details. Agents, by advice and supervision, should assist young Indians to become economically independent.\n\n31. The Department urges its field officers to make suggestions for improving any phase of the educational programme.\nINDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nA special effort was made during the year to secure efficiency in both day and residential schools for Indian children. Many fully qualified teachers and instructors were engaged and much equipment was purchased with a view to better training for the younger generation of the Department's wards. Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1926, was $1,915,000 - nearly as large as the 1922-24 record Vote for Indian Education.\n\nResidential school activity was particularly encouraging. The four Canadian churches, that are associated with us in the conduct of these institutions, have all adopted a measure of centralized control which, of course, makes for efficiency. This type of school offers both academic and vocational instruction; and the aim is to graduate Indian boys and girls so equipped that they will go to their respective communities prepared for lives of general usefulness. 6327 pupils were enrolled at residential schools during the year. Compare this with 4783, the number maintained and trained in 1920-21, and the increasing importance of this part of the Department's educational programme is apparent. The average attendance at these institutions for the year was 89.42% of the enrolment. 5656 of the youth of our wards daily received academic instruction and vocational training while living in homes managed by Christian workers.\n\nThe cooperation of the churches in the management of these residential schools is shown by the following table:\n\n| Church                  | Residential Schools | Enrolment |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 40                  | 3,614     |\n| Church of England       | 20                  | 1,448     |\n| Methodist               | 7                   | 754       |\n| Presbyterian            | 7                   | 571       |\n| **Total**               | **74**              | **6,327** |\n\n(As the figures are for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1926, they do not take into account a recent church union.)\n\nThe residential school enrolment by provinces for the fiscal year was as follows:\n\n| Province    | Institutions | Pupils |\n|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| Ontario     | 12          | 1094   |\n| Manitoba    | 10          | 1024   |\n| Sask.       | 12          | 1290   |\n| Alta.       | 19          | 1160   |\n| N.W.T.      | 3           | 167    |\n| B.C.        | 16          | 1506   |\n| Yukon       | 2           | 66     |\n| **Total**   | **74**      | **6327** |\n\n254 Indian Day Schools and 16 Combined Schools were in operation during the year. The Indian day schools are situated on reserves and are solely for Indian children. The combined schools are managed and financed jointly by the Department of Indian Affairs and local school boards and they are attended by both Indian and white pupils. Theday schools were attended by 8455 Indian children during the fiscal year 1925-26. This phase of the Department's educational work is becoming more important from year to year as better qualified teachers are being engaged. Field matrons and travelling nurses\nClasses have special duties among day school pupils and classroom activity is being made more attractive. The average attendance was 58.42% of the enrolment.\n\nThe day school enrolment by provinces for the fiscal year was as follows:\n\n| Province | Enrolment |\n|----------|-----------|\n| P.E.I.   | 1 day school with 26 pupils. |\n| N. S.    | 13 \"      | 318 \"     |\n| N.

The following table shows the enrolment and average attendance at both types of schools for the past eleven fiscal years. The General percentage of attendance has reached a new high level and is indicative of an awakening interest in education on the part of Indian communities. The numbers of the two types of schools are not given, as they vary but little from year to year. Ten years ago there were two more residential institutions and one less day school than in 1925-26.\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n|             | Enrolment          | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1915-16     | 4661               | 4029        | 8138   | 4051              | 12799     | 8080              | 63.13                  |\n| 1916-17     | 4520               | 4149        | 7658   | 4136              | 12178     | 8285              | 68.03                  |\n| 1917-18     | 4692               | 4081        | 7721   | 3797              | 12413     | 7878              | 63.46                  |\n| 1918-19     | 4640               | 4014        | 7512   | 3587              | 11952     | 7501              | 63.59                  |\n| 1919-20     | 4719               | 4133        | 7477   | 3516              | 12196     | 7649              | 62.71                  |\n| 1920-21     | 4783               | 4143        | 7775   | 3931              | 12556     | 8074              | 64.29                  |\n| 1921-22     | 5031               | 4360        | 7990   | 4308              | 13021     | 8668              | 66.56                  |\n| 1922-23     | 5347               | 4695        | 8376   | 4411              | 13723     | 9106              | 66.35                  |\n| 1923-24     | 5673               | 4856        | 8199   | 4332              | 13972     | 9188              | 66.23                  |\n| 1924-25     | 6031               | 5278        | 8191   | 4601              | 14822     | 9879              | 69.46                  |\n| 1925-26     | 6327               | 5658        | 8455   | 4940              | 14782     | 10598             | 71.69                  |\nIndian schools adopt the course of studies for the province in which they are situated. Emphasis is placed on the subjects of language, reading, domestic science, manual training, agriculture and physical training. Frequent inspections by officers of the Department are supplemented by academic examinations by public and separate school inspectors.\n\nThe Department continued to give considerable attention to the health of Indian children, particularly those in residential schools. Last year there was a comprehensive medical inspection and a special effort in the matter of physical education. Milk herds at residential schools were tested and the children's diet carefully supervised. Field matrons, travelling nurses and Red Cross workers have been given opportunity to make arrangements for the promotion of better health among Indian school children.\n\nContinuation and high school work is now being taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced pupils in these residential schools that are situated close to municipal colleges are benefitting by secondary training in competition with white children. Then, there are 120 Indian students, not shown in the tabular statements, attending public schools, high schools and colleges in Canada. In the case of most of these, the Department assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation. In this connection, $19,386.38 was expended during the past year. The policy is to make grants to the most promising graduates of Indian residential and day schools. If Church and Department representatives consider a graduate worthy, the Department provides a grant when the bona fide intention of the pupil is evident and provided proper supervision can be secured for the period of advanced study. These tuition grants are continued only when satisfactory reports are received. The practice of assisting ex-pupils of residential schools to start farming and housekeeping has been continued. Grants for stock, implements, building and household equipment have been made to some promising graduates. $4,386.40 was the expenditure from Indian Education for this assistance during the year.\n\nCompared with the previous year, there was an increase of one residential school and 10 day schools. A new residential school near McIntosh, Ont., was completed and opened for the admission of pupils. The additional day schools were established or re-opened on reserves where this type of activity gave promise of success. Other important building operations were the commencing of residential school buildings near Sioux Lookout, Ont., Sturgeon Landing, Sask., and Morley, Alta.; the completion of the new buildings at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, in Saskatchewan; a further wing for the Kamloops, B.C., Institution and the replacement of the buildings at Indian residential schools near Onion Lake, Sask., and Cardston, Alta.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1926, amounted to $1,918,441.53, as follows:\n| Province          | Day Schools | Residential | Ex-Pupils | Special | Tuition | Express | Stationery | Miscellaneous | Total       |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Nova Scotia      | $9989.75    | -          | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| Prince Edward Island | -         | -          | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| New Brunswick    | 15071.27    | -          | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| Quebec           | 6334.44     | -          | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| Ontario          | 5288.10     | 231682.14  | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| Manitoba         | 59987.21    | 185031.97  | 396.40    | 226.55  | 879.11  | 1566.39  | 3779.08     | 6644.27      | $6775.20    |\n| Saskatchewan     | 40658.40    | 404314.83  | 3494.61   | 414.94  | 855.37  | 4228.63  | 232.51      | 454199.29    | $6775.20    |\n| Alberta          | 6277.83     | 362668.37  | 197.50    | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| British Columbia | 58915.90    | 310443.00  | 295.89    | 4426.60 | 368.60  | 384.36   | 5988.04     | 137.70       | $6775.20    |\n| Northwest Territories | 1162.90 | 29085.92   | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n| Yukon            | 2888.25     | 13825.98   | -         | -       | -       | -       | -          | -             | $6775.20    |\n\nTotal: $19134.11\nIn addition to the above, certain bands of Indians, whose funds were sufficient to meet the expenditure, contributed the sum of $66,901.56 for school purposes.

When assistance has been granted, the funds used were Indian Education in some cases; and in others, other votes or funds administered by the Accountant. I believe it advisable to have a definite ruling concerning what funds should be used for these purposes; and an assignment of the responsibility, under your direction, to the Branches in question.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Assistance to Ex-pupils portion (at present $4,000) in the Appropriation for Indian Education be used for granting some little assistance or reward to satisfactory graduates of Indian residential schools - such assistance or reward to be of not more than $125 in value and to be given not more than three years after graduation. I also suggest that consideration of requests of this kind should be given by the Schools Branch. This would mean that the Accountant would be responsible for more comprehensive assistance, such as the establishment of a young man or couple on a farm or home, the cost of which would be met by other votes or funds.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe progress of the Indians is the result of supervision, and of educational efforts, which began in the older provinces shortly after 1830, when the first boarding schools were established, and which have since developed until the Department now conducts 253 day schools, with an enrolment of over 8,000 pupils, and 76 residential schools, with an enrolment of 6,300 pupils. The cost is met from parliamentary appropriation, which last year amounted to $1,918,000.00, and from funds of the Indians themselves, which are annually used to the extent of approximately $60,000.00. The unique feature of our educational system is the co-operation with the three leading religious denominations, the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the United Church. They contribute towards the cost to the extent of about twenty per cent of the total. At the residential schools, the Indian boys and girls are taught domestic work and instructed in farming and in the care of stock, and ex-pupils are encouraged by loans and direction by local Farming Instructors to settle and make homes on the reserve.\nIndian schools are not controlled or assisted by provincial departments of education.\n\nThe Indians' capacity for intellectual development compares favourably with that of Whites. Our wards who have attended high schools and colleges have in many cases led their classes and are now making good in professional life. Two years ago, an Indian boy was gold medalist at Upper Canada College. In the main however, vocational training, followed by supervision on the reserves, is the more important factor in the educational programme. At the residential schools, Indian boys are trained in farming and the care of stock and girls are given domestic instruction. Grants and loans encourage ex-pupils to establish themselves on reserves, where farming instructors direct their efforts.\n\nThe results of industrial education and supervision of graduates on reserves are encouraging. In four provinces, where the young Indian farmers have been trained in residential schools, the grain and root crop last year was over two million bushels. This indicates that our Indians are becoming successful farmers.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Duncan O.

It may be of interest to briefly sketch Indian educational activities of 1867. All the early efforts with Indian children were wholly missionary in character - for nearly 200 years the work was carried on without financial assistance from the governments. There is record of Recollet Fathers' schools for Indian children in New France as early as 1615; the Jesuits were active early in the 18th century; and settlers in the British colonies established little centres of Christianity at this period. These intermittent and only partly successful efforts were continued under British domination, prominence being given to instruction in religion. Even the education of white children received very little attention; in fact the first school in Upper Canada (1784) was for the Mohawk Indians who had settled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte and the first church to be erected in the Province (1785) was for the Six Nations Indians of the Grand River Reserve, near Brantford.\n\nPrior to Confederation, day schools were successfully conducted at Lorette, St. Regis and Pierreville in Lower Canada. At Caughnawaga, educational work was made nearly impossible by local difficulties. However, there were interesting experiments at Chateauguay and Christieville, where Indian boys from Caughnawaga were taken into residence and given a training in the classroom and on the farm. All these school activities received grants from Lower Canada. The Seminary of St. Sulpice, at Oka, maintained a farm school, at which Indian boys were enrolled.\n\nIn Upper Canada, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts organized the earliest Indian school on the Trentindage Reserve (Bay of Quinte). The New England Company, an evangelical organization chartered in 1661 in the reign of Charles II, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society and the Jesuits interested themselves in Indian educational work early in the 19th century. Approximately 40 day schools were established in Upper Canada prior to Confederation, but there is record of only two of them receiving grants from the governments of the day. Special institutions for the education of Indians were established at this time: the Mohawk Institute by the New England Company; the Alderville and Mt. Elgin Boarding Schools by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society; and the Wikwemikong Boarding School by the Jesuits. In addition, there was a community training centre established by the Governor of Upper Canada at Manitowaning, on Manitoulin Island. This enterprise was for the education of both young and old; but, as it did not appeal to the Indian temperament, it was abandoned in 1855, after 20 years of effort.\n\nIt should be recorded that in 1848 certain Indian bands in Upper Canada agreed to set apart for the purposes\nof education one quarter of the amount received in commutation of their annual distribution of ammunition. This Indian school fund was used largely for the maintenance of the Alderville and Mt. Elgin Boarding Schools, payments being made on a per capita grant basis - so much per child per year. Right at the outset of governmental association with Indian educational activity, we find two of the outstanding characteristics of the present system - church cooperation in the work and per capita grant payments to residential schools.\n\nPrior to Confederation there was practically no organization of Indian schools in other parts of Canada. Missionaries interested in the education of Indian children were opportunists - classes being conducted whenever and wherever the activity gave promise of even a little success. The New England Company experimented with foster homes for Indian children in New Brunswick even before it applied its energy and funds to the work among the Six Nations. A Church of England chaplain to the Hudson's Bay Company conducted a boarding school for Indian children on the Red River as early as 1822. A Roman Catholic priest tried an agricultural school for young Indians at Baie St. Paul, now St. Eustache, Man., in 1833. There is record of day schools in various parts of the West, all conducted by Roman Catholic, Church of England and Methodist missionaries. In British Columbia the New England Company began work early in the 19th century from which developed the present Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nAt Confederation Indian schools were supported for the most part by missionary societies, religious orders and the Indian bands - little financial assistance being given by the Legislatures. Low salaries were paid and the attendance was irregular and, as a consequence, the schools were not effective. When the British North America Act placed the responsibility for the Indians of Canada with the Federal Government, reports from Indian schools were forwarded to the Department of the Secretary of State, a branch of which was made the administrative office for Indian Affairs. In 1867 one residential school, the Mount Elgin Institute with an enrolment of 52, and 49 day schools with a total of 1564 pupils - all in Ontario and Quebec - were recognized by the Indian office. There were several Indian schools, entirely missionary in character, that did not make returns to the Government. The two most important of these were the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, supported by the New England Company, and the Roman Catholic boarding school at Wikwemikong.\n\nThere were 77 residential schools and 250 day schools in operation during the past year - a total of 327 Indian schools. In addition, the Department assisted in the maintenance of 16 combined white and Indian schools. The total enrolment for 1926-27 was 14,710 and the average attendance 10,541. In Part 2 of this report will be found a tabular statement, showing the location and indicating the enrolment and other facts in the case of each school.\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools. This cooperation of the churches in the case of residential schools is as follows: Roman Catholic, 48; Church of England, 20; United Church, 13; Presbyterian, 2.\n\nIn addition to the regular academic work at all Indian schools, there is the very important vocational training at the residential schools. Farming, gardening, the care of stock, manual training and domestic instruction are being given more attention by the Department and the Churches. About 190 Indian students are studying high school, business college and other advanced work. Some of these are at our regular Indian schools and others are enrolled at high schools and colleges. In the case of most of these last mentioned pupils, the Department assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation. The practice of assisting ex-pupils of residential schools to start farming and housekeeping has been continued.\n\nAt all Indian schools, provincial curricula are followed and fully qualified teachers engaged whenever possible. Properly qualified inspectors visit all classrooms except those in the northern schools. Arrangements have been made with the Provincial Departments of Education for the services of the regular public and separate school inspectors for this supervision, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian School Inspectors. In addition, there is a medical inspection and department officers give supervision to the vocational training.\n\nDuring the past few years, larger appropriations for Indian Education have enabled the Department to make various improvements in the school activity. Old equipment has been replaced, new schools have been commenced and better qualified teachers have been engaged. Instruction in both day and residential schools is becoming more attractive and now compares favourably with that in public and separate schools in Canada. During the past fiscal year three Indian residential schools were established. The Department erected the Guy School at Sturgeon Lake, Sask., 40 miles northwest of the Pas, Man. This institution is for Roman Catholic children and is equipped to accommodate and train 100 pupils. There was a most gratifying enrolment when the school was opened. At Morley, Alberta, a boarding school under the management of the United Church had an equally successful commencement.

Barrett,\nStirling,\nOnt.\nEDUCATING THE INDIAN.\n\nPresent System, If It Help, Leaves Much to Be Desired.\n\nTo the Editor of The New York Times:\n\nThe TIMES editorial of Dec. 26, based on the endowment of the Olive White Memorial Fund to be used for an Indian girl of the Six Nations, suggests comment on the need of vocational education opportunities for all our Indian youth.\n\nThe United States spends $6,000,000 annually on activities nominally classified as \"Indian Education.\" Fully 98 percent of Indian children, when they grow up, must work, beg or starve; the percentage of the total who possess measurable income is negligible.\n\nThere is not an Indian group among the hundreds from New York and North Carolina in the East, to California and Oregon in the West which does not need, and know that it needs, some one of its own membership trained in medicine, in nursing, in agricultural leadership, in business management and in law.\n\nBoth under present arrangements, large as is the expenditure by the Government on uses classified as educational, the Indian needs are being grievously neglected. For example, the most immediate Indian need as a training of boys and girls in rural and domestic economics\u2014in the many specialties of home economy. But the following is Secretary Hubert Work's characterization of the conditions of such training now given in our Indian schools:\n\n\"Teachers of trade subjects, agriculture and home economics, as a rule, have been men in whom is possessing neither education nor attainments fitting them to impart knowledge to classes of Indian students. Much of this personal skill has been of the character of manual or mechanical labor to handle the mass of material required in each day, but which is actually performed under their supervision and instruction by details of Indian children to an extent detrimental to the pursuit of their studies.\"\n\nDr. Work uses the past tense, but his report, which is for the year ended June 30, 1927, explicitly deals with conditions of today and, unless radical changes are made, of tomorrow. It should be pointed out that the situation can be met, at least to an extent decisive in the lives of thousands of Indian children, without any substantial increase in appropriations. At present the heavy drain on Federal appropriations for Indian education is caused by the boarding schools for Indians. These schools are conducted as asylums on a grand scale, and into them Indian children as young as five years of age are brought; many of their enrolments have an average age far below the age when vocational education would properly begin.\n\nThe per capita costs in these boarding schools are relatively large\u2014in excess of $250 a year for each child. This per capita expenditure is small for the requirements of board and room plus teaching, but it is at least five times larger than the average per capita cost of schooling those little Indian children in day schools at home.\n\nEducational results call for the restoration of these younger children to their homes, and the building up of adequate day schools in which can serve the child and the home simultaneously. Such results, humanly speaking, are equally self-evident and I might add, hygienically desirable.\n\nOnce the Indian children who are properly of boarding school age are educated in their own homes, their homes at least $1,000,000 will be released from the appropriation for Indians, which can then be applied to the education of thousands of Indian children such as are now undergoing training, including nursing, medical, dental, veterinary, law and business law, as will be exemplified by the Olive White Memorial Fund to be benefited by the Olive White Memorial Fund.\n\nThe facts which I here recite have been well known to observers of the Indian situation for many years. They have been pointed out in numerous efforts to secure attention to in frequent hearings before the Congress and the Congress. Until now the Indian Bureau has stood fast for its policy of institution of boarding schools housing the wards of little Indian children. A turning point in the welfare of the Indians will come when light breaks in the bureau's policy and the bureau compels the readjustment of its education policy to meet the obvious needs and capacities of the Indians.\n\nHAVEN EMERSON,\nPresident, American Indian Defense Association,\nNew York, Dec. 27, 1927.\nINDIAN SCHOOLS LECTURE\n\nA lantern lecture will be given in St. Luke's church-hall Monday evening at 6 o'clock by Rev. D. Westgate. His subject will be \"Indian Residential Schools Throughout Canada.\" A five-cent collection will be taken. The public is invited.\nSecretary,\nDept. Indians Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Burns referred you to me for literature regarding Indian Affairs as to the Act which allows Indians to keep money.\n\nIf the Indians have the same in the nine provinces why it is the Maritime Provinces have no Indian Boarding School?\n\nMost especially rules and regulations of the Indian Boarding School do not number of teaching days in years.\n\nThe regulations of the public schools of the provinces are\u2014 supposing a teacher is hired for\n$720.00 a year, if at the end of the fourth month (October) she leaves her connection she is paid $15 per day.\n\nIf she taught five months ordinarily she would be paid $5 \\times 60 = $300.00 according to per day in the five months of one hundred and five (105) teaching days. If she two hundred ten (210) school days she would be $105 \\times 2 = $210 making a difference of sixty dollars ($60).\n\nThanking you no anticipation of clearing up my ignorance on this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs Coutts\n\n445 Kennedy Ave,\nWinnipeg\nOttawa, February 4th, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th ultimo, I am forwarding, under separate cover, a copy of the Indian Act, also, a copy of our last annual report.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, the Department has always acted in close conjunction with the various churches in the establishment of Indian residential schools and, until recently, it has not been considered necessary to engage in this type of activity in the Maritime Provinces. For your information I may say, however, that land has recently been purchased and it is intended to erect a new Indian residential school at Shubenacadie, N.S., this year.\n\nIn paying the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools, this Department makes payment on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year. As the education of white children is in charge of the Provincial Departments of Education, they can make whatever regulations they see fit for paying salaries of their teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Coutts,\n445 Kennedy Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, February 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to confirm conversations concerning Indian educational policy, which the delegation from the Pasqua, Piapot and Muscowpetung Indian Reserves had with Dr. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General, and Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nYour request for more advanced academic training in the Indian residential schools has been noted and is receiving consideration. The difficulties of arranging special training for promising students have been explained to you at the present time in the Prairie Provinces the Department is trying to offer special facilities if the parents of promising students are willing to have their children transferred to those Indian residential schools which are near high schools and colleges. We are trying to improve the classroom instruction and an important step in this connection was taken a few years ago, when the public school inspectors were invited to visit our schools and to offer constructive criticism. You may rest assured that the Department will insist on classroom instructors with a thorough knowledge of English, which is the language of instruction. Your complaint that religious training is unduly emphasized at certain schools has been noted.\n\nThe Department is giving serious consideration to the question of more thorough vocational training at our schools. I am pleased to inform you that it is hoped to extend the facilities at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School next year. It is proposed to erect carpenter, blacksmith and tinsmith shops, so that instruction in\nthese trades can be given to all the boys. The Department's reasons for discouraging Christmas holidays at Indian residential schools has been explained. You are asked to use your influence to see that pupils remain at Indian residential schools until they reach the age of 18, if such action is urged by the Indian agent. You have been told why the Department does not always provide a house for visiting parents at residential schools, and, as promised by Mr. Ferrier, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham will be asked for a recommendation concerning such a building at the File Hills Institution.\n\nLimited funds are provided by Parliament for the purpose of assisting promising young Indians when they wish to establish themselves on reserves. Each individual case must be decided on its own merits and the application should be made to the Indian agent, who will make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nThe problem presented by the children who are physically unfit for Indian residential schools is most difficult of solution. At the present time, there is no school-hospital to which they can be admitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Veuillez s'il vous pla\u00eet me dire si vous avez re\u00e7u cette la\u00efte lettre et si vous y avez r\u00e9pondu.\n\nJe suis, Monsieur, votre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nEdouard Meilleur\n\nNote : Veuillez s.v.p. m'exp\u00e9dier le rapport de 1927, en fran\u00e7ais.\n\nTranslation:\nOn the 12th of October 1927, I wrote you a long letter asking for information regarding the Indian day schools. There were nine (9) questions. Have you received my letter? Your reply did not reach me. Kindly tell me if you have received my letter and if you have answered it.\n\nYours etc.,\nEdouard Meilleur O.M.I.\n\nNote - Kindly send me a French copy of the report for 1927.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st ultimo, I beg to say that I am under the impression that a reply was forwarded to your letter of October 12th. A copy of the annual report was forwarded to you on March 26th, 1927 and a French copy was forwarded on October 26th last, as requested in your letter of September 1st.\n\nWith reference to the questions asked in your letter of October 12th, I may say that, in more settled districts, Indian day schools are conducted for ten months each year. The daily sessions are the same as in rural white schools. However, in outlying districts where it is only possible to obtain the attendance of Indian children at day schools for a limited period each year, special arrangements are made. The amount allowed the teacher depends on the qualifications and the situation of the school. Indian day schools usually follow the course of studies prescribed for the white schools of the province in which the Indian school is situated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Le programme quotidien est le m\u00eame que celui suivi dans les \u00e9coles rurales de la population blanche de l'endroit. Toutefois, dans les districts \u00e9loign\u00e9s o\u00f9 l'assistance des enfants Indiens \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du jour n'est possible que pendant une p\u00e9riode limit\u00e9e de l'ann\u00e9e des arrangements sp\u00e9ciaux sont accord\u00e9s. Le montant allou\u00e9 \u00e0 la personne enseignante d\u00e9pend de ses qualifications et de l'\u00e9cole est situ\u00e9e.

Thanking you for your kindness.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 2nd.\nOttawa, April 3, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Gosling:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant and I have today mailed to you another copy of our latest Annual Report. The stamps you enclosed are not required and they are returned herewith. I might also inform you that on envelopes addressed to me at the Department, O. H. M.

Gosling, Esq.,\n215 Poplar Plains Road,\nToronto, Ont.\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nMay 1, 1926.\n\nMr. John D. MacLean,\nAssistant Deputy of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. MacLean:\n\nMiss Stella King, the Indian girl who is in attendance at our Normal School, is preparing an essay on \"Education Among the Indians\" to be read at our Empire Day exercises on May 23rd. I would be very glad if you would send us 2 or 3 books that would give the extent and nature and result of Indian Education for some years back. I have only a hazy idea of the good work that has been done among the Indian population.\n\nI would like also to get the names of some prominent young Indians who occupy important positions through the training they got in the Indian schools. I am thinking now of Chief Long Lance who is now a writer, and there must be others. This will be a splendid opportunity to bring this phase of education before our 265 students.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 7th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, informing the Department that Miss Stella King, an Indian girl who is in attendance at the North Bay Normal School, is preparing an essay, and requesting that some literature be forwarded on Indian education.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, under separate cover, I am forwarding to you copies of the annual report of the Department for the fiscal years ending March 31st, 1926 and 1927. If you will refer to the report for 1926, part 1, pages 15-18, and to part 2, pages 56-68, also to the 1927 report, part 1, pages 12-16, and to part 2, pages 52-64, it is thought that the information desired will be obtained.\n\nWe have no printed literature with reference to successful Indians in Canada, but I might mention that a number have taken up the teaching profession and several are clergymen. The Departmental medical officer at Caughnawaga, Que., is an Indian, and there is an Indian teaching in one of the Toronto colleges, who has secured not only his Master's Degree in Arts but is even now completing the course leading to the Ph.D. Degree.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Day School for the quarters ended September 30th and December 31st, 1927. These returns were handed to the Department by His Lordship Bishop Stringer on the occasion of his visit here this week. For some time past, this Department has been allowing a grant of $5.00 a teaching day at this school and we have issued and forwarded to Bishop Stringer a cheque for $335.- this is in payment of 56 days in the September quarter and 56 days in the December quarter at the rate stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nO. S. Finnie, Esq.,\nDirector,\nN.W.T. & Yukon Branch,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nIndian education, including the construction of school buildings, $2,169,210.\n\nMr. EDWARDS (Frontenac): Would the minister be good enough to give us a general statement in regard to the item of Indian education and how it is carried on?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): With the exception of the day schools, this work is carried on very largely by the religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, the United church, and the Presbyterian. In the day schools all the teachers must be employed by the government. They must be examined and approved by the provincial school inspectors of the province in which they are located. Under the old system the churches assumed the whole responsibility regarding the boarding schools, and received a per capita grant for this work from the government. When I came here I changed the system somewhat, as I found many of the church organizations were in other severe financial difficulties. We took over such buildings as we deemed to be decent and worth while, and started an extensive program of construction of new buildings. We have been spending in the neighborhood of $500,000 or $550,000 annually in the purchase and construction of new buildings, keeping in mind the needs of the communities among which have this work in hand, and the necessities of the communities in which they are built. In the British Columbia vote there is an additional $100,000 due to a recommendation made by the joint committee which dealt with this matter last year.\n\nMr. EDWARDS (Frontenac): I wanted to get a comparison of the Indians educated in the day schools and in the so-called private schools.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We are constructing a new boarding school at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. We believe better training can be given the Indian child in the boarding schools than in the day school, because it is very difficult to get him to be at all regular in his attendance at the day school. We have him under control at the time in the boarding schools; he remains there during the whole school period. In the day schools, which are located in all the provinces, we have 3,433 boys, 3,838 girls, a total of 7,271. In our residential schools, which are located in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and the Yukon, we have 3,200 boys, 3,433 girls, or a total of 6,631. Therefore there are all told about 14,900 children attending school.\n\nMr. BRADY: In the Indian schools, particularly the boarding schools, does the department supervise or control in any way the program, for instance, of technical and vocational work? Is there a definite program whereby the young Indian, instead of receiving the ordinary education which is of little value to him, really becomes a producer? I am the opinion because I know from my experience in visiting the Indian schools that there is a great waste. In other words, they reach a certain stage; they learn to read, write and a few other things, and then they have absolutely nothing to fall back upon. Is there a defined program of technical education of the Indian boys?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): The very difficulty that my hon. friend mentions is one to which we have given a great thought, and an endeavor to see if we can remedy it; but if he knows anything about the Indian, his difficulties are enormous, and will be his difficulty. We are endeavoring to teach the girls domestic work in addition to the ordinary public school curriculum, and the boys, as far as possible, as much as we can hold in any given institution. In Kamloops, for example, the boys are trained in irrigation work because of that territory the boys are going into from the school, and the irrigation work. In the north we give them as much education as we can in regard to agriculture, even as labourers, if need be, so that when they go out they may carry on in competition with their white brothers.\nMr. WOODSWORTH: In regard to the policy of the department I should like to ask the minister whether it is contemplated that the Indians will have to earn their living by hunting, and if so, whether it is a good thing to bring young Indians to boarding schools, keep them there for six or eight years, then turn them out again without having given them the opportunity to acquire hunting habits.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I have given this question very considerable attention and I have watched the development of some of these young people very closely, and I have had great hopes of making a change in connection with the young Indians whom we can put at once into the occupation of farming. For example, take the Blood reserve. In that case we have an allotment of land for the young student as soon as he is ready to leave school, and we endeavour to build a small house for him and to become responsible for the purchase of stock and implements although in a very limited way. We have every prospect of success there, and the reason I lay so much emphasis on this is because I am led to believe it will be successful through what I have seen on the Six Nations reserve in Ontario. Of course there are good and bad Indians, as there are good and bad white men, but on that reserve they are making a fair success of agriculture. However, in answer to my hon. friend's direct question about the northern Indians, the northern Indian, who is brought to school and then turned loose at the age of fifteen or sixteen years, neither a hunter nor a half-trained white man, is the problem which is giving us the most concern at the present time. The Indians who live in agricultural areas usually work for the surrounding farmers, and they make good workers. I am not denying the advantages of education to the young Indian, but we should have something to put him at as soon as he leaves school in order that he may earn his livelihood, and we have not found any solution different from although we are giving it very careful consideration.\n\nMr. WOODSWORTH: Just one other question in connection with these industrial schools. Would it not be well to encourage the young Indians to become Canadian citizens, or to make it possible for them to become Canadian citizens, in order that they might assume the full responsibilities of citizenship?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Of course that is the whole idea behind the education given them, and it is the solution of the whole difficulty. However when that happy condition is attained it is a different matter. I do think that the quicker we teach them the virtuous ways of the white man and his methods of earning a livelihood the better it will be for our own records and the sooner they will be able to assume the white man's responsibility. That is what we have in view.\n\nMr. COOTE: I have just one remark to make in connection with this item. I should like to ask the minister to give us an assurance that the young Indians after they leave these industrial schools will be given the necessary equipment with which to start farming on the reserves. I have had a good many complaints from the Indians to the effect that they have had difficulties getting the department to give them equipment. I do not suggest that there is ground for all these complaints, but I would like to have the assurance that the minister will be as liberal as possible in the furnishing of equipment to these young Indians who are willing to start farms of their own.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I think I can give the hon. friend that assurance, but I would not promise anything until I study the young Indians, because they want a full set of equipment to start with. We try to be as generous as possible in starting up a young man in this way, and I do not think there is any complaint to be made.\n\nMr. LUCAS: Do these Indians receive agricultural education at the school?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Yes.\nMr. Turner, O.C.T.\n\nI should like a general account of the Indian Affairs, and thought that such a date might be available from your department.\n\nMay I see you & inform me whether I may secure such\n-2.\n\nAttention Hon. Sir,\n\nPlease send me some of the literature on Native Affairs.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEd. A.

In Part II of this report will be found a list of these schools, showing the names of principals or teachers, locality, enrolment and attendance. Compared with the previous year, there was an increase of one day school.\n\nFurther efforts were made during the year to increase the efficiency at both residential and day schools. Closer supervision, better qualified instructors, more intensive vocational training and better buildings were the aims of the Department. Parliament provided a record appropriation of over two million dollars, and it was possible to make many improvements in connection with both personal services and physical equipment. At Caughnawaga, a large brick building was erected for the important day school activity there. This school is now on a par with a good city public school. A staff of 14 Sisters and 4 lay teachers are engaged in Caughnawaga village. In addition, there is a separate school for Protestant children. The old main building at the Onion Lake R. C. and St. George's Indian Residential Schools, in Saskatchewan and at Lytton, British Columbia, respectively, were replaced by modern schools, fully equipped for the maintenance and training of Indian children. At St. Philips, Saskatchewan, a small residential school was erected near the site of the old Roman\nCatholic boarding school, which was closed in 1913. Arrangements were made for the establishment of a much needed Indian residential school at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. A site with the necessary farm was secured and a suitable staff engaged.\n\nWhenever opportunity offered, better qualified teachers were secured and the Department insisted that suitable vocational instructors were employed by those managing the residential schools. At these latter institutions, special attention to the training in farming and in the manual and domestic arts was given by the Department's inspectors and agents.\n\nMore regular attendance and better teachers and equipment have had an interesting effect on the academic standing of the pupils. The following table shows the percentage of the total enrolment that was reported as in Grade 5 and higher:\n\n| Fiscal year | Total Enrolment | Enrolment in Grade 5 and up | Percentage |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 1910-11     | 11,190          | 780                        | 6.97       |\n| 1911-12     | 11,305          | 828                        | 7.32       |\n| 1912-13     | 11,144          | 734                        | 6.58       |\n| 1913-14     | 11,714          | 766                        | 6.54       |\n| 1914-15     | 12,468          | 834                        | 6.69       |\n| 1915-16     | 12,799          | 897                        | 7.01       |\n| 1916-17     | 12,178          | 955                        | 7.84       |\n| 1917-18     | 12,413          | 903                        | 7.27       |\n| 1918-19     | 11,952          | 878                        | 7.34       |\n| 1919-20     | 12,196          | 889                        | 7.29       |\n| 1920-21     | 12,556          | 929                        | 7.39       |\n| 1921-22     | 13,081          | 1,046                      | 8.03       |\n| 1922-23     | 13,725          | 1,187                      | 8.55       |\n| 1923-24     | 13,872          | 1,187                      | 8.56       |\n| 1924-25     | 14,222          | 1,322                      | 9.29       |\n| 1925-26     | 14,782          | 1,466                      | 9.95       |\n| 1926-27     | 14,710          | 1,664                      | 11.31      |\n| 1927-28     | 15,018          | 1,957                      | 13.05      |\n\nOf the 1,957 pupils who were in the higher grades during the year, 65 were studying high school work. These students were enrolled in Indian schools. In addition, there are approximately 140 Indian young men and women attending colleges, business schools, colleges and universities. 110 of these are receiving some assistance from Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe cooperation of the churches in the management of Indian residential schools was as follows for the year 1927-28:\n\n- Roman Catholic - 42 residential schools; enrolment 3822\n- Church of England - 20 \" \" \" 1509\n- United Church - 13 \" \" \" 1300\n- Presbyterian - 2 \" \" \" 165\n\nTotal - 77 residential schools; enrolment 6795\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1928, amounted to $2,033,375.10, as follows:-\nThe expenditure shown above was augmented by the contributions made by certain Indians whose tribal funds have for many years been used to meet the cost of schools upon their reserves. During the past year the total expenditure from this source has been $62,215.18. The table following gives the details of the charges.\n\nThe contributions from the Interest Account of the Trust Funds were for current expenses, salaries of teachers, minor repairs and tuition grants. The expenditure from Capital was for repairs to day school buildings on the Six Nations Reserve and for a new classroom and teacher's residence at the Dokis Indian Day School.\n\nIt is of interest to note that this statement will not be found in any future report. Parliament has provided appropriation for the fiscal year 1928-29 to meet the charges heretofore borne by Indians. Free education for the Indians was definitely imposed by treaty in some provinces and by usage in others and as the only exceptions to the general rule were made in the case of Indians of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec who were fortunately in possession of tribal funds, it seemed discrimination to refuse to extend to them the bounty of the Government in this regard. The undersigned, therefore, recommended that in the future the education of these Indians should be carried on without cost to them. You heartily approved and Parliament has granted the necessary funds. I am, therefore, able to state that Canada now has established a system of free education for its Indian wards.\nOttawa, October 20th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letter of May 12th last in connection with the Aklavik C. of E.

As early as 1858, missionaries accompanied the Yukon Indians in their hunting and later established missions and schools. At the present time, the Church of England in Canada is associated with the Department of Indian Affairs in the conduct of nine day schools. Only three of these are kept open for the entire academic year. The Department of Indian Affairs provides salaries for the teachers and classroom equipment. There is also an Indian residential school at Carcross. This is owned by the Department of Indian Affairs and is managed by the Missionary Society of the Church of England. A per capita grant is allowed by the Department for current expenses. At this school, boys and girls are given vocational as well as academic training. The boys are taught carpentry, blacksmithing, gardening, etc., and the girls are given a thorough training in general domestic work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.B.\nOctober 23rd, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson,\n\nReferring to your request to have Chapter 12 of the pamphlet issued by you in 1926 on The Yukon Territory Revised, I have looked it carefully over and would suggest changes only in paragraphs 6 and 7, the last two of the portion dealing with Indians.\n\nI am attaching hereto a statement which I would substitute for these two paragraphs. The rest of the article is quite appropriate.\n\nYou will note a typographical error in the spelling of \"Dawson\" in the 5th paragraph. I have not, of course, dealt with the paragraph concerning Eskimos.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

McLellan, Esq.,\nSouth West Margaree,\nInverness Co., N.S.\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL\n\nJanuary 13th, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am anxious to make some inquiries of an educational nature with respect to the work of the children in the native Reservations in various parts of the Dominion.\n\nI should be most grateful if you would be good enough to send me the names and addresses of the educational officers to whom I should write for further information. The particular inquiry is in regard to the training of young children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.W. Paget\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nTHE RIGHT TO BE AN INDIAN.\n\nIf Senator King's demand that the Senate investigate the living conditions of American Indians helps to direct public attention to the subject, and a thorough-hauling of our Indian policy will be useful. There is already much material at hand about the Indian problem. Not only does the Bureau of the Institute for Government Research, which sets forth in 800 pages or more the studies by experts, but there are the presentations of officials of members of the Board of Indian Commissioners and of distinguished authorities on Indian affairs like Dr. William C. Moon, head of Phoenix Academy, who are as persistent today as when they were made.\n\nThe time has come to consider a question of principle. Is it right to continue the policy of trying to re-Indianize the Indians and make white men out of them? One school holds that only thus can the Indians be preserved to be the only aborigines in the modern world. They have ultimately to compete with the white men in the white man's way. Hence they must acquire the white man's education and taught to accept the white man's civilization. The ultimate outcome will be amalgamation or disappearance.\n\nThe other school holds that the policy of \"civilizing\" the Indians means extermination. It points to the fact that the Indians are a primitive people in a highly complex modern civilization. It contends that in the process the Indian's morale is broken; that the white man's spirit engulfs the Indian's religion strikes at the root of his being; that contact with white men has introduced vices and diseases; that the white man's schooling destroys the Indian's discipline, without preparing him for life as he must live it. It demands in the name of the Indians' rights the restoration of life which they still lead within their reservations.\n\nOnce this question of broad policy has been decided, there are countless details of administration to be studied. One of the most practical things that Senator King's committee could do would be to adopt the suggestion of Dr. Moon, head and study the Indian policy of the Canadian government. Their plan is simpler and less expensive than ours. It is not overwhelming by red tape. It recognizes the necessity of better pay for the administrator. It does not seek to make wholesale changes of the present system. It depends on specialists who are outside of politics. It is based on constant consideration of the Indians' welfare rather than for the white men's convenience. Such a system may not be completely adaptable to our own case. But under any condition wise financial legislation for the remuneration of the Indian service could not but be helpful. The need is for simplification and efficiency and for a greater recognition of the natural rights of the Indians to have more of a say about his own future.\u2014New York Times.\nOttawa, February 1, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the education of Canadian Indians. I am sending, under separate cover, a copy of a recent annual report. You will find, on pages 12 and 52, statements and tables in connection with the educational activity of this Department. If you have any questions, I shall be glad to give additional information.\n\nI note that you are particularly interested in the drawings of young children. In 1925, the Department made a collection of original drawings, which portrayed the independent thoughts, longings and humour of the young native mind. Landscapes and other common themes were not included. The Department asked principals of Indian schools for themes showing the child's mind at play, his humour, his fears and his fairy world. This collection was forwarded to the Royal Geographic Society of Belgium, 116 rue de la Limite, Bruxelles. It is possible that you might be able to see this collection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. W. Paget, Esq.,\nThe Department of Education,\nUniversity of Liverpool,\n22 Abercrombie Sq.,\nLiverpool,\nEngland.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOn File 107-1-1 there are two interesting communications on the subject of Indian education for central Saskatchewan Indians. Rev. Mr. Hives, Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, in his letter to Commissioner Graham, is strongly in favour of an educational institution in the vicinity of Prince Albert, to be a centre of Indian farming. Lac la Ronge, Onion Lake and the MacKay Residential Schools, plus the northern day schools, were to be feeders for this institution. Bishop Lloyd, in a letter, agrees that hunting and fishing no longer hold out any prospect of a livelihood for the Indians in question. He thinks the present residential schools are not adequate and would like to see the graduates placed on a farm colony on the John Smith's Reserve. Young men should be given assistance with their farming and should be encouraged to marry girls who, under the supervision of a matron, would be trained to look after the cottages.\nGive a boy a purpose in life & he is no longer a problem.\n\n\"One fact borne in upon us by much progress in recent yrs is 'realization' life is a unity - you cannot send a boy's head & body, his body & 'flagging' & heart & his friendships (this end & th.)\"\n\nTours, h.p. - a United ch house & 6-16 yr old girls. wonderful success.

SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to the proposed changes in the educational sections of the Indian Act, I wish to recommend that\n\n1. Section 10 (1) be amended to include children in their 16th year, i.e., compulsion from the 7th to the 16th birthdays.\n\n2. Section 98 (1) (F) be amended to conform.\n\n3. Section 194 (2) (F) be amended to conform.\n\n4. A subsection (4) be added to Section 10, so that the provisions of the section may apply to the 18th birthday in the case of any particular Indian child who, in the opinion of the Superintendent General, would be granted a decided disservice if discharged from industrial or boarding school at an earlier age.\n\nIn explanation of my 4th recommendation, I wish to state that, in a few cases, the Department has found it advisable to bend every energy towards keeping in a residential school a pupil who should not be placed in the custody of the parent or parents at the ages of 16 or 17. I might mention two instances as examples. The Department refused to discharge Kathleen Clause from the Chapleau School, even after repeated requests from the father. The mother was dead and the father was a Six Nation Indian, who eked out an existence, begging, etc., in the streets of Hamilton. In another case, the Department refused to send Aggie and Christie Olson, two attractive and accomplished 17 year old pupils at Brandon, to the mother, a Brokenhead woman, who wanted her daughters to join her in a life of prostitution. In these cases, the Department and the churches managing the schools had a moral obligation to thwart the efforts of an irresponsible parent. The proposed section would give power to keep such children in school until they had reached their 18th birthday. At this age, they would be better able to choose wisely for themselves.\n\n5. The words \"to the maintenance of such school or\" be deleted from Section 9 (6).\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe present Superintendent General of Indian Affairs has taken a lively interest in the education of the Department's wards. Parliament has been asked for larger appropriations in order that improvements could be made in the Indian school service. Many new buildings have been erected, better equipment has been provided and teachers with higher qualifications have been secured. The policy of more thorough inspection of classroom activity has been extended by the engagement of the services of public and separate school inspectors in the four western provinces. Further, special efforts have been made to promote better vocational training courses.\n\nA feature of Indian educational work in Canada is the cooperation of the churches interested in the evangelising of the Department's wards. The Honourable Mr. Stewart has continued and strengthened this association by his liberal policy. An important factor in the programme is the residential school, where vocational training can be made effective. There are now 80 of these institutions in Canada and, at the present time, one is being established in the Maritimes to educate the orphan and neglected Indian children there.\n\nThe cost of educating Indian children in some parts of Canada was definitely imposed on the Federal Government by treaties. In other parts of the Dominion, also, the State has accepted this obligation. However, certain bands in Ontario and Quebec still paid from their own funds part of the expenses of conducting their schools. A year ago, the Government extended the system of free education so as to include all Indian children.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\nRG 10, Volume 6001\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 1\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1879 - 1905\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 2\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1904 - 1928\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 3\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1928 - 1936\n\nFile 1-1-1, part 4\nHeadquarters - Schools - General. 1922 - 1941\nPROGRESS IN INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nFor many years Canada has held high record for the care of her Indian population. It has been frequently said by men of other lands that she secures greater results in the handling of her aboriginals from a smaller per capita expenditure than any other nation; but, however gratifying, however deserved at the present time, such testimony may be, all connected with the Department of Indian Affairs realize that perfection is yet a long way off and that it is only by ceaselessly going forward that Canada can keep pace with the demands of the situation. During recent years, therefore, and particularly during the past three years under the direction of Hon. Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, important changes have been effected in improving all Indian schools in regard to buildings and equipment, and the standard of academic and vocational work.\n\nThe Government of Canada holds large funds in trust for the Indians, the income from which is used for their benefit, but as the treaties or agreements with the various tribes were made at different times over a period of two hundred years the terms are not all the same. Some of the bands in eastern Canada were allowed to devote part of their income to provide schools. This was done to the amount of $63,000 per year, whereas in western Canada the Government has provided schools without drawing on the trust fund. In order to put all Indians on an even basis the Department now supplies the total cost of schools. Trust-fund moneys are devoted to objects of a municipal character, such as drainage, sanitation, hospitals, etc. Indians are not yet enfranchised.\nin Canada but the expenditure of these funds on work for the band is carried on, so far as possible, through the band council, in order to give the Indians a training in citizenship.\n\nThe buildings for schools for the training of Indian children have not been as commodious, nor the equipment as efficient, as in the case of schools for white children. This was due to the fact that, generally speaking, the buildings had been erected by the various churches co-operating with the Government and their missionary funds did not permit them to put up buildings as good as the case required. Working steadily from year to year the Department has been replacing these old structures by modern standard buildings, well lighted, sanitary, and protected against fire. This has applied both in the case of residential schools and in that of day schools. For the latter, buildings have been designed which, in addition to the school room, contain a house for the teacher and his family.\n\nThe academic work in these schools, both day and residential, has been steadily advanced and the text books, classification and curricula, now conform to the standards of the province in which the school is situated. Just lately another step forward has been taken in arranging that the schools shall be regularly inspected, as regards academic work, by provincial inspectors. In this way the Department will have the benefit of the judgment and constructive criticism of men inspecting white schools and the teaching kept abreast of the latest advances in education.\n\nIn the residential schools vocational work - half day in class room and half day in field or workroom - has been the rule and this will be continued. In the day schools special attention is now being given to school gardens, also\nto school fairs, where garden products grown by the pupils and articles made by them are exhibited. For the girls instruction is given in sewing, cooking and housework, including the preparation and serving of the mid-day meal in the school, which is now so generally a feature of Indian day school work.\n\nThe aim of the Department of Indian Affairs is not to turn an Indian into a white man in one generation but to enable him to become a more efficient Indian, able to take hold and make a living for himself and family in the locality where he resides, and gradually to lead him to full economic independence and citizenship.\n\nPrepared at the direction of Dr. Duncan C.

Ferrier]\nSuperintendent de l'\u00e9ducation des Indiens.\nCanadian Indian\n\nThe principal of one of our Indian schools says: \"The weakest point in all our Indian work is the one-roomed house or hut in which so many Indians have to live. When Benjamin Franklin began his great work in the South, he travelled for months among the negroes to decide where to focus his energy, and he was emphatic that the one-roomed dwelling-place must go. Evils, but impossible to remedy, which will not allow the mass to come forward, originating largely from a family living in a one-roomed abode.\"\n\nAnother pressing problem as he sees it is the great lack of responsibility on the part of the adult Indians. The school and the government and the missions alike is to make the Indian a worthy citizen, and he cannot be that without shouldering responsibility and taking his own share in the upkeep and education of his family. Are he and his children getting too much for nothing? Free land, free farm instruction, free medical attendance, free missionary, no taxes of any kind, no payments on school buildings, very little to church. Some are beginning to have some wealth, good houses, and better farms. It is right that they should also have an economic sense of the value of what they receive, and cultivate thrift and responsibility.\n\nOur Indian schools are meeting just such problems in the best way possible by the contact of Christian men and women with the young folk of the race\u2014Mrs. Charles Clark, 15 Danforth Crescent, Toronto, Ont.\n\nMarch 29\nArchdiocese of Vancouver\n\nChancery Office\n646 Richards Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Deputy Minister\nIndian Department\nOttawa\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir,\n\nI shall be much obliged if you would kindly have forwarded to me a copy of the Report on the administration of Indian Schools and Missions and the money paid therefor in the Province of British Columbia. With best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. Griffith\nMarch 12, 1929.\n\nDear Father Griffith:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, and I am enclosing a copy of the Department's latest report. On page 11, you will find literary matter which has reference to Indian education in Canada and on page 52, tabular statements listing the day and residential schools and giving information concerning their enrolment, etc.\n\nYou will note that there are in British Columbia 42 Indian day schools. These are conducted by the Department, in cooperation with the three Churches interested in the evangelizing of the natives of the province, viz.: Roman Catholic, United Church and Anglican. The Department provides buildings in most cases and whatever equipment and repairs are required from time to time. The teachers' salaries are paid by the Department. The residential schools, which are a very important factor in the Department's programme in British Columbia, number 16. 9 are conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, 5 by the United and 2 by the Church of England. The Ahousaht, Cariboo, Christie, Kitamaat, Fort Simpson, Squamish and St. Mary's institutions are church-owned and the Alberni, Alert Bay, Coqualeetza, Fraser Lake, Kamloops, Lillooet, Luper Island, Sechelt and St. George's Schools are owned by the Department of Indian Affairs. In the case of even the church-owned schools, the Department has assisted from time to time with the capital expenditure. These British Columbia residential schools are shown in the table on page 61 - the post office address, church control, name of principal and attendance record are given in each case.\n\nTo both Church and State owned residential schools, the Department pays a per capita grant, based on the average attendance of Indian children. This per capita grant is for the purpose of meeting the current expense. In some cases, church missionary societies or orders supplement this grant, if found necessary from time to time. There is also enclosed a copy of the Auditor General's report for this Department, showing the expenditure at the Indian schools. On page 42, you will find detail concerning the day school expenditure, and on page 33, that for the residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

I would like to know how many where the boys & girls come from, what they pay, etc., etc. This is to use in connection with a Junior Missionary meeting we have hoping to visit Brandon Industrial School.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Mrs. M. W.) Evelyn F. Thompson\nOttawa, April 8, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nYour letter of the 25th ultimo, addressed to the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, requesting certain information relative to Indian schools in Manitoba, has been transferred to this Department for reply.\n\nThere were in operation during the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1928, 43 day schools, 10 residential schools and 2 combined white and Indian day schools. There was an enrolment in the day schools of 1246 pupils, in the residential schools 1028 pupils and in the 2 combined schools 20 pupils, or a total enrolment of 2294 pupils. There was an average attendance of 1626 pupils, being a percentage of 70.85 of the number enrolled.\n\nThese schools are for the most part situated around Lakes Winnipeg, Manitoba and Winnipegosis. All these schools are conducted under the auspices of the various religious denominations interested in Indian work, viz., United Church, Presbyterian, Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches.\n\nFree education for the Indians was definitely imposed by treaty in Manitoba, and Indians are provided with education in that province without any expense to themselves.\n\nI am forwarding to you, under separate cover, a copy of the last annual report of the Department for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1928, and would refer you to Pages 11 to 14 and Page 22 of Part One, also to Pages 55, 56, 59, 62, 63 and 64 of Part Two, where you will be able to obtain particulars regarding the Indian schools conducted by this Department in Manitoba.\n\nI am also forwarding a copy of the Auditor General's report and would refer you to Pages 29, 30, 39, 40 and 41, which will show the expenditure incurred by each of these schools during the fiscal year 1927-28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. N. W. Thompson,\nJustice, Man.\nFitting the Indian In\n\nBeing an account of what some \"Good Indians\" are doing on the land.\n\nBy JAS. A. DONAGHY\n\nA QUESTION often asked is: \"Is it worth while spending so much money upon the Indians in an attempt to make self-supporting farmers out of them?\"\n\nThere are a great many who answer in the negative, declaring it to be a waste of funds. They say we are trying to make the square hole, which cannot be done. While there may be a grain of truth in the peg-and-hole idea, yet, the majority of these who give expression to that opinion are far out of the way, or are wandering in a strange land about which they have read but little. Perhaps the present system is not perfect, but that is true with most business systems; they are continually being improved. There may be some truth in the statement that the Indian is a round peg, and our mode of living is the square hole, and it may be necessary to make some rearrangement in the pegs. That situation appears to be found in the words of an Indian Missionary across the line. \"Too much money and time are being wasted trying to make white men out of the Indians instead of making good Indians out of them.\"\n\nThat great strides have been taken cannot be denied, and looking over the changes that have taken place in two or three generations we ought to feel proud on our part, and are being justified. On the other hand we must remember there are sections and some of our cities in which the white people are lacking in progress financially, socially or spiritually. The opportunity has been at their door for many years. Not very long ago the Indians were millionaires, and naturally did not feel the necessity of working. No provision in that past was made. Food and clothing for travel and clothing abounded on all sides, they simply had to go out and bring it in as required, like casing a chestnut. But the bark broke, and the huge supply of food disappeared, the Indians also almost exterminated by the whites. Like many bankrupt millionaires of today in Florida, they must work or go hungry. With the old-times work being hard, but the Indian Department and the churches working together take the young children before they have felt the influence of their environment to any extent, and place them where they are fed mentally and physically to face them to face an attempt at Indian work. All is not discarded, but the leaven is at work, and a glance over some of our big reserves will astonish those who are not acquainted with the scene. A few days ago I used to pass a few large farms known as \"Bonanza Farms,\" owned by white men, but the body seemed to be too large for the brain, and they were short-lived. But the young Indians in some of the big reserves in Alberta are doing no nothing short of \"Bonanza farming,\" and they are \"making it go.\" Their acreage is enormous, and their methods are scientific.\n\nThese people working upon a large or small scale, are guided by an overseer known as a Farm Instructor, whose duty it is to arrange all farming operations. His efforts are well rewarded. Seed is selected subject to his approval. He supervises the preparation of the land, and sowing of the crop. In fact, he is to the Indian farmer what The North-West Farmer is to the white people\u2014a source of information upon all farms from setting a hen, upwards. They are prevented from setting a hen, upwards. They are prevented by this system from making the blunders so often found among white farmers, for they are kept from making rash deals for articles they have no real use for. And also, to prevent the consumption merely from unsupecting useless articles upon these unsuspecting people, no one of the great leaks is thus closed. And finally, as stated in the eyes of the law, any such deal put through without the sanction of the Board of Supervisors is a deal that cannot be very well collected.\n\nAs the Government is his guardian, naturally it handles his money. All grain tickets pass into the hands of the Indian Department, who does the purchasing and advances money as he requires it during the winter. It will be seen that this system works to the best of all concerned. The Indian has the backing of the Government, and at the same time does not know that the bill will be paid out of the man's crop as far as it will go. A white man may decide to pay off his mortgage and hold back until the Indian's debts are paid in full if he has the means to his credit. So, while he cannot be sued for the debt, he is much safer than many white men. But all his business is not so complicated. He makes a good living raising sheep, digging out wolf pups in the spring, for which he receives a bounty of two dollars per head. If he knows how to hire a man to put in his crop while he went \"digging wolves,\" and in three weeks' time has a fine crop, and produce outside of farming operations is in their own control, and is used in payment of what is called the \"loan of honor,\" contracted without the sanction of the Department, and though they may sometimes be in arrears, yet they are absolutely sure. Indian honesty still stands.\n\nOn the Swan Lake reserve the visitor will see as fine work horses on the farms as Chief Matosse, Chas. Tanner, John Cameron, Mr. Telford, and others see on the average white man's farm. Last year Chas. Tanner had a good yield of very fine oats, and Mr. Cameron, who now considers himself to be on \"Easy Street.\" The other men have also done well. They raise a good variety of poultry, including ducks and geese, and also fish are in the gardens.\n\nWith an ordinary desire to pay, and education provided free, school taxes are unknown, the reader may think I am doing more than my share. It is well, for the Indian it is, if he has any ambition at all. We are giving these people the greatest opportunity ever given and a real square deal, although frequently we hear that we are not doing so.\n\nThe occupiers of the reserve have a large steam thrasher outfit owned by the Indians operating it on the Swan Lake reserve. They were working the farms at that time without a supervising Farm Instructor to direct them, but they understand the work quite well themselves. They have grasped the new idea necessary to overcome the lack of hunting and trading privileges, and the old mode of living has undergone quite a change, and they are gradually conforming to the white habit. We may expect them to fit accurately in the near future. It may be necessary for us to remember that they think of the Indians, and have their own national songs, dances, and traditions, and it may be necessary to cut off some of the sharp corners of the square hole a bit, and not demand that they become exactly like white men, but that they fill their place better by becoming \"good Indians.\" Not the \"dead\" kind we used to hear about, but Indians whose crops will require many trains to carry them out of the country.\n\nBut they still hang on to regard for their old traditions and certain dances. Can they be blamed? Perhaps we will have to preserve their national customs that are fast dying out, and at the same time make \"good Indians\" of the people. We must be careful to judge them by the wandering element we meet with occasionally as it is to judge the race who tour the country on the bumpy night train. Give the Indian fair chance, and he will prove that it is a return for the interest you have tak'en him.\nTHE NEW OUTLOOK\n\nReaders' Forum\n\nAre Our Indians Being Cared For?\n\nTo the Editor of The New Outlook:\n\nDear Sir\u2014The newspapers have given quite a little publicity to stories of sickness and suffering among our northern Indians, and as I have lived among these people for the last thirty-five years and have some knowledge of the conditions under which they live, I would like to try and give the public at least one side-light on the situation.\n\nSome criticism has been expressed as to the sickness among these northern Indians.\n\nNow, from the standpoint of a physician, I have never adverse criticism of the Department of Indian Affairs, because we, who represent the Churches, cannot take any better care of these isolated, wandering bands. Indians from a spiritual standpoint than the Department of Indian Affairs does from a physical one.\n\nThe isolated, scattered condition of these people makes the matter of caring for them almost an impossibility. Many a time I have thought that trying to reach these Indians was like the search of King Saul for the missing David \"as a partridge among the mountains.\"\n\nMy experience has made me of the opinion that the Department of Indian Affairs takes a very forefront of our federal and provincial departments in caring for their sick ones. Observing settlers, fishermen, and others I have often remarked, \"The Indians are the best-cared-for people in the whole country.\" Wherever the Indians are accessible they are well-cared for. Where they are inaccessible and uncared for it is not the fault of the State or the Churches.\n\nOne special note about the matter of the care of the Indians I would like to write about and that is the part that mission workers under all the Churches have played. During the best part of the past one hundred years mission workers have been attending to the physical as well as to the spiritual life of the Indians. Before \"Treaty\" was made with the Indians there were on the job doing what they could and at their own expense. Since \"Treaty\" was entered into, the Department of Indian Affairs has supplied remedies and the mission workers have dispensed them. Many and interesting tales could be told of isolated mission workers doing wonderful things among the bands which visit bands of Indians. Equally wonderful and appealing stories could be told of how needless work came to an end, broken bones were amputated, made and so forth. Besides all this the steady work day by day of dispensing remedies, extracting teeth, caring for the women and teaching the children by daily example and precept upon precept, the laws of life and clean living, and of how to prevent sickness and if it came how to cure for it.\n\nThe question is ofttimes asked, \"Do Indian Missions pay?\" We who know something of the knowledge that the lowest factor in the civilization, and general care and control of our Indians has been the work done by the Missions among them.\n\nKoostatah, Man.\n\nF.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nM. C. Maclean, Esq.,\nChief of Education Statistics,\nDominion Bureau of Statistics,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nNATIONAL PARKS OF CANADA\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Bird Banding.\n\nIn connection with the Official Canadian Record of Bird Banding Returns, kept at this office, it has been suggested that many more banding returns would be reported by Indians if they understood the purpose of identification bands and the importance of reporting details concerning the recovery of each banded bird. Accordingly, I am asking you to help in this work by familiarizing the Indians with the purpose and results of bird banding.\n\nThe information that it is desired to give the Indians is as follows:\n\nThrough the voluntary efforts of persons throughout Canada and the United States, aluminum bands or rings are being placed on the legs of wild birds in an endeavour to obtain information concerning the migration and life histories of our native birds.\n\nTo avoid confusion, only one set of bands is being used in the two countries, and these bands are issued by the United States Bureau of Biological Survey, at Washington, D.C. They bear the inscription \"Biol. Surv., Wash.D.C.\" and a number, or a letter and number.\n\nIt is important that any Indian, who finds a bird wearing one of these bands report the fact to the Indian Agent, who will then report all details to this branch. He should give the kind of bird, band number, date and locality of recovery, and information as to whether the bird was found dead, was killed, or was released alive still wearing its band.\n\nTo each Indian or Eskimo, reporting the recovery of a banded bird, the Government of Canada donates a bronze medallion. These tokens bear the inscription \"From the Government of Canada\" and are finished off in bright colours, that for the Indians showing a Canada Jay, and the one for the Eskimos a Polar Bear.\n\nThose who\nThose who report returns, help to establish very interesting and useful information concerning the wanderings of the birds of which very much is being learned in this way. Every report of a banded bird helps. Many interesting returns have already been furnished through the cooperation of Indians, and we hope for a great many more.\n\nIt is hoped that the Indians have begun to realize that the protection, which is afforded to migratory birds by the treaty which exists between Canada and the United States, is resulting in the increase of our ducks and geese, so that the Indians will have much better hunting in the open season. It is also hoped that they have learned that spring shooting is very detrimental to the cause of bird protection in general and that they will cease to carry out this practice.\n\nThe geese and ducks from Canada go to the United States and spend the winter there. Years ago the people in the United States, where the birds winter, used to shoot them for market. There were no bag limits and in many places there was no closed season. Then when the birds were on their northward flight they were shot wherever they stopped to feed. In many of the States of the United States this was true, and even in parts of Canada.\n\nNow, since Canada and the United States have come to an understanding, because the birds were getting so scarce, things have changed. There is an open season of the same length in all parts of Canada and the United States. In no part of each of those countries are the birds shot for longer than three and one half months. In the whole of the United States there is no shooting after the end of January. In the whole of the United States where our birds are in winter, there is no sale of birds allowed. Fines amounting to thousands of dollars each year have had to be paid by persons who broke the law, and long jail sentences have been given persons who shot ducks or geese for sale. As there is no shooting after the end of January, the birds are not bothered when they are mating before coming north to Canada to breed. If Canada and the United States had not agreed by this treaty to give the birds more care, by now there would be very few ducks and geese coming North, in the spring, for they would have nearly all been shot to be sold. Since the treaty between Canada and the United States, the sale of birds has stopped, and spring shooting has stopped. The treaty made it possible for the United States to set aside big reserves where the ducks and the geese are not shot at all at any time of year. It is because of this treaty that ducks and geese come North now in bigger numbers than they did a few years ago.\n\nIndians should remember that if the treaty had not been adopted, there would be hardly any birds left to come North.\n\nAll Canadians.\nAll Canadians should do their share\nto see that birds are not shot in spring before they\nnest, to see that no birds are wasted, because they\nmean so much to our people, and to see that all banded\nbirds are reported to the National Parks of Canada\nBranch, so that we may have more knowledge of the birds'\nmigrations and habits and so be in a position to enact\nlaws for the protection of these birds which are a\nnational asset.\n\nIndian Agents and other persons, reporting\nbanded birds, will be informed promptly respecting\nthe place and time of banding.\n\nYour co-operation in this matter will\nbe very much appreciated by this Branch.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.B. Harkin,\nCommissioner.\nCONDITIONS IN INDIAN SCHOOLS ARE IMPROVING\n\nHenry Conn, City Schools Inspector, Addresses Lunch-Club\n\nAn interesting outline of the present conditions existing in Indian schools was given to the luncheon club at this afternoon's gathering by Henry Conn, B.A., city schools inspector.\n\nMr. Conn took a very hopeful view of the present day trend in Indian schools and said he felt within a short time they will be on a par with rural schools in efficiency of work. He discussed the various difficulties confronted in teaching the Indians' children, particularly that of frequent adverse home environment and the fact that the child is secure only in the home but in recent years better school buildings, better equipment and teachers and qualifications equal to those of the public schools were having the desired effect.\n\nMake Progress\n\nJurisdiction of the Indian schools for the most part was in the hands of the department of Indian affairs and the management was generally very good. Much progress had been made in the last few years in co-ordinating the work in Indian schools with that in the public schools.\n\nPhysical matters in the past have made inadequate ventilating, cult of exercise when children came to school without breakfast as was sometimes the case.\n\nThe speaker excited some amusement when he described how the teacher is out of the schools on Wednesday and permanent, the department to furnish cold lunch or outdoor recreation. Hopefully, he hoped, facilities would be provided for serving one hot lunch daily to the children.\nNew Indian Policy\n\nUncle Sam Has a\n\nTHE SATURDAY EVENING POST\n\nBy Ray Lyman Wilbur\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nAs Told to William Atherton Du Puy\n\nThe Red Man in a White Man's World\n\nTHE American Indian should be made self-sustaining, should be brought to full responsibility for himself, should be freed of his present wardship, should be merged into the industrial life of the nation. The administration of his affairs should be decentralized, the manner of his education revised, the Indian agent, with his abnormal powers, should cease to exist. The Indian schools will become but one of three agencies of Government which will steadily become less important, and in twenty-five years it practically should have ceased to exist.\n\nThe assimilation of the Indian has been a policy of the Government for a hundred years. Despite that policy, the Indian has remained a people apart, close to the old life, languishing into periods as he former hunting grounds have disappeared. Yet the Indian stock is of excellent quality and can readily merge with that of the nation.\n\nTo bring about this result it will be necessary to revise the educational program both of practical and vocational character and to mature plans for the absorption of the Indian into the industrial life of the nation. The Indian boy and girl will be given the normal educations of our American boys and girls. Indian schools shall in no respect partake of the nature of reform schools. He shall not be prepared for dependent wardship but upstanding and independent manhood.\n\nHe shall be prepared for a place in the everyday world and then that place shall be found for him.\n\nThe Indian, obviously, constitutes a racial group quite different from the masses of the population. The United States has had a vast experience with racial and national groups. Italians, Scandinavians, Germans, have come to these shores, lived for a while as peoples apart, been absorbed into the mass. But the red man has remained a comparatively small racial group that has been relatively unaffected by the movement toward the melting pot. The white American is today the least American element in the population. He remains unassimilated because he has been isolated, held apart on his reservation, prevented from entering the great stream of American life.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence indicating the possession by the Indian of abundant intelligence to become a productive citizen of the United States capable of giving a good account of himself. The psychologists have tested Indian children and have found them to be on an average grade of white children. The white children, they say, grade 14 per cent above the Indians. There is much question, however, if this advantage is not due to the stimulation they have had in their homes, the greater familiarity with the language of the schools rather than to any innate superiority.\n\nThere are many experiences in which Indian children have gone into the public schools and taken their places beside white children. They have passed through the primary grades and gone on to high schools with those children. In some cases they have afterward gone to college. In running this gamut of education the Indian child has made a record that seems quite normal. He has shown an adequate capacity to acquire these various degrees of education.\n\nThe Indian is dexterous with his hands. He sees accurately. He is probably superior to the average white man.\nin learning manual tasks. He can learn to be a carpenter, a bricklayer, a machinist, as readily as any white man. He is an excellent employee in the railway shops of the West. There are one hundred and fifty Indians employed in these shops at Winslow, Arizona, many of them drawing the pay of skilled machinists. This manual skill appears in the industries of the Indian woman, in basket weaving, in blacksmithing, in shoemaking. The man is of an even temperament. The women fit well into domestic service. They make excellent trained nurses. They are competent as clerks and stenographers. It has been adequately demonstrated that there is, in fact, no bar against the Indian becoming of full social standing and as a member of a civilized community by an opportunity.\n\nThe world of activity that is America is wide open to the Indian. When he has finished that schooling which provides for most of his kind, there are two avenues open to him. He may go back to the reservation or he may try to find himself a place in the white man's occupation. At this turning point in his career his fate is largely in the hands of those who control the Government who administer the Indian Service. They can send him back to the reservation to return to the ways of his ancestors and maintain the Indian status as a race apart or they can send him out into the active life of the nation.\n\nThe Choice\n\nFROM now on every effort will be made to accomplish the following:\n\nSenator Curtis, who, as a boy, lived as a blanket Indian on the reservation, tells of his experiences as a boy and, at the age of fifteen, again going up with the Indians to return to the reservation. His Indian grandmother waked him in the night, showed him that road led to the life of a reservation Indian and the other to that of the white man, and, though she loved him dearly, put him on the road which led him to the latter. Just this problem faces every young Indian who returns from school. Proper placement would lead most of them into lives among the whites and to assimilation.\n\nThe educated Indian usually goes back to the reservation, experience has shown, usually goes back to poverty, to the life of the aborigine. His veneer of civilization is soon lost and he becomes as were his fathers. The people of the reservation are likely to be prejudiced against all that is not Indian. The old prejudices of the young man may have learned in school, beat him down, drive him back.\n\nAmong the Indians there is great reverence for the old people, an apparent virtue, but one which here has barred progress. The white people dominate. There is no use against them. Because of the former theory of returning the young educated Indian to the reservation that he might exert an elevating influence comes to naught. The old order wins out. Boarding-school education is stripped from the young Indian upon his return to the reservation as might be a cloak.\n\nThe young Indian coming out of school does not want to go back to the reservation. A return to the crude life of it is particularly repugnant to the young girls. It usually happens, after they have gone back to their homes, that they come to the Indian agent and plead with him to find an avenue of employment for them. They beg for work. But in the remote regions in which the reservations are located there is no work. They can do nothing else than to subsist on the rations provided for them.\n\nThere should be no great difficulty in finding places in the industrial life of the nation for these young Indians. They could be placed anywhere and it is not hard to direct into the proper channels. Their numbers are not so great as materially to affect any labor market. They are scattered West where, for example, domestic help is scarce. Every girl who wants it could find a place in a white home. Their employment in the tourist hotels would be a highly attractive atmosphere. Many of them have had special training in sewing, which has its possibilities. Places could be readily found for those who have got some training in photography. There is unlimited call outdoor-door for the boys on the farms, in the orchards, in railway building and maintenance.\n\nThey are too often chained doggedly to one idea which, on the face of it, seems a correct one, but which has failed through the decades in actual practice. It has held that the Indian of the modern epoch was better fitted to farming than any other occupation. They had land. Above all else, they should be taught to farm. They have been so taught and then they have gone back to the reservation and applied what they have learned. Their opportunities have been many, but few have taken advantage of them. Farming on the reservations is largely a failure. The Indians lease their good lands to white farmers, who succeed on them, while the Indians fail.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the owner operation of a farm is a quite complicated business. Many white men with a thousand years of experience fail to operate successfully. It requires foresight, fixity of purpose, business sense, capacity for management, certain scientific knowledge\u2014a combination of many things. It is almost impossible for one other than the exceptional aborigine. The development of the Indian into a farmer has largely failed and should cease to be the favorite theme of educationalists. The simplest method of self-support for an inexperienced and backward individual, the new policy should hold, is that of work for pay, preferably outside. The Indian's first step toward taking his place among the general population should be that of getting a simple job, doing it faithfully, and thereby gaining experience in the new manner of life. Securing this sort of work for him is the most practical step that can be taken toward his assimilation.\n\nIt is to the advantage of the Indians who remain on the reservation that their contact with their white neighbors be increased. Whatever possible, the reservations should be opened up in part to white settlers. White men should be mixed with the Indians. This would break down Indian isolation, give them an opportunity to absorb white civilization.\n\nThe experience of the Kiowa Indians, in Oklahoma, is a fine example of the result of such intermingling of the races. A generation ago lands were allotted to the Kiowas, who were unlettered red men, few of whom knew anything of English. Instead of allotting them lands which were in a solid block, they were given alternate tracts with white farms. The white settlers went about their farming, built their schools, carried on a normal community life. The Indian farmers observed their neighbors, came in contact with them, grew to imitate them, sent their children to the white...\nschools. Those children of the present generation are in no way members of a race apart. They are average members of the community.\n\nEven the Indians who grew up under the old order have come to live like white men now. A single generation has worked the miracle. Conditions approximating these would cause the dissolution of any of these reservations.\n\nMuch might be done for the aboriginal adults of the isolated reservations who are now living in idleness and poverty. The West is changing, which ought to be doing. During the past decade half a million Mexicans have crossed the line, seeking and finding work in the United States. More of them have come than there are Indians in all the United States. They have tended to congregate in such cities as Los Angeles and San Antonio, where new quids for the nation to digest. The excuse for allowing them to come in has been the need of them to perform rough labor yet needed by our national industry.\n\nTheir blood is little different from that of their cousins across the line. They have been brought into our country as a new problem while our own Indians have languished in idleness and want on their isolated reservations.\n\nProvision for securing employment for our own Indians should have resulted in their getting many of the jobs rather than those introduced by Mexico. It should have got them away from the reservations, given them an opportunity to learn, carried them far toward civilization. There are certain reservations which get money from the sale of timber. The White Mountain Apaches, in Arizona, for instance, the last of the wilder Indians, have been away from the reservation and have made as much as four hundred thousand dollars in a single year. It was said of them that they spent it all, but they did not go back to the reservation. The answer to this is that they gained an experience in handling money which will be of value when next they have opportunity to earn any.\n\nOff the Reservation\n\nThere is one employment activity of the Indians, however, that I would discourage. I do not believe that the reservation in shape manner is beneficial to them. The influences that surround circus life, for example, are likely to prove a rather serious test on the moral fiber of any such development. There have already been too many cases in which shows have been stranded and the Government has been called upon to take Indians who were a part of them back to their homes.\n\nEmployment will be found for the reservation Indians. It is in the interest of most of them that, when they get away from the reservations, they be encouraged to stay away. Gradually they would find themselves, establishing permanent homes among the general population, taking their places among the mass of us.\n\nThere are a few of the reservations on which the productive arts and industries have developed. The blanket weaving of the Navajos, the baskets and silver ornaments of the Pueblos, are typical of them. These should be encouraged to the utmost. They should be helped, particularly in marketing their output. The existence of these reservations is a few reservations, however, should not lead to the false impression that they offer a general opportunity to the Indians of the nations on all reservations. On many of the reservations there is little opportunity for the Indians to earn livelihoods through their native arts and industries.\n\nThe Right Sort of Help\n\nIn so far as is possible, there should be continued allotment of Indian lands with full ownership rights. Provision should be made for disposing of the surplus rights of absentee Indians. The advantages of contact with the whites develop when members of that race are allowed to enter the reservations. The timber should be distributed among the Indians. The Indians, whether they stay on the reservations or leave them, should be fully provided with their property rights. There are many ways in which this could be done. An Indian reservation, for example, might be created in which a valuable forest of spruce might be created which would own this timber. The Indians of the tribe would be stockholders in the corporation. It could be arranged to give the best possible returns from the timber. Members of the tribe, whether they stayed on the reservation or moved away, would receive what was due them. This would be better for them than that they should be bound to the reservation by property rights which they were forced to acquire if they wished to move.\n\nUnder these influences Indians would tend steadily to get away from the reservations. Those remaining in the order would graduate off. Those who remained on the reservations would have normal educations and would assume the roles of normal citizens. The government would then vanish. In a generation there would remain but a few small groups that would be different from the generality of the population. Indian administration virtually would have ceased to exist.\nShall We Send Our Indians to the Cities?\n\nJoseph A. Gschwend, S.J.\nEditor of Jesuit Missions.\n\nDuring the month of July, a Senate Investigation Committee has been at work on the Indian Reservations. The writer does not question the Committee's sincerity or hard work. However, not being endowed with an all-seeing eye and an all-comprehending mind such as enabled the Senate Committee to \"study\" the Indian situation in a vast territory of some 15,000 square miles in two or three days, the writer found that three weeks were scarcely sufficient to give him anything like a complete idea of the Indian problem on the Sioux Reservations of South Dakota.\n\nThe writer, long before his trip to South Dakota, had made something of a study of the American Indians. He had read up on the subject and had discussed the Indian and his problems and his mode of life with men who had given years to the work of evangelizing and civilizing the Red Man of the Dakota prairies. From these men he learned to know the Indian as he is in reality, in daily life at school, and off in his tent or tepee or log cabin or small house out on the plain. The men who had been burned brown by exposure in the cause of Indian welfare had not drawn their knowledge from beautiful illustrations that one may find in magazines or books, nor yet from heroic Indian figures that adorn our art galleries and museums, or are stamped on our coins.\n\nAfter many conversations held with old missionaries on the Reservation, and after personal observations made at the schools and among the Indians themselves, one feels rather convinced that the problem of training the Indian along lines of white civilization and industry is a slow and painful process. One understands, too, the danger involved in following out in practice the suggestion of certain poorly informed investigators, that the Indian should be sent into the city and made to shift for himself.\n\nThe Indian on the Reservation is only slowly emerging from the nomadic life of his ancestors. He has not yet entirely overcome his lazitude, his old-time aversion to strenuous work. Put him into competition with the white man of the city, and, most likely, it would be only a matter of weeks or months till the Red Man would find himself established for life in the slums of our cities. That he is not ready to compete with the white man in the latter's industries, is evident from the experience right out on the prairie where the white settler soon outstrips his Indian neighbor, and where even the well-trained Indian, who has been through some eastern school or other, soon lapses again into his old ways.\n\nHandicapped in this sphere, the Indian has yet another weakness which would make him a losing player in the game of life in our cities. That weakness is the Indian's ignorance of the value of money. He simply has not yet learned its value, and consequently still needs the guiding and helping hand of the Indian Agency and the missionary to teach him to provide for a rainy day.

Putman,\nSenior Inspector of Schools,\nOTTAWA,\nCANADA.\n\nDear Dr. Putman,\n\nI am taking the liberty of asking you to do me a favour.\n\nAt a Summer School to be held in this town in January, the main subject will be education of coloured races and I should like to refer to the Canadian method of educating the Indians. Will you kindly ask the proper officer of the Dominion Government to send me any relevant information in the form of regulations, reports, etc., which he can supply.\n\nI have read with much interest your very full and able report on the British Columbia Survey. I have done some survey work on a smaller scale since my return and an extension of the work is now under consideration. I shall send you some particulars of what has been done.\n\nFor some time, I have been Senior Inspector in charge of the Taranaki Education District which consists of the Taranaki Province and part of the Auckland Province.\n\nI still look back with unalloyed pleasure to the innumerable kindnesses received in Canada and to the very profitable experiences of many kinds (including my sojourn with you in Ottawa).\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Putman and yourself, and thanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. Belongie.\nJ. H. PUTMAN\nSENIOR INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nOttawa, Canada, Sept. 17th, 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing you a letter received from Mr. W. M. MacKenzie of New Plymouth, New Zealand. Perhaps you would be good enough to send him the material he asks for on Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. Putman\nSenior Inspector.\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDr. J. H. Putman has asked me to reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo. Enclosed you will find the last report of the Department of Indian Affairs. On page 11 is a brief recapitulation of Indian educational activity in Canada and tables showing the expenditure therefor. On page 52, there is a tabular statement, listing the day and residential schools, indicating their location and giving statistics concerning enrolment, average attendance, grades, etc. Provincial curricula are followed at all Indian schools and all are inspected by properly qualified officers.\n\nIndian educational work had its beginning in all parts of Canada in mission schools of one kind or another. Gradually, the Dominion has shouldered the burden and accepted the responsibility. At the present time, nearly one-third of the day schools on reserves are managed solely by the Department. This is also true of a few of the residential schools. In the main, however, church missionary societies and orders are associated with the Department in the work - all capital expenditure and approximately 90% of the current costs being provided by Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nN. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSenior Inspector of Schools,\nEducation Office,\nNew Plymouth,\nNew Zealand.\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Putman:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with enclosure from Mr. N. R. McKenzie, Senior Inspector of Schools at New Plymouth, New Zealand. I am informing him that his letter has been placed in my hands and I have given him the information requested, along with the Annual Report of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. J. H. Putman,\nSenior Inspector of Public Schools,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuring the year, 76 residential schools and 263 day schools were in operation, a total of 341 centres for Indian educational activity. The total enrolment was 15,247 and the average attendance 11,268. Ten years ago, there were a total of 322 Indian schools. Although the number of schools has shown but a normal increase, larger appropriations by Parliament since the War have enabled the Department to enlarge as well as reconstruct buildings and to supply better and more varied equipment. Higher salaries and grants have attracted better qualified teachers and instructors. It may be said, therefore, that larger appropriations have resulted in larger and better schools. Further, Indian communities have evinced more interest in their children's welfare. The following table shows the rapid increase in enrolment and attendance:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Day Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Total Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1918-19     | 4,640                         | 4,014              | 7,212                 | 3,587              | 11,952          | 7,601              | 63.59                   |\n| 1919-20     | 4,719                         | 4,133              | 7,477                 | 3,516              | 12,196          | 7,649              | 62.71                   |\n| 1920-21     | 4,783                         | 4,143              | 7,775                 | 3,931              | 12,558          | 8,074              | 64.29                   |\n| 1921-22     | 5,031                         | 4,360              | 7,990                 | 4,308              | 13,021          | 8,668              | 66.56                   |\n| 1922-23     | 5,347                         | 4,695              | 8,276                 | 4,411              | 13,723          | 9,106              | 66.35                   |\n| 1923-24     | 5,673                         | 4,856              | 8,199                 | 4,332              | 13,872          | 9,188              | 66.23                   |\n| 1924-25     | 6,031                         | 5,278              | 8,191                 | 4,601              | 14,222          | 9,879              | 69.46                   |\n| 1925-26     | 6,327                         | 5,658              | 8,455                 | 4,940              | 14,782          | 10,598             | 71.69                   |\n| 1926-27     | 6,641                         | 5,881              | 8,069                 | 4,660              | 14,710          | 10,541             | 71.66                   |\n| 1927-28     | 6,795                         | 6,043              | 8,223                 | 4,823              | 15,018          | 10,866             | 72.35                   |\n| 1928-29     | 7,075                         | 6,282              | 8,272                 | 4,976              | 15,347          | 11,258             | 73.35                   |\n\nIn ten years, enrolment has increased 28% and attendance, 48%. The percentage of attendance has increased approximately 10%. Not only are more children attending, but they are attending more regularly. This has had an interesting effect on the academic standing of pupils. In 1918-19, 878 Indian children were studying in Grade 5 and higher. Last year, 2228 were in the higher grades.\n\nAll this is very gratifying, but there is much to be desired yet as far as day school attendance is concerned. Every energy is being bent to make instruction at these schools attractive. Better qualified teachers, more interesting texts and teachers' aids, more playground and outdoor activities and better correlation with the Indian home environment are the\naims. In Part II of this report will be found a tabular statement, showing the location and indicating the enrolment at all Indian schools.\n\nCompared with the previous year, there was an increase of one residential school. New institutions were opened at St. Phillips, Sask., and Sioux Lookout, Ont. The first is under the management of the Oblate Fathers and the second is conducted by the Missionary Society of the Church of England. The Old Sun School in Alberta, was destroyed by fire and, at the time of this writing, is being rebuilt. During the year, three day schools were closed on account of poor attendance, and in three communities the Department is associated with a local school district in the conduct of new combined Indian and public schools.\n\nThe work at residential schools was particularly encouraging. The churches that are associated with the Department in the conduct of these institutions have been more careful in the selection of principals and other officers. As before, vocational training has been emphasized. Special funds are now available for this phase of the work in the province of British Columbia and all residential schools there are now well equipped for manual training and related instruction. In Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, emphasis is placed on farming, gardening and the care of stock. 7075 pupils were enrolled at residential schools during the year. Compare this with 4,640, the number maintained and trained in boarding schools ten years ago, and the increasing importance of this part of the Department's educational programme is apparent.\n\nThe cooperation of the churches in the management of these residential schools was as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Number of Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 42                            |\n| Church of England       | 20                            |\n| United Church           | 13                            |\n| Presbyterian Church     | 2                             |\n| **Total:**              | **78**                         |\n\nAll Indian schools were inspected frequently by officers of the Department. In addition, public and separate school inspectors visited all classrooms, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there were special Indian School Inspectors. More thorough inspection has resulted in a higher standard of instruction. Classroom activity in Indian schools is now comparable to the work in white schools of the same localities. It is the practice at Indian schools to follow provincial curricula and to engage fully qualified teachers.\n\nThe health of Indian children studying in boarding schools has been given special attention. Medical and dental supervision and treatment have been arranged. Travelling nurses spent part of their time at these institutions. There was considerable expenditure for the removal of adenoids and\nDiseased tonsils and for the correction of defective vision. There has been a special effort during the year to vaccinate every Indian school pupil. Improvements have been made in the children's diet and in the playground activities. Milk herds have been tested and special attention has been given to water supply and sewage disposal systems.\n\nNew main buildings were commenced during the year at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, near Kenora, Ont., and the Alert Bay Institution, in British Columbia. In addition, the Department secured a suitable farm and building site and commenced the erection of the necessary buildings for a large boarding school at Shubenacadie, N. S. This last named institution will provide an academic and vocational training as well as maintenance for orphans and other neglected Indian children in the Maritime Provinces. The boys' wing at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in British Columbia, was completed during the year. At nine day schools, new classrooms or teacher's residences were erected.\n\nOne hundred and sixty graduates of Indian schools, who showed academic promise, received grants for the purpose of continuing their studies at high schools, universities and business colleges. The policy is to make grants to the most promising, physically fit graduates of our own schools. If church and department representatives consider a graduate worthy, a grant is allowed when the bona fide intention of the pupil is evident and provided proper supervision can be secured for the period of advanced study. These tuition grants are continued only when satisfactory reports are received. Last year, besides those taking advanced work, there were approximately 225 Indian children attending white schools and orphanages. All these are in addition to the enrolment at Indian schools as shown in the tabular statements. The expenditure from parliamentary appropriation on behalf of these special students amounted to $39,000 during the year. The practice of assisting selected ex-pupils of residential schools to start farming and housekeeping has been continued.\n\nIn the past, the funds of certain Indian bands have been used to meet some of the costs of conducting day schools on their reserves. The year under review is the first that all expenditure for education has been provided by Parliamentary Appropriation. The programme of free education is now extended to all Indians in Canada. The expenditure for Indian education for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1929, amounted to $2,215,411.98, as follows:-\n| Province          | Residential Schools | Special Ex-pupils | Tuition & Travel | Freight Express | Stationery | Miscellaneous | Total |\n|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------|\n| Nova Scotia      | 12,866.25          | 130,465.46        |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Prince Edward Island | 1,161.03         |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| New Brunswick    | 15,535.09          |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Quebec           | 80,239.70          |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Ontario          | 118,805.90         |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Manitoba         | 67,614.89          |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Saskatchewan     | 45,159.97          |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Alberta          | 837.52             |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Northwest Territory | 1,933.00         |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| British Columbia | 59,877.22          |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n| Yukon            | 2,733.65           |                   |                 |                |            |               |       |\n\nTotal: 409,706.62\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you kindly send me any information you may have regarding the Indian schools of Canada. Are there any such schools entirely under the control of the government? We have been informed there is a blue book giving very definite information regarding education, so will you kindly forward.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. H.J. Macdonald\nBlack Diamond\nAlberta.\nOttawa, October 4, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting information regarding Indian schools and also a copy of the last annual report of this Department.\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding you a copy of the last annual report. Pages 11-14 give a brief recapitulation of Indian educational activity in Canada and tables showing the expenditure therefor.

Believing that you can supply him with much better information than I can I am sending it on to you with the request that you give him the information he requests.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 24, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ont., who is newly appointed to Indian work, has forwarded your letter of the 12th ultimo, with the request that I answer it. On the 19th ultimo, I wrote to you, briefly indicating the nature of Indian educational activity in Canada. You now ask regarding the character of the educational work of a residential school and of the reserve schools.\n\nIndian residential schools are for the Indian child who is underprivileged from an educational standpoint, i.e., no school close to his home, orphan or neglected. The activity at a residential school is both academic and vocational. Girls are taught the domestic arts, practical nursing, etc., and boys are prepared for whatever vocations are common on their particular reserves. All older pupils spend half of each day in one of the vocational departments and the other half in a classroom. The academic work is as prescribed for white schools by the Provincial Departments of Education. In certain parts of Canada, where the Indian lives by the chase, his habits are too nomadic for the operation of day schools on reserves. In these localities, the residential school is the main factor in the programme of the Department and of the churches that are associated.\n\nThe Indian day schools on reserves are comparable in every way to the ordinary rural school. Provincial courses of study are followed, emphasis being placed on agriculture and manual training. An effort is made to correlate classroom activity with home life on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nN. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSenior Inspector of Schools,\nEducation Office,\nNew Plymouth,\nNew Zealand.\nOttawa, October 29, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, concerning literature on the North American Indian. I regret that there is nothing available that would suit your purposes. There are many publications on the market which would be of more value to you than the Department's Annual Report.\n\nThe educational functions of this Department are confined to the training and schooling of Indians. We have no literature to aid in the teaching of white children. The Department could send you the Annual Report, which shows our activities among our wards; but this is not what you require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Any literature would also be much appreciated.\n\n\"What is the status of Indian day schools? Formerly, they were entirely under the control of the Indian Department and financed from Indian money - now, however, the Government has taken over all costs. Does that affect the schools? Are they part of the Provincial system? Who \"hires and fires\" the teachers? Has the County School Inspector any real authority over them, or is he only an advisor? What qualifications are necessary to secure positions as teachers? For how long do they sign up?\"\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Chas.) A. Smith\nOttawa, December 2, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to Indian day schools. For many years, they have been controlled by the Department of Indian Affairs and there has not been any change in their status. In certain localities, one or other of the churches is associated with the Department in the management. For the most part, parliamentary appropriation has provided the funds necessary for the conduct of Indian day schools\u2014a few of them having been financed, either wholly or in part, by the funds of the Indian band.\n\nIndian day schools are not part of the provincial system; but, at our request, they are visited by the provincial public and separate school inspectors. Teachers are engaged or dismissed by the Department of Indian Affairs, but they are expected to follow the advice of the provincial inspectors.\n\nTeachers are generally engaged for the academic year and the qualifications we require are similar to those necessary for ordinary rural schools. If you\u2014or any other\u2014are interested in an Indian school as from January 6th, next, the Department would be glad to have an application. There are one or two interesting vacancies at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Alethea G.

Some Stations Reached Only Once or Twice a Year\n\nBy WILLIAM HAMILTON\nActing Chief Alaska Division, Bureau of Education\n\nThe story of relief work carried on during the summer months on the coast of Labrador has crowded many lecture halls and has deservedly drawn from the benevolently disposed thousands of dollars toward its support. Few people realize that in Alaska, more remote and inaccessible, the Bureau of Education is carrying on, all the year round, a far greater work in behalf of the aboriginal races of that northern Territory.\n\nFor the native Alaskan the Bureau of Education provides teachers, physicians, and nurses\u2014trained workers who have at heart the welfare of their charges. It maintains schools, hospitals, and orphanages, relieves destitution, trades, organizes cooperative business enterprises, establishes colonies, and controls the reindeer industry.\n\nTo Overcome Distances the Greatest Problem\n\nThe work is of vast extent, and it is carried on under great difficulties arising principally from the remoteness of most of the villages, the enormous distances between them, the meager means of communication, and the severity of the climate. The 27,000 natives are scattered along thousands of miles of coast and on the great rivers in villages ranging from 30 souls to 200 or 400 persons. The work would extend to the utmost limits of the United States in terms of distance with schools in Maine, California, Georgia, and Minnesota. One of the school districts is twice the size of the State of Illinois. Many of the settlements in which the bureau's work is located are far beyond the limits of regular transportation and mail service. Some of the villages on remote islands or beside the frozen ocean are brought into touch with the outside world only once or twice a year, when they are visited by the United States Coast Guard steamer on its annual cruise or by the supply vessel sent by the Bureau of Education. During eight months of the year all of the native villages in Alaska, with the exception of those near the coast and a few near the Alaska Railroad, are reached only by trails over the snow-covered land or frozen rivers.\n\nOne of the greatest problems has been the securing of transportation of appointees and supplies from Seattle to the remotest settlements. In compliance with the requests for a vessel suitable for use by the bureau in its Alaskan work, the Navy Department transferred to the Interior Department the U.S.S. Bozer, a wooden vessel, with a carrying capacity of 500 tons, formerly used as a training ship for naval cadets. During the season of 1916 the Bozer made two voyages, the first to the Bering Sea region and the second to points on the shore of the Arctic Ocean as far as Point Barrow. On its southern voyage she took teachers whose terms of service had expired and carried from northern Alaska reindeer meat which Eskimo herders wished to sell in the States. During the winter months she was used in the work of southeastern Alaska as a school of navigation and seamanship for young native men.\n\nIn the Alaskan native community the school is the center of all social, industrial, and civic life. The teacher is guide, leader, and everything else the community may demand. To be \"teacher\" in the narrow schoolroom sense is the least of the teacher's duties.\nSchool Savings Successful In Small Community\n\nThat the school savings system works as well in small communities as in the cities is demonstrated by the schools of Gilbert, Minn. Within 10 weeks from the day the first savings were deposited, $1,950 out of the 2,066 pupils enrolled opened school accounts.\n\nDetail work of the system within the schools is in charge of W. A. Pike, head of the commercial department. Within two months more he expects that every child will have his book open. Weekly and monthly reports showing the percentage standings of all the rooms are sent to every room in the district. It has been provided that as soon as every pupil in a school opens an account, the entire school gets a holiday.\n\nMexican Indians Surrender Homes to Establish Schools\n\nThe Department of Education, Mexico, is sending as many rural teachers as possible to the State of Chihuahua to meet the call for education among the Tarahumara Indians, according to the Bulletin of the Pacific School Union. These Indians formerly fled to the mountains at the sight of a white man, but were won over through an educational campaign conducted by the Mexican Government.\n\nSo strong was the Indian's conviction that one of them offered his hut as the first \"People's House,\" leaving only a tree as shelter for himself and his family. Six other Tarahumaras followed his example. These \"people's houses\" are made centers of activity against drunkenness and other vices.\n\nPrompt Action Demanded of School Nurses\n\nForeign Bodies in the Eye Frequently Cause Trouble. Bites of Insects and Minor Injuries Require Attention\n\nBy ELLA D. FLEMING\nJunior Specialist in School Hygiene, Bureau of Education\n\nIn the course of the school nurse's duty she often will be called upon to give a child medical treatment; but emergencies often call forth her ability to do small things quickly and adeptly.\n\nSome of the most frequent ones are:\n\nRemoving a foreign body from the eye, irrigating a child's ear, care of a fainted child, treating insect bites.\n\nRemoving a foreign body from the eye may be accomplished by drawing the upper lid down over the eye, and causing the child to blow the nose forward at the same time. If the particle is under the upper lid, instruct the child to look down and inward, turn the lid back over a small pencil or match, and with the corner of a clean handkerchief or cloth, wipe off the inside of the lid. If the particle is under the lower lid, draw the lid down against the cheekbone and instruct the child to look up. If the body is imbedded in the eye-ball, do not touch it but have an oculist see the eye at once.\n\nSuggestions of Practical Methods\n\nIn irrigating a child's ear when the doctor wishes it done and for any reason it can not be done at home, lay the child down, draw the tip of the ear upward and backward, and syringe the ear gently with warm water. Be very careful not to poke into the ear or direct the stream of solution forcibly against the drum of the ear.\n\nIf a child has fainted, lower his head, give him fresh air in abundance and apply cold compresses to his head and chest. An attack may be averted by having a child rest on his hands and knees.\n\nFor an insect bite such as from a bee or wasp, soak the area affected in a solution of ammonia or baking-soda.\n\nTo Emphasize Local History\n\n\"A museum in every high school\" is a new slogan in Kansas. Local history and the botany and geology of the respective localities are the subjects to be emphasized. The collections are to be made by the pupils to stimulate interest in their studies. Many high schools have found value.\nJ.M.

Another important reason for any increase in population in various Indian communities is the better sanitation and medical supervision on reserves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Gladys Quanbury,\nR. R. #3,\nSimcoe, Ont.\n97 Craighurst St.\nToronto, Ont.\n14th March 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Evans,\n\nIn my travels among the schools for Indian children both of the day and residential types I have found that very seldom does a teacher sign the register. It is true that there is no placed marks on the school registers which would indicate that teachers are expected to sign.\n\nMay I suggest that this matter receive some consideration. I think it would be a great improvement if on every school register the teacher's name appeared once in three months. In none case I looked over registers covering more than thirty years there was nothing to indicate who had presided over that class room except in one year.\n\nThis suggestion is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours faithfully,\nArthur Warner\nOttawa, March 17, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the advisability of having a place for the teacher's signature on the classroom register used in Indian schools.

Arthur Barner,\n97 Craighurst Ave.,\nToronto 12, Ont.\nAugust 1929.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nEducating Our Indians Is An Important Task\n\nNew School In The Maritimes\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nConducts Day and Residential Schools Throughout Canada.\n\nOne of the very important functions of the Department of Indian Affairs is the providing of educational facilities for Indian children throughout the Dominion. Day schools are conducted on reserves in every province and where conditions necessitate it, residential schools are also operate. In order to provide academic instruction and vocational training for those Indian children in the Maritime Provinces whose needs are not met by the twenty-two day schools conducted in that part of Canada by the Department, a residential school has been erected at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. There are six such institutions in the vicinity of the Great Lakes in Ontario and many in Western Canada but the one lately erected at Shubenacadie is the only one in the Maritimes.\n\nThe new school, which will house 125 pupils and the necessary teaching staff and provide accommodation for class-room and domestic instruction will be opened about the middle of September. In due time there will be erected barns, workshops, and the other equipment necessary for the vocational courses.\n\nOf the day schools conduct by the Department of Indian Affairs in the Maritime Provinces, eleven are located on reserves in Nova Scotia, ten in New Brunswick, and one on Prince Edward Island. These schools solve the ordinary problem of educating the children residing in close proximity to the schools. There remains the necessity of providing for orphans, neglected children, and those who live too far from the day schools to be regular attendants. It is for these under-privileged children that the residential school has been established.\n\nFrom the establishment of the first industrial school nearly one hundred years ago, there has been cooperation between the Dominion Government and the various religious denominations interested in missionary work among the Indians. In following this well-established policy the Shubenacadie school will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church as the Indian bands in the Maritimes are all adherents of that faith.\n\nRev. Father J. P. MacKey has been appointed principal and is now installed in the school. Under the Department's direction he will have general charge of the institution. The Sisters of Charity, who will conduct the domestic and classroom activities, will move into their quarters about the middle of August. The teachers and other instructors will be fully qualified and educational activities will be academic and vocational. The class-room work will be comparable to that in the public schools of the province. At the Department's request the school will be inspected by officers of the Provincial Department of Education. The vocational training will include for the girls, domestic science; and for the boys, farming, gardening, care of stock and possibly manual training, thus placing graduates from this school in a position to become self-supporting and independent.\nTo the Honourable Charles Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nThe courtesy and condescension with which you have answered my letter with regards to my apprehension over our mineral claims, gives me great confidence that again the present will receive your high and kind attention. I was too timid about disturbing Your Honour with my bringing to you my great gratitude, knowing how precious and limited is the time of a gentleman of so high a position.\n\nAs the Secretary of our School Commission received, some time ago, a letter from your Department, asking him if he was handling the Bulletin \"Natural Resources,\" I had thought of sending some of my pupils' copy. I have always received it regularly and greatly appreciated it; it is so interesting and gets us, pupils and teacher acquainted with the wealth and progress of our Country. We are very thankful to the Department of the Interior.

Otherwise, the average Indian child, handicapped by the lack of finance is not prepared to further his academic education, and thus have a tendency to revert to his tribal custom of living.\n\nFurther, too, the domestic duties performed by these pupils as part of their studies, is a monetary saving worth considering in the upkeep of these institutions.\n\nMrs. John D.

In reply I have to state that the various votes in our Main Estimates - which have been approved by the Government - total $6,067,065. A Supplementary Estimate of over $400,000 is being requested also. The appropriations have not yet been made by Parliament. At the present time, the Department is using the Interim Supply. There is an annual statutory provision for an additional $234,000 from public funds and a further $218,000 will be voted for the salaries and expenses of the Headquarters staff. You will note that nearly $6,000,000 of public funds will be voted by Parliament and will be used this year on behalf of the Indians of Canada.\n\nThe following is an approximate division of this amount:\n\n- Annuities and other payments - $285,000.\n- Relief - $600,000.\n- Medical - $975,000.\n- Encouraging Agriculture - $145,000.\n- Education - $2,650,000.\n- Public works - $178,000.\n- Miscellaneous - $295,000.\n- Outside service and expenses - $790,000.\n\nWhereas Parliament has not given final approval for these expenditures, it would be inadvisable for you to give these figures to anyone as official; but there is no reason why you cannot give the information in addresses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

MacLean, Esq.,\nChief of Education Statistics,\nDominion Bureau of Statistics,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuring the past 9 years, definite efforts have been made to improve and expand the educational activity among the youth of our Indian wards. The present Superintendent General of Indian Affairs has taken a lively interest in this work and has asked Parliament for larger appropriations, so that improvements could be made in the Indian school service. Buildings have been reconstructed or enlarged and better and more varied equipment has been supplied. Higher salaries and grants have attracted better qualified teachers and instructors.\n\nIn connection with residential schools, which are a very important factor in the programme, 27 new main buildings have been erected or are now under construction.\n\nSince 1921, the number of Indian schools has not materially increased. Added accommodation and better and more attractive instruction have contributed largely to the remarkable increase in enrolment and attendance. The enrolment has increased from 12,558 in 1921 to 15,347 last year. During the same period, the average daily attendance has increased from 8,074 to 11,258. Not only are more children attending, but they are attending more regularly. This has had an interesting effect on the academic standing of the older pupils. Nine years ago, 929 Indian children were in Grade 5 or higher. Last year, 2,228 were in the higher grades.\n\nThe cost of educating Indian children in some parts of Canada was definitely imposed on the Federal Government by treaties. Elsewhere, the State had accepted this obligation. However, up to last year, certain bands in Ontario and Quebec still paid from their own funds part of the expenses of conducting their schools. The Government has now extended the system of free education so as to include all Indian children.\nSpecial efforts have been made to extend and improve the vocational training in residential schools. Larger grants to the churches that are associated with the Department in the conduct of these institutions have made this possible. Departmental officers make frequent inspections, with a view to preparing the Indian boys and girls for lives of economic independence after graduation.\n\nThe curricula and textbooks at Indian schools have been made to conform to the standards of the various provinces. The inspection of Indian schools by the provincial public and separate school inspectors has been extended to the three prairie provinces. Wherever this arrangement is possible, classroom instructors in Indian schools benefit greatly by the constructive criticism of men who are familiar with the best pedagogical methods in use in white schools.\nAn Indian Training Ground\n\nThe following letter is from Rev. W. A. Hendry, Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The work of the school throughout the year has been carried on in all its branches. The attendance, as usual, has been equal to the capacity of the plant. For the last ten years more children have wished to enter than we could accommodate. The parents realize that the school serves a purpose which seems to bring something worth while to them and they want their children to take advantage of it.\n\nThe farm, on which we look for good things always and consider our greatest asset as a training ground for the future of the school, was all but a failure this past harvest of the lack of rain. We had only four hours' rain in this district from spring until fall. No matter how it looked as though it would rain it did not seem to be able to rain, and many crops were sown twice, but all alike were burned up.\n\nOur chief source of supply is the Long Flat Reserve which is sixteen miles to the west of the school. More than half of our pupils come from this reserve. The Indians of the Sioux village are being moved to it, which will make it the largest reserve in southern Manitoba.\n\nIn many ways great progress has been achieved with the Indians in the three prairie provinces during the last forty years. There are few Indians today who cannot speak the English language and more than half the population in the prairie provinces have been through the day or residential school. They know how to read and many of them have received an excellent training in agriculture in some one of the residential schools, and others have worked for many years with the farmers of the plains. They have received very generous and sympathetic help from the government in the way of support and guidance through the aid of a farm instructor, and they have good land free from taxation of any kind. The Indian is not lacking in knowledge as to how to proceed to farm, but, unless they do so by their own initiative and assume responsibility, they will never learn what it means to stand on their own feet. The task from now on, for a while at least, is a difficult one, as it requires a thorough knowledge of the problem, and an education of a practical kind that requires tact, patience, and perhaps a little audacity to perform the work of transferring the load on to the Indian himself.\n\nIf we continue giving to him, ever giving, we may be working toward an ever-fading objective, and at the same time wasting in the Indians what is often called \"the latent energy.\" On the other hand, if he is taught to stand on his own feet, he will be inspired to construct on his own characteristics and to develop his own leadership. It will tend to help him to work out himself his programmes of education, health, economics and community welfare. In the final analysis the only permanent foundation for progress must come from within the Indian himself.\n\n[Signature]\n(United Church)\nJune 30\nIndians and I should like, if funds were available, to widen the work even further, to give technical education to these young boys in trades after they secure, as they do, a good common school education in their own schools in every province. But this will require more money. Years ago we have not vote more money. Since fur has become so valuable in this country and the white man has become active in trapping animals and securing their furs, it has been much more difficult for the Indians to obtain livelihoods. For that reason we have to spend more money on them, for relief, for medical attention and for what, undoubtedly, the country and government owes them. I believe we are now spending enough money upon the Indians, but I realize one must keep within reason in asking for the necessary funds to carry on this work. We must be careful to spend our money in giving the Indians better medical attention in the future than we have done in the past and I make no apology for asking these sums of money for Indian welfare in Canada.\n\nMr. SIMPSON: Can the minister give any information as to the intention of the government with respect to the erection of a new building to replace the old Shingwauk Home building?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I am sorry my reply is not with me at this moment, but I may say that we are as quickly as possible replacing old buildings with new and modern ones, and erecting new buildings where they seem to be required for Indian educational work. My deputy will be here in a few minutes.\n\nMr. SIMPSON: They are carrying on at present in a building that has been in existence for a period of upwards of fifty years. It is not modern at all.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I have it in mind, I cannot say whether it is in the program for this year or not.\n\nMr. MANION: I would like to refer to the question of the fire extending from the Indian reserve at Fort William into the park. The minister is quite right in saying that it is some time since I put them on record in a letter to him. The minister's deputy takes the attitude that the parks board, who asked for assistance in putting out the fire has not a just claim inasmuch as the Indian department, although admitting that the fire started on the reserve, contend that they have already spent, I think, some $3,500 in assisting the Indians in fire protection. I am informed that $3,500 was spent on an absolute necessity in the shape of fire protection which should have been put in long before, and it has been put in so far as past action is concerned. I wish, without delaying the committee at all, to impress upon the minister once again what I have done in private and by public speech, that I believe the parks board, which has had a very difficult time getting along and which has suffered because of the extension into their park from the Indian reserve, should be given consideration by the minister and some assistance towards at least the expenditure made by them for the upkeep of the forest-fire service. I submit it is only a matter of about $700\u2014should be given by the department of Indian Affairs, in spite of what my good friend the deputy minister says in regard to the parks board, that the minister will look into this once again and endeavour to see that the parks board receive this assistance. It can be done without delaying the matter in the meantime and without any special vote. I presume there are in the Indian department as in other departments voted out of the budget sum of about $800 could be taken. I am not speaking for what little political effect this might have; I am speaking very seriously because I think the parks board has a just claim and I hope he will see they are given some assistance in regard to the matter.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I am familiar with the report the hon. member has brought up. It is one upon which we have not reached decision. I have had inquiry made and I may say the report is not particularly favourable, but I think my good friend is correct in saying there must be some claim and I will look into the matter again.\n\nMr. MANION: I think in this case the minister's deputy is a little too economical for the department and he should let down the votes in justice to the parks board of Fort William.\n\nMr. BENNETT: I should like to say a few words about this item. Last year taken for granted, I believe, the minister voted a degree point out to the minister that during the last few months, in fact during the last year, I have received very serious complaints regarding the administration of the Indian department in western Canada. The fault does not rest with the officer immediately in charge. Political patronage has played a large part in the matter, in which the deputy head is wholly without authority. For instance there\nhave been cases of machinery bought merely for the purpose of providing business for friends and which lies outdoors unused. In one instance a man employed on a farm instructed to the Indians an undischarged bankrupt, and in another case a man who is addicted to the use of liquor to too large an extent was put in a position of authority with the result that at times he gets under the weather with injurious consequences to the Indians.\n\nThere is a vast sum of money being expended for the Indians, and this talk of the minister about his desire to help these wards of the nation would somehow bring me to give some little expression to that sentiment in concrete form in a proper expenditure of the money voted for the purpose, and with less exercise of political patronage on the part of appointments to the Civil Service Commission, which makes appointments in some cases should make them in all. It is not simply one case but six or three cases in particular. Why is it that the rear relations of a member of parliament is taken from Portage la Prairie and put on a reserve? Did the Civil Service Commission approve of it?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Yes.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Under what circumstances?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I cannot tell my hon. friend.\n\nMr. BENNETT: I think the minister could be he took the trouble to. The people in that locality at all events think so. In one instance the Indians were moved off one reserve\u2014\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Where was that?\n\nMr. BENNETT: Not far from Portage, and they are supposed to have removed to other places. I do not know whether they have been or not. This is the report that was made by a gentleman who went through the country, not with any political bias at all, but with the one object of seeing how the aborigines were treated. He inquired why farm machinery should be left lying around unused, and why the power for farming purposes unused. He also saw this reserve that I mention. In fairness to all concerned I am leaving out the names of the particular individuals, the matter having been an opportunity to investigate these matters, lest it be said that injury is being done to any particular person.\n\nSome years ago the idea was started that the Indians were raising very large crops. For instance, in my own province of Alberta there were the exigencies of\u2014shall I say?\u2014the demands of friends, the reserves should be leased near Medicine; then reserves were created; then the sale of the lands of a reserve east of Calgary; and when you go into Saskatchewan you find difficulties of the same sort, especially in the northern parts of the province, and still in Manitoba. The result is that although it is said that the Indians are producing large quantities of grain, in the main it will be found that we are not getting the increase they should for the moneys that are expended, and part of the moneys we are expending belong to the Indians. There is a vast sum of this money that belongs to the Indians; for when lands are sold which the Indians own the proceeds from the sale of these lands goes into a trust fund, and the income therefrom is available for the maintenance of the Indians.\n\nI have referred to three reserves in Alberta. I refer to a reserve in Saskatchewan. There is also a reserve in Manitoba called Long Plain reserve, which I mentioned a little while ago. The Indians I referred to are the Indians who were removed from Portage to the Long Plain reserve. I do not go into the numbers in detail, but I think it is sufficient for my purpose to indicate them lest it be said that we have approved of this vast expenditure; and I say again, though it may be small in itself, it is a relatively small sum of money, actually it is a very substantial sum. You have $2,500,000 out of $5,000,000 being used for Indian education, including the construction of schools, buildings which would be desirable, if not now, that we should have a complete statement from the minister as to just what work is being done and what the results are. Possibly the hearers of the ear of the nation would be ready for something to go into the matter in detail, but I should like the minister to know that there are those deeply interested in these questions who are steadily watching them from outside observation and they believe that the results obtained are not all in keeping with what could be secured from the expenditures made. A tendency is manifesting itself to expend money on the purchase of facilities for farming which are not used for farming, with resultant idleness on the part of the Indians. The question of the Indians in this direction is well known to all\u2014with the unfortunate result that instead of the Indian becoming more self-respecting he becomes more dependent on the government as they do very excellent areas of land of high agricultural value, we know that there are not wanting those who are always endeavouring to see that these lands are sold.\nand purchased by someone else. The minister has had a good deal of experience in that regard in various sections of the country. He knows the means that are taken to have the Indians made to believe that it is desirable for them to sell and that they do not find their resources gone and the lands sold; the result is that you have a worse condition than you had before. The minister knows the difficulties which sometimes have been pointed out in connection therewith, I fancy many others besides myself.\n\nWithout taking the minister's time or the time of the committee we go into a great deal of detail which I have under my hand, and which I had expected would be useful at this session of the house, representing accumulated detail extending over several years. I do suggest, however, that whatever little time he may have at his disposal for Indian affairs might be utilized in having the closest possible inspection made of the farms now in the hands of the Indians, and the inspectors' reports. Unfortunately I have seen some of them and have checked them up. I know the difficulties in connection with farm instructors and the difficulties and difficulties which the minister has to experience with those who think that they are fitted by a kindly Providence better to discharge the duties of farming among the Indians than Indians than any other people in the world. But if we are to get some value for the money that we are expending and make the Indians as well as possible self-supporting, more self-reliant and less dependent and improve his position in the community by encouraging him to engage in agricultural pursuits and the raising of crops, done at one time in connection with two reserves in Alberta, we shall have to adopt different means from those which are now in vogue.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is an opportunity to which attention I attach a great deal of importance is strongly of the opinion that there has been a steady deterioration in recent years in the management of the affairs of the reserves. That is not wholly attributable to my hon. friend's administration, of course, but it is attributable to causes which the government might, it seems to me, by very strong action prevent. I confine myself with pointing out these matters, without taking time to read a vast quantity of evidence which I have dealing with the subject, if the minister to ensure that he shall I say?\u2014observation and action on the ground, and not departmental action from Ottawa, that better results are obtained for the money expended than those which we have heretofore realized; for some of the education that we have given the Indians has only resulted in the poor unfortunate becoming the easier the victim of the tendencies of modern civilization. I think the minister knows what I refer to in that respect. Despite all efforts that are made to prevent the Indian becoming the victim of the drink, very often his improved education has the effect readily made him a victim of alcohol. I see nothing wrong. All these things are matters that I regard as of great importance from the standpoint of the treatment of our aborigine, and I earnestly hope that steps will be taken to improve the conditions I have mentioned.\n\nMr. STIKWART (Edmonton): There are reserves in western Canada\u2014I presume my hon. friend is peaking of those reserves\u2014where the Indians are left out of doors. But that is the case on almost every farm in western Canada. On the whole I think we have more facilities on the Indian reserve for securing implements and tools than will be found on ordinary farms in any given locality in the western country. As fast as we can get money\u2014because after all it is a question of money\u2014behind us providing facilities for covering these implements at or near the agent's quarters on the reserve. The appointment of agents is made by the Civil Service Commission, usually after a competitive examination.\n\nMr. BENNETT: It was not agents that I mentioned.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Farm instructors are appointed by the commissioner at Regina. The hon. member refers to him, forgetting that Mr. Edwards, who, he says, was an undischarged bankrupt when he received his appointment. I did not know anything about that at the time. After the period of probation he did not prove to have the necessary qualifications for the work and he is no longer in the employ of the department. My hon. friend says that the Indians are making no improvement in the way of farming. May I direct his attention to the Blood reserve at Macleod? They had well over one hundred thousand bushels of grain on that reserve last year. The Indians on the Blackfoot reserve are also making progress. As to the sale of Indian land, I agree with everything that hon. member said. Usually the reserve covers the best land in any given locality, and there is a desire on the part of the people who surround it to secure that land and they try every means in their power to get possession. The Blackfoot reserve was sold long before I became Superintendent...\nGeneral of Indian Affairs, and we have had a good deal of trouble in getting collections of the money from the Indians, but we have succeeded in strengthening out the difficulty. It is not the policy of the department to sell any land required now or that may be required in the future in the province of western Canada if it can be utilized by them for grazing, agriculture or any other purpose.\n\nWith respect to the education of the Indians, when I took charge of the department I found the various churches of the country, the Roman Catholic under the Oblate Fathers, the Anglicans, the Presbyterians, the Methodists\u2014of course the Anglicans and the Catholics were engaged in missionary work to a much greater extent than the Presbyterians and the Methodists\u2014I found that these churches had constructed buildings and had become responsible for the maintenance of the Indians in their institutions, and they were levying upon their adherents to secure money necessary to carry on their educational work. These churches had gone into the country in missionary spirit to educate and christianize the young Indians, and I did not think it was fair to have them carrying that heavy financial burden. Therefore I immediately took steps to purchase from them the institutions that were considered to be useful for a number of years to come and to replace as far as possible the structures that had fallen into disrepair. The Roman Catholic churches carried on their work under much better conditions than they did when I became minister of the department.\n\nWith 105,000 Indians scattered over the Dominion from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and away up in the Arctic, it would seem strange if some of our officers did not go wrong once in a while. But may I say to the hon. leader of the opposition that I will not tolerate an officer on an Indian reserve who has anything to do with liquor\u2014and I am not a prohibitionist.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Hear, hear.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): That is one very strong resolution I have made in this regard, and I intend to carry it out. So far as I know, we try to keep the staff engaged in Indian affairs as honest as possible. I do not say that we will not have difficulties now and again; anyone who has to administer this department is bound to have difficulties, but I say we are making progress, and I think perhaps I should be glad to inform the house of the lines along which we are making splendid progress in Indian affairs.\n\n[Mr. C. A. Stewart.]\n\nMr. BRADY: I want to bring home to the Minister of the Interior a few facts that are vital in connection with this question. I will admit, without hesitation, that the money we are spending on the education of Indians in Canada has not resulted in making the Indians of our country educated. No hon. member of this house who has studied the Indian problem can dare tell me that beneficial results have accrued from this large expenditure. If we compare the condition of the Indians in Canada with that of the Maoris in New Zealand, we find a striking contrast. The Maoris in New Zealand have entered almost every branch of life you can even find them in the legislative halls of that dominion. Unfortunately we cannot point to a similar advance among the Indians in our own country. I say that the minister has honestly endeavored to the best of his ability to solve the problem of educating the Indian, but he has not succeeded. The Indian on the reserve is given tools with the most valuable land in the country at his disposal, is not doing for himself what he should do when we take into account what happens to his education? What is the position of the Indians today? I grant that the Indian schools are doing good work? There is the Coqualeetza school, the school at Fort Simpson, Athabasca Telegraph Station, and Whitehorse Island school, all are doing very good work. We must admit that they are not solving the problem of getting the full value of these 105,000 Indians who have been taken from their natural habitat in our modern methods, and to whom we are trying to give a modern education. We have succeeded only in giving them a veneer of education, and we have not brought the education of those Indians to its legitimate end. In their education I suggest that we should strive to teach those Indian children to be part of the modern life in which they find themselves. Are the Indian schools doing that? I desire that when we spend so much money on Indian education we shall see to it that the Indians shall have good teachers, and teachers who are well paid. Furthermore those children should be taught technical work in which pursuit the Indian is an expert.\n\nWithout taking more time of the committee I wish to say that by instinct the Indians are very artistic. We in this house would do well to take note of the work they have done with wood carving in western Canada; they are efficient in painting and basket weaving. What have we done to fit the Indian for the vocation to which he is entitled? We\nshould direct our attention to the study of the Indians. We have more Indians than we are doing today and I hope that during the coming year a great and concerted effort will be made to make those Indians part and parcel of our modern civilization a part which they do not hold at the present time.\n\nMr. KEDDLE: I have a long letter concerning the dismissal without notice of Mr. W. Edwards. Is the minister in a position to make a statement as to why this man was dismissed?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I believe my department received a letter from my hon. friend. I made inquiries, and as a result I find that there statements were made to the effect that there was an undischarged bankrupt. The claim was made that the Indians owed him money, which claim I believe has been satisfied. The principal however was that the man was not fit and capable to carry out his duties, and for that reason was not employed longer.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nProgress reported.\n\nBUSINESS OF THE HOUSE\n\nSITTING THIS DAY AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK\u2014\n\nSITTING ON ASCENSION DAY\n\nRight Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING (Prime Minister): I wish to move that this house do not adjourn at eleven o'clock to night.\n\nMr. BENNETT: We should have a definite statement as to when the house will rise. We had difficulty on one occasion in connection with that matter and it is better to have a definite statement at the place of eleven o'clock rather than to proceed immediately and then have difficulty.\n\nMr. MACKENZIE KING: My hon. friend and other members of the house are no doubt aware of the importance of Ascension day, and that in the past it has not been customary for this house to sit on that day. It has not been customary either for the last May As it has been sitting since that day and are now doing our utmost to get through with the business of parliament as rapidly as possible. It might be convenient if all of us were present only for two sittings tomorrow instead of three as we are doing at present. In that way we would leave the morning free to meet at some afternoon. If that is agreeable, I would suggest that it might be advisable to meet at the hour of two o'clock in the afternoon instead of at three o'clock.\n\nIn regard to this evening, I imagine it will meet the convenience of all parties if we fix the hour of adjournment at one o'clock. Some hon. members have mentioned that we might continue to sit until two o'clock; on the other hand I have heard from three or four members who prefer to adjourn at one o'clock. That being the case I would suggest the hour of one o'clock, and with the consent of the house I shall include that hour in my motion.\n\nMotion agreed to.\n\nMr. MACKENZIE KING: I shall make the formal motion that this house do sit tomorrow, May 29, 1930, beginning at the hour of two o'clock p.m.\n\nMotion agreed to.\n\nMr. MACKENZIE KING: May I add that I hope the fact that for part of the day we are to sit on Ascension day will not be regarded as in any way establishing a precedent?\n\nSUPPLY\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nThe house in committee of supply, Mr. Johnston in the chair.\n\nIndians\u2014Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia (Hansard 1961-257)\n\nMr. FANSHER (Late Member): I want to bring to the attention of the minister the matter of some Indian accounts. In some instances in the province of Saskatchewan Indians submit their claims to the farmers and purchased seed grain, feed oats hay for horses and in some instances cattle. In some cases these people have received full pay, but in others they have not received anything. I brought this matter to the attention of the minister last year, and my remarks are recorded at pages 380 and 380s of unrecorded Hansards. Among other things the minister said:\n\nIn every case where he is able to prove such an order we are prepared to settle, and in some cases where the evidence is clear that the transaction actually took place and that the minister is prepared to pay the claim, we will try to make an adjustment.\n\nIt seems to me that some provision should be made by legislation or parliament to pay these accounts when the agents get seed grain or feed from farmers. I hope the minister will see that these accounts are paid this summer.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): All I can say is that we do recognize the orders of the agents, but we do not pretend to recognize trading done with Indians unless by the\nauthority of the agents. We have had a great deal of difficulty in settling up old accounts which have dragged on for many years; many of the obligations in this respect occurred during and just after the war. I think, however, with the exception of just one or two at Tisdale, where we have paid most of these accounts, and the crop on the Blood reserve this year will no doubt clear up a very heavy indebtedness which exists there. We are watching this matter very closely and hope we will be able to clean up the last of these accounts before the year is over.\n\nMr. FANSHER (Last Mountain): Am I to understand that it is not the intention of the department to take care of these accounts at all until such time as the money comes from crops belonging to the Indians themselves?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): No, that is not what I want my hon. friend to understand. As far as possible we want to avoid taking money from our Indian account for purposes of paying these amounts. In the case of the Blood Indians there is about $50,000 owing, a very large amount, and I am informed that this year their crop will clear up these accounts. In some cases we have had accounts long overdue and he had to vote the money to pay for them. I want my hon. friend to understand that it has not been an easy matter to get up this old indebtedness but I say we hope to be able to clean it up during the present year.\n\nMr. FANSHER (Last Mountain): I should like the minister to understand also that it has not been his task for these men to carry these accounts for many decades and some of them for very large amounts. I do not refer to any cases where trading has been done between the Indian and the farmer; I refer to cases where the agent simply gave orders on government stationary. The farmer, thinking he was going to get his pay in the near future, let go of a valuable liquid asset and so has not received his money. We make loans to hardware companies and many other institutions throughout Canada, and it seems to me this matter should be cleaned up. We cannot now afford to make a loan to the department which would enable these legitimate accounts to be paid. They should be paid and it would not take a great deal of money and it would relieve a great deal of hardship among the farmers who have been carrying these accounts for a long time.\n\n[Mr. C. A. Stewart.]\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: I have quite a large file of correspondence here in reference to the case of C. B. Rothery who was clerk in the Indian office at Onion Lake. This man claims to have been unjustly treated; he was appointed to the position through the Civil Service Commission and after six months probation he was dismissed by the department. I have a recent letter from him in which he says:\n\nA communication from J. C. G. Herwig, secretary, former Canadian Legion, to the representative of the imperial section of the Legion, which has been kindly sent to me\u2014reveals the following interesting admission by the Indian department:\n\n\"We have been met with a bland denial of our interference (political) and been told that the department does not except Rothery in the first place, doubting his competency.\" The commission examined the service of the Indian department throughout the whole hierarchy and does protest their intention to appoint the man named C. B. Rothery. It further states that it certainly supports my contention that there is nothing to support that I should get past the period of probation.\n\nAnd so on. I also have a number of communications from prominent people in the district and I have taken the liberty to read to the committee. However, there is one letter from a prominent gentleman in Fort Pitt, Saskatchewan. I will let the minister see this. It is a very strong one, but I did not wish to put it all on Hansard to give the name of my correspondent. I should like to read a short extract, however, as follows:\n\nThe whole district feel most strongly about his dismissal from the position he held as clerk at the Onion lake indian agency, a position I certainly believe was given to Mr. Rothery as a very capable, courteous man fitted in every way for the position he held at Onion lake. His reading qualifications I do not approve place him right in the front rank, and it is impossible for me to believe that he was dismissed from Onion lake on such paltry grounds. I have gone into the matter most fully, and to the best of my knowledge will hardly hear the light of day.\n\nAll agree that Rothery was eminently suited for the job as clerk at Onion lake. His reading qualifications are excellent. I have made a number of private inquiries into this matter and have viewed all possible aspects of this case. I most respectfully urge that there should be a thorough, impartial inquiry into this matter which I know would lead to Rothery's reinstatement.\n\nWould the minister care to make a statement in connection with that case?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Yes, I may say that I have heard of this case too late for the first time but I am informed that this man was selected by the Civil Service Commission for the position; he was taken\non for a period of probation of six months and was found to be unfit for his job so he was let out. As I say, I had not heard of this matter until my hon. friend brought it up to-night, but that is the information I have with respect to the fact. I may add that in the eyes of the department ought to be the judges of whether or not a man is capable of filling a position after he is given a trial. If he has not received a trial then he is a permanent man; but I am bound to say that I shall have to accept the opinion of my officials against any outside suggestions as to the fitness of anyone else with respect to the department. I do not know anything about this case; it has been dealt with by the department officially, and the officials of the department will be the judges of the question to fill a position after he is given a fair and impartial trial.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: Does the minister know whether it is true that the man who got the position was recommended by the hon. member mentioned in this letter?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I do not know who has the letter or where it is filed. I had no knowledge of this matter until just this moment.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: The statement is made to that effect.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I cannot be responsible for all the statements which are made but undoubtedly the Civil Service Commission would have to pass upon the applicant, and would also send us another one.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: As a matter of fact they did give this man the appointment. He is supposed to be what the man appointed in his place was not. Does the minister know that to be the fact?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I do not know anything about the appointment. As clerks are needed they are advertised for in the usual way and the appointment is made by the Civil Service Commission. The individual who obtains the appointment is taken on probation, but if he is found to be unsuited for the position he is let out and we ask the Civil Service Commission to give us another appointment.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: Does the minister agree that there should be an investigation made?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): If my hon. friend will give me the information which he has and I find that an investigation is warranted, yes. Every man is entitled to fair treatment, but many of these cases come up and it is found usually that the officials in charge are capable of deciding whether or not a man is fitted for the position. If that man has not been found worthy of demonstrating fitness for the position, then there might be grounds for complaint.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: The gravamen of this charge is that the department never intended that this man should retain the position. That would mean that it is a clear case of fraud, and more than that there is the suggestion of political interference.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): If my hon. friend is willing to give me the information in his possession, I will go into this matter officially and if in my opinion any injustice has been done to this man, an investigation will be held.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: No doubt the deputy has full information as to what took place. These are rather serious charges, and they seem to be backed up by very prominent residents of that district who think that an injustice has been done to this man. I should be very glad to give them back all the information I have, and I would ask that he consider the holding of an investigation. It is very unsatisfactory that there should be, as there has been in this case, any political interference, particularly when a returned man is displaced by a man who did not serve overseas.\n\nMr. FANSHER (Last Mountain): Has any provision been made for the payment of these accounts?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Does the hon. member mean by way of a special vote?\n\nMr. FANSHER (Last Mountain): Yes.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): No, but should it be deemed absolutely necessary that payments be made, and the accounts do not run up too large a sum, they will be taken care of.\n\nMr. FANSHER (Last Mountain): Does not the minister think that some of these accounts should be paid? The crown store people have said that the farmers would like to receive their money. I would like to see the minister bring in a supplementary estimate to cover this matter. It would not mean the parliament to a very large sum out of the federal treasury and that would be returned as new crops are grown.\n\nItem agreed to.\nMr. FRASER: What percentage of this vote was expended last year?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): So far as education is concerned, we have found that we have overspent our votes in all the provinces. We do not carry over any amounts in the Indian department, especially in those items dealing with medical health and medical services.\n\nMr. FRASER: One of the items in this vote is for $100,000 to provide for technical education, hospitals, medical attendance, promotion of agriculture, stock raising, fruit culture, and irrigation projects, and I would like to know in a general way what disposition was made last year of that amount, and how it is proposed to expend this present vote.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): That is the sum which was voted two years ago as a settlement with the Indians.\n\nMr. FRASER: Could the minister indicate in a general way how the amount is being spent? For instance, how much is being spent on technical education?\n\nMr. BENNETT: And what is meant by technical education?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I did not anticipate being asked these questions, and I have not been instructed to say that $100,000 is divided up in various ways for the benefit of the Indians in British Columbia. Does the hon. member want a statement as to how that amount was spent?\n\nMr. FRASER: I wanted only a general statement, but if the minister is going to prepare one perhaps he would prepare a complete statement.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): The expenditures for this year were as follows:\n\n- Technical education: $10,000\n- Hospitals and medical attendance: $60,000\n- Promotion of agriculture, stock raising, and fruit culture: $15,000\n- Irrigation projects: $15,000\n\nMr. FRASER: Most of the amount went for medical purposes.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): That is quite right.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: Is it the policy of the department to lease Indian lands to orientals?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I am informed that where they are available for leasehold, Indian lands are leased to orientals.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: On page 1268 of Hansard of this year, senators for Canada by the minister to a question asked by the hon. member for Battle River (Mr. Spencer). A list is shown of about 32 orientals who have obtained leases on the Kamslangs No. 1, Tesouche, \"forbidden\" reserve, St. Thomas, and Musqueam reserves. I presume the minister knows of the agitation in British Columbia against the leasing of lands to orientals. There are many feet of land are leased on lands in that province. I suggest to the minister that this is a policy the department should not pursue. Is there any particular reason why such a policy should be pursued?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I know of no particular reason. So far as I am aware, the orientals rent property freely in British Columbia for the purpose of raising vegetables. The Indian department is not unique in the fact that it happens to have a few leased out contracts, but so far as I know, make very good gardeners; they take good care of the land and we get the rentals from them. There is no difficulty about getting the rentals. They do not regard the possession of the land in any way; it is merely on leasehold. I may say frankly, if Anglo-Saxons wish to rent the land they would certainly have the privilege, but I do not know that they should have the ground and I would absolutely refuse to lease lands to orientals unless that were a general policy in British Columbia and then, of course, we would acquiesce in it. The hon. member knows the oriental is a very large leaseholder in British Columbia.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: The minister says that the orientals take good care of the land. Perhaps the minister does not know. As a matter of fact the orientals do just the opposite; they use up the land. It is estimated that the land leased to them has lost practically nil for quite a long period after. The minister has not that information, I presume.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): My hon. friend knows that right at his own home on the Delta there is a large number of orientals who have been there for a number of years. I happen to know that from observation. I had not heard they were leaving the land. If they are, it is a great pity. I had not heard that they were more extravagant in the use of land or took the life out of it more quickly than their white competitors. That is news to me, I confess.\nMr. McQUARRIE: It is quite true never-\ntheless, I presume the minister is not aware\nthat the great majority of the farmers through-\nout that district have decided not to lease any\nlands to orientals. The minister has not that\ninformation?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): No.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: I want to ask another\nquestion in regard to reserves and Indian lands.\nWhat is the policy of the government in con-\nnection with lands that are not being occupied\nby Indians at all? How many reserves have\nwe like that in British Columbia?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): I think we\nhave in the neighborhood of 1,200 in the\nprovince of British Columbia. I frankly con-\nfess we are not anxious to sell Indian lands,\nbut when there are no Indians who use\nthem and they are of any particular\nvalue for agricultural purposes, they are\nusually sold or put under leasehold. Use is\nbeing made of them in some cases, but the\nIndians of course receive the benefit of the\nreceipts from the leases, and in this way we\nare assisted in carrying on the Indians.\nAs I say, we do not keep a large number\nIndian lands; we believe there is little enough land\nreserved for the Indians without depleting it\nfurther.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: When the department\nproceeds to lease lands, does it advertise them\nin any way or give opportunity to the public\ngenerally to know that such lands are for\nrental?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): Usually we\nhave solicitors for them and we seek to\nmake known, in the locality in which the land\nis located, the fact that it is for rental. In\nthe case of sales they are always by public\nauction and more often than otherwise there\nis only one or two interested parties or there may\nbe two. We try to meet all who are desirous\nof obtaining leases of these lands.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nIndians\u2014general, $336,596.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Perhaps the minister will\ngive us a few words of explanation in con-\nnection with the item of $317,000 for the\nprevention of the spread of tuberculosis. I\nhad a conversation in respect to that the\nother day.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We are not\nanything like meeting the requirements of\nthe act in regard to the suppression of tuber-\nculosis amongst the Indians. Indeed, there\nis in Canada scarcely a band of Indian which\nis not more or less affected by tuberculosis.\nUnfortunately the disease has spread to rather\nan alarming degree, so much so that we are\nreally anxious about it. I am asking for the\nappointment of an assistant Indian medical\nofficer, but even that does not touch the\nheart of the question. Something further\nwill have to be done, and a very considerable\nsum of money spent on this work in order\nto meet the requirements can be used to survey\nthe present state of the hospital\nfacilities in every province in Canada, because\nwe believe, rightly or wrongly, that it will be\nmore economical for the government to work\nwith the existing hospitals of the provinces\nthan to attempt to set up large institutions\nof our own with the incidental cost. Of course\nin some instances we are obliged to establish\ninstitutions. Moreover, growing out of this is\nanother demand, a demand for some sort of\ninstitution to house our old people, but I\nfrankly confess our chief concern about the\nmatter is tuberculosis and the ravages of\nthis disease amongst the Indians and also\nthe danger of the spreading into the com-\nmunities that surround them. As a result of\nso much of it being found on the reserves.\nYear by year we shall have to increase the\nvote for this purpose. I consider it a real\nmenace and we are giving it very careful\nattention and we are doing everything in our\npower to prevent the spread of this institution\nas far as it is possible to do so, not to\neradicate, but to suppress, if possible, the\nspread of the malady.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Last week I was at the\nByron hospital near London and I saw some\nof the inmates of that hospital. During the\npast year I had occasion to observe the\nravages of this disease in the Siksika band near\nCalgary, where the band is certainly in a very\nbad condition, where diseases of other\nkinds than tuberculosis have undermined the\nvitality of the survivors, and something must\nbe done. The same thing is now going on\nregard to other reserves in Alberta. I have\nhad no opportunity to see other reserves but\none, and therefore I cannot with any degree\nof certainty speak about the others. The\nminister anticipated a suggestion I was going\nto make to him, and it is this: We have a\nDepartment of Health and there should be\nthe closest cooperation between the two de-\npartments. The overlapping is one of the\nthings that disturb people greatly. The federal\nDepartment of Health should be in some\nmeasure responsible for this. The hon.\ngentleman has referred to a subject that, I\nthink, is of considerable importance, namely,\nthe tying of the efforts of the department to\nthose of the provincial organizations in some\nway. I do not know just how this can best\nhe accomplished. Take, for instance, the large institution near Red Deer, west of Calgary where large numbers of tubercular patients are being treated. From the inquiries I have made, it did not seem to me you could take the Indian patients to that sanatorium and have them treated with the other patients there.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): What we are doing\u2014and we are trying to extend it\u2014is to provide a suitable remedy to build extensions to these institutions, and they are operated as Indian annexes.\n\nMr. BENNETT: The hon. member knows what was done at Biechen in connection with trying to put the Indians away for their own good, of living that makes them more susceptible to the incursions of this disease. Certainly there are a great many people who are intensely interested in whom when the existing conditions are not a menace to the public health of the surrounding community, as the minister has said. The deaths last year were very considerable, especially among the women and women of the reserves. The sum of $137,000 properly expended in one year in a concentrated effort at one particular point might provide facilities that would enable that community to withstand the ravages of this disease being so apparent next year, but a sum like $137,000 spread over a wide area has to be taken care of by the whole situation and afraid accomplishes very little good. I am bound to say that the facilities that have been provided in connection with the reserves and Blackfoot reserves and at one or two other places have done an amazing amount of good. But the Indian does not take kindly to the preventive measures that are being taken, and cannot anything like reasonable results. The reason I brought this matter up was that there might be on Hansard for the benefit of those who are interested in investigating this matter a statement from the minister to which I could refer them, indicating a realization of the gravity of the disease in this situation and as to what steps are being taken not to eradicate, but to bring about an attitude of mind on the part of those concerned by which they will let matters operate so as to prevent their becoming victims of this disease.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We have been expending very large sums of money on the building of educational institutions, and I think we have now reached the stage where we shall not require so much money for that purpose. Both this year and last, in conjunction with the Department of Health at Ottawa and the provincial departments of\n\nhealth, we have been making a survey with a view to establishing additions to the institutions already built to take care of the Indians who are suffering from this and other diseases.\n\nMr. MANION: May I suggest that there is this point to be remembered? The Indians are more susceptible to any disease taken from the white man than the white men themselves, and a good deal of the work done should be directed not so much to taking care of the Indians as has been done in disease as to preventing him from taking it. Tuberculosis is a disease which comes upon patients particularly after having had much cold and keeping the Indians from having such diseases as might render them less susceptible to tuberculosis. Preventive measures of that sort will do more good than looking after the Indian after he has taken the disease.\n\nI move agreed to.\n\nPublic education, including the construction of school buildings, $2,409,500.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Perhaps the minister would give us some statement as to how this money is to be expended. The minister stated that there were no new school buildings in certain parts of western Canada, and I think it would be desirable to have a statement on Hansard for references.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We have in operation this year boarding and day schools for Indians as follows: Prince Edward Island, 1; Nova Scotia, 11; New Brunswick, 10; Quebec, 33; Ontario, 96; Manitoba, 55; Saskatchewan, 39; Alberta, 21; Northwest Territories, 1; British Columbia, 32; Yukon, 7; or 341 in all. There are no boarding schools in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or Quebec, but there are 13 boarding schools in Ontario; Manitoba, 10; Saskatchewan, 14; Alberta, 19; Northwest Territories, 4; British Columbia, 16; Yukon, 2.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Is this new construction?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): No, these are schools in operation. The new construction is as follows:\n\nShingwauk Home, Ontario (C.E.) . . . $50,000\nNew Home, Manitoba (United) . . . 15,000\nBirtle, Manitoba (Pres.) . . . 125,000\nMuscowequan, Saskatchewan (R.C.) . . . 100,000\nOld Sun, Alberta (C.E.) . . . 25,000\nAlbert Bay, British Columbia (C.E.) . . . 10,000\nBig Lake, Saskatchewan (R.C.) . . . 100,000\nEdmonton, Alberta (United) . . . 14,000\nOld Sun, Alberta (C.E.) . . . 30,000\nMiscellaneous\u2014to provide for a gratuity to Peter Tomkins, former instructor, formerly of Saddle Lake agency, Alberta, $500.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Is Peter Tomkins an Indian?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): No. For many years he was in the employ of the Indian department, particularly during the period of the war. Now he is unable to maintain himself, and we are voting this as a gratuity for the services he rendered in the early days.\n\nMr. BENNETT: It is a small sum, but there is a precedent involved which is of very great importance having regard to the letters one in my position receives from those who took part in the Northwest rebellion. When did he leave the public service?\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): He left the Indian service some years ago, but I believe he was employed in the Department of the Interior as a homestead inspector. I do not think he has been engaged in the Indian department for twenty years.\n\nMr. KENNEDY: He has been in the public service forty years altogether. He was Dominion Land Agent at Ground until 1911.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nIndian affairs\u2014salaries, $185,000; contingent, $20,000.\n\nMr. COWAN: Is there any provision in the supplementary or the main estimates for making an addition to the hospital at Sioux Lookout in the northern part of the territory? It is a most urgent point to establish a hospital by reason of the fact that Indians resident in the area from the Manitoba boundary to as far as Cochrane are treated there. The Indians have asked us in the department that a wing should be added to the hospital. At present the Indians are treated in an institution erected by the citizens of the community. We think it only fair that the government should pay for the construction of a wing to the hospital in pursuance of the request that has been forwarded to the minister.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): If we can make an arrangement with the hospital authorities, we propose to provide the funds for the construction of a wing for the purpose my hon. friend has mentioned. It is our intention to put an item in the estimates next year. In the meantime we will continue to pay the ordinary hospital fees.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: What is the reason for the increase of over $16,000 for salaries?\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We are appointing a new medical officer to assist the chief medical officer at a salary of $4,000; a departmental accountant, grade 5; a survey engineer, grade 1a; and an assistant in charge of Indian agencies, grade 2. This official in the past has been paid from the vote for the outside service; we are transferring him to the permanent inside service. These, with a few other items, make the total of $16,000.\n\nMr. McQUARRIE: There is an increase of $1,500 for contingencies.\n\nMr. STEWART (Edmonton): We find that we have not had enough money in the past for contingencies, and we are now asking for $1,500 more.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE\n\nNational Revenue\u2014Civil government\u2014services\u2014$75,000 for contingencies.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Does this amount include the salaries of special officers who have been taking charge of prosecutions and looking after matters of that kind?\n\nHon. W. D. EULER (Minister of National Revenue): No, this is under the civil government section.\n\nMr. BENNETT: They are not included in that?\n\nMr. EULER: No; this applies to the officers in the departmental head office.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nSalaries and contingent expenses of the new positions in the Dominions, including pay for overtime of officers, notwithstanding anything in the Civil Service Act, and temporary positions, $38,000.\n\nSalaries and travelling expenses of inspectors of ports and of other officers on inspection and the establishment of the Board of Customs and Excise, the amount required to create positions, make transfers, and provide for the services of Dominion appraisers, investigators of values and claims for duties, etc., $19,000.\n\nMaterials\u2014Printing and stationery, subscriptions to commercial papers, flags, clothing, uniforms, etc., $1,500; supplies for the port of entry, express charges on samples, stationery and miscellaneous expenses, printing, providing guarantee bonds and uniforms for customs officers, $650,000.\n\nAmount to be paid to the Department of Justice, to be disbursed by and accounted for to the secret preventive service, and amounts required to create positions and make appointments of officers for the prevention of smuggling and to investigate reported transactions, to be expended also to provide for the expenses of such officers and for the purchase of automobiles to be used in the prevention of smuggling or other offences against the revenue laws, $1,812,519.\n\n(Mr. McQuarrie.)\n\nAmount to be paid to the Department of Justice, to be disbursed by and accounted for to the secret preventive service, and amounts required to create positions and make appointments of officers for the prevention of smuggling and to investigate reported transactions, to be expended also to provide for the expenses of such officers and for the purchase of automobiles to be used in the prevention of smuggling or other offences against the revenue laws, $1,812,519.\n\n(Mr. McQuarrie.)\nWHAT WILL YOU DO WITHOUT HIM?\n\nFRANCIS RIDLEY HAVergal.\n\nI could not do without Him!\nJesus is more to me\nThan all the richest, fairest gifts\nOf earthly life can be.\nBut the more I find Him precious,\nAnd the more I find Him true,\nThe more I long to find\nWhat He can be to you.\n\nWhy will you do without Him?\nIs He not your Guide?\nDid He not die to save you?\nIs He not all you need?\nDo you not want your Master?\nDo you not want a Friend?\nOne who will love you faithfully,\nAnd know you to the end?\n\nWhat will you do without Him\nWhen death is drawing near,\nWith His own deathless love,\nThat casts out every fear?\nWhen the shadow-valley opens\nIts gloomy, silent door,\nAnd the terrors of its darkness\nMust all be passed o'er?\n\nWhat will you do without Him\nWhen He has shut the door,\nAnd you are left outside because\nYou came too late before?\nWhen it is no use knocking,\nNo use to stand and wait;\nFor the words He spoke to your heart\nThen terrible \"Too late!\"\nYou cannot do without Him!\nThere is no substitute,\nBy which you ever can be saved,\nNo hope, no cheer,\nWithout Him there is no way\nOf love and life and joy.\nWithout Him there is nothing woeful\nAnd everlasting night.\n\nWhy should you do without Him?\nIt is not too late;\nHe has not closed the day of grace,\nHe has not shut the gate.\nHe calls you by His name,\nHe calls you!\nHe would not have you go\nAnother step without Him,\nBecause He loves you so.\n\nWhat will you do without Him?\nWhen the great white throne is set,\nAnd the Lord Himself can mistake\nAnd never can forget\u2014\nThe Judge whom you have never here,\nAs Friends of God's dear Son,\nShall summon you to give account\nOf every word and thought.\nYou need not do without Him,\nFor life is just by Him,\nHe is ready to be gracious,\nOnly waiting for your cry.\nHe is anxious to receive you\u2014\nTo make you His own\u2014\nWhy will you do without Him?\nAnd wander on alone?\n\nRemember the words of the Lord Jesus how He said, \"It is more blessed (happy) to give than to receive.\" Acts 20:35.\n\nThis leaflet 3c per dozen, 20c per 100, postpaid.\n\nJames Publishing Co., 285 Minnesota St., St. Paul, U.S.A.\nThe Song of the Sparrow.\n\n\"I am not the sparrow sold for two farthings and no one of them is forgotten before God; but every hair of your head is all numbered.

We have moved from the old-time severity of the Puritans toward a lack of regard for the Sabbath\u2014a lack of regard and respect for the day that is really a serious matter. While it is possible to say that the religion of the Puritans was hard and unattractive to children and young people, it is nevertheless true that their disciplinary effect was good, for in those days children grew up to become God-fearing and God-fearing citizens. Some of their remedies would be of necessity be impractical now, but may we not strive to make a happy medium in the observance of the Sabbath, that will somewhat harmonize with changed conditions, and yet help our youth to understand that it is God's Day?\n\nOne happy ideal, recently suggested by an English writer is that the Sabbath should be a real day of rest, refreshing mentally and spiritually, for all in the home. The idea may be realized when the Sabbath becomes indeed a family day and children, to natives and foreigners, to the city dweller and the country farm hand, the best day of the week.\n\nLet us make it a day when the intimacies of the family circle are the sweetest and most precious, when the help and inspiration of the sanctified are most needed, hampered by thoughts of the toil of yesterday or fear of the coming tomorrow; when the best books are read, and the most holy deeds performed. The rush and hurry of modern life has, some way, kept us from taking time to enjoy the quiet moments we\nI know there are many sparrows\u2014\nAll over the world they are found\u2014\nBut our heavenly Father knoweth\nWhen one of us falls to the ground.\n\nThe small, we see not for form;\nThe weak, we are never afraid;\nFor we know the dear Lord keepeth\nThe life of the creatures He made.\n\nI fly through city and country,\nI alight on mountain spray\u2014\nI have no chart or compass\nBut I never lose my way.\n\nI just fold my wings at daylight,\nWhen I happen to be there;\nFor the Father is always watching\nAnd no harm can come to me.\n\nI am only a little sparrow,\nAt little work degree;\nBut I know that the Father loves me,\nDost Thou know His love for THEE?\n\nASSORTED TRACTS\u2014ONE OF EACH.\n\n| Lot No. | Description          | Price |\n|--------|----------------------|-------|\n| 1      | For Unbelievers      | $0.08 |\n| 2      | For Believers        | $0.15 |\n| 3      | For Young            | $0.08 |\n| 4      | For Old Folks        | $0.08 |\n| 5      | Premillennial Tracts | $0.08 |\n| 6      | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 7      | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 8      | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 9      | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 10     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 11     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 12     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 13     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 14     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 15     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 16     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n| 17     | Bible Reading Cards  | $0.05 |\n\nRemember the Sabbath observance how He said, \"It is more blessed to give than to receive.\" Acts 20:35\n\nThis leaflet 1\u00a2; a dozen, 1\u00a2; a hundred, postpaid.\n\nASHER PUBLISHING CO., 350 Minnesota St., St. Paul, U.S.A.\n\nDepartment of Sabbath Observance.

As you say, it is very seldom that the question of Indian Education is discussed editorially in our newspapers. I am quite sure that this editorial comment is gratifying to you. We in the office here perhaps are in a better position to judge what is being accomplished through the Indian Schools than even the Editors of our Canadian newspapers and we value very highly the work of the Department, and also the very cordial co-operation which we receive from you and the other officials.\n\nAgain thanking you, and with kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nREC:AMA.\nJune 6-30.\n\nMr. Russel T.

It is good to have the results of Indian education so generously recognized by a leading paper like the Citizen. I know the family referred to, at least part of them.

I am interested in knowing how such schools are administered by your department when they are in the hands of religious organizations, such Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, &c.; also historical data.\n\nI am more particularly interested in knowing the method of handling such institutions in the province of Saskatchewan. Any printed matter or regulations for the purpose of computing grants, &c., will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for your courtesy in this matter, believe me to be,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

The total enrolment was 15,743 and the average attendance, 11,579 - a percentage of attendance of 73.55. The enrolment for the year is the largest and the attendance the highest yet reached. Ten years ago, the average attendance was 7,649, and it is gratifying to note that the increase since that time is over 50%. In Part II of this report will be found a tabular statement, showing the location and indicating the attendance at all Indian schools.\n\nThe same number of residential schools were in operation last year and the results have been very encouraging. Vocational training is possible at these boarding schools and the Department continues to emphasize this important phase of the work. Mention should be made of the rapid development of technical education in British Columbia - made possible by special funds which have been provided for the purpose. In Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, emphasis is placed on farming, gardening and the care of stock.\n\nThe co-operation of the churches in the management of these residential schools was as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Number of Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 43                            |\n| Church of England       | 20                            |\n| United Church           | 13                            |\n| Presbyterian Church     | 2                             |\n| **Total**               | **78**                        |\n\nTwo new day schools were established where there was promise of real usefulness. On many reserves, the Indian schools now secure as good attendance and results as rural white schools. Provincial curricula for public and separate schools are followed and fully qualified teachers are engaged.\n\nAll Indian schools were regularly inspected by officers of the Department. Particular attention is paid to the general management, condition and care of property, vocational training and the health of the pupils. In addition, provincial school inspectors visited all classrooms and reported on the academic work, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there were special Indian school inspectors.\n\nIt is with much regret that the Department reports the death of the Sister Superior and 12 children when fire destroyed the main building at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, in northern Manitoba. Renewed efforts have been made in the matter of fire prevention and protection and all principals of residential schools\nhave again been instructed to examine fire fighting equipment and escapes and to practise fire drill regularly. Fireproof construction is now being used in all new buildings where there are children's dormitories and at all schools the Department has provided adequate fire fighting equipment and escape facilities.\n\nNew main buildings were commenced during the year at four residential schools - Brandon, Man., (Brandon); Punnichy, Sask., (Gordon's); Gleichen, Alta., (Old Sun's); Grouard, Alta., (St. Bruno's). In addition, the Department assisted the respective church authorities with the reconstruction of new buildings at Beauval, Sask., Wabasca, Alta., and Providence, N.W.T. The new buildings at Alert Bay, B.C., and Kenora, Ont., (Cecilia Jeffrey), were completed and furnished during the year.\n\nThe buildings for the new Maritime Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, N.S., have also been completed and furnished. This institution is for orphan and neglected children and for those who are unable, for one reason or other, to obtain an education at the reserve day schools. It already gives promise of much usefulness to the Indians of the Maritime Provinces. At 8 Indian day schools in Canada, new classrooms or teachers' residences were erected.\n\nThe practice of assisting the most promising and industrious graduates of Indian schools was continued. Approximately 160 young Indian men and women were helped to continue their studies or to establish homes. Except in those Indian communities where successful farming is found, the school graduate presents a problem which is very difficult of solution. The Department and the churches interested are trying new schemes and searching for better methods of helping the young people to establish themselves.\n\nIn the past, the funds of certain Indian bands were used to meet some of the costs of conducting day schools on their reserves. The year under review is the second that all expenditure has been provided by Parliamentary Appropriation. The programme of free education is now extended to all Indians in Canada. The expenditure for Indian Education for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1930, amounted to \u00a32,230,438.21, as follows:-\n## Indian Education Vote\n\n### Expenditure for Year 1929-30\n\n| Province          | Day Schools | Residential Schools | Stationery | Tuition & Assistance | Miscellaneous | Total |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------|-------|\n| Nova Scotia       | 8,792.84    | 80,952.42           | 244.03     | 15,255.39            | 11.87         | 105,266.55 |\n| Prince Edward Island | -           | -                   | 533.63     | -                    | -             | 721.63 |\n| New Brunswick     | 14,892.47   | -                   | 765.79     | 663.95               | 1,004.10      | 17,366.31 |\n| Quebec            | 75,488.75   | -                   | 1,765.69   | 4,279.90             | 19.60         | 78,551.94 |\n| Ontario           | 106,594.51  | 285,740.23          | 9,620.80   | 12,848.50            | 544.21        | 415,392.35 |\n| Manitoba          | 53,612.40   | 321,263.55          | 4,706.77   | 596.09               | 5,069.33      | 395,266.14 |\n| Saskatchewan      | 42,519.43   | 344,878.34          | 4,350.31   | 2,356.20             | 3,117.87      | 397,252.15 |\n| Alberta           | 3,650.78    | 316,222.33          | 4,709.68   | 1,674.10             | 515.19        | 356,772.06 |\n| Northwest Territories | 2,245.25   | 52,103.96           | 436.87     | -                    | 49.23         | 54,825.33 |\n| British Columbia  | 60,509.33   | 462,517.45          | 7,536.57   | 948.12               | 1,067.50      | 532,578.97 |\n| Yukon             | 2,502.70    | 13,493.64           | 426.52     | -                    | -             | 16,422.86 |\n| **Total**         | **368,476.46** | **1,877,235.94**    | **39,644.66** | **38,642.25**        | **11,456.90** | **2,330,438.21** |\nthy and appreciation of the work staff, and the good ship of mercy, support to \"THE LOG OF THE known the valuable work being bound coast.\n\nJesus Saviour, pilot me,\nOver life's tempestuous sea,\nUnknown waves before me roll,\nHiding rock and treacherous shoal,\nChart and compass come from Thee,\nJesus Saviour, pilot me.\n\nAn Appreciation\n\nOf the forces brought to bear on the raising of funds for the new hospital, the \"Daily Province\" newspaper easily ranks the greatest.\n\nWhen, about the beginning of the year, our little hospital on floats was wrecked on its way to Pender Harbor, the paper with ready sympathy gave its pages to help replace the loss.

Earl Anfield, Principal Inian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIt was the writer's privilege recently to pay a visit to several of the more northern villages from which our children are drawn to this residential school, and most gratifying indeed were the impressions gained. A tremendous improvement is to be noted in type and condition of homes, and in every case by one Indian people, although perhaps there is a tendency to build on rather too pretentious a scale. However, such is a good fault. The villages visited were well informed and clean, and although the fishermen had not had an too prosperous a year, there was noticeable a feeling and sense of well-being. Through the good-will of the Indian Department and an earnest desire on the part of the people of our northern villages are now equipped with satisfactory water supplies, and if the large washings displayed on the clothes line were any sign those supplies were being well used.\n\nAs seems so usual in our Indian village life, the attraction of many seemed to centre around the Church, and there was strongly evident a desire on the part of the Indian people to make of their Church a real centre to the corporate and spiritual life of the village. In one centre, Bella Bella, the Indians, the people who are largely engaged in building a Church Hall, all the lumber and labour being freely and cheerfully donated by the people. The Village Council arranged for the necessary materials for the workers, and it was pleasing indeed to see them working together after a hard morning's work, and to hear them discuss how they were going to use the work of their creation after its completion.\n\nTalking of Village Councils, it would be well in my opinion if this movement were extended to more villages and also if the power of the Council were made a little more concrete. In one village the writer passed at the Council's Notice Board, and read therein an earnest request from the Council that better attendance take place in the day school; on another a notice stating that the curfew law was to be enforced, all with the signature of the Chief Councillor. There is need indeed of more of enforcing such orders by the Council themselves.\n\nThis brings me to the chief subject of this little article. The Indian Day Schools visited were, without exception, well built, well equipped, and, best of all, in the hands of quite willing and enthusiastic teachers. I wish most strongly to stress the fact that by these noble workers, often in the loneliest and most disheartening places, is being performed a task that is heroic to a degree. In the latest report we find that the total enrolment of the day schools of this province is 1,267, whilst the average attendance is only 604, whilst the Residential Schools, with a total of 1,585, have an average of 1,375. In the former case less than 50 per cent, and the latter almost 88 per cent. Is it any wonder that the day school teachers get discouraged; can we not see why it is so difficult to get pupils to go into the schools and discouraging conditions? And then, to crown it all, along comes the Residential Schools and take away the best of the children to the larger centres. As one teacher put it, \"We want the children to try and attend regularly, and they are the ones you come and take just as we are getting them somewhere.\" Or, to quote another\u2014\"The children feel that they do not need to attend regularly as some of them think that as soon as they get to ten or eleven years of age they are off to the Residential School in any case.\" This attitude was found in the minds of the parents in every centre visited, and it is a fatal weakness among the Indians at any rate if the day school is to be made the power it should be in village life. The parents must be educated to the all-important fact that continued success and an increasing standard, is contingent upon the facilities offered by the Day Schools of our Indian villages. I tried to impress on them the fact that if the Day Schools were properly supported by the parents, there would be no need for the removal of children from our residential schools, with a consequent increase of scope for the pupils, as the money and teachers at present used in primary work could be diverted to other classes, and further that if the day schools were successful, then the number of problem cases in the large schools would be greatly lessened, as the day school will have shown the defects so often remedial if caught in time. Neither should be forgotten the value of the day school in an attempt in introducing of Indian children to the routine and life of the larger schools. To sum up briefly, the following points must be emphasized greatly if the Indian Day School is to come into its proper and most valuable sphere:\n\n(1) An educational propaganda must be carried on extensively among the parents to convince them of the value of their day schools, as the foundation schools for the education of their children.\n\n(2) A far more rigid enforcement of the Indian Act with regard to school attendance must be carried out.\n\n(3) The curriculum of the Day School must be adapted to allow of more specialization in primary work.\n\n(4) A move in the right direction would be that the residential schools should demand from the parents a pass certificate from primary to Grade I, with a satisfactory attendance record at an Indian Day School, before applications will be accepted.\n\nIn closing let us give honour to those faithful teachers who, in face of real difficulties and often harshship and neglect are holding the line of Indian education. God bless them, cheer them, and comfort them, in the realization that their labour is not in vain.\nThe today and tomorrow of the Indian Child.\n\nEducation-\n\nThe Educational and Civic training system of the Dept of Indian Affairs working in conjunction with the several Churches is today rapidly approaching perfection.\n\nThe magnificent new residential schools finished, under construction and in contemplation will, in the course of a few years, complete homes of early and adolescent training covering every sphere of education from moral to technical and in which every child between the ages of 10 and 16, who passes the doctors medical examination, will have access.\n\nThese large commodious residential schools are a wonder and a source of jealousy to the white population. Many times when one has been busied showing a visitor over the school, the conversation winds up with the words \"this is marvellous, I wish my child could be an Indian for 10 years of his or her life.\" The Department of Indian Affairs has indeed a reason to be proud of their late accomplishments, and the Churches have indeed a reason to be thankful to the Department at Ottawa for its keen foresight, sympathy and adherence for and to a policy even surpassing dreams of ten years ago. The Churches now are obliged to put forth every effort to keep faith with the Fathers who have realized in their outlook that, first suitable and modern buildings must be provided which should be the foundation institutions of future learning for generations of their wards. Then cheerfully with the spirit of highest faith handed over the keys to the Churches expecting these institutions to be religious as well as technical training to the young Indian life of British Columbia.\n\nEverywhere in beautiful settings and surroundings these institutions must breed in the child a system of character building comparative only with the pureness of the natural beauty and grandeur generated and created by a God of Love who is seen in and throughout yet immanent in all the child's eye beholds and should hear of from those in charge and to whom the Department of Indian Affairs have so nobly almost without reserve handed over to care for and in which to bring up in the way they should go, those who are their dependants.\n\nWith this generosity goes every sympathy, intertwined with an expectancy of such development that will eventually absorb the Indian race into the body politic and thus cultivate independent citizens who will prove worthy of the expenditure and the unwavering foresight of the Department together with the faithful and patient work of the Churches through their workers are so nobly moulding upright, fair and honorable lives in those younger Indian people.\n\nThe New Schools open up many advantages of training. While the class room covers the entire Provincial Curriculum and a child has the option of advancing side by side with his white brother even to matriculation standard. On the other hand the child is trained in first aid, care of babies, elementary nursing, manual training developing into full fledged journey men's engine work essential today for every boy to know, general agriculture on a scientific basis, whereas excepting for the larger centres, the white child is obliged to resort to Red Cross and other philanthropic societies as well as instructors salaried by the government to give whatever routine instruction can be given under existing circumstances.\n\nTruly the Indian Child is a favored individual and sometimes one wonders whether the race on the whole appreciates what is being done, but those only who are workers in the field can vouch for that spirit as exhibited in the return of the fruit of their labors as they sojourn among those who have been through their hands. The advancing strides have been a marvel and the present system of education in vogue, this advance should hereafter be more visible and convincing as the years go by.\n\nThe child is growing in mind and maturing in physique. He shows marked ability and in not a few cases this is shown extraordinary aptitude in every Dept. of his training especially in the technical work so lately established. In some cases one finds themselves forced by the brightness of mind and anxiety exhibited by the\nchild, to carry on into advanced work. Students are asking for high school education some looking forward to scientific training. This spirit must not be discouraged as it is a self-centered force having in itself tendency towards the rapid growth and wider advance of the race as a whole. One finds individual parental interest in their offspring and also an individual reserve claiming the glory of a child's advance, developing into Band accepting or Iau reis. The Indian as a rule is docile and Stoical retaining his expressions of delight only exhibiting same in close intimacy bordering secrecy. The old Boys and Girls are becoming more outspoken regarding their children's advance and welfare.\n\nLet me say a word for the Indian Day School. The work in this branch of the Department's system of education is largely a preparatory course for entrance to the Residential Schools. Feeders one might term them. The idea is a very good one and the policy every where should be to have properly certificated teachers specialized in Language and Kindergarten work.\n\nWhile a great sacrifice is made by teachers in the main, it would seem that everything is not brought to bare on the Indian parent in the necessity of regular attendance as the average is very low and such is not conducive to good work by the teacher nor is the child properly fitted to enter the Residential School. I have found that children entering at having five years experience in day schools are not good grade two pupils. Others have come registering grade four and were obliged to be taken back to grade two. This factor cannot be placed on the teacher but rather on the reticence of the parent in keeping his child in regular attendance. In comparing the average attendance of the Day School with that of the Residential one finds a great difference showing that something should be done together more regular attendance if they are to play the part the Department expects of them; else the first three or four years of the child's educational life is lost. This the child cannot afford for he has to begin with in the majority of cases a two year language handicap to overcome before anything can be done in grade work.\n\nAs mentioned above there are a number of children forcing the schools for higher education and are asking to be fitted for special training. While I do not advocate a wholesale advance I cannot discourage the child who has the ability, self-foresight and cohesiveness, as these must be taken on and for the time being will have to be absorbed by the Department in the different Sub-Departmental positions to which they may qualify. A Boy may wish to take Medicine and in case he makes good his qualifications, work for him can be found among his own people. The same applying to the Nurse or Teacher or in Agricultural pursuits. This condition is rapidly approaching and provision will have to be made for it.\n\nThis brings me to the to-morrow of the child. I have endeavored to describe the system of modern training now in vogue among our Indians but of what use is all this? Some ask, Will the child follow up his or her training or they revert? This depends upon a number of vital questions, some of which has to be proven by the Indian child now grown up, and some will depend upon the policy adopted for his absorption.\n\nThe growing tendency of the Indian towards responsibility is fast becoming his asset and is leading him to a state of independence. Here-tofore he was classed as a thriftless, irresponsible species of manhood. This trait is born in him and it is not an easy task for him to cast away inheritance. He is beginning to realize that his own making or breaking lies within himself and that to depend on outside assistance alone will soon drive him into vagrancy becoming a fit subject for the grasp of the law. He is fast realizing that he cannot anymore roam the hills to search for game and to kill without reserve, nor can he fish the streams without restriction and is applying himself to responsibility in labor. He sees that he must be prepared to shoulder the burden of responsibility a position of labor will place upon him. No more can he work when he likes and lazily lie around for a period. He also finds that with responsibility comes a peaceful un-\ndisturbed life, a respectable home and family and steady employment. This tendency is more marked in those who have been through the schools where responsibility is taught and driven home in every way. Once he has grasped this spirit of responsibility and has shown aptness in application he is rated as one of the best by his employers. I have heard railway men say that the Indian when he will take care makes the best Section Foremen they have on the D.C. lines. Road Masters say that the best kept sections are now under Indians, which statement augurs well for the future of the race. I believe that given his opportunity this will apply to any class of employment.\n\nTechnical training now working factor in our schools will give the boy a feeling that when he graduates he will be equipped to take some responsibility which will in turn give him independence. Mechanical training in every line appeals to him. He is quick, apt and efficient with tools and will use his head to accomplish. He delights in being given an opportunity of exercising his own creative ability. He sees his own production and it results in him a something latent leading him on to greater activity and efficiency.\n\nEfficiency and rapidity are watchwords today among employers and in Unions. The keen competition in the trades per force calls for efficiency and responsibility and that irrespective of race or creed. If therefore we can assure these requirements in our Indians, as I believe we can, and they measure up if given their opportunity, the Department of Indian Affairs will in the course of a few years be amply rewarded for the expenditure wrapped up in these schools and the Churches will rejoice in having expended work and patience in the years of training. Our work, God's work, rewarded in independent, law-abiding God-fearing people.\n\nProtection from himself in his rapid advance, is something that must be taken care of by those in authority. The Indian is an adopted child and has realized and accepted protection, asking for it, cases where it should not be given. With the present day unrest and unemployment comes the tendency for Governments to protect and sustain, wherever possible, in employment those who to some degree return to them in taxation part of what is given to the taxable citizen, the Indian being a more or less free agent objects even to paying the poll tax. He asks for protection against same and gets it, which fact I think is not good for it carries with it the possibility of no employment when perhaps he could get it being at least a small donation to the public treasury. It also deprives him to a degree of the responsibility in his equipment.\n\nThis would also lead us to the Enfranchise which education and responsible Citizenship will give him. There are a great number of our Indians who are not in such a position as to be intelligent voters. In a few years time all will come under this recognition by our Governments. It would increase national interest and have a tendency to quicken his ability to cast off his Ward garments.\n\nIn absorption the utmost care should be exercised by those in charge of the educational problem of these people not to educate them away from themselves. The present half-breed situation\u2014Indian and white\u2014is not good. The half-breed children in the field are in constant contact with an appalling situation, not only in illiteracy but also in the fact that this inter class are neither whites nor Indians and are claimed by no one and in general useless and irresponsible. Care therefore should be taken to secure so this condition is still possible. This can be done by educating the two sexes on an equality. The natural tendency of humanity is to link up with his own standard in education. A Doctor will marry a nurse or a teacher, and so it runs throughout. Very rare is the occasion for one in either sex to marry illiteracy or lower his or her educational standards. The Indian is quite human in this respect. This difficulty therefore can be cured for by those in responsible for the upbringing of these school children and a great social difficulty in time eradicated.\n\nThe Indian mode of living and in most cases at the present has been and is a source creating a feeling of class distinction and it was only in the main a very low class of white man who would lower himself to live with an Indian woman. The consequence is that the last state is worse than the first, leaving behind\nThe Indian in his early life was a Nomad, he travelled, hunted man and beast, finding himself \"Lord of all he surveyed\". If he cared to own little on the land which was all his, very good but if not very good, however, the loss in the interior of B.C., he was and in a man of the land so it must be the policy of the authorities to see that he developed agriculturally. To-day this development is not very far from the primitive, only in its infancy and greater thought and greater strides will have to be taken and taken in this important regard.\n\nBritish Columbia is a mixed farming province and if properly handled a family can make a good living on thirty acres of land, especially in the irrigated sections.\n\nFollowing a scientific training, which in all Schools should be given, and which when a boy is graduated from the School, he will be able to carry on at his graduation in the same manner as he was taught in the School. He may be left behind with his knowledge and at his hand to work against the natural tendency of all life to hate and a boy under the control of his early teaching takes unto himself a wife whom he hopes to care for as a husband; he has been taught when a child to earn for the necessities of family difficulties of production and provision become greater, the boy finds that his little store is not sufficient well equipped nor is he capable in his primitive way to keep himself, his house, clothes and food.\n\nDriven to the work he must find another or war in which to provide and very often he forced to become a soldier or is found by the law trying to make an unlawful living for himself and family using his education to further his interests. A man will into the hands of the law and as seven years term might be a period of his husband's forced separation the idea and desire to live in morality in order to take care of that child which is a blessing to any man or woman who in God's name have been joined to another. It is to prevent this catastrophe, the government should be made before him for the above mentioned, a community system should be advocated the Community System wherever possible. Graduates of the Schools should be given an opportunity to attend high schools, where they may catch up again to that they could before and carry on where they left off at the end of their School days.\n\nGovernment on a Community basis where a number of families could be supervised as one unit, this would give the Board of Education a better opportunity to follow up their boys and girls. The Department would also be able to give closer and more intelligent supervision. The church also would find it much less difficult to continue in every way the early instruction spiritually of the child. In a word it would make possible the Departments policy and success would be attained by working in conjunction with the several Churches.\n\nThe early environment of the \"potlatch\" is still a source of annoyance and children will vacate the Schools without leave in order to attend these modified old time gatherings. These are carried on at the time of death and again at the time of renovating their cemetery.\n\nWith the community system a hall could be built and used to offset this evil. It would also serve for community games and meetings. Competition should be fostered in games among communities. Recreation of all kinds could be supervised and many evils thereby taken care of.\n\nCompetition could be applied in agriculture with suitable prizes issued. Calf clubs could be organized. Judging classes carried on. Senior and junior herd sire sires could be kept and a general continued supervision having for its object the stabilization of the young population who are now wards of the Department.\nFarms should be made interesting to the boy. Half-hearted or haphazard agricultural training should not be tolerated in the schools nor on the reserve. Scientific and intense training should be the slogan so far as it is possible to enter upon that training an international competition calls for thorough and intelligent work those who are going to make a success of any industry.\n\nScience in an industry makes it interesting. No boy will take an interest in that which does not interest him; he will become its slave instead. The school therefore must foster, mould, and develop interest in the pupil and he must be taught to adapt himself to immediate and sectional surroundings.\n\nMethods maintained and successful in the dry belt are not adapted in wet areas; methods adaptable in the interior are not a success at or in the coast schools. Judgment must be carefully meted out and the child brought up to conform with the development of the province in which he is to live and make a livelihood.\n\nThe tendency of the Indian today is to become an eight hour day man and get into the mechanical line. This tendency must be cultivated on the coast as it seems a workable and feasible proposition there because of the unlimited mechanical development but in the interior care must be taken to keep our Indians at home and in their proper environment industrially as well as physically. One would therefore advocate for the coast Indian a thorough mechanical training and for the interior Indian an intensive agricultural training his mechanical training materially helping him in the work.\n\nNow this system of Community plantation would entail a great deal of thought and a fairly large expenditure. The situation of land would have to be considered in the beginning as the irrigation problem is one not easy to overcome and good judgment in choice would have to be exercised.\n\nConsidering the expenditure I would not advocate giving this modernly built and equipped community over to the Indian Boys without some reserve. They should be made responsible for the investment the investment and also make a small payment each year on the principle which would return in time the initial expense. A boy after being given a trial and found wanting should be changed for more showing of responsibility. The Boys thus placed should not be given complete control of their individual property except in so far as it is his upon which to make a success and when it is considered he has made payment equal to the expenditure the property would become his so long as he used it to the satisfaction of those in supervision. It would be his but he would be unable to rent or sell and would be property to be perpetuated to generations.\n\nI have had long talks with Boys and Girls already graduated and who have stated that they would be glad to enter upon any contract reasonable feeling that they could make good, maintaining that at present they could not get a start and the initial handicap was of life long duration.\n\nI have no hesitancy in saying that this plan of settlement would soon become a source of joy to all concerned. The average Indian Boy and Girl realizes what responsibility is and will take it when given.\n\nIt is true there are still many who know nothing only to live a thriftless irresponsible life, living in the main upon a horse's back, gambling away his best friend\u2014his horse\u2014saddle and saddle blanket when meeting another of the same calibre, yet even this could be corrected by the close supervision available on the Reserve in community system, or leaving such to their own fate would soon bring them back to lead a responsible life adopting the plan mapped out for them.\n\nI would like very much to see a plan of this type tried out and would be glad to offer suggestions or assist in any way. It has been a source of careful thought to me. I am interested in the children and also interested in the relation the Department holds to them and would like to see some plan worked out so that graduates of these interior Schools would become in the course of time, the length of time depending upon the individual Boy and his ability to make a success, independent citizens holding and\nmaintaining the same rights and privileges of any prosperous citizen of the Dominion. I feel an investment of that sort would avail much and would be a concrete proposition. It would return in time money well spent initially with no maintenance other than official supervision which largely could be done by those already in the field through condensation of work brought about by its introduction, instead of being spread over wide areas as it is at the present time.\n\nThe system would eradicate many old evils and traditions by segregation of the young placing among them some of the older Indians who are anxiously looking forward to the time when their affliction of tradition, thriftlessness and irresponsibility will be a story for perpetuation instead of a reality still existing in a small but determined way.\n\nThere still exists many handicaps but these would be a minus quantity in a short time. The present hand-to-mouth existence is not conducive to results in a manner calling for a rapid turnover, but given a working opportunity the Indian Boy and Girl of today will quickly adapt themselves to new spurs onwards, new possibilities and would accept an opening which would allow them to carry on according to the teaching given in the Residential Schools. The pupils themselves would see a future ahead and the worker, especially the heads of these institutions would feel that although the children were leaving their childhood home they would not be lost directly they passed out of the School door at graduation.\n\nThe Indian Residential School of today is only a first step towards stabilization; the work in them must be followed up close till and money are lost. Results accomplished in them would otherwise be of no avail with no return for expenditure.\n\nI could enlarge upon the many evils which surround the Child at his graduation but sufficient it would seem to plan away of escape and materialize same so that the beginning of escape so well established in the Schools will not be lost by having the child return to his former foes.\n\nThe Residential Schools should be the hub around which the present and future life of the Indian child is moulded. His future depending upon himself in ability and responsibility and also upon the opportunity he's given to exercise his early childhood and adolescent training.\n\nI trust that the above will be of some benefit towards the future Educational life and civil establishing of the Indian Child.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nH.

We are naturally very much interested in having the very latest information regarding the work which you are doing and, if there are any special reports on your educational program that have not hitherto been forwarded to this Office, I should appreciate having them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW. Carson Ryan, Jr.,\nDirector of Education.\nSeptember 18, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ryan:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I may say that there are no special reports on the Department's educational programme. Our Annual Reports are the only current printed matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. Carson Ryan, Jr., Esq.,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Affairs Office,\nWashington,\nU.S.A.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Indian Agent Gordon's report on the Norway House Agency for the month of August.\n\nAfter reading this report, and from what I know after having visited the reserve, I am satisfied in my own mind that the Indians are going to have a hard time of it. The problem at Norway House, Berens River, and in fact all the reserves bordering on the Lake, is a very difficult one to solve. At best, these Indians only eke out a hand to mouth existence, and now that there is only a limited amount of fishing carried on, what is there left for them to do? We have had extensive fires and the game is disappearing, and we cannot raise stock nor grain, so that the only solution is to feed these Indians or else move the younger Indians out to the prairies after they graduate from school. This is one reason why I have always thought the Department should give consideration to the matter of bringing the children from those northern points out to the schools on the prairies, and after they graduated many of them would not return to the north. I think it is a great mistake building large schools up in the north; to take a child at seven years of age and keep him in school until he is eighteen, means that he is unfit to carry on a life of hunting, even if there were anything to hunt. The problem is one that should receive very serious consideration. A number of pupils have been brought out from the north to the schools at Brandon and Teckum, and have since found their places on the prairies and are doing very well indeed. Many of the girls are married to white men, are raising families and sending their children to school. They are living like prosperous white people. Whereas had they remained in the north they would be living in a state of near starvation, which I think goes to show that the proper thing to do is to educate them out on the prairies, which gives them a chance to assimilate with white people or to settle on reserves where they can make a living.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The report, titled \"Saskatchewan and Immigration,\" provides an overview of the current state of immigration in the province, including the number of immigrants currently residing in Saskatchewan, the types of immigrants being attracted, and the challenges faced by the province in attracting new residents.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of immigration in promoting economic growth and diversification in Saskatchewan. It also emphasizes the need for a coordinated approach to immigration policy, involving all levels of government and stakeholders in the province.\n\nIn conclusion, the report underscores the potential benefits of immigration for Saskatchewan, and recommends a range of measures to facilitate the integration of new residents into the community. These measures include improving access to language training and employment opportunities, and promoting cultural understanding and acceptance.\n\nOverall, the report provides a valuable resource for policymakers, businesses, and individuals interested in learning more about immigration in Saskatchewan.\nIndustrial Work and Clothing\n\nSir Wilfred Grenfell\n\nWitness and Canadian Homestead, October 21, 1934\n\nThis Point, as follows (Page 605 of Hastings):\n\nThere was a time when the people of the world thought that the only way to solve the problems of poverty and disease was through charity. However, Sir Wilfred Grenfell has shown us that there is another way.\n\nSir Wilfred Grenfell was born in England and came to Canada as a young man. He became interested in the plight of the poor and sick in the North. He decided to do something about it and started a hospital in Labrador.\n\nSir Wilfred Grenfell's hospital was very successful and he was able to help many people. He also started a school for children in Labrador.\n\nSir Wilfred Grenfell was a very kind and generous man. He always tried to help those who needed it. He died in 1934 but his legacy lives on today.\n\nSir Wilfred Grenfell's work in Labrador has inspired many others to help those in need.

Organization\n\nStatistics & Schools Branch from '85\nSchools Branch alone from '94\nEducation of Indians\n\nThe report to hand of the provisions for education of Indian children who are wards of the Dominion Government, indicates that so far as the buildings and staff are concerned Canada is not saving money at the expense of the \"papoosees.\" There are now 78 residential, and 276 day schools with nearly 16,000 pupils in attendance. The residential schools the report states are conducted by the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and United churches, while the public ones provided by the Government and in this connection it should be noted that Manitoba has now two new ones, one already erected at Brandon and one in process of building at Birtle. The amount spent on Indian education in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1929, was $2,215,412.\n\nSide by side, however, with these handsome residences there is arising at least some volume of criticism, not as to the amount of money Canada is spending on these children, nor as to the amount of effort being put forward by the schools, but as to the ultimate results. Canada is making an effort to pay her debt to her first settlers, but are the results at all commensurate with that effort? In other words are large, modern, electrically-machine-equipped schools ideal or even sensible educational plants for children whose tradition and mode of life are far removed from such accessories?\n\nThere is a body of opinion which claims that not only is this education not an advantage, but that it is a detriment and since this opinion comes from persons in close touch with the situation and the \"gooseies,\" perhaps it might be well for those in charge of Indian education to become aware of it. It is claimed that these children brought up in these residences go back to their reserves where the conditions are so vastly different from those of the school, that handicapped already by a nature which does not lend itself to over-exertion and by the hopeless breach of environment, they rapidly sink back and in a year or so have successfully eradicated all the veneer which the white man's well-intentioned efforts have conferred upon them. But the years learning these things to forget have not taught them the things which they might have learned in their own tradition of life.\n\nSupporting this contention are the reports of the tuberculosis organizations which point to the fact that the tuberculosis among Indians as one of the causative factors of the high death rate. If the Indians could be made to realize as they are supposed hopefully to do, to keep a sanitary house and to eat rather than that go to forward the cause of health, there would be a better record, or at least a record more liable to suppose that there would be.\n\nOn the other side, however, is the report of the Census authorities which goes forth that during the past decade the area of land under cultivation by the people increased from 172,195 to 322,751 acres, and that the total income has jumped up from $1,000,000 to $9,745,576. A fairly encouraging record when it is remembered that the population is practically stationary.\n\nHowever desirable it might be the Indians cannot go back to the ways of his ancestors. He must live, if he is to survive, within reasonable distance of the white man's standards. Canada has a good record of her treatment of these people. Her records are still good so that good intentions go. But there does seem to be some room for opinion that the type of approval of the results of the education which is being provided, not with regard to whether it is such provision but that if necessary it may be better adapted to the pupil and to the life from which he came and to which he will return.\nFRANCIS H.

I am enclosing a dozen or so pictures of Indian schools and school children. I am also enclosing our latest Report and wish to refer you to the literary matter on page 15 and to the tabular statements on page 76. You may be interested in the special story of the Mohawk Institute, which is on page 15.\n\nYou will note that there are both day schools and residential schools for Indian children in Canada. The day schools are located on Indian reserves and are comparable to the ordinary rural school. The residential schools are both on and off reserves and they provide vocational, as well as academic, training.

He expressed interest in our work and I would appreciate any advice you could offer us as to:\n\n1. The best methods for teaching Indian students.\n2. The qualifications required for teachers of Indian students.\n3. The best way to integrate Indian students into the regular school system.\n\nThank you very much for your assistance.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. We are planning to hold a special meeting next week to discuss the above matters further.\nOttawa, April 1, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Dodson:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, concerning Indian education generally, and I regret that pressure of business has made it impossible for me to answer until today. There are approximately 235 Indians attending high schools, colleges, universities, colleges, normal schools and business schools. You asked for the number of Indian public school teachers, etc., but I regret that this figure is not obtainable. I would estimate that there are a total of 45 Indians teaching school in Canada. This includes those engaged at Indian schools. One or two have done very well, like Mr. Jamieson, who is teaching in one of the Toronto colleges.\n\nWith reference to your question re assistance given by the Department to worthy students, my first answer replies in part: we are helping approximately all of these students with their special work. In addition, certain promising graduates of our schools are given some assistance to establish themselves on reserves, generally at the time of marriage.\n\nThe average cost of Indian Education for the five fiscal years ended yesterday was $2,250,000 per annum. I am enclosing the latest Report, with the suggestion that, if there is any further information you require, you should write again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe Education of the Indians in Canada\n\nGreat advancement has been made in Canada, particularly of late years, in providing our Indian population with a high standard of education and vocational training. Increased appropriations by Parliament have made possible the construction of new modern schools and the enlargement of existing buildings which have attracted more highly qualified teachers.\n\nThere are now 350 centres of Indian education, attended by over 15,000 pupils, ample evidence of the success of the work in preparing Indian children to become independent and self-supporting citizens of the Dominion.\n\nIn its work for the education of the Indians the Department of Indian Affairs has had close cooperation of religious denominations, which well-established policy has demonstrated beyond all question of doubt the effectiveness of the system.\n\nThe latest addition to the residential schools for Indians is the one opened in September, Manitoba last summer, which is the first of its kind in Canada. It is provided with dormitories, class rooms, study rooms, recreation rooms, sunroom, hospital ward and laundry. Adjacent to the school are a number of fine farm buildings. These residential schools are required owing to the scattered locations of the reserves and also because the occupations of the Indians take them away from their homes.\n\nThe curriculum provides academic instruction equivalent to the second year in high school. In addition, the girls are given a thorough course in domestic science and the boys a course in agriculture together with an elementary training in carpentry and such other trades as will be of use to them when they leave school.\n\nWhile every possible effort is made to impart a sound academic and industrial education, special attention is given to the health of the students to assist in the building up of a robust constitution.\n\nUnder the care and tutelage of the Department of Indian Affairs the practical Indians now have a successful agriculturist. Official records for 1928 show that 65,104 acres in the Prairie Provinces were sown to grain from which were garnered millions of bushels. In addition thousands of bushels of root crops, hay and other fodder were produced.\nThe wireless operator on board the Alice Lacey only tuned in the National transmitter. A hideous creaking jarred on ear and mind, his wife, and through it, the Voice emerged in the middle of a sentence.\n\n\"I have one S.O.S.\"\n\nThe wireless operator listened idly. The floor of the little cabin rose and fell monotonously as the trawler Alice Lacey fought her way through the restless sea. The cabin was a maze of net, full of bewildered and indignant fish. \"Will James Andrews \u2014 A.N.R.E.T. \u2014 be able to reach the trawler Alice Lacey, at present fishing somewhere in the North Sea, please inform me once more how well his wife is?\" And the voice sank to nothing under a fresh onslaught of squall and a violent sea weather. The message was not repeated.\n\nA little switch clicked under the wireless operator's hand. He slipped off the headphones.\n\nHeavy feet stamped overhead. \"Andrews\u2014what a coincidence!\" He went up the darkened ladder. Bert, in slippers, was coming down the stairway. The wireless operator called, \"Bert!\"\n\n\"Bert, I've just picked up a call\u2014S.O.S\u2014for Jim Andrews. He's got to go home at speed. His wife is\u2014and there's something else. The rest of the message had been smothered under atmospheric interference. 'Get hold of him,' said the Voice.\"\n\nThe man rebuttoned the neck of his slacks and ran up the stairway. His wet back glistened in the lamplight. The wireless operator took off the headphones. The bows of the Alice Lacey thundered into the roar of waves as he burst them into clouds of breath-catching spray which drenched the man's neck and drenched his soul, all at once. \"Where's Andrews? Where's hell's Andrews? Wanted, here...\"\n\nAnd presently, Andrews came in. He drew up in the little wireless cabin to get confirmation of the words bawled into the air by the Voice. He was listening to the results of the day's play in the League matches.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Grandfather Bill. \"A very awful groan was wrung from him. Then a huge hand on his shoulder shook him roughly and the headphones slipped over his face.\n\n\"Hello, Andrews...\" This is good ten.\" Tom Chedder, just beginning to catch it. Something about your wife...\"\n\n\"Mary...\"\n\n\"I didn't hear the end of the message. But\u2014well\u2014\" he dropped his eyes before the steady and rather stupid glare of the lamp. \"You know those S.O.S.\u2014generally sent when dangerously ill, don't they? I'm sorry old man...\"\n\n\"Mary...\"\n\nAndrews seemed to have rather thickened his receptive powers. Then, \"Dangerously ill? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The S.O.S on the wireless, man!\" The wireless operator's voice sounded impatient, though he looked curiously at Andrews.\n\n\"Aye, of course.\" Andrews put out his hand. \"What made you come home so sudden?\"\n\n\"Someone sent for me on\u2014\"\n\n\"And right in the middle of that sentence he stopped speaking. For all his mannerisms, with extraordinary vivacity, the wireless operator of the Alice Lacey was speaking again those half-heeded words.\n\n\"Mary...\"\n\n\"Mary...\"\n\nAndrews sank into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. All that he had gone through\u2014the shocking news, the night race with its hope and fear, misery and death\u2014now this did surprise; all he had gone through overcame and overwhelmed him, and his spirit gave way.\n\nThe woman came a few paces towards him, and stood looking at him. \"Jim,\" she said, faintly. \"I didn't know you were here.\"\n\nHe looked up. He still could not believe that it was his wife, alive and well, standing there, back-forth because of the tears in his eyes. He began to struggle with his feelings because he could not trust himself to speak just yet. As he did so, he saw the partly-packed suitcase lying open on the floor; his clothes were laid out over the back of a chair\u2014ready. The woman closed her eyes. He put away his hand slowly.\n\n\"What's this, Mary?\"\n\nOnly her eyelids tightened away, Mary?\"\nThe National Council of Women of Canada\n\nPresident\nMRS. J. A.

As National Convenor of Education, I am seeking to have both the booth on Education and the programme on Education as representative as possible of the departments of education that should be known by all the people and that are perhaps not as well understood by some as they should be. Would you be willing to cooperate with us in the demonstration of the work of some one or more of the Indian Schools?\n\nIf we are able to have revolving pictures illustrating the different phases of education, could you provide for us some pictures that would illustrate the work that is being done?

I shall be very glad to cooperate with you and secure an exhibit of work from one or more of our Indian schools. No doubt, the Department can also supply pictures that will illustrate the work, provided I have little more information concerning what you would like. I think perhaps a chart could be prepared, showing the extent and differentiation of the work that is being done for Indian schools. This will be given some thought, and, when I write to you next, I will send a rough sketch for your advice and help.\n\nWhen your plans have crystallized, please let this Department hear further from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

The first suggestion that came to my mind was that you should examine the reports of this Department for the period 1975 - 1905, but I am unable to find that they have ever been sent to either the University of Alberta or to the Library at the Legislature. I therefore propose to give you some information in this letter. From this, suggestions will come to you, regarding the next step you should pursue.\n\nAt the present time, there are being conducted in Alberta 20 Indian residential schools, as shown on page 85 of our latest report, a copy of which is enclosed. One is missing from the list, and at the present time, it has been changed to day school activity, pending the completion of the new residential school main building. I refer to the Old Sun's institution, on the Blackfoot reserve, which is conducted by the Department and the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. On page 81 you will note that in addition to the Sarcee Indian Day School, there is also one shown at Morley, but this is really an adjunct of the residential school there and need not be considered independently. Briefly, there are 20 Indian residential schools and one day school operating in the province. Strictly speaking, there are three other day schools which are really in Alberta, although we list them under Saskatchewan because they are in the Onion Lake agency. I refer to the schools at Cold Lake, Frog Lake and Long Lake. You will find these also on page 81. So that you will have a general understanding of the work that is being done, you might read the literary matter on page 13. This part of our latest report is rather brief, as I wanted some special room for the story of the Mohawk Institute, which commences on page 15. I am therefore enclosing a copy of the report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1928, and wish to refer you to page 11.\n\nI am also enclosing a set of short articles that I have written for \"Natural Resources\", a bulletin of the Department of the Interior. These will help you\n\nRev. Brother Francis,\nUniversity Catholic College,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nto an understanding of the present situation. This set, you will please return to me as soon as you have taken any notes that you wish, as it is the only complete set I now have.\n\nSo that you will have a further understanding of the work as it now is, I would suggest that you have an interview with the Reverend Sister Superior at the Yuville Convent at St. Albert. This institution is for both white and Indian children and it ranks as an Indian residential school as far as this Department is concerned. You should also have an interview with Rev. J. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, which is approximately 7 miles north of the city, to the east of St. Albert.\n\nAfter this preparation, you will have an understanding of the maintenance, supervision, organization and management of our existing schools. The Sister Superior and Mr. Woodsworth can, perhaps, go back a little into the history of Indian schools in Alberta.\n\nTo give you additional help in connection with the history of the work, I am writing brief notes concerning the residential schools, which, of course, are the most important factor in our Alberta Indian education programme.\n\nST.

BRUNO'S - First government grant as residential school 1914: originally church-owned; now government-owned.\n\nEDMONTON - First government grant 1924: this was really the same activity as the school at Red Deer: government-owned.\n\nDay schools were conducted by the various churches in Alberta for some years before the Government gave any assistance. In some cases, they took a few pupils in residence. At the time of Confederation, there was practically no government organization or control of Indian schools in Alberta. Such as existed were supported for the most part by Missionary Societies, Religious Orders and the Indian Bands themselves.\n\nAbout 1885, the Federal Government came to the rescue of the churches doing the work and gave to residential schools a per capita grant for current expenses. This grant has been increased from time to time and, at the present time, amounts to an average of about $170 per child per year, based on the actual average attendance. During the last 10 years, the Department has tried to undertake, not only the current expenses at Indian schools, but practically all of the capital expense as well. Before 1920, certain schools were assisted with their capital expense and other schools were erected entirely by the Government, but considerable church and missionary money was being used for the purpose. In the northern part of the province, this obtains to this day. The Roman Catholic and the Anglican Churches still have the major equity in the physical equipment. From Edmonton south, however, where there are situated the largest schools, the Government owns practically all the properties.\n\nI have made additional enquiries since the first page of this letter was written, and I find that, for some time now, the King's Printer has been sending copies of our Annual Reports to both the University of Alberta and to the Library at the Legislature. With the start that this letter gives you, you should be able to...\nget considerable information from these reports. Up to 1916, there was more detail in our printed reports. The tabular statement for the 1916 report is found on page 126 as far as the day schools are concerned and on page 134 for the residential schools. In addition, there is the special report of the Superintendent of Indian Education. You will find interesting information concerning the Alberta schools on pages 151-2, -3, -4 and -5. There is additional literary matter extracted from the reports of the various schools to be found on page 167. The expenditure will be found on page H56 (Auditor General's Report 1915-16) and the residential schools for Alberta, on page 47 for the industrial schools and page 49 for the boarding schools. I may state, at this time, that we no longer distinguish between boarding and industrial schools. They are all known as residential schools. Originally, there was a distinction. The Government established the industrial schools and the Church owned and conducted buildings were known as the boarding schools. Today, this distinction has disappeared, and the type of instruction in all residential schools is quite uniform.\n\nThe reports prior to 1916 give similar information. You will notice that our reports are considerably briefer as from 1917 to the present. The information concerning schools will be found in three places. Using the 1917 report as a guide, please see page 14 for the literary matter, pages 72 and 80 for the tabular statements and pages H45, 48 and 56 of the Auditor General's report for the expenditure. I am taking it for granted that you can see the reports to which I refer at one of the libraries. There is another possibility in connection with these annual reports. A good set might be found at the Indian agent's office, Edmonton (Mr. G. O. Laight).\n\nIf there is any additional assistance you need from the Department, please do not hesitate to let me know your requirements. This letter will be found somewhat rambling in character, because I have dictated it two or three times during the day, but I trust that you will find it helpful.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

As you read you will note that practically all the Indian schools are conducted by the Department of Indian Affairs and the various churches that are interested in the evangelization of our wards. Approximately 85% of the current expenses are met from Parliamentary Appropriation, and, during later years, nearly all of the capital expense also has been undertaken by the Department. The Department pays the salaries of all day school teachers and gives a per capita grant, based on the average attendance, at the residential schools. This per capita grant is then used by the principals to meet the current costs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn A.

At least this is my conviction in those parts where you have established for their children your splendid modern Residential Schools and where on the Reserves you have been able, through your Agents, to teach the Indians the laws of hygiene.\n\nI heard that these utterances caused some astonishment in the scientific world abroad. To a certainty I had never thought that my humble opinion on the matter would be given such credit. I would be glad to know what you think yourself on the question, and I hope I am not taking too much of your time in asking you to give a little consideration to the subject and answer me at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to the population of Indians in western Canada and the hope for their future. Generally speaking, the rapid decline in Indian population in Canada as a whole ended about 100 years ago. It is estimated that there were approximately 115,000 Indians in Canada in 1830. There was a slow decrease until the beginning of the 20th century, when the population was known to be roughly 105,000. During the past 30 years, the number of Indians has slightly increased. The best figures available at present are 108,000. In a few months, the results of the decennial census will be known and a very accurate figure can be given.\n\nWith particular reference to the Indians of western Canada, concerning whom your comments have occasioned surprise, for your information I compare the figures of 1912 and 1929.\n\n|                | 1912   | 1929   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Manitoba       | 10,373 | 12,263 |\n| Saskatchewan   | 9,545  | 10,784 |\n| Alberta        | 8,113  | 9,846  |\n| Northwest Territories | 5,262 | 4,615  |\n| British Columbia | 24,781 | 25,107 |\n\nThese figures show that the Indians of the West have, to some degree, won an immunity from the white man's diseases that at first contact created such havoc. So, there is certainly considerable truth to your remarks.\n\nAs far as industry is concerned, there is no doubt that great strides have been made in the last 20 years in western Canada.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell F. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nToronto, Ontario,\nJuly 7, 1931.\n\nMr. H.T. Ferriar,\nDirector of Indian Education,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the distribution of our catalogue, it would be of interest to us to learn the location of the different Indian schools. We would also very much like to know the number of staff and the number of students resident in each of these schools.\n\nWe would esteem it a great favour if you would let us have this information at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Main Johnson, Publicity Manager.)\nOttawa, July 10, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, and, in reply, I am enclosing a list of Indian Residential Schools with post office addresses and number of students in each case. As far as the number of staff is concerned, as a general rule, for a pupilage of from 50 to 60, there are 7 members; the average sized school is about 125 and they have 10 or 11 on the staff: the largest schools, i.e., those with 250 to 275 pupils, have from 20 to 25 officers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Ferrier,\n\nWith respect to the question as to whether the capital of a minor Indian can be used for his education, I have to say that a ward is entitled to be educated in accordance with his station and prospects in life and the interest of his capital can always be used by his guardian for such purpose. If the interest is not sufficient, the guardian would have to get the consent of the court before he could make payment from the capital and such consent is invariably given. I think accordingly that the capital of an Indian minor could be used for his education with the consent of the Superintendent General.\n\n(Sgd.) A. S.

I have had a meeting, however, and they very deeply appreciate the thoughtful tone of your letter and the character of the support that you are willing to give to us in the matter of the exhibit in the Educational booth at the Canadian National Exhibition.\n\nIn your letter, number 1-1-1, of April 29, 1931, you said that you would be willing to cooperate and secure an exhibit of work from one or more of the Indian schools. Our booth for the exhibitive work is nine feet by twelve. I am sure from the many schools that the material that you may submit will be of great interest to those who see it, and I hope will arouse wide interest because of the many people from widely different sections of the country who attend the Exhibition.\n\nThe chart should be about two and a half feet wide by three feet long. One representing the work of the Indian schools could be very attractive because of the rich colouring that could be used on it.\n\nI shall be here for the greater part of the vacation period up to the Exhibition time and shall be glad to cooperate with you concerning a sketch if you care to send one to me. Concerning the pictures, I have secured a sixteen mm. cinema projector and could use a film taken of the Indian schools, or of Indian\nThe National Council of Women of Canada\n\nHonorary President\nHER EXCELLENCY THE VISCOUNTESS WILLINGDON, G.B.E., C.I.\n\nPresident\nMRS.

If you do not have a film I shall be glad to know in what form you have pictures and we shall be glad to use them.\n\nWe are quite pleased with the cooperation that we are receiving from the different departments of education and hope that we can do something to make the general public not only more interested in the form of education that is nearest to the individual, but in the extra-curricular education. I am hoping, too, to arouse some thought in the minds of our people concerning standardization. It has always been impossible and always will be impossible to standardize human beings as to ability and to interest, but the world needs the highest development and individual tendency and ability and we need more and more in Canada of development of the unusual since our country is not yet untouched as to its possibilities.\n\nI thank you for the kind expression of your cooperation.

There were in operation during the year 80 residential and 272 day schools; or 2 more residential schools than the previous year, and the same number of day schools. The enrolment increased from 15,743 to 16,415, and the average attendance, which is the important figure, from 11,579 to 12,231, an increase in one year of 5.63%. Further, pupils were more regular in attendance during 1930-31, the figure being 74.51% of the enrolment as compared with 73.55% for the previous year.\n\nIt may be of interest to briefly review the progress in Indian education during the past 50 years. The following table, with percentage increases for each decennial period, indicates the increasing importance of the work and shows that a very satisfactory step forward has been taken during the past 10 years.\n\n| Year | Number of Schools | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance | Decennial Attendance Increase |\n|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1881 | 114              | 4,126     | 2,088              | 50.60                   | -                             |\n| 1891 | 268              | 7,554     | 4,194              | 55.52                   | 100.86%                       |\n| 1901 | 290              | 9,576     | 6,117              | 63.88                   | 45.85%                        |\n| 1911 | 324              | 11,190    | 6,763              | 60.44                   | 10.56%                        |\n| 1921 | 326              | 12,558    | 8,074              | 64.29                   | 19.38%                        |\n| 1931 | 352              | 16,415    | 12,231             | 74.51                   | 51.48%                        |\n\nParticularly gratifying is the improvement in the attendance regularity during the past decade. From 64.29% to 74.51% shows a remarkable awakening on the part of Indian communities and parents. In 1920, compulsory education of Indian children was provided by statute, and the Act is enforced, particularly when supported by the opinion of the most progressive Indians on a reserve. However, the main reason for improvement in attendance at Indian schools is a growing conviction on the part of our wards that their children must be better fitted for the future. Fewer and fewer natives are finding it possible to live by the chase and they are turning towards education to prepare themselves for encroaching civilization.\n\nThose somewhat familiar with the educational work of the Department and the Churches may argue that the rapid increase in residential school attendance, which is naturally quite regular, is largely responsible for this improvement. It should be stated that\nthe residential school percentages of attendance have always been good and that practically the entire credit is with the pupils of day schools, who come so largely under the influence of their parents. The following tables show the residential and day schools separately for the past 40 years. Earlier figures distinguishing between the two types of school are not available and are not so valuable for purposes of comparison, as the work was hardly well established. As far as the residential schools are concerned, the figures for 1901 are really the first that should be considered. It will be noted that the percentage of attendance at residential schools has been quite constant for 30 years and that the improvement lies entirely with the day schools. In fact, for the past 10 years, the percentage of attendance for day schools has increased from 50.56 to 61.90\u2014a greater improvement than that of all schools taken together.\n\n| Year | Number of Schools | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance | Decennial Increase |\n|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1891 | 37               | 1,352     | 1,082              | 80.03                   | -                 |\n| 1901 | 64               | 3,455     | 3,095              | 89.58                   | 186.04%           |\n| 1911 | 75               | 3,842     | 3,382              | 88.02                   | 9.27%             |\n| 1921 | 73               | 4,785     | 4,143              | 86.62                   | 22.50%            |\n| 1931 | 80               | 7,831     | 6,917              | 88.33                   | 66.95%            |\n\nThe percentage of attendance at rural and village day schools in Canada is approximately 69. At Indian day schools, the figure is nearly 62, which, while encouraging, leaves much room for improvement. However, it should be remembered that the Department's wards are among the most nomadic of Canadians.\n\nIt may be of interest to analyze the attendance to show the figures for those provinces where there are\na sufficient number of day schools to permit comparison. Residential schools are not included in this table. The figures show the gain in average attendance during the past 10 years and the increase in percentage of attendance or regularity for the same period. In the provinces not mentioned, there are only two or three day schools and comparisons would not be of value.\n\nDay School Attendance during past 10 years.\n\n| Province       | Attendance Increase | Regularity Increase |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Nova Scotia    | 37%                 | 12.97%             |\n| New Brunswick  | 46%                 | 13.00%             |\n| Quebec         | 33%                 | 9.81%              |\n| Ontario        | 38%                 | 15.89%             |\n| Manitoba       | 51%                 | 14.22%             |\n| Saskatchewan   | 39%                 | 9.21%              |\n| British Columbia | 22%                | 2.75%              |\n\nDuring the year, there was a change made in the compulsory education clause in the Indian Act. It is now possible to compel the attendance of every physically fit Indian child between the full ages of 7 and 16 years, and, in very special cases, the Superintendent General may direct that a pupil be kept in school until he has reached the full age of 18 years. Of course, the usual practice at Indian residential schools is to encourage pupils to remain until they are 17 or 18.\n\nIn Part II of this report will be found tabular statements, showing the location, naming those in charge and indicating the enrolment and attendance at all Indian schools. Day schools on reserves, where our wards are permanently settled, quite properly are becoming increasingly important. Special efforts have been made during the year to increase the efficiency at those day schools where there is a large average attendance. Better qualified teachers are being engaged and modern texts and other instruments of instruction are being placed in their hands.\n\nGenerally speaking, residential schools enjoyed a particularly successful year. At these institutions, emphasis is placed on vocational training, religious instruction and the care of health. The various churches, as shown hereunder, cooperate\nwith the Department in the residential school activity, to the advantage of all concerned.\n\nRoman Catholic - 44 residential Schools\nChurch of England - 21 \"\nUnited Church - 13 \"\nPresbyterian Church - 2 \"\nTotal - 80 \"\n\nIndian schools follow the provincial curricula, but special emphasis is placed on language, reading, domestic science, manual training and agriculture. Frequent inspections are made by officers of the Department. In addition, public and separate school inspectors visit all classrooms, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian School Inspectors.\n\nDuring the year, new main buildings were completed at four residential schools - Brandon, Man. (Brandon); Punnichy, Sask. (Gordon's); Gleichen, Alta. (Old Suns); and Grouard, Alta. (St. Bruns). The buildings at the Birtle Indian Residential School in Manitoba; the Muscowequan Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan; and the Blue Quills Indian Residential School in Alberta had outlived their usefulness, and reconstruction was commenced during the year. There was also started a new main building at the Beauval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan, which had been destroyed by fire in 1927. Grants were given to the church authorities towards the cost of important improvements at the Albany Indian Residential School, on James Bay, and the Providence Indian Residential School, in the North West Territories. Minor improvements were undertaken at several other residential schools and new classrooms were erected at a few day schools, where the work was well established.\n\nThe practice of assisting the most promising and industrious graduates of Indian schools was continued. Approximately 260 young Indian men and women were helped to continue their studies or to establish homes. Except in those Indian communities where successful farming is found, the school graduate presents a problem which is very difficult of solution. The Department and the churches interested are trying new schemes and searching for better methods of helping the young people to establish themselves.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1931, amounting to\n$2,754,395.47, is analyzed in the following table. In addition to this amount, there was expended for educational purposes from a special appropriation for British Columbia Indians the sum of $14,527.03. This last amount was used for technical training at B.C. Indian schools and in assisting promising graduates to continue their studies.\n## Indian Education Vote\n\n### Expenditure for Year 1930-31\n\n| Province          | Day Schools | Residential Schools | Stationery | Tuition & Assistance to Ex-Pupils | Miscellaneous | Total       |\n|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Nova Scotia       | 13,556.21   | 46,281.96          | 1,702.21   | 1,641.12                         | 8.55          | 63,190.06   |\n| Prince Edward Island | 1,069.32    |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| New Brunswick     | 18,968.51   |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Quebec            | 75,119.51   |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Ontario           | 138,669.57  |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Manitoba          | 66,961.87   |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Saskatchewan      | 42,600.81   |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Alberta           | 3,219.27    |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Northwest Territories | 3,497.00    |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| British Columbia  | 2,982.00    |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n| Yukon             | 45,861.35   |                    |            |                                  |               |             |\n\nTotal: 2,231,293.66\nItem 33\n\nINDIAN WORK.\n\n(a) Resolutions passed at Conference of Indian Missionaries and Leaders held at Norway House in July last, referred to the Executive by the Sub-Executive:\n\n(i) Whereas, feeling the urgent need of following up the work of the industrial and residential schools and keeping in touch with the graduates and other Indians employed off the reserve,\n\n- 5 -\n\nItem 33 (a) cont'd\n\nResolutions passed at Conference of Indian Missionaries and Leaders -\n\n(i) Be it resolved that we recommend the appointment of a placement officer for Manitoba who would have the oversight of all such young people, placing them in suitable homes, finding them proper employment, and having a general kindly supervision of their advancement.\n\nBe it further resolved that we ask the Board of Home Missions to make a strong representation to the Department of Indian Affairs urging the appointment of such an officer as soon as possible.\n\n(ii) That in the opinion of this Convention of Indian Workers assembled at Norway House, July 1st to 5th, the experiment has proved a success in its value to the Workers both new and old, and also to the Indian people...........\n\nWe would therefore request the Board of Home Missions that, if possible, a similar conference be arranged for another year.\n\n(iii) Whereas it is the consensus of opinion of this Conference of Workers among Indians that, after reviewing the results of missionary work and educational work of both the Church and the Department of Indian Affairs, we are convinced that the Indian under present conditions and in his present environment has no adequate opportunity of carrying into practice the training and teaching he has already received;\n\nNow, therefore, we the missionaries assembled feel that the time has fully arrived for the making of a stronger effort by the Church to improve the economic condition of the Indians in order that a progressive movement might be instituted among them by which they might be more quickly prepared for self-support, leading to Canadian citizenship.\nFlandreau Indian School,\nFlandreau, South Dakota,\n\nNovember, 1931.\n\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSirs:\n\nPlease send us catalogues, price lists or other information as to any machines or materials that you may have that would be suitable in the organization of a department of visual education at this school.\n\nThis would include machines to show films, slides or views and any material such as films, slides, views, pictures, charts, graphs and the like which may be used in such a program whether it be for sale, rent, loan or free distribution.\n\nThis school has enrolled approximately 500 Indian students in Junior and Senior High School work.

Antoinette,\nNotre Dame Convent,\nWaterdown, Ont.\nCULTIVATING INDIAN IDEAS\n\nThere is a growing desire in the United States Indian department to follow the trend of the native mind in various essentials. It is being better realized that more latitude in the red man's home and economic life gives a better cultural showing, than to force upon him the white man's ways.\n\nThis has long been the Canadian point of view. Our Indian guardians have consistently followed the course of preserving the native atmosphere on the various Indian reserves, while useful educational instruction has not deprived our Indians of certain individual and traditional tendencies of value.\n\nIndian boarding schools across the line are now recognizing craft schools, as a matter of conservation of native craft and artisanship of value. Boarding schools are being restricted to Indian pupils of more advanced age. There is a distinct attempt to revive knowledge of native arts and crafts by drawing on all of the schools. Native teachers are being encouraged.\n\nThis recognition of the Indian point of view arises out of the efforts of many devoted white men and women, who have been able to see the \"other side\" of so-called \"Indian problems.\"\n\"The purpose of education for any indigenous peoples at the present day is to help these peoples, both as groups and as individuals, to adjust themselves to modern life, protecting and preserving as much of their own way of living as possible and capitalizing their economic and cultural resources for their own benefit and their contribution to modern civilization. The effort should begin with the Indian people in their own environment or in some comparable environment, in which they can develop their own resources. The Indian educational problem is to work over from a more or less conventional institution conception of education to one that is local and individual. Boarding schools should be for special purposes, at least partly vocational.\n\nUtilize Indian arts and crafts wherever these exist or can be revived. Grasp opportunities to put Indian children into local public schools rather than into government boarding schools.\n\nIn the United States, they have appointed visiting teachers, who are really field matrons, for the purpose of coordinating home and school. (R.T.F.'s note - This language \"Visiting teacher\" suggests another type of employee, one who has been really successful and who has a broad viewpoint should be employed to supplement the work of the public and separate school inspectors. Such a worker would really be a junior Inspector of Indian Schools). In the States, State curricula are suggested for the Indian service as guides but are not slavishly followed.\n\n\"It is estimated that the same sum of money that is required for 100 children of elementary school age in a boarding school will provide an adequate educational programme, including necessary food, clothing and follow-up service, for at least half as many more if expended in the local community - and with better ultimate results. It is both better economy and better education to leave the children in their own homes. That the Indians themselves should be consulted regarding these and other plans for education of their children is axiomatic. We welcome signs of initiative on the part of Indians to work themselves free from dependence and take an interest in their own educational affairs.\"\n\nIn the United States, they are substituting the lure of good facilities, good personnel and need of education for the dragging-in method of enrolment.\nOttawa, February 15, 1932.\n\nDear Brother Francis:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of May 4th, last, and to my request that you return the set of short articles in \"Natural Resources\". This is the only set I had and I am very desirous of having them again.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Stewart\nOttawa, March 17, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to courses in commercial education in any Indian schools of British Columbia. A scattering of commercial work is offered to the pupils of the Coqualeetza, St. George's and Alert Bay Indian Residential Schools. The first is under the management of the United Church and is situated at Sardis; the second and third are under the management of the Church of England: St. George's being situated at Lytton and Alert Bay at Alert Bay. The last two institutions are the only residential schools under the Church of England in the province. There are a few day schools where the Church of England is associated with the Department, but the course offered is very elementary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

SCOTT,\n\nThe latest census shows that there are 23,290 Indian children of school age. 16,400 are attending Indian schools and an additional 300 are being educated in white schools\u2014a total of 16,700, or 71.7% of the total number of school age.\n\nIn the northern parts of Canada, there are approximately 3,835 Indian children of school age whose parents live by the chase, and schools for these would be very difficult to undertake, nor is it desirable that such children receive a white man's education at the present time. The present generation of these hunting and nomadic Indians of the North are better off if left alone. Their contact with whites is negligible.\n\nApproximately 7\u00bd% of the Indian children of school age, numbering about 1,630, have no school facilities. It is timely now to consider extending our programme to embrace these, although there is no particular pressure being brought to bear upon the Department from the Indians themselves or from any other sources. Approximately 2\u00bd% of the Indian children of school age are delinquents. School facilities are available, but, for one reason or another, attendance has not been compelled in their case. This group is rapidly diminishing. The remainder, approximately 3\u00bd%, are physically or mentally unfit for an education.\n\nTo recapitulate:\n\n- 71.7% - in school.\n- 16.4% - school facilities not now desirable.\n- 7\u00bd% - additional school facilities should be considered.\n- 2\u00bd% - delinquents\n- 3\u00bd% - unfit.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nTHE FIRST CANADIANS.\n\nThe impending resignation of Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa will create a vacancy in the highest important post. The distinguished poet has filled a key position in the Department for more than half a century. To select a successor for such an outstanding State servant would be a matter of nation-wide concern, and it is one which is of even more importance now. For it has become increasingly apparent in the past few years that Canada's whole relationship toward the Indians should be reviewed.\n\nIt is quite possible that the retirement of Dr. Scott will expedite an opportunity for reorganizing the Department and realigning the whole work of Indian welfare, on a scale inexpedient at other times.\n\nThe recent interviews and letters in The Globe from Mr. John Butterfield, a responsible and respected prospector in Northern Ontario, have at last drawn attention to the gravity of the allegations of Canadian officials against his charges. For if Mr. Butterfield's charges are true, Indians are not only living in an appalling state of semi-famine. They are not only suffering from the scourges of deadly disease. But they are also being subjected to destruction and physical affliction because\u2014to use a blunt term\u2014they have been \"double-crossed\" by His Majesty's Government in the Dominion of Canada.\n\nIf Mr. Butterfield's charges are true, the Indians are not getting the medical attention to which they are entitled, not only under the laws of common decency or humanity, but under the very letter of the supposedly solemn treaties which they were induced to sign.\n\nIf Mr. Butterfield were but one observer making rather sensational charges the tendency might be to brush them aside as isolated and but one lapse away from a mere local condition. But the fact is that Mr. Butterfield's charges are but substantiations of reports made by no less a noted public servant than Captain Roy Maxwell, Commissioner of the Department of Ontario. A few years ago Captain Maxwell had occasion to make an emergency flight into the Far North on a mission of mercy. He brought back a story of sickness and disaster tragic enough to stir the hardest hearts.\n\nThe essential point is that the Indians surrendered properties of enormous value for certain considerations. Money payments\u2014small in comparison with the real value of the land\u2014played their part. But the Canadian representatives of the King also promised the Indians certain services\u2014medical attention and supplies.\n\nAre these treaties being honored? Or are they being flouted like nine-tenths of all other treaties have been flouted by white men in their dealings with North American Indians?\n\nPerhaps Tecumseh was right when he made those speeches as eloquent as any that ever came from the lips of Lincoln or Laurier. The great Indian chieftain convinced the confederacy which he bound together by sheer force of his own marvellous personality that the last hope of the American Indians lay in the union of all of the tribes. Thus Through Yet Tecumseh himself lived to pour scorn on the British General who failed to honor his own King's agreement with the Indian leader and whose cowardice was partly responsible for Tecumseh's death.\n\nThe history of the century following Tecumseh's death is not such as to shed lustre on Canada's treatment of the Indians. Indian relations became the sole responsibility of the National Government after the days of Confederation. Yet Governments of all parties came and went, and the Department of Indian Affairs was regarded, by whatever party happened to be in power, as just another necessary function.\n\nIf there is any censure to be levied as a result of this state of affairs, it should not be placed on the Departmental officials. If the true story could be told it would probably be found that the politicians\u2014politically or unpolitically\u2014forge the Indians as much as possible\u2014because the Indians have no votes.\n\nThe degeneration and decay of a great race is a tragic thing. Is it inevitable? How many Canadians know that the Indians, who are not supposed to be able to adapt themselves to modern civilization, make the best structural steel workers available\u2014virtually monopolizing that hazardous occupation in some cities?\n\nCanada's relations with the Indians afford a striking contrast with those between New Zealand and the Maoris. Perhaps the reason why New Zealanders put Canada to shame is because the Maori representatives have always been permitted to speak for their own people on the floor of Parliament.\n\nIf the Bennett Government is willing to make a start toward atonement for a sorry chapter in Canadian administration by having some small, competent body make a survey of actual conditions of Indian life in Canada.\n\nIf Canadians as a whole could be given an authentic clear picture of Indian life\u2014after the manner of the Royal Commission on social welfare in Ontario\u2014a real start might be made toward redressing Indian wrongs.\n\nA Canada-First Government should not be indifferent to the plight of the First Canadians.\nOttawa, June 11, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAbout a year ago, I sent to Rev.

There is but one residential school under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church - the one at Binslee, Man. The Church of England has several, as shown on Pages 57 to 59 of the 1931 Annual Report, a copy of which is enclosed. I may say that most of these Anglican Indian residential schools are managed by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. The Field Secretary is Rev. T. R. R.

For the fiscal year 1931-32, there was an enrolment of over 17,000 and an average attendance of over 13,000. The percentage of attendance was 76.36, which is a record for the work. The following table shows the rapid increase in enrolment and attendance during the past 10 years:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1921-22     | 5,031     | 4,360         | 7,990     | 4,308             | 13,021    | 8,668             | 66.56                  |\n| 1922-23     | 5,347     | 4,695         | 8,376     | 4,411             | 13,723    | 9,106             | 66.36                  |\n| 1923-24     | 5,673     | 4,856         | 8,199     | 4,332             | 13,872    | 9,188             | 66.23                  |\n| 1924-25     | 6,031     | 5,278         | 8,191     | 4,601             | 14,222    | 9,379             | 69.46                  |\n| 1925-26     | 6,327     | 5,658         | 8,455     | 4,940             | 14,782    | 10,598            | 71.69                  |\n| 1926-27     | 6,641     | 5,891         | 8,069     | 4,660             | 14,710    | 10,541            | 71.66                  |\n| 1927-28     | 6,795     | 6,043         | 8,223     | 4,823             | 15,018    | 10,866            | 72.35                  |\n| 1928-29     | 7,075     | 6,282         | 8,272     | 4,976             | 15,347    | 11,258            | 73.35                  |\n| 1929-30     | 7,302     | 6,476         | 8,441     | 5,103             | 15,743    | 11,579            | 73.55                  |\n| 1930-31     | 7,931     | 6,917         | 8,584     | 5,314             | 16,415    | 12,231            | 74.51                  |\n| 1931-32     | 8,213     | 7,400         | 8,950     | 5,707             | 17,163    | 13,107            | 76.36                  |\n\nDuring the year, 80 residential schools and 270 day schools were in operation - a total of 350 centres of Indian educational activity. There were no changes in the residential schools during the year, but\ntwo day schools, where the attendance was poor, were closed. Although Parliament's Appropriation for Indian Education was materially reduced, the Department has been able to maintain its educational services in full. Of necessity, however, comparatively little was expended for new buildings and for the repair of existing physical equipment. During the year, new main buildings were completed at three residential schools:- Birtle, Man. (Birtle); Lestook, Sask. (Muscowequan); and St. Paul, Alta. (Blue Quills). Further, the Department assisted the church authorities with the reconstruction of main buildings at the following Indian residential schools:- Albany, on James Bay, Ont., St. Bruno's, near Grouard, Alta., and Wabasca R. C., at Wabasca, Alta.\n\nAt Indian day schools, the Department is trying to make the work as attractive as possible and to correlate classroom exercises with reserve and Indian home activities. At the residential schools, vocational training continues to receive the proper emphasis. The management of these institutions are giving every assistance to the Department with this programme. The cooperation of the churches in the management of these residential schools is as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Number of Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 44                            |\n| Church of England       | 21                            |\n| United Church           | 13                            |\n| Presbyterian Church     | 2                             |\n| **Total**               | **80**                        |\n\nAt the present time, Indian schools adopt the provincial curricula but place special emphasis on language, reading, domestic science, manual training and agriculture. It is hoped to prescribe, in the near future, a complete course of studies for Indian schools in Canada. In the junior grades, at least, there will be a departure from the provincial courses, which are not altogether suitable in either scope or content for Indian children. During the past few months, there have been published some exceptionally suitable readers and other texts. It is hoped to supply these to Indian schools.\n\nAll Indian schools are regularly inspected by officers of the Department. In addition, public and separate school inspectors visit all classrooms, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian school inspectors. Fully qualified teachers are engaged whenever possible.\n\nThe health of Indian children studying in boarding schools continues to receive special attention.\n\n- Good medical\nGood medical supervision has been arranged and much thought is given to physical education, proper diet and sanitation. During the year, extraordinary care was taken to prevent the loss of life by fire. In the schools where the hazard is serious, night watchmen are employed and at all schools fire drill is practised regularly.\n\nThe practice of assisting the most promising and industrious graduates of Indian schools was continued. Approximately 250 young Indian men and women were helped to continue their studies or to establish homes. Except in those Indian communities where successful farming is found, the school graduate presents a problem which is very difficult of solution. The department and the churches interested are trying new schemes and searching for better methods of helping the young people to establish themselves.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1932, amounting to $2,004,957.34, is analyzed in the following table. In addition to this amount, there was expended for educational purposes from a special appropriation for British Columbia Indians the sum of $14,636.12. This last amount was used for technical training at British Columbia Indian schools and in assisting promising graduates to continue their studies.\nThe Minister,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am very anxious to obtain, for classroom purposes, materials, including pictures if possible, on the Indians, especially of the western plains.\n\nI should like very much to get charts or maps showing the situation of the various reserves and information in general on the various tribes, and especially in Alberta.\n\nAny assistance you may give me in this connection will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) N.

They think that the race is passing away and that it is only a question of time before they will be extinct.\n\nI believe that God has put it in my power to do something for Indians and only because of that reason do I write now.\n\nI have seen representatives of law and order drinking at a party where Indians were present. I have seen them have been a good example to the Indians. I've known an individual who had never been convicted of a single Indian for being drunk or in county jail for being drunk. This same man was fined on the supposition that he had been drinking when he swore that he had not.\n\nThen as to the doctor. I was at a house in a small village last night when a man (Indian) came anxiously calling for his wife. She was ill, his wife, who was soon to be a mother. The doctor came, but it was too late and the baby died.\n\nThe home was broken up. The father is now in prison. His wife and daughter is being cared for by people on the reserve who are wanting the money they get for selling their goods. Another is in an institution.\n\nThere is another boy in my school with sore eyes. I sent him to the clinic the doctor here Friday. The case was considered something unusual. But I saw his eyes becoming worse. So I wrote to Ottawa and arrived a new doctor, who really cares for the Indians. He found that my little pupil had tuberculosis. And on the advice of the doctor we found three others with it at school.\n\nAs regards discipline at school. At first glance one would consider that to be a teacher of Indians must be a hard task, since that discipline would be easy. I know that Indian children can be educated by appealing to their good qualities (which are not lacking) rather than force. They can be ruled by love, but to be forced by fear simply brings forth their unkindness.\n\nGovernment agents who are to rule schools for Indians should take a study course in child psychology and school management and learn the fact that the Indians whose pupils had to be hurt physically to be made to behave, are not Indians. There are many young Indians tell of the futility of strapping in their school clothes. Physical punishment does not really mean much to an Indian. But appeal to their better nature, which is highest and you will get lasting results. I know whereof I speak.\n\nWhere is the feeling from headquarters against the Indians speaking? Why do they not stand up? What good do they do? What right has any one to take their language away from them by force?\n\nIt's very interesting to me to know that there are some teachers of the pupils from one of these schools who have been punished for using these terms, or something similar to this:\n\n\"We have a man teacher, who is awfully cross. He keeps us all running out in the yard when we're playing games or doing our work in the classroom. If he keeps on being so cross we're all going to quit school at Christmas.\"\n\nThis is a case of lack of humor, but it is the attitude of the pupils in these schools which is most contrary to one who loves and understands child nature that even in their play they must keep their language away without fear of punishment in the form of a beating or a whipping.\n\nNow, I think I've said sufficient to show that there are two sides to this question. We must see Indians treated as human beings, not dogs. They must be allowed to think and speak for themselves they are trodden under foot by indifferent men who think that their own every helplessness has been their greatest appeal.\n\nI trust that this may serve to interest someone who may realize how to give Indians understanding and love instead of the mockery of old children's food, which only keeps their bodies and leave their souls to starve.\n\nToronto One Who Loves Indians.\n77 Alberta Ave., Toronto\nNov. 7, 1932\n\nDept.

MCGILL,\n\nMr. Phelan sent me some time ago a copy of a memorandum dated April 5, 1932, dealing with the question of Per Capita Grants at Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn the second paragraph you will find a reference to a formal agreement made between the Department and the Boarding Schools in April 1911, and which it is said remained in force to April 1, 1916. The Minister would like to know if this agreement is still in force and effect, or has it been formally abrogated? If so, please give particulars; also furnish the Minister with a copy of the Agreement referred to.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 25, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 22nd instant, I attach hereto copy of the agreement with the Churches, regarding the maintenance and management of Indian Residential Schools, of April 5th, 1911. It was provided in this agreement that it would have effect for a period of five years; it has never been renewed, nor has it been formally abrogated. Changes have been made from time to time in many of the clauses of the agreement, the most important being:\n\n(a) Per Capita Grants: Our present policy regarding these is stated fully in memorandum of April 5, 1932, which you have received.\n\n(b) Erection and Maintenance of Buildings: The agreement in 1911 contemplated that the Government would pay a much larger proportion of the total cost of Indian education than it had previously done, especially in the matter of providing more adequate accommodation for the pupils. Conditions during the past 16 years have changed to such an extent that the Department was obliged to go further in the matter of repairs and replacements of buildings than set forth in the agreement. During the past ten years the Department has assisted towards the cost of repairing church-owned buildings when we were assured that these buildings would continue to be used by the Churches for Indian educational purposes.\n\nIf desired, a memorandum could be supplied, setting out in detail the changes that have taken place in each of the various clauses since the agreement was signed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nStoney Creek School\n\n[Signature]\n\nI have some serious matters regarding the education and support of our Indians, and any matters that would require a short discussion.\n\nThank you.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 13, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your request of the 5th instant for certain information regarding the educational and religious work among the Indians.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the only publication we have for distribution is the annual report of the Department. I am forwarding to you, under separate cover, a copy of the annual report for the year 1927, also the last published report for the year ended March 1931-32. If you will refer to the report of 1927, page 7 and following pages, under the heading \"The Canadian Indians after Sixty Years of Confederation\", you will obtain a brief summary of the development of Indian Affairs during sixty years since Confederation. As our copies of the annual report of 1927 are very limited, I would request that you return the enclosed copy. An envelope for this purpose is enclosed herewith. It will not be necessary to pay postage.\n\nIn the report for 1932, pages 10-11, you will find the number of day and residential schools in operation, and the number under the auspices of the various religious denominations, also the total expenditure incurred from Parliamentary Appropriation. Pages 46 to 59, Part 2, show the various schools in operation, where located, enrolment, average attendance, etc.,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. C. E. Freeman,\nStoney Creek,\nOnt.\nJanuary 31, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL,\n\nRe: Per Capita Grants\n\nThe total Per Capita Grants for Indian Residential Schools, without any deductions, amounts to $1,399,735.00. 10% or $139,973.50 was deducted, leaving a balance of $1,259,761.50.\n\nThese grants were formerly based on 100% attendance, although it was found that, during the past few years, only 95% was earned. It was therefore decided to make a further deduction of 5% in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1933-34, and the sum of $62,988.07 was deducted. In order to make the total Appropriation asked for an even amount, an additional sum of $11,773.43 was deducted, leaving the amount required for Per Capita Grants the sum of $1,185,000.00.\nJanuary 31st, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy -\n\nWith reference to the matter of the Schools for Captin Grant, I would respectfully submit the following memorandum prepared by Mr. Rutherford, which sets out in detail the deductions made last year and this year from the original sum granted.\n\nYou will note that in addition to the 10% deduction last year and again this year, that a further deduction of 5% has already been made based upon the fact that the school attendance had never reached one hundred per cent.\n\nA further deduction of 2% from the net sum estimated for the ensuing fiscal year would amount to $9,250.00. On the other hand, a deduction of 10% from the original amount before the first cut of 10% would amount to $9,986.75.\nFebruary 2nd, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nMr. Allen understands, from conversation with the Director of Estimates, that the amount of the reduction in the estimates of the Department of Indian Affairs was determined by a 5% reduction in the per capita grants for schools.\n\nFrom our telephone conversation this morning I understand that it is your wish that this reduction be taken from our relief appropriation. May I respectfully point out that while we can make a paper reduction here, our actual expenditure in this branch is very largely uncontrollable; whereas if the cut is made in the schools appropriation we know that there will be an actual decrease of expenditure.\n\nI would appreciate very much the opportunity of discussing the matter with you early tomorrow morning in order that we may proceed at once with the completion of our estimates.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIn making reference to these denominations I would like to do justice to their generosity and commendable efforts.\n\n(5) Inspections. Was any of the inspection of Indian schools done by regular inspectors of public schools? If so to what extent?\n\n(6) Curriculum. I notice that in some cases Indian schools used the Provincial curricula. In other cases, did your Department provide a curriculum?\n\n(7) In what year did Battleford Industrial School discontinue and why? In what year did Regina Industrial School discontinue and why? I believe that the Qu'Appelle School is still in operation.\n\nI am aware that this and related information cannot be got together without some inconvenience; but I hope that the service to the Indians of education may warrant the extra efforts. In any case I shall greatly appreciate any information you can let me have. Owing to financial conditions I cannot travel abroad for information and must be content with what I can secure by mail.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for such co-operation as you can find it possible to give in this matter,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.H. Gallaway\nhas been taken from Indian Trust Fund Accounts. At the present time, all costs of education are provided from Parliamentary Appropriation, and no amount is taken from Indian Trust Funds towards the expenses in maintaining Indian schools.\n\nAll Indian schools in the western provinces are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with this Department in the carrying out of its educational policy. The following will show the dates of the opening of the boarding and industrial schools in the Province of Saskatchewan:\n\n**Boarding Schools.**\n\nRound Lake (Presbyterian) 1887;\nCrowstand \" 1889 (now closed);\nFile Hills \" 1889;\nMuscoweguan (Roman Catholic) 1890;\nEmmanuel College, Prince Albert, (Anglican) 1891,\n(This school not now in operation);\nGordon's (Anglican) 1892;\nCowessess (Roman Catholic) 1893;\nDuck Lake \" 1895;\nThunderchild (Roman Catholic) 1901;\n\n**Industrial Schools.**\n\nBattleford (Anglican) November, 1883;\nQu'Appelle (Roman Catholic) October, 1884;\nRegina (Presbyterian) April, 1891.\n\nRegarding the inspection of Indian schools in Saskatchewan, I have to say that previous to 1922 the inspection of schools was carried out by our own inspectors and agents. In 1922, arrangements were made with the Provincial Department of Education to utilize the services of the public school inspectors in inspecting the schools once each year and reporting on the classroom work being carried out by the teachers. This action was taken with a view to standardizing the instruction offered. Although teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, yet teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school. The course of studies prescribed by the Provincial Department is used. However, the Department is at present engaged in compiling a list of text-books, etc., to be used by all Indian schools in Canada.\n\nThe Battleford School was closed on May 31, 1914, and the Regina Industrial School on May 31, 1910. The chief reason being that these schools were not contiguous to reserves and it was difficult in recruiting pupils, the Indian parents objecting to sending their children so far from home.\n\nYou have been mailed, under separate cover, annual reports of this Department for the fiscal years ending March 31, 1931, and 1932.\n\nFor information regarding the early history of Indian Education in Saskatchewan, I would suggest that you communicate with Mr. W. Murison, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Indian Office, Regina; also with the late Indian Commissioner, Mr. W. M. Graham, who resides in Regina. Both these men have been in the service of this Department for many years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nJ.H. GALLAWAY, B.A.\n716 EASTLAKE AVE.\nSASKATOON, SASK. Feb. 1/33.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with some research work in education in the Province of Saskatchewan, you were good enough to send me last year, the copy each of 12 annual reports of your Department in 1872, 1874, 1876, 1878, 1899, 1914, 1917, 1918, 1920, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1930.\n\nI have secured what information I can from these reports; but as I am gathering materials for a history of education in this Province the material obtainable from these reports, relative to education in Indian schools is somewhat fragmentary. I am wondering whether I may obtain from you additional information with which to supplement what is contained in these reports.\n\nPerhaps if I mention some of the specific items of information which I wish, it may give you the best indication of my needs. I shall for the sake of clearness, enumerate some of these: (1) Annual Reports for the remaining years, not included in the above list. (2) Information as to the first beginnings of Indian schools in what is now Saskatchewan. Among the above mentioned reports, the first of such schools appear to be in the 1899 Report, but as there are in that report, some 16 day schools, 10 boarding schools and 1 industrial school, it is apparent that some of these were opened prior to 1899. Indeed I played football with boys from the Regina Industrial School in 1898, in the city of Regina, while I was attending Normal School.\n\nIn Dr. Norman Black's book, \"A History of Saskatchewan and the Old North West\", pages 561-2, he mentions-(a) L.K.R. Cameron school in St. Boniface in 1879, (b) Methodist Church Mission schools in operation in the far North west as early as 1879, (c) A Presbyterian Church School in Prince Albert in 1866, (d) In 1873 Chief Factor Christie mentions visits he had paid to Anglican, Roman Catholic mission schools at Fort Simpson, Providence and Isle \u00e0 la Crose. I am interested in these earliest beginnings of Indian education in Sask., and if you can supply me with details in connection with same I shall be greatly obliged. If you have not such information on file perhaps you could advise me where I might apply for same.\n\nIn your 1930 Annual Report I see a splendid account of the beginnings of the Mohawk Institute (page 13). If you could put me in touch with anyone or with several persons who could give me a similar account of the earliest beginnings and some history of the first Indian schools in Sask., I should be very grateful.\n\n(3) The basis of government support and the amount of same in cases of these first schools. I notice in the 1872 and 1874 reports that $60 per year was allowed annually from Indian funds, for each boarding school pupil. This is all the information which I have noticed about the appropriations towards these schools. I presume that there was some basis for appropriations for day schools and industrial schools.\n\n(4) How were the legislative grants toward the Indian Trust Fund determined? This grant, together with proceeds from sales, rents, etc., seem to be the sources for funds for this Indian Trust Fund, but I am wondering on what basis the grant for this fund was determined, and also the bases on which moneys from it were paid to Indian schools. Any information covering these and kindred points will be welcome, if it is available in a form which it is convenient to supply.\n\n(5) Were all Indian schools under the charge of a religious body?\nOttawa, February 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, requesting information regarding the early beginning of education for the Indians in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe earliest efforts to educate the Indians were carried out by the missionaries of the various denominations, this Department contributing no grant for salary or other expenses previous to 1877. In the annual report for that year it is shown that a grant of $300 was provided to each of the schools at Lac la Biche and St. Albert, the latter of which was for Indian orphan children.\n\nThe annual report of this Department for the year 1878 shows that a grant of $12 per capita per annum, based on the daily average attendance, up to $300, was provided at each of the following schools: Isle a la Crose, Little Touchwood Hills, St. Albert, Lac la Biche and Assippi Mission.\n\nAll Indian schools in Saskatchewan have been started under Church auspices and usually conducted for a certain period without Government aid.\n\nThe yearly grants allowed for teachers' salaries were at the rate of $300 per annum at day schools, while $60 per annum was allowed to the boarding schools and from $72 to $100 per capita at the industrial schools. Salaries and grants were supplemented from Church funds. The grants have considerably increased from time to time, and we now pay grants towards teachers' salaries in day schools, depending upon the qualifications of the teachers, from $750 to $1050 per school year, and provide per capita grants to residential schools ranging from $60 to $200 per capita. The staffs at residential schools are paid by the Church authorities from the per capita grant provided or from Church sources. In the case where a teacher in a day school performs certain missionary duties, the Church provides an additional salary over and above that allowed by the Department. All teachers and staffs are nominated by the Church authorities.\n\nIn the western provinces no legislative grants have been provided toward Indian Trust Funds. These Trust Funds consist of proceeds from sales of land, timber and rents. No part of the cost of Indian Education in the western provinces\n\nJ. H. Gallaway, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\n716 Eastlake Ave.,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n716 Eastlake Ave., Regina, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTO THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nMr. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSec. Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to thank you for the trouble you have gone to in writing me at such length relative to Indian Affairs, as per your letter of the 13th inst.\n\nI am sorry that one point in your letter is not clear, and I am taking the liberty of troubling you further for the information. In the first sentence of your 5th paragraph you mention that grants were allowed at the rate of $300 per annum at any schools, $60 per annum to ordinary schools and $720 to $900 per capita at industrial schools. In this connection I presume that the $300 per annum means $300 per annum per teacher, but it is not clear whether the $60 per annum means per teacher or per pupil.\n\nAs regards the term, \"per capita,\" I would understand this to mean, per pupil; although its use further on in this paragraph would mean, in that case, that the grant ran as high as $900 per pupil per annum in residential schools. Would advise whether this is your meaning.\n\nIn your letter you mention an annual report for 1877. As stated in my letter of the 1st inst., I shall send annual reports for the years 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880 to 1913 inclusive, 1875 to 1879 inclusive, 1883 and all reports prior to 1873. If it is possible to secure these reports I should be obliged.\n\nI shall avail myself of the opportunity of getting in touch with Inspector Murison and possibly Mr. Graham, ex-Commissioner Graham, on some future occasion when I am in Regina.\n\nAs your Department paid no grants to Indian schools prior to 1877, I presume that you will not have any records of these schools prior to that year. No doubt the $350 mentioned as salaries in your 1876 Annual Report, p. 36, would be from Manitoba. You mention, however, that no money from Indian Trust Funds is used for Indian education, what Indian funds therefore are referred to in this 1874 Report?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n1872, 1873, 1874\nMr. Hetherland\n\nUnderstand that there is no agreement in 1874 about a salary.\nOttawa, February 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, requesting further information in regard to my letter of the 13th instant.\n\nThe grant which was allowed at the rate of $300 per annum at day schools was for the teacher's salary only. While this amount was allowed, payment was based on the period the school was in operation during each year. It would appear that the schools were more or less seasonal in their operation, and the full amount of grant allowed was not always earned. The $60 per capita per annum allowed the boarding schools and the $72-$100 per capita per annum for industrial schools was the rate allowed for each pupil per year. From these per capita grants, the church authorities, under whose auspices a school was conducted, provided food, clothing, payment of staff and general running expenses of the school. Both salaries and per capita grants have been revised from time to time, and we now provide towards salaries of teachers in day schools $750-$1050 per school year, and the per capita grants to residential schools range from $160-$200 per capita per annum.\n\nI am unable to find the reference made by you regarding the amount of salary in the annual report for the year 1874. As stated in my previous letter, the first grant this Department made for salaries to Indian schools in Saskatchewan was in the year 1877. The reference mentioned by you, no doubt, refers to Manitoba, as grants were provided towards the salary of teachers of Indian schools in that Province previous to the year mentioned.\n\nC. H. Gallaway, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\n716 Eastlake Ave.,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nFor your information, as it may be of value, I am forwarding, under separate cover, a copy of statistics showing the expenditure for Indian schools for the years 1877-1896. By reference thereto you will see, along with the other Indian schools in Canada, the amounts paid by this Department to the schools conducted under the auspices of the various religious denominations in the former Northwest Territories, embracing the present Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. The items marked by an asterisk cover the expenditure incurred in the erection of and repairs to buildings, while the other amounts in the case of day schools are the teachers' salaries, and in the case of boarding schools, the per capita grant paid each year.\n\nI also forward, under separate cover, annual reports of the Department for the years 1872, 1873, 1919, 1921, 1926 and 1927. I regret that we have no copies available for distribution of the reports for the other years mentioned by you.\n\nWhen \"Indian Funds\" are referred to as the source from which payments were made, these funds were provided by Parliamentary Appropriation. The Department of Indian Affairs was organized as a separate Department in 1880. Previous to that time the administration of Indian Affairs was under the Department of the Interior and the vote which they obtained was referred to generally as \"Indian Funds\". As stated in my previous letter, \"Indian Trust Funds\" consist of proceeds from sales of land, timber, rents, etc., and are funded in this Department to the credit of the various bands interested.\n\nThe first treaty made with the Indians in Saskatchewan was in September, 1874, with the Cree and Saulteaux Tribes, at Qu'Appelle and Fort Ellice, known as Treaty No. 4. The next treaty was with the Plain and Wood Cree Indians, made at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt and Battle River, in September, 1876, and known as Treaty No. 5. There was, therefore, no Indian Trust Funds to the credit of any of the bands in Saskatchewan previous to treaty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nEDUCATION OF INDIANS.\n\nFurther Progress is Anticipated Under the New Administration.\n\nTo the Editor of The Nation:\n\nNot many persons realize that the Federal Government administers one Federal program of education, namely that of the Indian Bureau, which has the responsibility for the education of thousands of Indian children scattered throughout the width and breadth of the United States.\n\nFor many years this Federal education project was devoted to giving Indian children an education as white children, in spite of the racial and cultural differences between them and, on the whole, these differences possibilities and different kinds of opportunities open to them in adult life.\n\nAs a result of those interested both in education and Indian welfare this situation has been changed and a progressive educator, Dr. Carson Ryan, placed in charge of the government Indian schools, to bring their program into line with modern progressive thought in educational administration. This involves the development of a system of education adapted to the specific needs of the Indian child and the preservation of the best elements of his native culture.\n\nThe first step was the abolition of the Indian boarding schools, which were unnecessarily costly and in many cases failed to provide education of a high standard. Some of these have been closed, but much of the whole program still remains to be put in operation. All those interested in the progressive education experiment which has been undertaken can only hope that it will be continued as vigorously and on the same scale as hitherto under the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to be appointed by the new President.\n\nMARIA ROGERS.\nNew York, March 4, 1933.\n\nAT DAWN OF THE SUNRISE\nThe J.

B. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to introduce myself as Director of Technical Education in the service of the Board of Land Administration (S. Africa), at present in N. America under the auspices of the Carnegie Corporation.\n\nI am making investigations regarding Technical Education and Vocational Training among backward peoples, and at the moment of writing, am visiting the savage communities on the sea islands of South Carolina.\n\nIt has been suggested to me that it might be very helpful if I could visit some Indian reservations in Canada, where conditions of tribal communal life might prevail, not altogether unlike those with which I am dealing in Basutoland. But being rather anxious as to how to get reliable information which might assist me in making such visits, I am consulting, on the advice of your Embassy in Washington, Dr. [illegible].\n\nWhat I want to study, briefly, is (a) how you train your Indian boys as craftsmen, i.e., carpenters, masons, smiths, wheelwrights, farmers, etc., and by how they manage to establish themselves and live by their trades among their own people.\n\nUnfortunately my time is very limited as I have only six months' leave in all\u2014so that I must fit my investigation in Canada between June 3rd & 15th. That, and other reasons mainly financial, mean that I can hardly attempt to go to the West, but must limit myself to reservations in Ontario or Quebec.\n\nCan you then advise me as to whether there are places...\nin three provinces which I could visit with advantage to my investigations. I should be most grateful if you could help me with any suggestions or other information.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\nOscar Bult.\nin those provinces which I could visit with advantage to my investigation? I should be most grateful if you could help me with any suggestions or other information.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\nOswin Bull.\nMay 2nd, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Bull:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding your proposed visit, early in June, next, to a number of the Indian reserves in Ontario and Quebec, in order that you can carry out certain investigations concerning the vocational training of Indian boys and how they establish themselves among their own people on their reserves.\n\nIn this connection I would suggest that you first visit this Department, when we will be pleased to give you any information we can and also assist you in planning a visit to a number of our schools and reserves. There are several Indian residential schools in Ontario with nearby reserves, which, no doubt, it would be of advantage for you to visit, to observe the work carried on and the conditions and progress of the Indians on their reserves. We would be pleased to give instructions to our agents and to principals of the schools that they give you every opportunity to carry out any investigation which you desire to make. However, if time does not permit you to visit Ottawa, I would suggest that you visit the Indian Residential School and the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ont., also the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School and the Caradoc Indian Agency at Muncey, Ont. If your time permitted, you might also visit the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve and Schools near Montreal. The greater number of the Indian residential schools at which the boys receive vocational training are located in the western provinces.\n\nI shall be pleased to have you visit the Department on any date at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nOswin B.

Through this exercise the child's muscles and limbs are strengthened and an upright carriage gained.\n\nParents should do well to note the love of the young generation for musical exercises. Those who have given their children this form of exercise have been well repaid by the noticeable improvement shown in the health and deportment of the children in later years.\n\nThere are many forms of Tap-Dancing, but perhaps the most popular and the easiest to follow, is the original dance of the North American Indians which is known as \"The Red River Jig\". The step for this dance is easy at all stages to learn. Throughout the foot makes three beats - the first only slightly accented - the second a slur, while the third is forcibly accented, because it receives the weight of the body, while the other foot takes up the step.\n\nAs the Old-Time Fiddlers play, one can easily recognize the triple beat running through the music. Thus it is almost an impulse that one dances the Red River Jig in accordance with the music quite naturally when accompanied with rhythmical music.\n\nA child who is musically inclined may soon develop the flexibility that will enable him to do the triple tap. To practise this he should stand on his toes, keeping body erect, with the right foot the toe pointing downwards, straighten the leg bringing foot smartly on to the floor in front of him, then draw it back in line with the left foot.\n\nThe left foot will require more exercise, and this is obtained by raising the weight on the toes of the right foot and swinging the left foot backwards and forwards. This exercise will be more enjoyable performed and with greater exertion if the piano music of \"The Tapatoe\" is played. It will accustom the child to the rhythm.\n\nOnce the triple tap is mastered, and the child can do it, no matter how slowly, his muscles begin to tremble and his bones to grow stronger due to the splendid erect position of the body. The music of \"The Tapatoe\" can be played very slowly at first, then faster as the child becomes fully acquainted with the dance. With a fast musical exercise, such as this, a most beneficial development is obtained in a short time.\n\nThe world over, nations have portrayed the tempo of life, and to remedy the different modes of dancing, yet it has been left to the Canadians to inspire this triple tempo, in rhythm with the triple tap action; and this tempo is the fundamental basis of the dance, perfect symmetry between the music and the dance.\n\nThese two dances, \"The Red River Jig\" and \"The Tapatoe\" for which there are many steps are numbered to assist the parent or teacher with these two musical exercises.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR DANCING TAPATOE\n\nThe National Canadian Tap Dance\n\nThe Tapatoe is danced like the Military Schottische, commencing with a shuffle\u2014lady with the right foot forward with the right foot, repeat a shuffle, with the left foot forward for three times and a turn by alternate shuffles. This is just as graceful a dance to watch as the waltz and as easy to learn.\n\nA Shuffle\u2014Stand with weight on left foot, holding the right foot off the floor, with knee slightly bent. Swing the right foot forward, sounding a tap on the floor with the ball of the foot and finishing with right foot forward, holding the right foot off the floor. Now bring ball of right foot to floor, with knee straight, sounding a second tap. This movement is done as though to slap floor sounding two taps. On the second tap the weight is carried over to the right foot.\n\nLadys' Step (Tap taps only):\n\nSlap right Count 1\nSlap left Count 2\nSlap right Count 3\nSlap right Count 4\n\nRepeat all that starting left. Gentleman's step is the same only commencing with the left foot, and beginning the repeat with the right foot.\n\nThe Turn\u2014Couple are in waltzing position. Turn clockwise lady commencing left, Gentleman right. Gentleman step is:\n\nSlap left Count 1\nHop left Count 2\nSlap right Count 3\nHop right Count 4\n\nRepeat all that.\n\nRecommended for accuracy in tap dancing and for physical development.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR DANCING THE RED RIVER JIG\n\nThis dance is, we believe, derived from the Pow Wow of the North American Indian, the early inhabitants of the Red River Valley, and was continued by the early settlers.\n\nTwo dancers face one another six feet apart; stand perfectly erect, and their movements commence by doing a shuffle by the right foot, followed by one shuffle with the left; every third shuffle or tap raise the foot backward sufficiently to miss one beat of the music. Perfect shuffle and tap\u2014shuffle and tap of step is beat perfect time to the music with ones toes, with as little body movement as possible, is easily accomplished.\n\nThe dancers change side by crossing over with the shuffle step, a hand clap, and continue to dance about six feet apart until tired, or until other dancers take their place.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have some music published and wondered if you would be kind enough to see if it were possible to introduce this music to some of the Indian schools.\n\nIf you care to consider the matter I will be pleased to send samples of this music to you.\n\nEnclosed you will find a few leaflets which partly explain the objective. I trust to receive a reply from you with a favorable consideration of the matter.\n\nEver yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLife Member of Old Timer Ass'n\n\nArrived in Manitoba 1887\nOttawa, May 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a leaflet regarding the words and music published by you, for use in Tap Dancing.

There are several Indian residential schools in Ontario with nearby reserves, which, no doubt, it would be of advantage for you to visit, to observe the work carried on and the conditions and progress of the Indians on their reserves. We would be pleased to give instructions to our agents and to principals of the schools that they give you every opportunity to carry out any investigation which you desire to make. However, if time does not permit you to visit Ottawa, I would suggest that you visit the Indian Residential School and the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ont., also the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School and the Caradoc Indian Agency at Muncey, Ont. If your time permitted, you might also visit the Caughnawage Indian Reserve and Schools near Montreal. The greater number of the Indian residential schools at which the boys receive vocational training are located in the western provinces.\n\nI shall be pleased to have you visit the Department on any date at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nOswin B.

Tomorrow I am hoping to get out to Brandon to see what I can here. Then on Thursday morning when I am in Ottawa I shall ring your office and find out what would be a convenient hour to call on you and chat a little of your time - any only right about any time is so limited.\n\nYours very truly,\nOsman Bull.\nOttawa, [date]\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\n\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 23rd, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nIn the attached letter from Mr. Victor G. Porteous enquiry is made with regard to the statute dealing with Public Schools on Indian Reserves.\n\nWill you kindly return the letter and let me have a memorandum which the Minister may send on to the writer.\n\nEnc.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJune 26, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 23rd instant, attaching a communication from Mr. Victor C. Porteous, I have to say that Subsections \"a\" and \"b\" of Section 9 of the Indian Act, 1927, give the Governor in Council power to establish day and residential schools. These schools are for the benefit of Indian children.\n\nMr. Porteous' reference to schools on Indian reserves as \"public\" schools is not exactly according to fact, as these schools are intended primarily for Indian children. Under special circumstances, the Department has from time to time permitted white children living in the vicinity of a reserve to attend the Indian school on the reserve. Arrangements in this connection have usually been made at the request of the Provincial School Inspector or the local Indian agent. The children of departmental employees, when residing on a reserve, are permitted to attend Indian day schools.\n\nAs requested, I return herewith Mr. Porteous' letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 13, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nRegarding the proposed visit of the Honourable the Minister to the North West Territories, I have to say that the following Indian Residential Schools are located in that territory:\n\n| Name of School          | Location       | Name of Principal         |\n|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|\n| Aklovik (R.C.)          | At Aklovik    | Rev. Sister A. Robinet    |\n| Fort Resolution (R.C.)  | Ft. Resolution| J. Dussault               |\n| Hay River (C.E.)        | Hay River     | W.A. Geddes (Acting)      |\n| Providence Mission (R.C.)| Ft. Providence| Sister Sarasin            |\n\nA per capita grant is provided for each of these schools, as follows, subject to a deduction of 10% during the current fiscal year:\n\n- Aklovik: 40 pupils $200.\n- Ft. Resolution: 30 pupils $200.\n- Hay River: 30 pupils $200.\n- Providence Miss.: 65 pupils $200.\n\nDr. C. Bourget is the Indian Agent and Medical Officer for these schools. He is located at Fort Resolution.\n\nThere are two Indian Day Schools in operation, viz., at Fort Simpson and Fort Smith, conducted under the charge of the Reverend Sisters.\n\nRegarding the Hay River Residential School, requests have been received from the Anglican Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, to provide a new building. The present building at this point is stated to be unsuitable for residential school purposes. The majority of the pupils are brought from long distances and the cost of their transportation is very high. In my opinion, as far as the Department is interested, this school could very well be closed. The Roman Catholic Bishop, under whose auspices all the other schools mentioned are conducted, is\n\nRight Reverend G. Breynat, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nThere are no matters requiring special attention in connection with the Roman Catholic schools.\nEDUCATION\n\nThere were 80 residential schools and 260 day schools in operation during the year\u2014a total of 340 Indian schools. In addition, the Department assisted in the maintenance of 9 combined white and Indian schools. The total enrolment was 17,425 and the average attendance 13,487. This was an increase in enrolment over that of the preceding year of 262 and in the average attendance of 350. A more regular attendance was maintained at the day schools during the year, the percentage being 65.73 as compared with 63.69 for the previous year. The percentage of attendance at all schools was 77.4, a record for the work. The tabular statement showing the location and indicating the enrolment and other facts in the case of each school, will be found in Part 2 of this report.\n\nEfforts were continued during the year to secure efficiency in both day and residential schools. Many fully qualified teachers and instructors were engaged and equipment was maintained to standard. The residential school activity was particularly encouraging. All these schools had an enrolment of pupils to full capacity. Due to economic conditions, the Indian parents are anxious to place their children in the schools of this class.\n\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools. This cooperation of the churches in the case of residential schools is as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 44                 |\n| Church of England       | 21                 |\n| United Church           | 13                 |\n| Presbyterian Church     | 2                  |\n| **Total:**              | **80**             |\n\nIn addition to the regular academic work at all Indian schools, there is the very important vocational training at the residential schools. Farming, gardening, the care of stock, manual training, and domestic instruction are being given more attention. The attendance problem at day schools is most difficult, but progress is gradually being made.\n\nQualified inspectors visit all classrooms, except those in the more northern schools. Under arrangement with the Provincial Departments of Education, the services of regular public and separate school inspectors are utilized, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian school inspectors. In addition, there is a medical inspection and department officers give constant supervision to the vocational training.\n\nContinuation and high school work is taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced\nadvanced pupils in those residential schools that are situated close to municipal colleges are benefited by secondary training, in competition with white children. There were approximately 230 Indian students, not shown in the tabular statements, attending public schools, high schools and colleges in Canada. The Department, in the case of most of these, assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nNo new building operations were undertaken. Minor repairs only were carried out in order to keep buildings in a good state of repair. The new building at the Blue Quills Residential School was completed and equipped. The expenditure for Indian Education for the year shows a decrease of $292,734.28 as compared with the previous year, this being mainly on account of the deduction in per capita grant to residential schools. The Department, however, was able to maintain its educational services in full.\n\nMuch consideration has been given to the selection of suitable texts in order to prescribe a complete course of study for Indian schools. In the junior grades there has been a departure to a more or less extent from the provincial courses.\n\nThe health of Indian children in the residential schools continued to receive special attention. Good medical supervision has been arranged.\n\nA severe loss was occasioned by the death of the late Russell T. Ferrier, M.A., Superintendent of Indian Education. During his tenure of office, a period of twelve years, much progress was accomplished in the educational advancement of our wards.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education from parliamentary appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1933, amounted to $1,712,223.06, as follows:-\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE SECRETARY.\n\nOTTAWA, August 11th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter received from Miss Elizabeth Ellis, teacher, Flaxcombe, Saskatchewan, is a request --- among other matters --- for the following information:\n\nPictures of Indians or any material on Indian life for use in public school grades.\n\nWe have advised the inquirer that the above-mentioned portion of the request has been transferred to your office for attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 15, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department of the Interior has forwarded to this Department a request contained in your letter, for pictures of Indians or any material on Indian life, for use in public school grades.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we have no pictures of Indians for distribution.

It is understood, of course, that the Department would be prepared to give full consideration to all representations made by the interested Church authorities in the selection of teachers.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEducation of Indian Children\n\nBy K. M. H.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has issued a report on the education of Indian children. The emphasis placed on domestic science and manual training and agriculture is that emphasis placed in relation to the facilities which the pupils will have when they attempt to put theory into practice at home, on the reserves, or that emphasis\u2014whether the best intentions\u2014directed by the best of practice among white people.\n\nThe same life on the reserves is not an overburdened affair. If the criticism is justified, and it is too general and well informed to be a matter of much doubt, that, for example, the domestic science is taught to the Indians girls, the aid of electrically run washing machines and electrically powered bread mixers, it is not going to be much help at the home lodge. The same is true of agricultural and of animal training. The Indians do not need steady work at any time, and to suggest that he will take enthusiastically to seed selection, the cultivation of crops, and the care of animals is merely an extremist. It should be remembered that his history, and pretty recent history, is that, is to find his food by the hand of the white man\u2014wheat and cattle culture done by the same. Therefore, elaborate teaching in agriculture is simply endured by the Indian students, and to judge by the few years of results, is generally and most effectively forgotten.\n\nOver the years education of the Indians has not been a success. It has not lowered the death rate, especially from tuberculosis, which disease is fostered by poor housing, and unsuitable diet. It has not raised the status of Indian life on the reserve. It has not increased the number of Indians who have taken their places in the life of the Country.\n\nIn the few places where progress has been made among the Indians there has been based on observations directed by an agent who had knowledge of Indian character and of the possibilities, economic and human, with which he had to work.\n\nCanada has spent millions on Indian education, and is still spending, and that ungrudgingly. The gesture apparently satisfied the white citizen's conscience that he owed something to the red man and is determined to pay it. But it is too easy a way which contents itself with handing over money.\n\nThere should be intelligent plans. It is always very difficult to fit civilizations so alien in ideals as the Indian and the white, but where there is respect and goodwill on both sides, as there is in this case, the task should not be an impossible one.\n2nd December, 1933.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI am attaching hereto the clipping from the Winnipeg Free Press which we spoke of yesterday, dealing with education of Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.H.

Gen. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI have heard a rumour that your dept contemplate abandoning the system of residential schools for Indians and depending only on day schools, retaining one or two residential schools for orphans.\n\nI trust it is not correct. After living on this coast for 42 years during 10 or all years of which I was Indian Agent for the whole West Coast I am in a position to judge the effect of the two systems.\n\nWhen I was first Indian Agent, both systems were in use in this Agency and I had the best of chances to see the results.\n\nThe Boarding schools did good work hampered by the then antagonism of the Indians who did not like to part with their children. Now the Indians are anxious to send them to the residential schools as they see the benefit.\n\nI used to tell the Indians that if they did not wish to be forced to send their children to the boarding schools, they should make a point of seeing that they attended the day schools which were then held on several of the principal reserves. Despite that, my experience of day schools was that they were a joke, almost entirely useless.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nThe exceptional child or the child of exceptional parents did fairly well but the vast majority were no better. It was always left entirely to the choice or whim of the child as to whether he should go to school or not and you can guess the attendance. Apart from that the Indians move about so much according to the season and the opportunities of fishing that their children could not have attended well if they had wanted to.\n\nI have seen children with an ostensible attendance of 4 or 5 years at day school and they did not know the elements of reading or writing.\n\nThe results of the boarding schools were very different and are now a credit to the Dept. I feel strongly on this as I would hate to see the Dept adopt a policy that would be bound to undo so much that they achieved in the past. In ten or fifteen years time the education of the Indians would be back where it was 20 years ago.\n\nI would be much obliged if you would advise me by return mail as I would like to get it before I leave home, on the following points:\n\n1st Has the dept such a change of policy in mind?\n\n2nd Can I have a copy of the treaty or at least that portion of it dealing with education which was made some time shortly after Confederation, made between the Indians of the 3 Prairie Provinces as we now know them and her Majesty Queen Victoria. I think it was made in her name after an investigation by a Royal Commission.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\n3rd, A copy of an agreement or a blue book containing it, made a few years ago between your dept and the Indians of B.C. They had been agitating for treaty rights claiming that no definite treaty had ever been made with them and claiming that therefore all B.C belonged to them.\n\nAn arrangement was made to take the place of a treaty and I have a firm impression that it contained a clause guaranteeing the existence and I think the extension of the boarding or residential system of schools.\n\nI may be quite wrong but I think the first named treaty and certainly the last named agreement contained promises of education facilities being given the Indians and owing to their nomadic mode of life I submit that this will not be afforded by a system of day schools on the reserves.\n\nI question even if it would be much economy if that is the idea. There would have to be so many day schools in out of the way places to accommodate small and remote bands. These Indians are not like those on the Prairies. There may be only 25 or 50 in a band and they may be 20 miles from any other band or even if nearer, be entirely cut off by impassible woods or a sea trip too tough to negotiate half the time.\n\nI trust you may oblige by sending me the data asked for as soon as possible. I do not want the whole treaty merely the part dealing with education.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.M. Neill\nOctober 1928\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nJanuary 4, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to continuing the system of residential schools conducted for the benefit of Indian children.\n\nThe Department has given no consideration to the abandonment of the present system of residential schools and is not contemplating any change in its present policy. At present, however, it is not proposed to extend the residential school system. It is considered, in a case where further school facilities may be necessary, that the day school would meet requirements. The Department endeavours, in so far as funds permit, to keep school buildings and equipment in good repair.\n\nI am forwarding, under separate cover, a copy of Indian Treaty No. 4. This is similar in all respects to the other treaties made with the Indians of the Prairie provinces. You will observe that it was agreed by the Treaty to maintain a school on each reserve whenever the Indians of the reserve should desire it.\n\nI also forward a copy of the report of the special Committee of the Senate and House of Commons regarding the enquiry into the claims of the Allied Tribes of British Columbia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.

In these cases the Department did not build the schools and does not exercise the rights of ownership. It is noted that the last seven in the above list are in one agency, i.e. the Grouard Agency.\n\nIn a number of these cases the Department is being asked to assume financial responsibility and to pay grants towards the capital costs of the buildings, besides making additional grants for additions, repairs and maintenance. In at least some instances there are undertakings on the part of the Department to furnish certain financial assistance. Many of the arrangements made in the past in this connection have been verbal in nature and the terms are not of definite record. It would seem clear, however, that in some, if not\nall cases the Department is obligated to some degree at least, but the lack of written records and agreements makes it very difficult to determine the nature and extent of this responsibility.\n\nThe fact that the Department has undertaken the payment of per capita grants implies a certain responsibility for the up-keep of the buildings, if not for the capital costs.\n\nIn my opinion it is necessary that the Department adopt a general policy for the purpose of dealing with these difficulties and I would respectfully offer the following suggestions for your consideration:\n\n(1) That the Department of Indian Affairs undertake the payment of per capita grants and any financial aid towards the cost of building only when the prior authority of the Department has been granted. This authority should cover such matters as site, size and nature of school buildings.\n\n(2) That such authority in all cases be set out in a formal and definitely worded agreement for the guidance of Departmental officials, as a matter of record and for the purpose of avoiding future misunderstandings.\n\n(3) That the schools now operating by authority of the Department as recognized by the payment of per capita grants be assisted from time to time as circumstances warrant and financial conditions permit.\n\n(4) That the various missionary societies be notified that in future building projects undertaken without the sanction of the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs will not be considered as a later date for authority and recognition.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCan the Indian of B.C. be raised to a standard of citizenship wherein he would be obliged to be responsible for his own responsibility, rather than full enfranchisement.\n\nBecause of depression necessitating economy men are forced to think in terms of saving expenses. But how many have really thought of the new operating construction of the economic world? It affects everyone as individuals because of this it naturally extends to wider relative fields; from families to communities, from communities to governments, covering in its scope governments or committees which govern industries, commodity circulation, governments municipal and federal. It matters not what business one adheres to economy has to be practised. In governments of countries, departments are affected; during the past two years estimates have been returned for paring at every session of parliament. The common dollar is not in circulation and therefore could not be had in taxation direct or indirect, hence the department of Indian Affairs as all other departments, is obliged to exercise the utmost economy and now feels as though the bottom is about to drop out, finding itself with thousands of dependants on its hands, what is to be done? We in B.C. have felt the pinch; grants have been cut temporary, but when will this reduction be returned? While departments for the time being have been laid aside, what then can be done? Can we carry on with these cuts? Can we, as members of departments efficiently carry our load with such handicap? Reconstruction, what does it mean and where are we to begin? Thoughts take one back to the early days and for a brief moment we must dwell on conditions leading up to the present situation. There are one or two outstanding thoughts which should command our attention.\n\n(1) The Indian in Canada is in his Fatherland; this is his home. He cannot, like the Chinese or Japanese, be repatriated, for he is in the land of his birth. He is therefore not a foreigner and much more so than his white brother has he a right to his just living. He is the aboriginal and must be absorbed into the body politic.\n\n(2) This absorption must be done as quickly as possible for it will relieve the populous general of a large amount of taxation. The Indian is human in every sense of the word; like every other aboriginal tribe he was found with social relations built about a sense of religion. This religion had with it a centralized deity which was greater than himself and must be taken into consideration at all times and in all places. His worshipful instincts were easily appealed to and he was quickly led to citizenship of the Kingdom of God. This citizenship holds within itself the one thing which breeds loyalty, patriotism and independence.\n\nIn order to best see the working of this change one must of necessity see the beginning. We find the Indian in his original state knowing no responsibility. He lived upon the animal, vegetable and fish wealth of the land over which he roamed in freedom. He ambushed and scalped his tribal enemies. His system of hygiene was worked out in his nomadic nature; he wandered and in that wandering, while unaware of it himself, he was able to keep himself fairly healthy and at all times fit for the chase. He left behind him as he roamed, his refuse and nature did the cleansing work. As a result then our early white migration came into touch with a race healthy in its own crude mode and manner of living. His system of eugenics was linked up in a great many ways with his mode of warfare; fighting in ambush he annihilated if possible, but in some cases, saved the daughters of his enemies to become the mother of his own sons, children in this way keeping high a standard of breeding.\nHe spurned cowardice. Brave became a brave by enduring extreme torture or by roaming in isolation sometimes for long periods of time, gaining his keep from nature's inanimate and animate life. Stoical in the face of danger he faced death because he expected it to come at a certain time and very often in a certain manner.\n\nThe Indian's folk lore and ceremony were wonderful and beautiful and to himself real, becoming a part of his life.\n\nHis one big responsibility in life was to keep his bodily appetite appeased. He ate when he was hungry and hunted when his larder was empty. Seasonally he preserved by his own methods the fruit and roots of the wild, while the fish was put through a process of sun drying. These served him for winter food together with the meat of the chase. He understood nature and utilized her for his own essential bodily sustenance.\n\nHe was not without superstitions. Conformity to his traditions was a marked characteristic and with his superstitions they had a great deal to do in governing his life and forming his habits and mode of living.\n\nThe white man then coming into the land found a people unique who at first showed a placid mind but soon was induced to smoke the pipe of peace. There followed barter and fire-water. The Indian was sadly exploited, finding himself out his weaknesses the white man took advantage of him, seeing Madam Clotchet's weakness for gaudy colors the Gentleman Indian paid dearly with his life to satisfy this weakness. Values being unknown to him the Indian was induced to pile barrel high the old Hudson Bay basket in order that he might become the proud possessor of the white man's weapon of killing.\n\nThen follows the prospector of every blood and land, who again in their turn took advantage in many other ways, worst of all morally, for the Indian came into contact with, in the main, a very low type of white man who brought disease. Following this, settlements and the rounding of the Indians into reserves and forcing upon him the white man's mode of living, blocking nature's work and making possible the spread of disease and the development and spread of tuberculosis, were the conditions into which the Indian was rudely precipitated, resulting in the fact that until late years he has been a dying race. To-day we can safely say that he survives, the records for statistics show that he is increasing again numerically.\n\nThe country for a time, through its own lack of forethought in its system of development and seeking for gold, practically forgot that it owed a dying race a helping hand; yet whatever induced her, she turned her eyes to look into the cause of the Indian and she found a situation which called for rapid and timely attention. The condition was such that it would demand years of patient and constant care. Canada also realized that the co-operation of Christian principles was necessary in the reconditioning of the race. She therefore asked the help of the churches in her undertaking and we now find the church and country working hand in hand accomplishing slowly but surely a gigantic Canadian task, which extends itself in its appeal to all true Canadians who realize the existence of a common brotherhood.\n\nAbsorption in itself means or presents to the casual thinker, perhaps only one thing, that is inter-marriage between the whites and the Indians. In looking into this part of the work, men who have made a study of the situation find a great deal of other blood, principally white, and where this is so it has not always been good. Very many times we find the mixture has been much for the worse. The halfbreed who is recognized as neither Indian nor white man is a curse to the\ncountry and a menace to the uplift of the Indian. Absorption by mixture of blood in inter-marriage cannot be advocated. It must be applied only to a status of Dominion citizenship; that is keep the Indian separate, letting him live as a race within the land but see to it that the system of absorption will raise him to a higher standard of citizenship, making him a citizen of whom we can and will be proud.\n\nWe have hereto for expended large sums of money and energy but what has been done? Nothing but to create Indians who parade under the name of Indian and hang to the apron strings of the Department of Indian Affairs, so to speak. The work is terribly disjointed and needs some welding and amalgamation. In order therefore to carry on economically and for the best of all concerned a minute study of the problem sectionally would have to be made together with the Indian's general relation to the population as a whole, taking into consideration the weakness of the Indian and his easy fall to many temptations.\n\nConditions and occupations at the coast are much different than in the Southern Interior of the Province and likewise the North differ widely from the South; sectional study involves the necessary industry and therefore occupation. In the Southern Interior of B.C. you have an extensive fruit growing and mixed farming occupation while on the Coast the occupations vary from mechanical work to lumbering and fishing. In the North you have fur trading and lumbering. In order therefore to make a success of the Provincial Indian situation it has to be studied sectionally.\n\nIt follows then that the Indian must be taught to adapt himself, first to his environment, secondly to take care of his own physical needs in such a way as to become a responsible citizen wholly manning and maintaining his own Canoe of Life. He, on the coast, must be given a liberal and useful education in the art of building, ways and means of fishing, the art of boat building, the care of and how to handle gas engines, the care of and how to handle cannery machinery. He, in the Southern Interior of B.C. must be taught agriculture in all its phases, cattle husbandry, dairying, fruit and vegetable growing, how to lay out and build his irrigation ditches and to irrigate, how to cultivate, spray and prune his orchards. He, in Northern B.C. must be taught how to farm where it is possible, fur farming should appeal to him and he could be taught to grow fur in his own backyard and also the art of conservation of fur on his trap lines, and he should be taught lumbering and conservation of timber which should be realized in this industry.\n\nHow then is this to be done efficiently and with the least possible expenditure? Simply and solely through a system of education beginning in the day or residential school and at the age of seven years and by a definite and concrete following-up scheme.\n\nA definite academic education must be provided and in all cases and stages using the provincial curriculum, setting at least an average standard of high school entrance for every child. This is not an impossible task if ages are adhered to and a constant attendance enforced. The Indian child shows considerable aptitude in absorbing and retaining academic subjects as they are taught to-day. Mentally, except for a language handicap of one year, he progresses equally with the white child. Intelligence tests given and I.Q.'s taken show some to be as much as a year and a half older in intelligence than they are physically. Since then we have a mind which can be readily developed, it can also be taught to control technically the physical faculties. Here again more than average aptitude is shown and it leads one to believe that secondary advanced education would be a very ideal educational development to follow, leading up to trades and industries\nbest suited and adapted sectionally for whatever part of the Province\nthe child is expected to live in after school life.\n\nThe residential schools for the past, in some cases sixty years,\nhas been very great factor in the uplift of the Indian and is still\none would think, the ideal of all modes of education. It is centralized.\nIt overcomes also a difficulty in the Indian make-up, that of irresponsibility,\nfor his child when in the residential school is controlled by those\nwhose only concern is the advance of the Indian to common citizenship.\nWhile the Indian is aware of the responsibility demanded of him yet his\nutter indifference to things essential to future welfare hinges entirely\nupon the native peculiarity of being sensitive only to the needs of the\nday. He therefore applies himself and works all his dependants into this\nunfortunate trait. The residential school takes away a great many\ndifficulties and makes education more thorough, but are they altogether\nthe best? Are the difficulties which they dissolve after all insurmountable\nif handled in other ways? In the beginning the residential school is an\ninstitution which belongs to times of prosperity. Only governments can\ncarry them on. Indian Residential Schools are worked today. They are\nexpensive financially and are again expensive stumbling blocks to the\nrapid and thorough absorption of these people. As they are provided for\ntoday they take away from the Indian that very responsibility which they\nthemselves are trying to instill. These institutions feed, clothe and\neducate an Indian's children during the most expensive period of his child's\nlife. A Graduate becomes a father and is blessed with a family for\nwhich during school days he is taught to take the responsibility, then the\nschool turns around and takes the instilled responsibility out of his hands.\nSurely this is defeating its own aims. The Indian must be made responsible\nfor his own responsibility else it will take a thousand years to bring\nhim to that position wherein he will take that responsibility. Give him\nthe responsibility of his family and you have him on the rapid road to\ncitizenship. One might say make him pay a set sum towards the education\nof his child, in other words tax him and listen to his appeal. It would\ntake a regiment of soldiers to extricate this money for he never has any\nwhen it comes to helping to take care of his child in one of the resident-\nial schools. Follow their system up and we find that when non graduates\nand lines that father had no responsibility in his rearing, the son\ndeclined to take any responsibility of his parent when in the age. Stories\nhave been told by responsible persons, who know what they are saying,\nabout boys who are graduates of these institutions, sitting by the fire-\nside in comfort when his grey-haired father shoulders his shovel and rocker\nand heads for the river to wash gold in order that he might live and keep\nhis communistic son. The residential school, while it is not retarding\nyet it is not conducive to the rapid uplift of the Indian, which could be\nset going and maintained by a system of day schools with the residential\nschools to-day utilized as institutions wherein higher secondary educat-\nion, academic and technical could be taught on the same basis and along\nthe same lines as junior high schools are carried on but with a somewhat\nwider opportunity for technical and industrial education. This wider\nopportunity would be one great step in the right direction. As stated\nabove it would make the Indian responsible for the care of his own family\nat a time when it most needs his care and instead of releasing him of his\nresponsibility it lays it where it belongs.\n\nThrough the day school system, educational expense to the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs would be cut in three or four. The average\nnumber of children cared for by one teacher in a residential school is\nabout nine, this varies a little but runs between eight and ten; while\na day school teacher would take care of from twenty to forty or an average\nof thirty, taking the province on a whole.\nBy cutting down the educational expense greater medical care could be given in the way of placing a nurse on each reserve or with each school teacher and where necessary, an extra officer who could be termed truant officer. This officer being in touch with the school or schools always could also be of some help to the Indian from the point of view of sectional occupation.\n\nThe Indian would by this scheme be obliged to feed and clothe his children and thereby he would be made to bear the burden of his own responsibility instead of, as stated above, the residential school taking this responsibility provided for by the Department and assisted by the church or denomination of whatever professed Christian religion the Indian happens to belong. The residential school makes responsibility much too easy for the Indian, as for example, an Indian who is a steady worker on the railway section, much to his credit, with a family numbering ten, have all but one been through a residential school, spending anywhere from seven to ten years in the institution. Two girls married shortly after graduation; two boys today are working on the railway with the father and son-in-law. They have, between the three, an earning capacity of five dollars per diem and therefore, even though he is able, is not obliged to carry his own responsibility. It would seem that there is, under these conditions, no fostering of the growth of responsible citizenship but is rather retarding that growth. Anyone would be very foolish not to avail themselves of such opportunities if allowed. Why should he make any effort to raise himself to any prescribed status of citizenship?\n\nIt is true this would work a hardship in some cases, perhaps not a few, but when a man is thrown on his own resources it is remarkable what difficulties he will meet and surmount with a little help and encouragement. Again it would open avenues to the Department when not only the children but the whole race could be helped.\n\nIn these days of economy and cutting down of departmental revenues head of departments look for ways of escape. It is common knowledge to those connected with the Department of Indian Affairs that its present educational scheme is absorbing all its available revenue. It is obliged even to cut to the core the relief so many of these older Indians need. There is a cry for equality of recognition between the whites and the Indians. This is justifiable for the Indians has as great a right for the same relief and pension recognition. This could easily be accomplished without added expense if a change could be made.\n\nThe Indian in the Interior of B.C. could easily take care of more responsibility if given in a proper way and it would make him a much better man and citizen. It would be interesting to make a study of the Coast section in this regard. Surely some scheme could be found wherein a sectional scheme could be put into action which would deal relatively and with equal effect.\n\nAs stated above, the expenditure involved in the residential school cannot be cast aside and must be utilized to the very best advantage in making them advanced secondary educational institutions wherein a child could be developed according to ability and mentality. He would graduate from the day school as grade seven pupil and at the maximum age of fourteen. He would be able to take care of himself and also be in a position mentally and physically to be advanced in such an institution of advanced general education.\n\nParents object to sending their children away from home at the early age of seven years fearing that the child will be obliged to do work which cannot physically do. These would have no hesitation, if asked, to send them to a day school and on the other hand, would have no hesitancy in sending them at the age of thirteen or fourteen to a school such as a residential school could be made.\n\nIn cases where it could be afforded parents should be obliged\nto pay a yearly fee of $50.00 to $100.00 so that the responsibility of his own making would not entirely be taken away from him when the time came for his child or children to attend this higher educational school. Attendance to these schools should be made compulsory up to the age of eighteen years, and in every case possible giving the child an average of four years residential school life. While reducing the cost of education it would also increase the numbers eligible for that higher essential education, reaching in turn a greater number and again the Department of Indian Affairs and churches would reap a greater benefit by turning out these greater numbers. To give real justice to a child's education in a residential school an increase of per capita grant is necessary. The child is obliged to do too much manual labor. Actual labor should only take place during periods of demonstration and should be of short duration. Residential schools cannot afford to hire labor to do the work, especially is this so where agriculture has to be taught.\n\nIt has been abundantly demonstrated that the Indian child today can take an advanced education. Schools are every year now graduating children who have attained a high school standard, not a few of these advancing to matriculation or university entrance standards. Academically a few should be taken on and in so far as it is possible the Department of Indian Affairs should be ready to absorb them as teachers, stenographers and instructors. Wherever possible graduates should be employed whenever a boy shows aptitude and a tendency to responsibility, positions should be given him; to this aim the Department through its agents should work. Appeals should be made to the Province to utilize the Indian rather than any foreigner. Employers of trade should be approached, railways asked to employ Indians wherever possible on the sections. It is rather sad feature of regular employment to find every nationality, Chinese, Japanese, Swedes, immigrants from Norway and the Balkan States given preference over the heads of young Indians who are anxious to make good, and given an opportunity would undoubtedly arise to the occasion.\n\nThe establishment of day schools, perhaps consolidation of reserves to accomplish this, making a two or more roamed school would be advantageous to the children as well as to the teacher employed. It would give an opportunity for a partially graded school and therefore more individual class attention. If a bus should be necessary, the driver could act as truant officer, as well as instructor in school gardening and general supervision of the Indian work on the reserve or reserves, by making a study of this and wherever possible a school could be erected. This should be done with a view to taking care of educationally not only the children but the parents as well.\nIt is true there are a number of day schools in the province situated, in some cases, very remote places. One, two and three in an agency with, in some cases, unqualified teachers, and on top of that, a very poor average attendance throughout. They are too scattered and insufficient in number to place a truant officer in the district so duty is placed on the agent or assistant. Each of these officials, unless it is on the beaten track, makes no attempt to visit the homes unless demanded by the Department.\n\nThe Department appoints as inspector of schools a man who is conscious of his position and in the choice of teachers allows the agent or church or some sympathetic reason to have a teacher continue in the school who is not worth his board, without taking into consideration the monthly he receives. What use is a dog if he is not able to hunt, or assist in driving sheep or cattle, without these qualities he becomes an ornamental animal. Officials become paid ornaments if their advice is not taken, in cases at least of glaring academic inefficiency and at this time when teachers are so numerous and are clamouring for work. A mistake in choice is sometimes made by the best of men but that mistake can never be one hundred percent in every case. What business has the church or Department men in the field who interfere with the inspector of schools when the inspector knows his work and is doing his best to raise the standard of general education. There are too many wheels within wheels. Every possible assistance should be given a man who wishes to give his best but the hanger-on should have no place at all whether his inability comes through insufficient training, or because he is a good fellow who has been so long in the work and who has perhaps in many other ways done a great deal for the Indian. The education of the future generation must not be jeopardized. If more day schools were established then more regular attendance would be forthcoming, and the decrease in expenditure would warrant a full time truant officer.\n\nGreat care should be taken that the children are not educated away from themselves. Separate schools should be established so that in them the sexes could be educated along the same lines, reaching the same standard, numerically equalizing as much as possible. Human tendency is to link up with alike standards in education and society. This is applicable to the Indian and it should be the business of the system to see that no distinction is made but that each and every child should be given an equal opportunity to fit him or herself into the race as a race but not by blood absorption or inter-marriage. Unfortunately there are always those among the white race who will stoop to the lowest and in satisfying fleshly desires take advantage of the Indian girl, making her his slave. Indian parents also will sacrifice their girl's character to get a white connection, though the connection as a rule happens to be with the lowest element, hence the last state is worse than the first. By all means keep the race together by giving them an opportunity to get satisfaction educationally and socially within themselves, so taking away a great evil which has heretofore exhibited itself in the half-breed situation which is a menace to the advance of the Indian himself.\n\nI can now hear the churches crying out in holy horror but surely the churches can rise to an occasion which is for the good of the land, holding themselves to make allowances, and by some arrangement provide for the situation. If on the other hand strict adherence to church denomination is sought, then leave church division as it is. Let Anglican be Anglican but shift children from the Coast to the Interior or vice versa, establishing one or more residential schools to take care of advanced learning and one to take care of the destitutes, applying this method to the Roman Catholics and non-Conformists alike. These schools are already in existence and would not now be an additional expense in the scheme. Pride and prejudice must be a nonentity even as the Department would have to drop\nplaying politics if this arrangement were to be carried out. Citizens of the Kingdom of God cannot be made unless fairness is shown. Fairness cannot be shown if we are going to lower ourselves to allow politics to play a part in the lifting-up of these people.\n\nSince the Indian has taken the first step in citizenship, that of being responsible for his own family and therefore has approached to a standard of citizenship, the great question arises, what are these children going to do to maintain this first step? The parent has been made responsible in the first stage which naturally follows the child and therefore a following-up scheme must be forthcoming. A definite concrete following-up scheme must be ready for graduates. They are, in the schools, mentally equipped and during this period are shown how they can maintain themselves. Let me say here that an honourable discharge certificate and a mentally alert child is not sufficient to keep the child going in the way wherein he has been so carefully taught while in the school. Principals and teachers alike are not giving just service to society if their business is anything other than to equip and advance the children who come within their charge. They should guide them as far as they reasonably can towards self-maintenance and independence. It can then be truly said that the very definite lesson that first and always occupy the mind of every church or government institution and every teacher in these institutions is self-reliance and responsibility. Any individual institution which for any purpose seeks to hold up the success of these children is misusing God-given opportunities. Since this is the case let me ask the question, what is being done by the Department to nurture and maintain this spirit of responsibility? Let me answer the question by giving a picture of what under the present abstract system might easily happen. A boy is graduated from a school wherein he has been studied and has been led to follow farming. He has shown an interest in all phases of agriculture. The boy graduates, going back to the reserve which he now calls going back home, and finds there a few acres of land on which he is expected to carry out that which he has been taught. After years of living within a school where his meals were regular and good, clothing warm and sufficient, baths regular, and a good clean bed wherein to sleep nine hours a day, the boy finds himself at the age of eighteen saying my mind will work but my hands are tied. I have no house, I have no machinery, I have nothing, only an education which now I would be better without for I would, in my ignorance, not have known anything different. Again the natural instinct tells him he must mate and perhaps take unto himself a wife, who also has been through a school, increasing step by step the responsibility. Then, through the blessings of God, a child makes its appearance, the boy with a wife and child to care for, will if he is able, use his education honestly and in an honest way take care of himself and his dependants. If he cannot then he will use some other means, it makes no difference as long as he can get enough of this world's goods to supply his needs and the needs of his wife and child. He falls into the hands of the law and is sentenced for supplying, stealing, or cattle rustling, and is branded a criminal in carrying out his duty as a father and a husband in caring for his legalized wife and child. With all good intentions, perhaps driven to the wall, when a little thoughtful help at his graduation would have made him a desirable citizen. No one of an official capacity visits him or takes an interest and one more Indian has come to be watched criminally in all that is officially recognized. He at least lives in close proximity to the clutches of the law, not an honourable citizen as he was taught he must be, but one that becomes a liability. Again there are always white men who will stoop to use an Indian for his (the white man's) criminal advantage. This is in so many cases unfortunate but true.\nIn not a few of these cases an Indian gets work, and on the strength of this runs a bill at the local store and pays up as the weeks go by. When his work finishes he never thinks of his bill and leaves an honestly contracted debt unpaid. Work again comes his way but he goes off to another store, and so on. Here let me ask would it not be much better for the Department to allow some means of collection in this regard? Yet a just debt remains unpaid because the Department's agent says keep off the reserve, you cannot take his horse or his cow or his beans, nor can you take his money. Again Indians who are to a great extent making good, by having been given help initially from the Department, can purchase a car, which is in almost every case his ruination, and can if he wishes run this car over the bank or can ruin it mechanically, and the dealer has no comeback as the Indian simply says take your car back I am finished with it whereas if he knew that his beans or horse or cow could be taken for part payment of a just debt he would not be in a hurry to purchase his ruination.\n\nIt is said that dealers have no business selling to an Indian as he knows he cannot collect, while another says do not worry the dealer made the Indian pay enough initially for the car and has been well paid for it, is this the proper viewpoint to take? Does not it likewise instill in both the minds of the Indian and the dealer dishonesty? Surely it does, for if the dealer knew he could get his own, as he can out of every other citizen he would be more inclined to deal honestly. The Indian also knowing that he would have to make his regular payments would not, in the first place, be inclined to risk more than he was able to pay. It is true in cases among the whites there is no sense of honour and dealers are obliged to take great risks and for these risks the faithful generally have to make payment. One never sees an opportunity for wholesale daylight robbery, as it were, as is the case with the Indian; almost all of them by the fact that they are not liable to pay bills are in that fact liable to be made dishonest citizens, men for whom no one has respect. The church and schools can teach until doomday and their combined efforts cannot avail for the gross wrong that is being done to the Indian at the present moment. He parades under the name Indian avails himself of his privileges, and laughs under the skin at his own weakness and inability to get what he wants and cheat without restriction almost. The railways running through our province do more for the uplift of the Indian than the Department, for where an Indian earns his living off the reserve, the Department places him in the same category with the white laborer, hence his monthly wage is liable to guarantee by his debtor. If he allows this to happen a second time he finds himself without a job. This I am sure is teaching responsibility and just what is needed to make an honest citizen. This could easily be done and profitably extended to every Indian on the reserves by utilizing the agent or his assistant to carry out just and fair collection of fairly contracted debts.\n\nInterested enquiry into the assistance given by local agents to local business men show that, in so many cases, the agent and his office does not mean a thing to them in the way of assistance to collect debts. There are cases where local business men have been of material assistance to the agent and if this was co-operatively utilized its reflection on the Indian would be of great benefit to his uplift. Not all business men are out to exploit the Indian, some are ready to help in every way possible. These men should be given every support but they are, in so many cases, fighting a lone battle. An Indian is allowed to run a bill, through the kindness of the merchant, and pledges in good faith an amount of his monthly wage, his bean crop, or his apple crop, or his fur harvest, or his fish harvest but when bills fall due and he is approached, he leaves and goes to the Chinese store next door. Here the Indian can buy or gamble as he sees fit, and is exploited, robbed of his character as well as his money. One finds that the Indian will do his business on Sunday through the back door of a\nChinese joint rather than a week day, through fear that the honest merchant\nto whom he is indebted, will see him. This situation is a reflection on\nProvincial authority for not enforcing the law and it is also a reflection\non the agent who should interest himself enough to see that his Indians\nwere morally and Christianly protected. Many a time it is asked what the\nchurch is doing. The church does a great deal for the Indian in his youth\nbut what can it do but condemn the Indian together with the prescribed\nindeficient process of Indian uplift.\n\nIn the Thompson and Fraser Valleys there are many Indians who are\nself-supporting and many more could be made self-supporting if made to\nrealize that their debts should be attended to before potlatching and pow-\nwowing, spending everything overnight when they should have plenty to keep\nthem over the season. Conditions of this sort need not arise if the\nproper supervision is given and a check made by keeping in touch with local\nbusiness places, especially Chinatown stores. Local business men should\nbe able to co-operate with the agent in being able to go to him for action\nin cases where fairly contracted bills should be paid. Allowing the Indian\nto fall into dishonesty is the very opposite to that which he is taught\nduring his school life.\n\nIndians who are steady workers have also been helped by the agents\nto evade Poll Tax, which is a direct evasion of responsibility.\n\nUnder the present working conditions with such meandering arrangements\nit is no wonder that some of the Departmental officers who have the uplift\nof the Indian at heart, cry out in disgust at the way the work is carried\non and especially when politics are allowed to govern. The principals of\nschools without exception, must dread the day when their boys and girls\nhave reached the age when they slip over the threshold of the school no more\nto return as a pupil. The task is not impossible if all were in the work\nfor the work's sake and the above loop-holes were covered.\n\nThe following-up scheme should be carefully considered and as the\nfoundation for this scheme should be well and truly laid during the child's\nperiod of school life it would only remain for the department to enlarge or\nbuild upon that foundation. No one can gainsay the fact that foundations\nfor citizenship are laid in any educational system. The Indian work then\nshould be carefully fostered and nurtured in its growth.\n\nFor the Interior of B.C. the community system of settlement would\nundoubtedly be the ideal as it would well take the place of the reserve and\nso called rancherie. Indians are fond of social life and if this fondness\ncan be guided in the proper channels then we have gone a great way in our\nupward progress. Thirty acres of land is sufficient to take care of a man\nand his family, and with intense cultivation such as that which should be\ntaught in the schools, an Indian would become self-supporting in a very\nshort time; providing appointed officials were capable of doing their work\nand interested themselves in the Indian and his welfare.\n\nThe Interior on the whole could easily be organized. The water\nquestion being the big problem in the community system. Church, school,\nand Departmental supervision could more easily be carried on and maintained\nand an immediate status of citizenship established. Situation of reserves\nshould be chosen with a view for easy marketing conditions, some of the\nreserves now set apart are ideally placed and should be utilized. There\nshould be no difficulty with co-operation between the Province and the\nDominion in setting apart new reserves if necessary, for in the cause of the\nIndian, it is a common one to all.\n\nThe Interior of B.C. is ideal and presents many opportunities for\nmixed farming by which a farmer can readily provide for his needs. Purchases\nhe would be obliged to make, over and above his own productions could easily\nbe provided for with a few tons of potatoes or a few tons of hay. Car lots\ncould always be made up in a community whereas individually it would be much\nharder and almost impossible. The Indian does not need big holdings but\nwith a number a great deal of successful concentrated work could be done.\nIf the Indians of the southern Interior of B.C. were taken care of in this manner, it would in turn care for one-third of the Indian population, which in itself would be of some material benefit to the Department. This scheme of community settlement would demand a means of regulation. Initial expenditure by the Department would have to be made and therefore an investment, in advance, to the community. Boys placed in their settlement should be obliged to pay interest charges and a small portion each year on the principal, so that over a period of years full return would be made to the Department. This would place some responsibility on the holder, which in itself would make him fit into effect that which he had been taught.\n\nThe land so distributed, when paid for, should be ceded to him as his property, not to be sold or traded, but for perpetuation by will to his next of kin, male or female; or dealt with in like manner and according to Canadian Law relating to any other citizen of the land.\n\nOld time Indians who value their property by the number of dogs and horses they have should not be allowed near such a community settlement. The younger Indians of today are crying out against such, stating that they are a hold-up to their advance. While one man has to be careful in accepting this statement, coming as it does from boys who have been through school, for very often these lads feel their status in education and become agitators of a kind. Nevertheless it shows the desire to get away and to cast off, wherever possible, prejudices of this kind.\n\nThe Coast situation would represent a difficulty, the fishing industry taking the Indians from place to place, but by careful study a great and substantial change could be made and a successful scheme evolved. On Vancouver Island there is an opportunity for agricultural development which should in every way be fostered, and the Indians induced to stay on the land.\n\nIn this manner work officially would take upon it a concrete nature giving those in charge a better opportunity for getting away from forced abstractness. As mentioned above, a sectional study should be made and should cover every aspect of the work, from the school teacher to the commissioner. What good would an agent be if he were unable to look into the agricultural pursuits of the school graduates in an essentially agricultural area or agency, especially if the child was taught agriculture because sectionally it was his only pursuit? One sees an advertisement hanging in the local post office wanting a man for constable who has at least a practical knowledge of agriculture. The Department realizes the necessity for this end an appointment is made, after a great deal of political pull, of a man who does not know the difference between a Holstein cow and a Durham, or a variety of wheat from a variety of oats. The thing is absurd, yet in some cases, is a reality. Agents likewise have been appointed, so great care should be taken, especially in regard to agents and their assistant. It matters not what race or age within that race is being dealt with, if the official is unable to advise and keep occupied the people under him, then he is only an expense to the Department and shortly becomes a hanger-on and is moved from place to place and is, to use a common proverbial phrase, a round peg in a square hole.\n\nOccupation is the secret of success in any line of work. If a teacher is unable to keep his children occupied, he has chaos instead of order in his classroom. This applies to every class of work. An official should be able to make an intelligent survey of his work, and if at all interested, he will do so without delay on his appointment. He will call a meeting of his Indians, ascertain their ideas and be prepared to make recommendations. A bluffer, delinquent, or incapable person has no business to be in the work, and the Department of Indian Affairs should not have to endure dictation politically. It should have no sympathy whatever for inaggressiveness of a man who expects to do a day's work beginning between 10 o'clock and noon and finishes at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The work itself demands a full day's work. Equilibrium of service is a studied\nnecessity; delinquency gives the Indian a chance to come back. Reasonable aggressiveness with good judgment, sympathy for the Indian, and patience is our need in the field. No sympathy should be given to men whose habits are not ideal; slothfulness, drunkenness, immorality or even indifference should not be for a moment tolerated.\n\nIt is universally known that the church, no matter what branch, sets ideals of measurement in moral and social life. Every official therefore should be ready to set a church example and attend his own services with regularity and frequency. While this is a highly commended virtue it also excites conscientious scruples which in every person genders to efficiency, regularity of habits, and temperance in all things. Choice of fit men is not a mere position filling act but the use of retrospective individuality as well as possible recognized ability to conscientiously and efficiently carry on the work so far as it is physically and reasonably possible, is required.\n\nAn official's work is not to toast his feet at the fireside, reading a novel and waiting for the work to come to him but rather, by studying his problems he can see possible complications or necessities and is ready to meet them. Emergencies arise in every sort of life but the man who is obliged to treat everything as an emergency is short of individual energy and therefore a men to whatever part of life's realities he has contact. How real these things become in the work and responsibility one has undertaken in playing his part in bringing these aboriginal peoples up to a standard of citizenship wherein they would become entirely self-supporting.\n\nThe Church truly plays its part in this great work but it is not always successful in every sense because representatives of the Department find it hard work with the church personnel, rightly so in cases. Again the church personnel find church sympathy very lean within the hearts of Departmental officials, especially where there is no example of church consciousness nominal church men as a rule find it hard to co-operate. Real churchmen as a rule understand the reality of living in Divine touch with their God and fellowmen.\n\nAn official should not think in terms of money but in terms of Indian citizenship. It is true we all expect a living wage but when the higher things are thrown away for the less essentials or material things, we are missing the mark. Again if an official always is crying over being underpaid or he finds it hard to make ends meet or worse still allows bills to run, what kind of an example can he be to the Indian? He is a specimen of not much worth to himself, to the work, and to the Department.\n\nAgent's assistants and agents themselves centre their activities in laying off and arresting when they would be much better occupied in how they are going to occupy their Indians, and bring their law-breaking minds into profitable occupation. The constable forgets that his appointment hinged upon a knowledge of agriculture, fur farming, lumbering, fishing or mechanic.\n\nEnfranchisement is one thing and a standard of citizenship is another. To be raised to full enfranchisement would perhaps necessitate the Indian's removal from the reserve or doing away with the reserve system. While to raise him to a standard of citizenship wherein he would be responsible for his own responsibility would leave him on the reserve, keeping the reserve system in vogue as it is today. The present system gives the Indian an opportunity and protects him in that opportunity of parading under the name \"Indian\". He gets what benefits he can, in most cases not a few, some of which have already been mentioned, and glories in his own ability of being able to hang on to the apron strings of the Department. Take away that protection wherein he is able to say: \"you can't sue me\"; \"you cannot take my cow, nor horse\"; \"you cannot collect my produce money\", or in his own mind the statement, \"I am not obliged to pay my just debts if I don't want to\"; \"you white man, you owe me a living anyway and why should I not get it\",\nand you will see how quickly his attitude will change. Observe how careful he will be when he knows that through the agent or other authority he will be obliged to pay his way. Again by the day school system, he would be obliged in so far as he was able, to take care of his own family thereby making him entirely responsible for his own responsibility.\n\nA step of this character taken would automatically put out of commission agitators, Indian and white, making the work pleasant as well as interesting. It is sad to say there are white men who exploit the Indian and are constantly advising him behind the scenes. The Department has had plenty of proof of this as letters are constantly received which indicate agitators are at work. In some cases however these parasites venture to display their individualized ignorance of the Indian situation and are a worse menace than knowing agitators; for the public is ready to accept anything on an agitative nature. Wrong impressions are thereby made, and falsified pictures are drawn of a work which should in no way be tampered with, especially by ignorance and amateurs.\n\nThere is a tendency for men in the field to lower themselves to the same standard as the Indians because the Indian is casual and unstable especially in regard to time. Punctuality is foreign to his make-up unless taught, but by careful teaching sometimes drastic to himself, he will in time respond. Church and Department alike should be always ready to maintain an equalized schedule. The Indian is no slouch, while he says nothing, he thinks a lot and his thoughts are demonstrated in his actions. He will drop one whom he knows will misplace his appointments, he will scorn one who is not as good as his word and that by this modernized Indian, who is not what his father was, will say one thing and never think of carrying it into effect.\n\nThere are a great many weaknesses in the present day system which are foreign to a general stipulated cohesiveness that in itself has a tendency to create a spirit of doubtfulness in the Indian which in his original make-up was really not there. We are too fond of transferring obligations where possible, or shelving responsibility. This particular bit of work is not my business; it belongs to the Educational Department. I therefore put into effect what the principal to the school says: he wants your boy or girl and therefore he must have him. Instead of putting it the other and better way - the Department says your boy must go to school and since there is whom I must have him. Agents should know their agencies and should be able to say I have so many children of school age, how many are you graduating so that I may know what to do. Families should be considered and good judgment meted out regarding those who first should go to school; simple but concrete co-operation. How many times principals are confronted with the story of how \"you forced me to come to school\" when if the agent and his assistant were really interested this would not be the case. Directly a shelving of responsibility is exhibited there is something wrong. There is no place for any but men who see and will take their responsibility of their own position and help others in their positions, for God knows the work needs us all with every faculty alert and every pulse vibrating with the call of duty. No one should be afraid of the responsibility of their position, fear undoes so quickly that which has taken years to build.\n\nThere are a great many Indians who have no scruples whatever and there are a great many white men who are ready to fraternize with these. There are also white men, sometimes those in authority, who will stoop to trappings for the Indian and will in good faith fraternize with him just for the purpose of getting the society which goes with laid information, when a case is brought up against the Indian. Cases have also been known where whites in authority have stooped to giving parties to make good fellows of themselves and claim for themselves a good-fellow place in the eyes of the Indian so that they might afterwards make use of the Indian and in being by the men who have the work at heart, brought up for hearing, have bribed or coerced the Indian into taking a false\noath. Trouble of this kind arises in Provincial and Dominion relations, game wardens and provincial constables who are not square have no more right to have anything to do with the Indian than has a man in the Dominion employ who is of equal calibre. There are flagrant cases of men who under provincial law are freed from crimes which should put them behind bars for years.\n\nOne then would question the authority given provincial men by the Indian Act. One also would question the mealy given informants as a possible source of wrong in encouragement to cater to the Indian's weaknesses for material gains. It would seem impossible to separate the Indian from the grasp of Provincial authority yet one feel that less opportunities be given to Provincial field authorities and more power of authority invested in the hands of the Dominion men, with a decent salary attached, so that he could not be confronted with the temptation to stoop to things of low calibre. Provincial authorities lie in wait to take advantage of the Indian when such should not be allowable. This weakens the hands of those who wish to do what is right and is also very discouraging, not to say anything of its degrading morals.\n\nRegarding enfranchisement, the Indian Act is careful to state that enfranchisement shall not be forthcoming to an Indian without his consent and the consent of the band. This has been amended to read that a committee appointed may make choice of Indians who may be given the franchise with a proviso that no violation of any agreements made between them and the crown will take place. Enfranchisement would affect only a very few Indians for all of them have interest, more or less vital, in the reserve which has been set apart for their possession. Any Indian would be very foolish to ask for enfranchisement since he can enjoy so many privileges, shelving his responsibility in so many ways. He makes it a business to see that he receives attention, demanding it in excess.\n\nThe Act also reads that, \"in case of any Indian given the franchise shall be given letters patent to all property which he has heretofore held in the reserve, providing he pay for such property and shall be classed as a citizen of good standing in the Dominion, possessing and enjoying the same legal powers, rights, and privileges as his Majesty's other subjects and shall no longer be deemed to be Indian within the meaning of any laws relating to Indians.\" This cannot be done without his removal from the reserve and if it should so happen he should be taken at far away from the reserve, his friends and kinfolk, as it is possible for him to be removed, so that in no way would he be able to exercise these new rights and privileges on his own people. To leave him on the reserve would simply mean chaos and would undo everything which has been done. Think of the untold harm one man, with practically unrestricted access to liquor stores would do; though he may not be an offender in excess drinking himself, yet he could ruin a whole reserve in a very short time. It is also a well known feature among the Indians that they will all gather around their fellows and wouldn't they have a great time enjoying the white man's privileges suddenly thrown upon one in their midst? Jail the criminal yes but would it not be better for him to still be an Indian and to a degree at least would take care of himself, even while he is constantly in jail, the country would have to be wholly responsible for him.\n\nAs a citizen who would have sole right over his own property he could sell and presently one would find a Chinese vegetable garden in the middle of a reserve which would be a wholesale menace, with arms reaching to complete destruction of reserve, health, and everything else deemed a benefit. The Chinese menace is bad enough with restrictions but with no letters it would simply be left havoc and the Department would reap accordingly. By all means let us give the full franchise to those few who are eligible and who are to-day living, in every sense taking the responsibility of the country's making, and who are not living on the reserve, and who earn their own living, in every sense of the word.\nTo those who are living on the reserve but earning their living off the reserve, e.g., laborers on the sections, farmers, etc., greater care must be taken. Beginning with this man comes the standard of citizenship which has been heretofore explained. He must be made to accept in every way the responsibility beginning with the care of his own family. This can only be done by the day school system followed by the higher secondary school education wherein he would be obliged to take care of at least part of the expense entailed. Then by a following-up scheme which can easily and readily become a very efficient means of caring for not only the few but would reach out to all. One sees a big initial expenditure in the offing but what are a few thousand dollars in making a recovery of millions over a very short period of years. It would also be a real beginning in the permanent uplift of these people.\n\nIt must also be remembered that the initiative must be taken by the Department and through its men in the field it can only be made a success. It therefore is important that men must be prepared to begin with what they now have on hand; a people who are in the middle of an educational transition period. The status now is worse than it was in the beginning. Education has been the salvation of many as it has been pointed out, but need not be if a regulation were made whereby those educated would be obliged to make proper use of their education rather than to use their development of brain to beat the law or get out of paying his just debts. Give his victim an opportunity to collect; take away protection of a wrong nature and protect him by making him work and pay as he goes. I am firmly convinced that in the course of a very few years the Indian work of B.C. could be so reconstructed that it would not only show a great reduction in expenditure but would also find the greater percentage ready to be given enfranchisement and to take it and use it as any other citizen of the Dominion.\n\nIn studying the Act one notes that a chief and a council are duly elected under the supervision of the Department, any member of which being subject to recall for certain stipulated crimes. This should be almost scrupulously observed; a chief who is immoral, dishonest, intemperate or incompetent should be removed at once and likewise with a councillor. This is one place where an agent can bring into play a real weapon that can be utilized so wonderfully for the uplift of the Indian but it is so very often neglected that it is more or less farcical to them. The Indian is very fond of position, so deprivation of honour as a rule hits them hard. Indians of the old school of thought, i.e., who tolerate potlatching, old time burial ceremonies or Indian practitioners in medicine should never hold a position as chief or councillor. Men who have risen above these things through Christian teaching and secular education properly used should fill these positions. What encouragement can one of the old school give to those who have gone through a modern school and what help would he be to the Indian agent? Every possible use should be made of the chief and the council, making sure that they realize their worth and that they are working in accordance to the Act. They should be regularly called together, their duties defined, and reports made on their fulfillment of duty, and minutes of these meetings should be taken and kept. Officials visiting reserves could very quickly ascertain what the Indians of the agency expected and were doing in the way of uplift. Another duty could be added to those already stipulated: \"To keep all undesirables off the reserve, whites and halfbreeds alike.\" There is great need of more strict observance of the halfbreed situation. There are many who are neither white nor Indian but who should have some designation. It is a marvel how these men, here and there, come to our notice; some who are receiving reserve privileges and reserve protection which, taken away, would be a severe hardship on these men, their dependants, and their own or their wife's parents. These men should be given Indian status and handled accordingly. A survey of this situation should be made by each agent and an unbiased decision made. The situation calls for a line to be drawn where a district\ndistrict separation is forthcoming. Fish cannot be made of one, and flesh of another, clean up and begin anew.\n\nThe tendency is to take everything out of the hands of the Indian which is not in accordance to the Act. One common aim should be set throughout. If franchise, then let us get busy and make those who are eligible take it as other citizens. If a standard of citizenship which will reach all is the aim, then let us together evolve a scheme, whether by getting opinions from selected individuals or by meeting on block. Whatever is to be done should be done at once. There is no time to waste in generalities or waiting to shelve responsibility. Ask one of the officials now in office in the province to make a survey and to see that it is thoroughly and intelligently made. Let it be done by one individual who will not stuff the job off or to someone else which is sometimes so carefully and unscrupulous; done in so many cases in government positions. Time should be taken to be thorough so that the situation could be fairly studied and presented. Perhaps a workable programme could be drawn up by which the official could be guided. Whatever is done should be done by one person and he should make it his business to see every worker, departmental and church alike. He should present the scheme to the Indians and get their opinions, and also to the councils where a great deal of information should be forthcoming, if these are being used by the agent, and would be if he were alert and interested in his Indians. On the other hand if the agent is not able to conduct a meeting (which by the way is not impossible) an official will not be able to make much of an Indian council interview.\n\nThere is in B.C. a very important position to be filled and if politics are kept out of it and a man appointed from the ranks, if possible, but if not, the man chosen should make his work an interest and study. There is a great opportunity awaiting such a man and the appointment is keenly awaited by all, especially the men who are interested workers because the filling of that position means much to the Indian work of B.C.\n\nApp. 1. The educational standards of officials should be a real consideration. If at all possible men who have a college degree should fill all positions. No constables should be appointed who have had at least Senior Matriculation Certificates. All other officials should have higher standards. A constable with only a matriculation certificate must not expect promotion unless a very outstanding man in the work and has amply proven his interest and worth.\n\nApp. 2.

This makes a total of $68,123 for whom education is provided.\n\nCANADA: Fiscal year ended March 31, 1933\n\n| Type                  | No. of Schools | Enrollment | Average Attendance |\n|-----------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Residential Schools   | 80            | 8,465      | 7,613              |\n| Day Schools           | 260           | 8,785      | 5,755              |\n| Combined White and Indian Schools | 9 | 175 | 119 |\n| **Total:**            | **349**       | **17,425** | **13,487**         |\n\nYou will note, from the above, that we have considerably more schools on reserves and also that the average attendance at the reserve schools in the United States is approximately 78%, while the attendance at the reserve schools in Canada is approximately 77%.\n\nThe total Appropriation for Indian Education in the United States is $9,103,230. The figures mentioned above show that the United States is providing education for 68,123 children. The average per capita costs are therefore approximately $133.\n\nIn Canada, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1933, we had an enrolment of 17,425 children and an Appropriation for Indian Education of $1,712,223.06. This works out at an average per capita cost of approximately $98.\nDepartment of the Interior\n\nDOMINION LANDS ADMINISTRATION\n\n27th February, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, this Administration provides for the maintenance and tuition of destitute orphan children of the Northwest Territories through the payment of an annual fee to the residential schools operated by the Missionaries.\n\nAt the present time consideration is being given to cases of children who have one or more parents living who, it is understood, are in a position to bear a portion of the cost of maintenance and education. These cases cannot be placed either in the category of orphans or that of destitutes.\n\nIt is felt that your Department has encountered similar situations and I should be glad to know the policy adopted in instances of this nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Education and maintenance at schools conducted by this Department for Indians is free to the individual Indian. In some instances, we place Indian children in white schools, and, in such cases, we require the parents to pay part of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Lorne Turner, Esq.,\nActing Chairman,\nDominion Lands Board,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office Commissioner,\n1220 Government St.,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been consulted by an employee of one of the Indian Industrial Schools, who asks us for certain information and advice. Before advising him, we would be pleased if you could give us the following information.\n\nOur client wants to know what provision is made for employees for payment of salaries where unable to work temporarily on account of sickness, or by reason of injury sustained during the course of employment. He also wants to know whether employees are entitled to compensation as a result of injury sustained. In this connection we do not suppose that the Department has brought employees within the purview of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" but would be pleased to hear whether this is so or not.

Of these, 80 were residential and 260 day schools. In addition, the department assisted in the maintenance of nine combined white and Indian schools.\n\nThe total enrolment was 17,425 and the average attendance 14,887. This was an increase in enrolment over that of the preceding year of 302 and an increase in attendance of 380. A more regular attendance was maintained at the day schools during the year, the average being 65.73 as compared with 63.69 for the previous year. The percentage of attendance at the schools was 77.4, a record for the work.\n\nEfforts were continued during the year to improve conditions in both day and residential schools. Many fully qualified teachers and instructors were engaged and equipment was maintained to standard. The residential school activity was particularly encouraging. All the schools had an enrolment of pupils to full capacity. Under present conditions, the Indian parents are anxious to place their children in the schools did this become possible.\n\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools. This co-operation of the churches in the case of residential schools is as follows: Roman Catholic, 44; Church of England, 21; United Church, 13; Presbyterian Church, 2; making a total of 80.\n\nIn addition to the regular academic work taught in Indian schools, there is the very important vocational training at the residential schools. Farming, gardening, raising of stock, manual training, and domestic instruction are being given more attention than ever before. Although at day schools is most difficult, but progress is gradually being made.\n\nDialysis is used in many of the classrooms, except those in the more northern schools. Under arrangement with the provincial departments of Education, the services of regular inspectors and separate school inspectors are utilized, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and Newfoundland where there are special Indian school inspectors. In addition, there is a medical inspection service which gives constant supervision to the vocational training.\n\nComputing and high school work is taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced pupils in those institutions schools that are situated close to universities or colleges are assisted by secondary teachers in competition with white children. There were 120 half-time Indian students not shown in the tabular statements, attending public schools, high schools, and universities in Canada.\n\nThe department, in the case of most of these assists with a grant from parliament for the purpose.\n\nNo new building operations were undertaken during the year, only were carried out in order to keep buildings in a good state of repair.\n\nThe tendency toward Indian education shows a decrease of [34:28] as compared with the year before being mainly due to deduction in per capita residential schools. The tendency also shows a reduction in educational services in\nMarch 20th 1934.\n\nJ. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O.

From that date to this, March 17th 1934 I have not had leave of absence for the purpose of vacation aside from such days as set aside as statutory holidays. Of them not all have I observed.\n\nIllness came upon me on Wednesday August 16/33 whereupon, I sought medical advice and was under hospital treatment one day at that period. A relapse occurred in September and I sought chiropractic services which I underwent from Sep. 11th to Oct. 11th. Another relapse overtook me in November when I underwent treatment from Nov. 11th to 21st. A further relapse came on in December when I underwent treatment from Dec. 28 to January 17th. Throughout the periods of sickness above mentioned I was necessitated to pay travelling expenses, Board and Laundry and Doctor's fees as well as no salary forthcoming. The approximate expenditure thereof being about \u00a3300.00.\n\nTherefore, I would be pleased to have advise thereabouts as to whether I am entitled to sick leave with or without pay, or with reduced pay?\n\nSince I will have concluded a three year term of service hereat on Monday, March 19th 1934 without taking leave for vacation except Sundays and Statutory holidays, could I rightfully combine the holidays permissible for a three year period into the vacation period of present year?\n\nWho is the Deputy Head to whom I may apply for my leave of absence as for vacation purpose?\n\nIn the position I now hold am I thus regarded as a member of the...\"\nDominion Civil Service?

This also applies in the case of purchase of equipment and furnishings. In some instances, undertakings have been made on the part of the Department to furnish certain financial assistance, but many of the arrangements made in this connection have been verbal in nature and the terms are not of definite record. It would seem, however, that, in some, if not all, cases, the Department is obligated to some degree, but the lack of written records and agreements makes it difficult to determine the nature and extent of this responsibility.\n\nThe fact that the Department has undertaken the payment of per capita grants implies a certain responsibility for the upkeep of the buildings and equipment, if not for the capital cost. For the purpose of dealing with these difficulties in future, the Department has decided to adopt the following policy:\n\n1. The Department of Indian Affairs will undertake the payment of per capita grants and any financial aid towards the cost of buildings and equipment only when the prior authority of the Department has been granted. This authority should cover such matters as site, size, and nature of school buildings, particulars regarding equipment and furnishings and cost involved.\n\n2. Such authority in all cases to be set out in a formal and definitely worded agreement between the Department and the church authorities interested, for the guidance of both, as a matter of record, and for the purpose of avoiding future misunderstandings.\n\n3. That the schools now operated by authority of the Department, as recognized by the payment of per capita grants, be assisted from time to time as circumstances warrant and financial conditions permit.\n\nI wish to emphasize that, unless authority is first obtained, the Department cannot in future assume any responsibility for reimbursing church authorities or principals of schools towards any part of cost of work undertaken by them in the erection of school buildings, the making of additions and repairs, or the purchase of equipment and furnishings.\n\nI would request that the above rulings receive your careful attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has frequently been requested in the past to assume financial responsibility towards the capital cost of the erection of residential school buildings in which it does not exercise the right of ownership.

Grants have also been requested towards the cost of additions, repairs and maintenance, and for the purchase of equipment and furnishings. Frequently, applications for these grants have been made after the work has been completed and without previous submission of plans and an estimate of cost for departmental approval.\n\nIn some instances, undertakings have been made on the part of the Departments to furnish certain financial assistance, but many of the arrangements made have been verbal in nature and the terms are not of definite record.

Applications for assistance from schools now operating by authority of the Department as recognized by the payment of per capita grants will, as in the past, receive such consideration as circumstances warrant and financial conditions permit.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nApril 19, 1934.\n\nCircular letter of April 19, 1934, attached,\nattached letter sent to the following:\n\nRoman Catholic Church Officers:\nRt.

Up to the present time, we have been able to work out harmoniously the policy to be followed in connection with each of these schools, but if the Department wishes signed agreements and written records concerning the details when new projects are undertaken, it will be perfectly satisfactory to us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle\nSYNOD HOUSE\nREGINA, SASK.,\nCANADA\n\nApril 23, 1934.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the absence of the Bishop of Qu'Appelle,\nwho is at present in England, we beg to acknowledge\nreceipt of your communication of the 19th inst.\nenclosing memorandum re the future policy of the\nDepartment in connection with Indian Schools. We will\nrefer this communication to his Lordship on his return\nto the Diocese towards the end of June.\n\nI am,\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOctober 16 1922\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have to inform you that there has been an amendment of the definition of the words \"Protestant Child\" and \"Roman Catholic child\" as they appear in subsection 1 of section 10 of the Indian Act. It is my request that you substitute the present communication for that of June 5th, last, and govern yourself accordingly.\n\nThe concluding part of subsection 1 of section 10 of the Indian Act, as enacted by 10-11 Geo.V., Chap. 50, Section 1, provides as follows:\n\n\"... No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School, or a School conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nThe opinion of the Department of Justice is that a Protestant child is one born of Protestant parents, or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices. A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. In other words, the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child should be brought up, and his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\nIn accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so; but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of the peace. Indian agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of Bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department.\n\nAs intimated in my earlier communications, I do not wish this ruling to be the occasion of requests that children be transferred from one school to another on the grounds of the present decision. I believe that a child, that has been resident in a school and may have imbibed religious opinions, should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, Miss. Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nJune 14th, 1922.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter dated June 5th, \"concerning the religion of applicants for admission to Indian Schools\", received, and considered by the Executive Committee of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada at its meeting held on Monday of this week.\n\nThe Executive Committee adopted, unanimously, the following resolution:\n\nWHEREAS;\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada has before it the letter dated June 5th, of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stating, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have to refer to my letter of December 24th last concerning the religion of applicants for admission to Indian residential schools.\n\nThe concluding part of Subsection 1 of Section 10 of the Indian Act, as enacted by 10-11 Geo.V, Chap.50, Section 1, provides as follows:\n\n\".... No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\".\n\nThe interpretation, which the Department had placed upon this part of the Section, having been criticized by certain officials interested in the education of our Indian wards, the matter was referred to the Deputy Minister of Justice, whose opinion is that a Protestant child means a child of parents who are Protestant; and a Roman Catholic child is one who has been baptized as a Roman Catholic or is born of Catholic parents; but the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child shall be brought up, and that his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them\".\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED;\nThat the said interpretation is wholly unacceptable to\nthe Church of England in Canada, which demands an\ninterpretation governing in the same terms \"applicants\nfor admission to Indian residential schools\", in\nrelation to the Church of England and in relation to\nthe Roman Catholic Church; that the official withdrawal,\nforthwith of the interpretation be respectfully but\nmost firmly requested and demanded; and that a copy of\nthis resolution be sent to the Right Honourable the\nPrime Minister of Canada, and to the Honourable the\nMinister of the Interior as the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\".\n\nThe foregoing resolution is so explicit that I do not\nthink that I can add much by way of comment, save to say;\n\n1. That by the words \"governing in the same terms\", we\nmean that the form of words, that is the tests,\nused to determine the religion of an applicant in\nrelation to the Roman Catholic Church must apply\nalso, under similar circumstances, to determine\nthe religion of an applicant in relation to the\nChurch of England in Canada. The interpretation\nof the Act as given by the Deputy Minister of\nJustice, quoted in the above resolution lays down\nthe definition that \"a Protestant child means a\nchild of parents who are Protestants; and a Roman\nCatholic child is one who has been baptized as a\nRoman Catholic or is born of Catholic parents\".\nIn other words two tests (1) baptism, (2) parent-\nage, are applied to determine the religion of an\napplicant in relation to the Roman Catholic Church,\nand one only, parentage, in relation to the Church\nof England.\n\n2. That the interpretation under discussion is, in the\nrespect described, wholly and absolutely unaccept-\nable to the Church of England in Canada. The inter-\npretation gives the Roman Catholic Church except-\nional consideration and, in consequence, directly\ninvades and contravenes the basal principle of\nreligious equality.\n\n3. That I should be remiss in my duty if I failed to\nemphasize in the strongest possible manner the fact\nthat the interpretation is wholly and absolutely\nunacceptable to the Church of England in Canada;\nwhich Church very respectfully, but most firmly,\nrequests and demands that it be withdrawn, forth-\nwith, in the same official manner in which it has\nbeen announced; and that failing such withdrawal,\nin the manner described, the Church of England in\nCanada will, while definitely and publicly ref-\nusing to accept or to recognize the interpretation,\nmost strenuously resist and oppose the application\nof the same by any and every means in its power.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions of the Executive\nCommittee I am sending a copy of this letter, including the resolution,\nto the Right Honourable the Prime Minister and to the Honourable the\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOffice of the Deputy Superintendent General,\nJune 5, 1922. Ottawa.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have to refer to my letter of December 24th last, concerning the religion of applicants for admission to Indian residential schools.\n\nThe concluding part of Subsection 1 of Section 10 of the Indian Act, as enacted by 10-11 Geo.V, Chap.50, Section 1, provides as follows:\n\n\"....No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\".\n\nThe interpretation, which the Department had placed upon this part of the Section, having been criticized by certain officials interested in the education of our Indian wards, the matter was referred to the Deputy Minister of Justice, whose opinion is that a Protestant child means a child of parents who are Protestants; and a Roman Catholic child is one who has been baptized as a Roman Catholic or born of Catholic parents; but the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child shall be brought up, and that his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\nIn accordance with this view if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department. The Department reserves the right to make decisions in special cases that are brought to our attention.\nAs intimated in my earlier communication in this connection, I do not wish this ruling to be the occasion of requests that children be transferred from one school to another on the grounds of the present decision. I believe that a child, that has been resident in a school and may have imbibed religious opinions, should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\n\nThe Department enlists your sympathetic co-operation in the event of difficult cases for decision in the future.\n\n(sgd) Duncan C.

During the year, the Department recognised a residential school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England at Fort George, Quahsee. In addition to the regular academic work at all Indian residential schools, farming, gardening, care of stock, manual training, and domestic instruction are being given more and more attention each year.\n\nIn the province of New Brunswick and in the province of British Columbia, the Department employs an Indian School Inspector. In the other provinces, arrangements have been made with the Provincial Departments of Education for the services of the regular public and separate school inspectors. Consequently, all classrooms\nexcept those in the more northern schools are regularly visited by qualified inspectors. All pupils receive medical inspection at regular intervals.\n\nContinuation and high school work is taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced pupils in these residential schools situated close to municipal colleges are able to receive secondary education in competition with white children. There are approximately 200 Indian students who are not shown in the regular statement but who are attending public schools, high schools and colleges in Canada. In the case of most of these, the Department assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation. Every possible effort is made to assist only those who will likely benefit from secondary education.\n\nNo new building operations were undertaken but all buildings were kept in a good state of repair. The expenditure for Indian Education for the year shows a decrease of $52,063.21, as compared with the previous year. Additional consideration has been given to the selection of suitable texts in order to provide books that would adequately meet the requirements of our schools. School inspectors and teachers have commented favourably on our efforts in this regard.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education from parliamentary appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1934, amounted to $1,620,129.85, as follows:-\nEDUCATION\n\nThere were 79 residential schools in operation during the year, with a total enrolment of 8,596 and an average of 7,760 - the percentage being 90.27. 256 day schools were also conducted, with an enrolment of 8,683 and an average attendance of 5,468, giving a percentage of 63.19.\n\nAs shown in the above paragraph, 335 schools were conducted by the Department, and, in addition, assistance was granted to 10 combined white and Indian schools.

In the other provinces, arrangements have been made with the Provincial Departments of Education for the services of the regular public and separate school inspectors. Consequently, all classrooms except those...\nexcept those in the more northern schools are regularly visited by qualified inspectors. All pupils receive medical inspection at regular intervals.\n\nContinuation and high school work is taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced pupils in these residential schools situated close to municipal colleges are able to receive secondary education in competition with white children. There are approximately 200 Indian students who are not shown in the tabular statement but who are attending public schools, high schools and colleges in Canada. In the case of most of these, the Department assists with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation. Every possible effort is made to assist only those who will likely benefit from secondary education.\n\nNo new building operations were undertaken but all buildings were kept in a good state of repair. The expenditure for Indian Education for the year shows a decrease of $92,093.21, as compared with the previous year. Additional consideration has been given to the selection of suitable texts in order to provide books that would adequately meet the requirements of our schools. School inspectors and teachers have commented favourably on our efforts in this regard.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education from parliamentary appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1934, amounted to $1,620,129.85, as follows:-\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF\n\nTRADE AND COMMERCE\nCANADA\n\nCOMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE\n\nOTTAWA.

You will note that we conduct both residential schools and day schools. The course or study prescribed for the province in which the school is located is followed. In addition to the regular academic courses, in the residential schools the boys are taught certain trades and the girls receive training in domestic science.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nC.

If there are any charges involved I shall be very glad to remit the amount necessary to cover the same.\n\nI am especially interested in the laws passed dealing with the matter from the time of its first initiation and also whether or not, and the extent to which, the provincial departments of education have been associated with the Dominion Government in providing for the education of the Indians.\n\nAny information or materials you may be able to send me will be sincerely appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames C. Miller\nProfessor, Educational Administration\n\nJCM J\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, requesting information respecting the policy, programme and legal provision for the education of the Indians in Canada.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, under authority of Sections 9-11 of the Indian Act, as amended, the Governor in Council is granted authority for the establishment of schools for Indian children. Under separate cover, you are being forwarded a copy of the Indian Act. Section 100 permits the Indian Bands in Council to make rules and regulations as to the religious denomination to which the school established on a reserve shall belong.\n\nIndian education had its beginning in all parts of Canada in mission schools. Gradually, the Dominion has shouldered the burden and accepted the responsibility.\n\nThere are two classes of schools - day and residential. The day schools, situated on reserves, are comparable in every way to the ordinary rural school. Residential schools are for the Indian child who is underprivileged from an educational standpoint, i.e., no school close to his home, orphan, or neglected. The activity at a residential school is both academic and vocational. Girls are taught the domestic arts, practical nursing, etc., and boys are prepared for whatever vocations are common on their particular reserves. The\n\n- academic\n\nJames C. Miller, Esq.,\nProfessor,\nEducational Administration,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,\nPhiladelphia, Pa.,\nU.S.A.\nacademic work is as prescribed for white schools by the Provincial Departments of Education.\n\nIndian schools are not part of the provincial system, but, at our request, they are visited by the Provincial Public and Separate School Inspectors. Teachers are engaged or dismissed by the Department of Indian Affairs, but they are expected to follow the advice of the Provincial Inspectors.\n\nFrom the establishment of the first schools, nearly 100 years ago, there has been cooperation between the Dominion Government and the various religious denominations interested in missionary work among the Indians. The majority of our schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with the Department in the carrying out of its educational policy.\n\nThere are no special reports on the Department's educational programme. Our Annual Reports are the only current printed matter. You are being forwarded a copy of the Annual Reports of the Department for the years ending March 31, 1927, and 1933. By reference to the report of 1927, page 12, you will find a brief account of Indian education since the date of Confederation, 1867.\n\nThe Provincial Departments of Education have no responsibility whatever for the education of Indian children. All expenditure for the purpose is provided by Parliamentary Appropriation. The Indians themselves do not provide any part of the cost of their education. Teachers having provincial qualifications are engaged in the classroom activities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Crowley, Esq.,\nAuditor General's Dept.,\nRoom 245,\nConfederation Building,\nOttawa.\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI am preparing a dissertation on Education in Canada for my doctorate from Toronto University and should be very happy if you could assist me with information regarding your system of education. I am gathering statistics to cover a period of years from all the Provinces of the Dominion. When these shall have been completed, I hope to have a comparative statement that will be useful as well as scientifically valuable.\n\nThe following data is my chief concern, or figures which will lead to such.\n\n1. Aggregate days of attendance.\n2. Total number of children of school age.\n3. Per cent of school population attending school daily.\n4. Average days attended by each child of school age.\n5. Average number of days schools were kept open.\n6. Total elementary school attendance.\n7. Total High School attendance.\n8. (a) Number of Boys -- High School.\n    (b) Number of Girls -- High School.\n9. Total yearly expenditure for education.\n10. Average annual expenditure per child of school age.\n11. Total number of teachers employed.\n12. Expenditure per pupil for purposes other than teachers' salaries.\n13. Total expenditure for salaries.\n14. Total annual enrolment.\nIf feasible, I should like to get figures which go back to the inception of public education in your Province\u2014at least as far back as possible.\n\nAny information regarding teacher-training, Normal School, cost of equipment, curriculum, etc., etc., will also be gratefully received.\n\nPlease forward everything that you can, and cost of same.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kind cooperation.\n\nI remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nCecil O'Brien\n\nDr. Sandiford has approved this thesis.\nOttawa, October 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, requesting the Department to supply you with information regarding its educational system for the Indians of Canada.\n\nRegarding the date which you require, I have to say that you are being forwarded, under separate cover, copies of the Annual Report of this Department for the years 1926 - 1933, with the exception of the report for the year 1929, which is not now available for distribution. The preparation of the various statements which you require, as to the aggregate days of attendance, etc., would entail considerable work on the part of the staff. By a review of the reports which we are sending, you will obtain information covering the past seven years.\n\nWe have not full information regarding the actual number of Indian children of school age in Canada, that is, between 7 and 16 years, but there are approximately 20,000. Of this number about 17,500 are attending school.\n\nThere are two classes of schools - day and residential. The residential schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with this Department in the carrying out of its educational policy, as is also the larger number of the day schools. There are approximately 180 teachers in the residential schools and 300 in the day schools.\n\nI would suggest that you find it convenient to visit the Department, when all reports and any other information available will be placed at your disposal. It is hoped, however, that, from the reports which are being sent, you will be able to obtain most of the information you require. I am also forwarding a copy of the Indian Act and would refer you particularly to Sections 9 - 11.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nCyril C. O'Brien, Esq.,\n53 Cunard Street,\nHalifax, N. S.\nOttawa, October 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, requesting further information regarding the education of the Indians in Canada. I note you are seeking information up to the time of Confederation.\n\nThe Department has very few records relating to Indian schools, previous to Confederation, when the Dominion Government became responsible for the education of the Indians. I am not aware where you would obtain information giving the missionary efforts of the various church denominations previous to 1872, the year this Department began publishing annual reports. I regret we will be unable to supply copies of the annual reports from that time. No doubt, copies could be seen in any of the more prominent libraries in Canada.\n\nI would suggest that you find it convenient to visit this Department, when any reports or other information we have will be placed at your disposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. Arthur Williams, Esq.,\nSte. Marguerite Station,\nTerrebonne Co., Que.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI presume you recently received an inquiry from Mr. Croft, the Canadian Bible Society missionary in New Zealand, regarding some information on education amongst the Indians. I have a copy of the annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs for 1935. I really required a copy of the syllabus which you provide for your schools. I teach in a Native school, and am extremely interested in these problems peculiar to native schools. No doubt you emphasize the use of English in your schools. The change over from the native tongue to the English results in conflict and confusion. This is only one of those problems I mentioned earlier. I should, therefore, be pleased if you would forward me a copy of the syllabus.\nof Work presented for the Indian Schools.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdward Hepburn\nOttawa, October 30th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter requesting further information regarding Indian schools in Canada. The Department does not issue any syllabus for Indian schools, as these schools follow the same curriculum as is prescribed by the province in which the schools are located.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that education in Canada for white children is under the jurisdiction of the different provincial governments. The education of Indians is the only system of education controlled by the Dominion Government and we have, therefore, found it advisable to adopt the system of following the provincial curricula.\n\nOne special difficulty in Indian schools is that many of the children do not speak English when they come to school. In order to assist the teacher, we have found it useful to use a manual prepared by the Department of Education of Ontario. While this manual refers particularly to the teaching of English to French-speaking children, many of our teachers have applied it to advantage in Indian schools. We have, also, found it necessary to prepare a Pre-Primer designed especially for our schools. For your information, I enclose a copy of the manual referred to above, also a copy of our Pre-Primer and the Work Book which is used in connection with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nEdward Nepia, Esq.,\nThe School,\nHoroera,\nTe Aroroa,\nEast Coast,\nNew Zealand.\nOctober 31st, 1934.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have a letter from Mr. F. Arthur Williams of Ste. Marguerite Station, Terrebonne County, Quebec, who is preparing to write a thesis on Indian Education. I am supplying him with information as far as the work of the United Church is concerned, but I know that he would like to correspond with the Department of Indian Affairs concerning the work as a whole. I am taking the liberty of referring him to you and I trust that it will not inconvenience you to write to him when you receive his letter of enquiry.\n\nTrusting that you are rapidly returning to normal health and with kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:NEF\nOttawa, November 1, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nI have your letter of yesterday's date, with reference to supplying information to F. Arthur Williams, of Ste. Marguerite Station, Que., who is writing a thesis on Indian Education.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that I have already replied to two communications from this man and supplied him with information, a copy of annual reports, etc., from which I hope he will be able to obtain the information he requires.\n\nI am feeling much better and hope that I have practically returned to normal. However, I am taking things as easy as possible. I have been back at work in the office since the end of August last.\n\nHoping you are enjoying good health and with best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D.

I would refer you to pages 14 and 15, Part I, and pages 44 to 56, Part II, which, it is hoped, will supply you with the information required. A census of the Indians in Canada can be found on page 31, Part II of the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nD. W. Pierce, Esq.,\nArcherwill,\nSask.\nRt. Honorable R. B. Bennett,\nPrime Minister,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Bennett:\n\nI have just read the \"Montreal Gazette\" of 21st December, 1934, stating that you held a conference with a delegation which came from all parts of Canada and that the round-table discussion was about the improvement of our Indian schools.\n\nAs an Indian vitally interested in the future of my people, I wish you would make a complete reorganization of the Educational Branch of the Indian Department, first by appointing a nationally-known educationalist, such as William B. Newell, M.A., Caughnawaga, P.Q., or Hon. George Weir, Ph.D. of British Columbia, as superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nThe U.S. Indian Bureau have now a very efficient education branch, and I wish to suggest that we do something to make our Indian schools even more efficient than theirs, for which see the last annual report of the Indian Bureau at Washington, D.C.\n\nHoping that I have made a timely suggestion,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Canadian\nOttawa, December 31, 1934.\n\nH. W.

Your letter will immediately be brought to his attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Honourable R. B. Bennett, K.C., P.C.,\nPrime Minister of Canada,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 8, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL,-\n\nRelative to the communication the Right Honourable the Prime Minister received from J. A. Canadian, an Indian of the Caughnawaga Band, I would say that this man is a rather aggressive and prolific letter writer. He, his wife and two children are at present on relief. Concerning the request of the Prime Minister, to be advised what is being done in connection with Indian education, I would say, briefly, there are 256 day schools, 79 residential schools and 10 combined white and Indian day schools in operation in Canada, with an enrolment of 17,448 pupils and an average attendance of 76.52%. The average attendance compares favourably with that in provincial rural schools.\n\nThe Department is associated with the various Church denominations in the carrying out of its educational policy, the greater number of schools being conducted under church auspices. Buildings and equipment are kept to maximum efficiency, as funds at our disposal permit. Teachers having professional qualifications are engaged and all schools, except in New Brunswick and British Columbia, are inspected by provincial public and separate school inspectors. In the two provinces named, we have our own inspectors. Textbooks and classroom studies are as prescribed for provincial white schools.\n\nAt all residential schools and a great number of the day schools, pupils can advance to the Ninth or Entrance Grade. An increasing number each year pass their Entrance to High School. At the residential schools and certain of the day schools, there are classes in manual training for the boys and domestic science for the girls. The boys are instructed in farming and the care of stock at residential schools and the girls receive training in general household duties. It would not be possible, without a large increased expenditure, to extend the work. Reports from public and separate school inspectors frequently make favourable comparison of the instruction being given in Indian schools with that in White schools in their inspectorates.\n\nThere are a large number of Indian pupils taking advanced educational courses at high schools, colleges, business colleges and universities. No part of the cost of the education of Indian children is charged to the Indians.\nIndians or to their Band Funds - all expenses being paid from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nWith special reference to the Caughnawaga reserve, to which Mr. J. A. Canadian belongs, I would say there are three modern 4-roomed schools, one 2-roomed school, and three one-roomed schools, with a teaching staff of 19 fully qualified professional teachers. In addition, there is a qualified physical instructor. Besides the regular curriculum, domestic science is taught the older girls and there is a stenographic and bookkeeping course for both boys and girls.\n\nThere are approximately 540 children of school age on the reserve. Of this number, 496 attend the day schools on the reserve and 40 others are in attendance at Indian residential schools, technical schools, business colleges and universities.\n\nThe buildings, equipment and classroom instruction on this reserve would compare more than favourably with the schools in the towns and villages of Quebec. None of the Indians contribute one cent to the cost of the education of their children. It would be difficult to improve classroom instruction at these schools. I consider that Mr. Canadian has no cause for complaint in connection with Indian education, at least on the Caughnawaga reserve.\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

I consider that Mr. Canadian has no cause for complaint in connection with Indian education, at least on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\n[Signature]\nJanuary 10th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Bennett,\n\nPlease be good enough to accept my expression of regret at the delay in my answer to your letter of December 31st, in respect to the matter of Indian education. I was absent from my office for several days owing to a minor illness and your letter was brought to my attention immediately upon my return.\n\nRegarding the Departmental activities in connection with the matter of Indian education, I would say that for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1924, the expenditure for this item amounted to $1,870,128.35, a sum somewhat exceeding 40% of our total appropriation from the General Vote.\n\nI would say briefly that there are 79 residential schools, 256 day schools and 10 combined white and Indian day schools operated in Canada with an enrolment of 17,446 pupils, and an average attendance of 76.5%. The average attendance compares favourably with that in provincial rural schools. Approximately an equal number of Indian children are educated in residential and day schools respectively. The cost of educating children is approximately 3\u00bd times as great in the residential schools as in the day schools.\n\nThe earlier efforts in the way of educating the Indians by means of residential schools were undertaken through Church and missionary enterprise. In 1911 the Department, by agreement, undertook the payment of per capita grants towards defraying the costs of maintaining\n\nRight Honourable R. B. Bennett, K.C., P.C., LL.D.,\nPrime Minister of Canada,\nOttawa.\nthe children in these schools. I may say that there has been a notable tendency for this per capita grant to increase from year to year. With two exceptions the residential schools are all conducted under Church auspices. The buildings and equipment are maintained at as high a standard as the funds at our disposal will permit. Teachers having professional qualifications are engaged, and all schools, except in New Brunswick and British Columbia, are inspected by provincial public and separate school inspectors. In the two provinces named we have our own inspectors. Text books and classroom studies are as prescribed for provincial white schools. At all residential schools and a great number of day schools pupils can advance to the Ninth or Entrance Grade. An increasing number each year pass their Entrance to High School. In the residential schools and in a number of day schools there are classes in manual training for the boys and domestic science for the girls. The boys are instructed in farming and the care of stock; residential schools and the girls receive training in general household duties.\n\nIt may be well for me to add that at residential schools the Departmental per capita grant covers the cost of food and clothing for the children admitted. Classroom equipment and text books are also supplied by the Department. In the case of the day schools in most places the Department supplies a mid-day meal for the pupils in attendance. There are a number of Indian pupils taking advanced educational courses at high schools, colleges, business colleges and universities. No part of the cost of the education of Indian children is charged to the Indians or to their band funds\u2014all expenses being paid from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nNotwithstanding the large proportionate amount of our Departmental appropriation devoted to Indian education there are still a number of Indian children deprived of the privilege of attending school. As the Indian population is increasing at a fairly rapid rate this state of affairs will tend to become aggravated.\nIn the Estimates prepared for the coming fiscal year we are making provision for the building of a number of day schools, as by this means the advantages of education can be given to a larger number of children at a lower cost per pupil than by means of residential schools. At the present time we are not contemplating any increase in the number of our residential schools and any new buildings undertaken will be in the way of replacements. I am sorry to say that the physical condition of many of our school buildings is far from satisfactory and the upkeep and maintenance costs are consequently high. We have found that where independent lighting and water systems are installed in these buildings, especially in those in remote districts, the resulting commitment in the way of maintenance and repair of these utilities tends to become a serious drain upon our financial appropriation.\n\nIt is my considered opinion that the time has come when day schools may be utilized to a greater extent in our policy of Indian education than has been the case heretofore. Outside of the question of cost altogether we have found that in a very great majority of these day schools a perfectly satisfactory quality of instruction is being imparted. Where Indians are in settled communities and have adopted to a greater or less extent the white man's mode of living, attendance of the children at day schools does not disrupt the home to the same degree as when they are taken away to residential schools. It would seem to me that the child forms an excellent medium between the school and the home for the transmission of culture and civilizing influences.\n\nWith special reference to the Caughnawaga reserve, to which your correspondent, Mr. J. A. Canadian, belongs, I would say that there are on this reserve three modern 4-roomed schools, one 2-roomed school, and three one-roomed schools, with a teaching staff of 13 fully qualified professional teachers. In addition there is a qualified physical instructor. Besides the regular curriculum, domestic science is taught the older girls and there is a stenographic and bookkeeping course for both boys and girls.\nThere are approximately 540 children of school age on the reserve. Of this number 436 attend the day schools on the reserve and 40 others are in attendance at Indian residential schools, technical schools, business colleges and universities.\n\nAny criticism that may be due to the conduct of the Department in the way of Indian education cannot be applied to the Caughnawaga reserve. I consider that the buildings, equipment and class-room instruction given on this reserve would compare favourably with that found in schools in the villages and towns in centres of white population throughout the country.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJanuary 11th, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nAs I think you may like to have the information contained therein I am sending copies of correspondence I have had with the Right Honourable the Prime Minister in connection with Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nShallow Lake, Ont.,\nJanuary 10, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to inquire about the number of Indians in Canada.

The teachers of all schools in the Yukon and the North West Territories are nominated by the church authorities. We require, as far as possible, that teachers have professional qualifications of the province in which the school is located.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

No. 2)\n- Cross Lake - U.C.\n- Red Lake - R.C.\n- Island Lake - U.C.\n- Island Lake - U.C.\n- Jack River - R.C. - Jack River Combined (Anglican)\n- Oxford House - U.C.\n- Rossville - U.C.\n- York Factory - Anglican\n- Big Eddy - Anglican\n- Chetahawin - Anglican\n- Norway House - U.C. Res.\n- Nelson House - R.C. Nelson House U.C.\n- Pas - Anglican\n- Pine Bluff - R.C.\n- Red Earth - Anglican\n- Fool Lake - Anglican\n- Spirit Lake - Anglican.\n\nCould you explain briefly just how does the Government co-operate with the various Churches in administering these schools?\nOn p.73 (Annual Report 1934) you have\n\nMoose Lake (Combined White & Indian School) listed.\n\nIs this Moose Lake S.D. #1698 where Mr. Harold Newton taught in 1932-33? Yes.\n\nIs there not a combined white and Indian School at Big Eddy and is it the same one that Mr. Walter C. Lundie is teacher of? Why is it not listed in your records? Not an Indian School.\n\n(There is an Indian Day School at Big Eddy, as well as the above.) Yes.\n\nIf you would kindly answer this letter (returning it with corrections), I would be very grateful to you.\n\nCould you send me a map of Manitoba with the Indian Day Schools, Residential schools, and Combined White Indian Schools marked on it, to give their approximate location. If you could mark one map and send me 4 unmarked maps, I could mark them myself. I need four copies for this M.A. thesis.\n\nThank you again,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn E. Lysecki B.A.\nOttawa, March 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, requesting certain information regarding the Indian schools in Manitoba, north of 53.\n\nYou are being forwarded a copy of the Auditor General's report covering the revenue and expenditure of this Department for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1934; this being the last published report. Marked thereon, you will find the expenditure for each of the schools to which you refer.\n\nWith reference to your second question, regarding the Cross Lake Residential School, I have to say that this building was destroyed by fire on February 26, 1930. One Reverend Sister and twelve children lost their lives. The loss in building and equipment was estimated at $70,000. This school has not been rebuilt.\n\nThe MacKay Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on March 19, 1933, at an estimated loss of $75,000. It is not intended to rebuild.\n\nBesides the Norway House Indian Residential School, the Roman Catholic Church authorities are conducting a residential school at Cross Lake and Jack River. There are about 15 children in residence at each point and these two schools are known under the name of the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nIt is considered that the Poplar River Indian Day School is north of 53. The parallel of latitude runs through the reserve.\n\nThe Pas and Norway House agencies are situated north of 53 and there are two day schools in the Clandeboye agency, viz.: Grand Rapids and, as stated, Poplar River.\n\nRegarding your fourth query, I may say that the Anglican Church conducts a school at Churchill, but this Department has not yet recognized same by providing any grants for teacher's salary and other expenses. We have supplied certain classroom equipment and biscuits for midday lunch only.\n\nWith reference to your fifth question, regarding the names of the schools north of 53, I would refer you to the Auditor General's report, pages 21, 22, 28 and 29 - the schools being underlined. I understand that the Moose Lake combined White and Indian Day School is also known as S. D. No. 169B. The Provincial Authorities appoint the teacher and this Department pays part of the salary and supplies, such as school material, for the Indian children, only.\n\nThere is only one Indian day school, at Big Eddy, under the control of this Department. We have no information\n\n- regarding\n\nJohn E. Lysecki, Esq., B.A.,\nSanford,\nMan.\nregarding a combined white and Indian school at this point and contribute no funds towards its support.\n\nThe Department is associated with the various church denominations in carrying out its educational policy. The early history of all schools north of 53 was that they were first started as a missionary cause. After the schools were in operation for a time, the church authorities approached the Department to take them over and be responsible for the cost of their operation, but the churches still retained their control. The church authorities nominate the teachers and their appointment is made subject to the approval of the Department. In many cases, the classroom activities are being carried on in buildings owned by the church authorities. In the case of the residential schools, a per capita grant is provided, from which the school authorities are required to provide the cost of salaries of staff, food and clothing for the children. The church authorities engage the staff at residential schools, the appointment of the Principal only being subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nI regret we have no maps of Manitoba, with the Indian schools marked thereon, available for distribution. If you write to the Provincial Department of Mines and Natural Resources, Winnipeg, you will, no doubt, be able to obtain the maps you require.\n\nI might add that the Roman Catholic Church authorities have been conducting a summer school at God's Lake, but, up to date, the Department has not assumed any responsibility for payment of salary of teacher or other expenses. It is being conducted as a church activity only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA\nTHE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION\n\nApril 3, 1935\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, CANADA\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nWith further reference to the study I am making of the relationship of the Dominion Government to education in Canada, I am anxious to obtain some significant information regarding the following points.\n\nYou will find attached a statement of the Dominion appropriation for Indian education for the years indicated as I have gleaned the information from the schedules accompanying the acts respectively referred to in the table.\n\nI am wondering if it would be possible for you to have my tabulation checked and (1) the proper amounts inserted for the year 1921; (2) the proper schedule numbers inserted for the years 1928 and 1930; and (3) the proper amounts and schedule numbers inserted for the years 1932, 1933, and 1934. I would not trouble you if it were not for the fact that this information is not available to me here in Philadelphia.\n\nI am anxious to have the statement of Government appropriations for the service accurate for the period of years indicated. If it would be of any interest to you, I should be very pleased to submit a copy of the manuscript or the section of my study on education of the Indians with a view to getting your reaction to it. I do not in any way mean to suggest that you should take any responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of my statement, but I would be glad to have the privilege of submitting it and obtaining your general reaction.\n\nI should like, of course, to have the information mentioned above as soon as possible and then, if agreeable to you, I shall send forward a copy of the manuscript for such consideration as you may care to give it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames C. Miller\nOttawa, April 5, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Miller:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, in further reference to the study you are making of the relationship of the Dominion Government to education in Canada and with special reference to the education of the Indians.\n\nRegarding the statement enclosed in your letter, of the Appropriation for Indian Education for the years indicated thereon, I have carefully checked same, made the corrections and filled in the information required by you. I may add that our Estimates for the current fiscal year, beginning the first instant, are now before Parliament but have not yet been passed. It can be assumed, however, that the figures I have given for the fiscal year beginning the first instant will be authorized.\n\nI should be pleased to receive a copy of the manuscript dealing with your study on the education of the Indians in Canada when same is completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames C. Miller, Esq.,\n114 Bennett Hall,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,\nPhiladelphia, Pa.,\nU. S. A.\nCANADIAN NEWS BULLETIN\n\nISSUED BY DIRECTION OF\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\nMinister of the Interior and Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nCANADA'S INDIANS ADVANCE IN EDUCATION\n\nContinued Gratifying Progress in Academic and Vocational Training - New Schools Being Erected\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014The continued growing interest of Canadian Indians in education is a matter of gratification to the Department of Indian Affairs, stated Honourable Thomas G. Murphy, Minister of the Interior and Superintendent General of Indian Affairs when interviewed recently on the progress of the Dominion's wards. Canada's treatment of her aboriginal inhabitants redounds to the credit of the administration, and the response of the Indians to the Department's efforts to advance them to a position of independence and self-support has been a major factor in the success of the work.\n\nIn nearly every year since the inauguration of day and residential schools among the Indians increases have been recorded both in the number of pupils enrolled and in the percentage of attendance. Ten years ago, in the school term of 1923-24, the total enrolment was 13,873 and the average attendance, 9,198. Last year the enrolment had risen to 17,446, a gain of 25.77 per cent, while the average attendance had advanced to 13,352, an increase of over 45 per cent.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 1934, there were 256 day schools, 79 residential schools, and 10 combined White and Indian schools in operation, a total of 345. The residential schools are conducted by the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and United Churches, and high tribute must be paid to the zeal and self-sacrifice of those engaged in the work. The department has had the close co-operation of these religious denominations in the education of the Indians, and this well established policy has demonstrated beyond all question of doubt the effectiveness of the system.\n\nTwo new Indian residential schools and an extension to an existing school are in course of erection this year. At Sault St. Marie, Ontario, the new Shingwauk school is under construction to replace present old buildings. This structure, which will accommodate 150 children, will be modern in every respect and fireproof. It is expected it will be ready for occupation by July 1. The school will as in the past be conducted by the Church of England in Canada.\n\nAt Lebret, in the Qu'Appelle valley, Saskatchewan, a building sufficiently large to accommodate 250 children is in course of erection to replace that destroyed by fire in November, 1932. It will be of re-enforced concrete construction and will be ready for occupation about next autumn. The school will continue to be conducted by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nTo provide increased accommodation, an addition is being made to the Residential School near Morley, Alberta. This building is of frame construction and when the addition is completed the school will accommodate 100 pupils. This school is conducted by the United Church of Canada and is for the benefit of the children of the Stony tribe.\n\n(Continued on sheet 269)\nIn these schools, as in the other Indian day and residential schools, the provincial curricula is followed, with special emphasis on language, reading, domestic science, manual training, and agriculture. For the older pupils, half the day is spent in the class room, and the remainder of the time is devoted to vocational training. There are farm lands in connection with each residential school and a member of the staff is a competent farmer. Under his guidance, the older boys carry out the farming operations and by this means they acquire a practical knowledge of farming and animal husbandry. The girls receive training in sewing, dress-making, cooking, bread-making, and other household duties.\n\nEvery possible effort is made to impart a sound academic and industrial education and special attention is given to the health of the pupils. During the years spent in the residential schools, medical and dental treatment is provided, which with a balanced diet and supervised recreation, assists in the building up of a robust constitution.\n\nTHE ROCKY MOUNTAINS CIRCLE TOUR\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014 Excellent motor highways traversing Banff, Kootenay, and Yoho National Parks form a picturesque motor loop of 260 miles. From the town of Banff the highway runs to Castle and here forks, one branch turning south via the Vermilion pass and Kootenay Park, the other proceeding west to Lake Louise and, via the Kicking Horse pass and Yoho Park, to Golden, British Columbia. These two mountain highways are connected by a good provincial road running north and south which intersects the Banff-Windermere Highway at Radium Hot Springs and ends at Golden. The route via the Vermilion pass is known as the Banff-Windermere Highway and the Lake Louise to Golden road as the Kicking Horse Trail. Motor buses make daily trips on both highways and twice a week make the circular tour.\n\nFOREST PRODUCTS AND THE RAILWAYS\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014 Of the freight handled by Canadian railways, an average of eighteen per cent, according to the Forest Service, Department of the Interior, consists of products of the forests.\n\nCANADA'S CLAY RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014 Canada has immense resources of clays and shales suitable for making good quality building brick of a wide range of texture and colour. That ample use is being made of such clays is evidenced by the large number of brick structures seen throughout the Dominion, states the Department of Mines.\nEDUCATING YOUNG INDIANS.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs announces in a bulletin that its wards are taking keen interest in education. It is said that in nearly every year since the inauguration of day and residential schools among the Indians, increases have been recorded both in the number of pupils enrolled and in the percentage of attendance.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 1934, it is reported, there were 256 day schools, 78 residential schools, and 10 combined white and Indian schools, making a total of 345. The residential schools are conducted by the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and United Churches, and high tribute is paid to the zeal and self-sacrifice of those engaged in the work. The Department has had the close cooperation of these religious denominations in the education of the Indians.\n\nIn these schools the Provincial curriculum is followed, with special emphasis on language, reading, domestic science, manual training, and agriculture. For the pupils half the day is spent in the classroom and the remainder of the time is devoted to vocational training. There are farm lands in connection with each residential school, and a member of the staff is a competent farmer. Under his guidance the pupils carry out the farming operations, and by this means they acquire a practical knowledge of farming and animal husbandry. The girls receive training in sewing, dressmaking, cooking, bread-making, and other household duties.\n\nWhile this is gratifying, the thought persists: What is being done for these children when they return to the tribal home? Reports have it that, especially during the winter months, many Indians are on the verge of starvation. Of what use, then, will be the presence of these homes from the residential schools with a smattering of domestic science, manual training, or agriculture? These children will have caught a glimpse of civilization, enjoyed some of its comforts, been well fed and clothed, had a taste of education, but back among the \"wigwams\" memories of this experience will create only mental suffering.\n\nIt is a tremendous problem. These partly educated young Indians may be as the leaven that will work for the betterment of their people, but they, under normal conditions, approaching absolute misery. No doubt the Department has considered this question, and may be taking the long view as to results. But those familiar with winter conditions among the further-away Indian tribes are of the opinion that a first aid to their behalf should be provided for the camps of food and clothing sufficient to prevent acute suffering. Education must also be provided, but it will be more effective if residential school children may return to homes that are not the abode of utter despair.\nGENERAL MEETING\nMACDONALD COLLEGE, ST.

How? Reports have been received recently during the winter months, many Indians are on the verge of destitution. Of what use, then, will be the presence of children home from the residential schools with a smattering of domestic science, manual training, or agriculture? These children will have caught a glimpse of the outside world; seen some of its comforts; been well fed and clothed; had a taste of education; but back among the wigwams' memories of this experience will create only mental suffering.\n\nIt is a tremendous problem. These partly educated young Indians may be as the leaven that will work for the betterment of their people but hardly under home conditions approaching absolute misery. No doubt the Department has considered this question, and may be taking the long view as to results. But those who know the actual conditions in the more further-away Indian homes are of the opinion that a first effort on their behalf should be provision for the camps of food and clothing sufficient to prevent acute suffering. Education must also be provided, but it will be more effective if residential school children may return to homes that are not the abode of utter despair.\nZuni Pueblo\n\nModern institutions are rapidly being adopted by the Indian population of the country, say Indian Bureau officials in a recently issued statement. In the past two months a majority of reservations have voted to accept the Indian Reorganization Act which allows them to set up a modern form of business and political organization. And now word comes from the Zunis of New Mexico of the adoption of the popular vote method of electing officials.\n\nAt Zuni villages the life of the Indians is very much as it has been in years past. They are self-contained, independent communities. Their lives pursue the ancient pattern in these days very much as they have in times past. Their dwellings are ancient, the same crops are raised in their fields, the same arts and crafts flourish. The white man's representatives are there in the form of the Superintendent, teachers, doctors, and so on. But side by side with these many of the old Zuni customs have remained.\n\nOne of these customs was the way of selecting the governor, he who would own the cane presented to the Zunis by President Lincoln as a symbol of office. In the past the choice of the governor has been made by the caciques or priests, a body of five older men whose decision bound the whole village. Once appointed by the caciques, the governor then remained in office until, by the same priestly judgment, he was replaced.\n\nBut recently there has been a trend toward popular government in the old pueblo. The young people and the more progressive old ones joined about a year ago in presenting a demand to the Indian Office for regular elections. The Indian Office left it up to them. When they finally decided that they wished to adopt the American institution of popular vote, white officials took no part in the actual election beyond seeing that order was maintained.\n\nThe first election under the new system was held recently and it passed off smoothly with an election of governor and village officers. The new men ran on a platform of supporting the present administration in its movement to fight erosion of tribal lands and to institute a program of range control. At the end of the day a village feast was held with the roasting of\u2014appropriately enough\u2014three buffalos.\n\nArts and Crafts\n\nThere is now an \"Indian Trading Post\" in the department store of R. H. Macy & Co., New York City, that harbors arts and crafts American Indians that are considered incredibly beautiful examples of contemporary art. The purpose of this \"Post\" is \"to acquaint people in the East with the charms of these things to explode the fabulous legend that the Indians could make no Indian art at its best; to show that Indian rugs, pottery, paintings and weaving fit with contemporary interior decoration as deftly as anything concocted by the modern masters of design.\"\n\nThis ought to prove an effective outlet for the handiwork of the Indians. It was inspired by Mrs. Charles W. Collier.\n\nHelp Wanted!\n\nThe I. R. A. is urgently in need of funds to keep up its work without any loss of effectiveness. A formal appeal has just been sent to our members and friends, and we hope the response to it will be prompt and generous.\n\nDeath has taken a heavy toll from the ranks of our faithful supporters, and the depression has reduced the income of others, but if each one does a part as circumstances permit, the necessary funds will be forthcoming.\n\nThomas-Rogers Bill\n\nExploiting the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma has continued so long that it seems to be considered by a certain class of attorneys as a game that should not be interfered with. The matter was very well put by Senator Wheeler at a hearing of the Senate Sub-committee on January 8, 1929 (page 1190), when he remarked to a witness:\n\n\"There are only two classes of people down in Oklahoma, the Indians and those who live off the Indians; is not that right?\"\n\n\"Mr. Selby\u2014Yes; there are a lot of honest people down there, Senator. There are many of course who live off the Indians.\n\n\"Senator Wheeler\u2014From listening to your testimony I have come to that conclusion.\"\n\nThe force of this statement is illustrated by the vicious attacks on the Thomas-Rogers bill, which aims to afford a larger measure of protection to the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes\u2014and, indeed, to all Indians in the State of Oklahoma. Senator Thomas and Representative Rogers, both of Oklahoma, and Chairmen of the respective Indian Committees, are to be commended for their courage in seeking to stop these abuses which have grown into customs. The need for such legislation is clearly shown by the determined opposition of those who are interested in the continuance of a system that has been so disastrous to the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes.\n\nNavajo Boundaries\n\nThe New Mexico Boundary Bill (H. R. 6542) would complete the task begun by the last Congress in\ndefining the exterior boundaries of the Navajo reservation in Arizona. The country occupied by the Navajo Indians is primarily valuable only for grazing purposes. It also requires large areas because of the sparseness of desert vegetation and water. Many Navajo Indians now have public domain allotments in the area within the proposed New Mexico boundary. The bill would make possible solidification of these areas by exchange or purchase and eliminate the friction due to the \"checker-board\" occupancy by Indian and white stockmen.\n\nIndian Claims\n\nSeveral bills have been introduced in the present Congress providing for setting up an Indian Claims Commission, or a Court of Indian Claims. Probably the companion bills (S. 2731, and H. R. 7837) are the best suited to the purpose desired. Settling up the mechanism for settling for all Indians and for all time their claims against the Government is urgently needed. The hope of securing large sums of money which will make all members of a given tribe wealthy, the disturbing influence of agitators seeking personal emolument, and the feeling of the Indians that justice is being denied them, stand in the way of an effective program of cooperation between the Government and the Indians. At the present rate of handling Indians' claims this procedure must go on indefinitely. The creation of such a Claims Commission as is proposed by this legislation should bring about the settlement of these matters within a reasonable period of time.\n\nW-H Amendments\n\nA bill (S. 2655, H. R. 7781) is pending in Congress to amend the Wheeler-Howard Act in two important sections. First, it provides that any elections under the Wheeler-Howard Act on the question of excluding a reservation from the application of the Act, on adopting a constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto, or on adopting a charter, the vote by a majority of those actually voting shall control the election, provided that the total vote cast shall not be less than 30% of those entitled to vote. Second, the time for elections as to whether the Act shall apply is extended for a year\u2014until June 18, 1936. There are desirable amendments in view of the confusion that has resulted from the stipulation of the Wheeler-Howard Act that in order to exclude themselves from its provisions a majority of the tribe must vote against it, and the ruling that those not voting were counted as being in favor of it.\n\nAn Oklahoma Plum\n\nA Joint Resolution (S. 109 and H. J. 264) has been introduced in Congress which aims to remove from the classified service the position of Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma and make it a presidential appointment, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The Resolution provided \"that such Superintendent shall be an Indian by blood, an enrolled member of one of the Five Civilized Tribes...\"\n\nThere is no justification for adoption of this Joint Resolution except that it would put one more \"plum\" at the disposal of the Oklahoma politicians. If it is desired to appoint an Indian to the position, providing he had the qualifications though not a civil service status, he could be selected through a presidential exception.\n\nWhen it is considered that the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes Agency has the supervision of trust funds approximating 18 million dollars and restricted Indian property worth upwards of 80 million dollars, it is clear why it should not be subject to the blighting hand of political influence.\n\nW-H Appropriations\n\nThe Interior Department Appropriation bill for the year beginning July 1, 1935, as passed by the House and Senate and reported out of Conference, contains the following items for carrying the Wheeler-Howard Act: Credit fund, $2,500,000 (although the W-H Act authorized $10,000,000); Land Purchases, $4,000,000 (one-half of the sum authorized); Student Educational loans, $175,000 ($75,000 less than the amount authorized), and for Tribal Organization, $150,000 (as against the $250,000 authorized). The Wheeler-Howard Act authorized appropriations of $12,500,000, and the present Congress is appropriating less than one-third of that amount. It looks like short-sightedness to build a good machine and expect it to run without fuel.\n\nMontreal Conference\n\nAt the National Conference of Social Work, to be held at Montreal June 9-15, the Committee on the American Indian will hold two sessions: June 10th and June 11th, 11 A.M. to 12.30 P.M.\n\nThe topic for the first session (June 10) is \"Governmental Policy in Indian Affairs.\" Commissioner Collier is expected to speak on \"The Present Policy.\" A speaker (to be announced later) will discuss \"The Relation of the Government to Indian Needs.\"\n\nOn June 11 the main topic will be \"The Indian Community.\" The speakers on the program are: Samuel Gerson, Director of Social Service, Montana Relief Commission, and Mark L. Burns, Superintendent of the Consolidated Chippewa Indian Agency, Cass Lake, Minn. Lawrence E. Lindley, Washington Representative of the I.R.A., is Chairman of the Committee and is expected to preside at both sessions.\n\nPhiladelphia Indians\n\nThe Society of Neighborhood Indians of Philadelphia, with a membership of about 250, will hold an annual Carlisle-Haskell night on Friday, May 17, at 1234 Locust Street. \"Old grads\" from different parts of the East are expected to attend this event.\nIndian Rights Association,\n(Incorporated)\n\nWASHINGTON OFFICE\nSAMUEL M. BEGGSUS\nRepresentative Emeritus\nLawrence Lindley\n744 JACKSON PLACE, N.W.\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nJune 3, 1925.\n\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont., Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I call to your attention the sessions of the Committee on the American Indian to be held in connection with the National Conference of Social Work, June 9-15 at Montreal? These meetings will occur on June 10-11 from 11 A.M. to 12:30 P.M.\n\nEnclosed is a marked copy of Indian Truth which gives the programs for these sessions, with the exception of the second address on June 10th, which is to be made by Paul W. Gordon, Director of Education for the Natives of Alaska, Office of Indian Affairs, Washington. Urgent demand that he be in the Navajo Country makes it impossible for Commissioner Collier to attend the Conference.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nLawrence E. Lindley, Esq.,\nChairman,\nCommittee on the American Indian,\n744 Jackson Place, N. W.,\nWashington, D. C.,\nU. S. A.\nEDUCATION.\n\nDuring the year 79 residential schools, 362 day schools and 10 combined Indian and white schools were in operation\u2014a total of 352 centres of Indian educational activity. The total enrolment was 17,560 and the average attendance, 13,442\u2014a percentage of attendance of 76.54. The enrolment for the year is the largest and the attendance the highest yet reached. In Part II of this report will be found a tabular statement showing the location and indicating the attendance at all Indian schools. The same number of residential schools were in operation last year and the results have been very encouraging.\n\nEfforts were continued, during the year, to secure efficiency in both the residential and day schools. Many fully qualified teachers and instructors are engaged and equipment is maintained to standard. All residential schools had an enrolment of pupils to full capacity. The Indian parents more and more realise the benefits of education and are anxious to place their children in the residential schools.\n\nThe cooperation of the Churches in the management of the residential schools was as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Number of Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 44                            |\n| Church of England       | 20                            |\n| United Church           | 13                            |\n| Presbyterian Church     | 2                             |\n| **Total**               | **79**                        |\n\nSix new day schools were established, where there was promise of real usefulness. On many of the reserves, the Indian day schools secure as good an attendance and results as rural white schools.\n\nProvincial curricula for public and separate schools are followed and fully qualified teachers are engaged. In addition to the regular academic work at all Indian schools, there is the very important vocational training at the residential schools.\n\nUnder arrangement with the Provincial Departments of Education, the services of regular public and separate school inspectors are utilized, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian School Inspectors. In addition, there is medical inspection and department officers give constant supervision.\n\nContinuation and high school work is taught at several of the day and residential schools. The more advanced\nadvanced pupils in these residential schools that are situated close to municipal colleges are benefited by secondary training in competition with white children. There were approximately 200 Indian students, not shown in the tabular statements, attending public schools, high schools and colleges in Canada. The Department assists them with a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nThe practice of assisting the most promising and industrious graduates of Indian schools was continued. Except in those Indian communities where successful farming is found, the school graduate presents a problem which is very difficult of solution. The Department and the Churches interested are continually trying and searching for better methods of helping the young people to establish themselves.\n\nNew main buildings were commenced during the year at two residential schools - Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. (Shingwauk Residential School); and Lebret, Sask. (Qu'Appelle Residential School). An addition is being erected to the residential school at Morley, Alberta, to provide increased accommodation. All school buildings and equipment were kept in repair as far as funds permitted.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education for the year shows an increase of $35,680.97 as compared with the previous year. The expenditure for Indian Education from Parliamentary Appropriation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1935, amounted to $1,660,830.62, as follows:-\nSpanish, Ont., 1-1-1\nAugust 6, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are preparing some essays for public speaking for the school Fair in September.\n\nThe topic chosen was \"Indian Education in Canada\" and we were informed that pamphlets on the subject could be procured from your department.\n\nI should be grateful for any such literature as you could send me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJulia Goodly\nOttawa, August 10, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, requesting that pamphlets, or other information regarding Indian education in Canada be sent you, for use of the pupils in preparing essays for public speaking at the School Fair in September, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no published literature regarding Indian education other than that printed in the annual report. I am sending you, under separate cover, copies of the Annual Reports of the Department for the years 1931 - 34. I have turned down the pages referring to Indian education and the statements showing the Indian schools in operation in Canada. I hope that, from these reports, you will be able to obtain the information required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Julia Goody,\nGirls' Indian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nSt. Ann's Academy,\nNew Westminster, B.C.,\nAugust 2nd, 1935.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWould you have any Literature, Pamphlets etc., issued by the Department giving information regarding the work carried on in the Industrial school for Indians pupils. I am writing an Examination thesis, and I have chosen for my topic \"Governmental Residential Indian Schools\"----I have been teaching in these schools for some time, at Kamloops and Mission City, so I know something about the work done in these Schools; but if I could get some other information I would be very grateful, especially the regulations laid down by the department regarding the proficiency of the work demanded by the up-to-date system of School, Domestic and Manual training.\n\nThanking you for an assistance you will be able to give me,\n\nI am,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nSister Mary Anne Alder,\nSister of St. Ann.\nOttawa, August 12, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting information regarding Indian residential schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the Department has no published literature for distribution, other than the annual report of the Department. I am sending you a copy, under separate cover.\n\nAll Indian residential schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with the Department in the carrying out of its educational policy. The larger number of the residential schools are government-owned institutions, but there are also a number church-owned.\n\nThe Department provides a per capita grant for a stated number of pupils at each school. From this grant, the authorities in charge of the school are to provide the cost of food, clothing, salaries of staff and all incidental expenses, and the Department is responsible for the upkeep of buildings and major items of equipment.\n\nThe church-owned school buildings and equipment are, to a large extent, maintained by the church authorities. However, if funds are available, the Department may assist towards the cost of repairs and equipment. The church authorities engage the services of all members of the staff, but their appointment is subject to the approval of the Department. It is necessary that they are fully qualified for the positions to which they are appointed.\n\nThe work in the classrooms is inspected by the provincial school inspectors, except in the province of British Columbia, where we utilize the services of our own inspectors. Besides, the schools are frequently visited by the local Indian agents and departmental inspectors.\n\nI am sending you, also, a copy of the Indian Act, and would refer you to Sections 9, 10 and 11. This comprises the law regarding the establishment of schools and the carrying out of the educational policy of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alide,\nSt. Ann's Academy,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nThe Comptroller of the Treasury has requested certain statistics concerning the various services relating to this Department.\n\nWe are compiling a statement for his information, and, to make this complete, we would request you to be good enough to supply us with information for each of the fiscal years 1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35, for the following -\n\n1. Average attendance of pupils for Residential Schools.\n2. Average attendance of pupils for Day Schools.\n3.

I would also like to get the name and address of the principals of these schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature]\n\nCayton Park,\nAug. 20, 1935.\nOttawa, August 27, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant, I am forwarding you, under separate cover, a copy of the last Annual Report of the Department. If you will refer to pages 74, 75 and 76, you will find a list of the Indian Residential Schools in Canada, with the name of the Principal and the post office address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The pages indicated give useful facts.\n\nI especially appreciate their historic sketch of Indian Education, which I am sure will complete the information we already have.\n\nThanking you for the trouble you took,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJulia Gooday\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Sutherland,\nSchools Branch.\n\n(Incl.)\n\nI am inclosing herewith for your information a copy of a statement we have prepared showing the expenditure for Indian Education for the fiscal years 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35, divided between Residential Schools, Day Schools and Technical Education.\n\nThe expenditure for medical attendance and hospitalization of school children has not been included in the figures for any of the three years, but any expenditure charged to B.C. Special on account of Technical Education has been added to that met from Allotment 2.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\n\nNCA:LLS\nAugust 21, 1936.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nDay Schools were established on the reserves on the Berens River as follows:\n\nBerens River United Church: This school was first started as a Methodist missionary cause and was conducted as a seasonal school only until 1884. From that time, it has been conducted as a full-time school.\n\nBerens River Roman Catholic: First established Sept. 1, 1918.\n\nGrand Rapids Church of England: First established Sept. 1, 1886.\n\nLittle Grand Rapids United Church: Started as a missionary cause and conducted as a summer school only, from June first, 1884, to September 1, 1886, from which latter date it has been conducted as a full-time school.\n\nLittle Grand Rapids Roman Catholic: Established Sept. 1, 1887.\n\nPehamekum United Church: First started as a missionary cause June first, 1886, and conducted intermittently from June first, 1886, to September first, 1888, from which latter date it has been conducted as a full-time school.\nAttention Mr. Hetherington,\n\nSecretariat Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nStanford, Man.,\nSept. 10th, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther in connection with information\nin my thesis on education in Northern\nManitoba - both Indian and Public schools -\nI again come to you for assistance.\n\n1. I need a copy of one of the\nIndian treaties (third or fourth) house\nor the law. Could you send me one?\n\n2. Could you tell me when each of the following\nschools began operating and when each was\nrecognized by the Dept. of Indian Affairs for\ngrant purposes:\n\nDay schools: Grand Rapids; Red River; Cross Lake;\nGrossette; God's Lake; Island Lake;\nIsland Lake No. 2; Red River No. 2; St. Boniface;\nConnaught; York Factory; Big Cedar;\nChimakarison; Nelson House No. 3;\nNelson House No. 4; Pas; Split Lake;\nChurchill - and any others since last report.\nCombined schools: Jack River S.S., Moose Lake S.S.\n\nResidential schools: Grass Lake R.C., Norway House R.C., McKay Lake R.C. (not shown)\n\n3. Cumberland in Saskatchewan would have had a mission school set long before the time and no doubt would spread its influence farther in this along the Saskatchewan River.\n\n(There was a Cumberland mission school at this point, recognized by the District School Committee. Similarly, they would attract pupils from Manitoba just over the border.)\n\n4. Pine Bluff, Red Earth, and Short Lake, all in Saskatchewan near the border of Manitoba may have had some influence, if they attracted the Indians from Manitoba. Didn't you know that from your records?\nThere is a shift of attitude in the Indian education\u2014now we have the idea of giving the Indians children a little high education and more along the lines which they want me to take\u2014teaching, reading, writing. I know some Indian Day School teachers feel that way about it. Some of the Department of Indian Affairs feel that such a shift is necessary or do they feel that teaching the Programme of Studies (of each province) is the proper thing.\n\nThanking you for the assistance in this and for this further information.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn conclusion, Superintendent of Missions, provide a duplicate copy of the data in Question #2. We took over the work of Dr. Benson lately and could not supply me with such information along that line.\nINDIAN DAY AND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS IN NORTHERN MANITOBA\nAND DATES THEY WERE STARTED.\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS:\n\nCross Lake - Opened September 1, 1914.\nDestroyed by fire, February 25, 1930.\n\nAs stated in my letter of March 20,\nlast, since the destruction of the building by\nfire, the Roman Catholic Church authorities\nconduct a residential school at Cross Lake and\nalso at Jack River. There are about 15 children\nin residence at each point and these two schools\nare known under the name of the Cross Lake\nResidential School.\n\nNorway House - First opened as a residential school\nDecember 13, 1899.\n\nKeeley (The Pas) - Opened October 1, 1914 -\nDestroyed by fire March 19, 1933 -\nHas not been re-established.\n\nG.R.Y. - First opened July 1, 1926.\nINDIAN DAY AND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS IN NORTHERN MANITOBA\nAND DATES THEY WERE STARTED.\n\nDAY SCHOOLS:\n\nGrand Rapids - September, 1885.\nPoplar River - Some time in 1894.\nCross Lake R.C. - November 1, 1903.\nCross Lake U.C. - July 1, 1893.\nGoda Lake - November 1, 1911.\nIsland Lake R.C. - September 1, 1928.\nIsland Lake U.C. - November 3, 1902.\nOxford House - September 1, 1907.\nRossville - July 1, 1883.\n\nThis school appears, from our records, to have been\nin operation as a church activity since 1878. The former\nMethodist Church authorities conducted a day school at this\npoint and at Norway House for some years previous to the\nDepartment providing any grant to assist them.\n\nYork Factory - April, 1904.\n\nA school activity was conducted at this point by\nthe Anglican Church authorities for some time previous to the\nabove date, from which the Department provided assistance.\n\nBig Eddy - Opened some time in 1884.\nChenaheawin - Some time in 1884.\nNelson House U.C. - June 1, 1901.\nNelson House R.C. - October 1, 1925.\nLee - During year 1880.\n\nSplit Lake - Opened June 1, 1909, and conducted as summer\nschool only until April 1, 1921 - continuously in operation\nsince that time.\n\nChurchill - Summer school only. The Department provided\nfirst assistance from June 22, 1934.\n\nJack River R.C. - September 1, 1926.\nJack River C.E. - December, 1904.\n\nMoose Lake - This school conducted as a Church of England\nschool from September 1, 1887, and, as a combined white and\nIndian school, from September 1, 1916.\n\nCumberland - Started some time in year 1882.\n\nFife Bluff - September first, 1922.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, requesting further information regarding the schools in northern Manitoba.\n\nReplying to the second enquiry in your letter, I attach a list, in duplicate, giving the dates on which the various day school activities, as mentioned in your letter, were started and recognized by the Department of Indian Affairs. Our early records are somewhat incomplete. In nearly all cases, these schools were started as missionary enterprises; the church authorities interested, after the schools were conducted more or less intermittently, requested the Department to contribute a grant towards salaries and other expenses. Therefore, it is impossible, in some cases, to give the exact date on which the schools started.\n\nThe earliest records we have of the Cumberland School are that it began operation some time in the year 1832 and has been carried on since that time.\n\nThe Guy Indian Residential School, at Sturgeon Landing, Sask., was opened on July first, 1926. At this school, there are, no doubt, a few of the pupils from reserves in Manitoba.\n\nIn reply to your fourth question, I may say that the day schools at Pine Bluff, Red Earth and Shoal Lake are for the Indian children of these reserves. It is doubtful if any of the children of the Bands in Manitoba attend, unless in the case of the children of a wandering Indian family. The Indians are continually travelling backwards and forwards between the different reserves.\n\nRegarding your fifth enquiry, I may say the Department desires that boys in attendance at residential schools\n\nJohn E. Lysecki, Esq., B.A.,\nSanford,\nMan.\nin northern Canada be given the opportunity to learn hunting and trapping, as this will, no doubt, be the main source of their livelihood after they leave school. We permit the boys at these schools, when they arrive at the proper age - say, 12 years - to accompany their parents for a few weeks during the hunting season. In so far as the day schools are concerned, the boys reside at home and, no doubt, have every opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of hunting and trapping. At some of our day schools, the holiday season is arranged to coincide with the hunting and trapping season.\n\nRelative to your request to be furnished with a copy of one of the Indian Treaties, I regret the Department has no copies available for distribution. Four volumes of Treaties and Surrenders have been issued, and you could, no doubt, consult this work in a public library, in Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nThe Little Red Schoolhouse\n196 Bleecker St.\nNew York City\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nCould you please advise me as to where I could obtain the names of all the Indianschools in Canada with the names of their directors? I wish to have the children in my class in school begin correspondence with Indian children all over North America as an aid to understanding present as well as past Indian life, and the geographical positions of the various tribes.\n\nI am also writing for the same information from the United States government in Washington.\n\nThanking you sincerely,\n\nDorothy Stall\n\nP.S. The children who will write the letters are eight and nine years old.\n| School Name                  | Location          |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Shubenacadie Residential    | Shubenacadie, N.S.|\n| Burnt Church Day            | Burnt Church, N.B.|\n| Kingsclear Day              | R. #6, Fredericton, N.B.|\n| Caughnawaga R.C.

MCGILL.\n\nI note from your memorandum of the 14th instant that one of the representatives of the church missionary societies recently stated to the Honourable the Superintendent General that, when a child in a residential school is ill and unable to attend classes, payment of per capita grant is not allowed during the time missed from classes.\n\nNo such instructions have ever been issued by the Department.\n\nAs long as a pupil is in residence, with the Department's permission, grant is allowed even though such pupil is unable to attend classes owing to illness or other reason.\n\nWhen a pupil is absent from a residential school for more than two or three days, either through illness or from some other cause, no per capita grant is allowed for the period of absence. I think you will agree that this is fair treatment, due to the following reasons:\n\n(1) In the majority of cases of absence through illness the pupil is sent from the residential school to hospital, where the maintenance costs are paid by the Department.\n\n(2) In the case of truancy or neglect of children to return promptly upon the expiry of their leave, the school is not required to maintain them, and, therefore, is not entitled to per capita grant for the period of their absence.\nSir,\n\nWould you kindly send me a list of the different Indian schools in the West, and also the means used for securing help in the schools.\n\nWould be very glad to receive any information or literature relative to Indian schools as to the support they receive either from the government or the church, with which they are connected.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Miss) M.

You will find information regarding schools by reference to pages 12, 13, and 66-78. As nearly all Indian schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with this Department in the carrying out of its educational policy, we look to the church authorities for the nomination of teachers.

If you will refer to the Treaties of Canada with the Indians of Manitoba and the North West Territories by Honourable Alexander Morris, P.C., on pages 143 and following, you will find a full account of the steps taken in obtaining the Treaty, and, also, on pages 342 to 350, a copy of the Treaty and the signatures thereto. It is thought that you can see a copy of Morris' Treaties in a good library. I regret being unable to send you a copy, as I have only one in my office for reference and the supply is exhausted. This has now become a rather valuable publication and is out of print. It would require the services of a typist for a considerable time to make a copy of the Treaty referred to.\n\nI note that you have completed your thesis and hope that you will receive your Master of Education degree. I understand that, in submitting your thesis, it will be necessary to have same printed. Should you have a copy available, I would be very glad to obtain one and would return same, if so requested.\n\nShould you be unable to obtain a copy of Morris' Treaties in a library in Winnipeg, I could forward my copy for your use, but, on the distinct understanding that you would return same to me when it has served your purpose.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

McGUIRE:\n\nThe attached letter (Feb 16) from John W. Tietz, DeWitt Clinton High School, New York City, re the health, educational and vocational training of Indians in Canada -\n\nis referred to the Department for attention.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, March 2, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, addressed to the former Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, requesting information regarding the work of educational type which is carried on among the Indians of Canada.\n\nSome 17,560 Indian children are enrolled in the 350 day and residential schools. These schools are not under the control of the Departments of Education in the different provinces but are financed and managed jointly by the Department of Indian Affairs and the various churches engaged in the work. In each province, the Indian schools are inspected regularly by qualified school inspectors, and the work done by Indian pupils compares favourably with that of the white schools in the same localities. In the day schools, in addition to the regular curriculum, emphasis is placed on handiwork, gardening, hygiene and group games. The residential schools give still further teaching in the manual arts that will assist the pupil in later life. The boys are trained in farming, gardening and the care of stock; and the girls are systematically taught all household duties.\n\nParliament annually provides appropriations - amounting during the present fiscal year to two million dollars - from which the expenditures for the maintenance of the various schools are made. The churches which are cooperating provide further funds to finance them.\n\nSpecial training or assistance is offered to the promising graduates of the day and residential schools. Approximately 300 young Indian men and women are attending high schools and colleges in Canada. Financial assistance and careful supervision for these special pupils are arranged for by the Department. Other energetic graduates are given grants for stock, implements, household equipment or building material.\n\nIn the residential schools - 79 in number - the staffs are nominated by the church authorities, and the activity is supervised by them and by the Department. The pupils in primary grades devote both morning and afternoon to classroom exercises, but the school day is divided for older pupils between academic instruction and vocational training.\n\nThe schools which the Department supervises and\n\nJohn W. Tietz, Esq.,\nDewitt Clinton High School,\nMoshulu Parkway and Paul Avenue,\nNew York, N. Y.,\nU. S. A.\nthe number of children in each kind of school are as follows:\n\n| Enrolment       |\n|-----------------|\n| 262 day schools | 8,638 |\n| 79 residential schools | 8,709 |\n| 10 combined schools | 213   |\n| Total           | 17,560 |\n\nThe names \"Day\" and \"Residential\" sufficiently differentiate these two classes of schools. A combined school is one which both Indian and white children attend and is found in districts too sparsely settled to support two schools. The Department, in such cases, cooperates with the local School Board in the upkeep of the school. The course of studies in Indian schools is that prescribed by the Provincial Departments of Education in the Province in which the school is located.\n\nI regret that this Department has no published reports for distribution, other than the annual report, a copy of which is being sent you, under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nA.F.

Such declaration must be made in the presence of, and certified by, the Indian agent or other justice of the peace, as having been understood by the Indian parent and as embodying his wishes.\nOttawa, February 27, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 23rd instant, enclosing a copy of the Indian and Eskimo Commission's recommendation, in connection with the difficulties arising out of different religious beliefs when recruiting pupils for Indian residential schools.\n\nI have noted the remarks of the Commission, and will be grateful for further enlightenment concerning two of their recommendations. Article No. 3 suggests that no Protestant child of one denomination be admitted to a school under the management of another Protestant denomination, without the consent of the authorities of the church to which the child belongs. In this connection, I wish to point out that in the past there has been practically no trouble between various Protestant denominations, and such a ruling, if put into effect by the Department of Indian Affairs, would cause considerable correspondence and give opportunity for endless trouble. As you know, the present effort is for the express purpose of minimizing difficulties, and I must confess that I am convinced that recommendation No. 3 of your Commission would lead to dissension among the interested Protestant institutions.\n\nAgain, I will be grateful for enlightenment concerning recommendation No. 8, which reads: \"That the Department of Indian Affairs should be ready to consider applications in special cases where parents brought up in one faith desire their children to be brought up in another.\" Is it your wish that Roman Catholic parents be permitted, upon the signing of an affidavit, to place their children in a Protestant school? This has been the most irritating sore and might lead to wholesale proselytism. In addition, considerable trouble ensues in later years, when parents make the wonderful discovery that their children are being brought up in the wrong religious faith. I believe that, if parents brought up in one faith desire their children to be educated in another, they will themselves have undergone a bona fide change in belief. When the Department has reason to believe that such change on the part of the parents is in good faith and not for the express purpose of circumventing the Indian Act, children will be admitted to institutions conducted by the church with which the parents have become associated.\n\n- I am looking -\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nI am looking forward to an arrangement that is satisfactory to all the churches, and would be grateful for an answering communication as soon as you have got in touch with those interested in the Indian work under the Church of England auspices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nUNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA\n\nOttawa, February 15th, 1922.\n\nMr Duncan C Scott,\nDep. Supt Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of December 24th, in reference to difficulties arising in connection with religious belief when recruiting pupils for Indian Residential schools.\n\nI wish to congratulate the Department for its attempt to solve a rather difficult question. However I must state that the Roman Catholic authorities cannot admit entirely the tentative decisions reached by the Department and I take the liberty of respectfully setting forth objections as also of suggesting a solution in some cases.\n\nParagraph 2 of your letter quotes a part of Section 10 of the Indian Act, as follows: \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\" The words have been underlined by the undersigned with the object of showing that the conclusion of the Department, viz: \"In the future, children from Protestant and Catholic homes will be considered eligible for admission, respectively, to Protestant and Roman Catholic schools only\" does not conform to the word and spirit of the law as set forth in this Section 10 of the Indian Act, in which it is question of a Protestant child or a Catholic child and not the child from a Protestant or Catholic home.\n\nTherefore do not see how the Department can alter this regulation. The Department can enforce law but has no authority to change it. Moreover, such a course would simply paralyze or discourage missionary efforts. And I wish to mention that I speak as much from a Protestant standpoint as from a Catholic one. The case has happened when Protestant parents have brought their children to a Catholic school stating clearly their intention of having said children baptized in the Catholic Faith (if they were not already) and educated in a Catholic school. A Catholic priest would act against his conscience and would not perform his duty and I dare say, would be in contradiction with himself in refusing such cases. Of course, prudence and respect for the Department's just regulations would dictate to him a procedure to safeguard his action and avoid possible trouble. Another instance is found in the case of children born of mixed marriages. Any Protestant wishing to be married to a Catholic party before the Catholic Church must sign a witnessed promise to give religious liberty to the catholic party and to have all children born of said marriage baptized and educated in the Catholic Religion. One will readily realize the difficulties arising in such cases from the ruling of the Department, specially when the father is a Protestant. Even in spite of the father's desires and solemn promises, and of the child's baptism the only school open to the latter would be the Protestant school. Under such circumstances the Department would go beyond its jurisdiction and its ruling would prove a manifest interference in the intimate rights and liberty of parents.\nIn Paragraph 3 the following principle of elementary natural law is set forth: \"except under special circumstances, the father during his life, has a right to choose in what religion the children are to be brought up, even when the children are illegitimate.\" In my opinion the bringing in of this principle weakens the Department's reasons for the ruling given in Paragraph 2 and seems a contradiction, for, if the father's choice is admitted by the Department when the parents disagree why should not same choice be admitted and with far greater evidence when father and mother agree? A few words could be said relative to illegitimate children but this is not the proper place.\n\nI have read over the Indian Act and copies of Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools and nowhere have I found that the Department was vested with the authority for dictating about the religion of an Indian, adult or child. Therefore the Department's ruling in the present instance could be considered ultra vires. The only concession possible would be in the case of difficulties arising from the choice, on the part of Protestant parents of a Catholic school for their children, or vice versa. Then the religion of the child (Section 10) is to be inquired into; that is the primary condition. In dubious cases the Department could be asked to give a decision. However, to safeguard all parties (the Department included) a declaration sworn to before a Magistrate and two witnesses could be made by the father or guardian declaring:\n\n1. The religion of his child or his consent to the christening of the latter in another religion;\n2. His free choice of the school conducted under the auspices of the child's religion.\n\nThis procedure has been practically followed by the Department in the past and I am pleased to state that difficulties have been rapidly smoothed by following such a course.\n\nThe Department can consider the above remarks as representing the Catholic view in the matter, and I have to substantiate and confirm my conclusions the approbation, under their own signature of the Rt Rev. Bishops, the Very Rev. Provincials and the Rev. Principals and Missionaries to whom I have forwarded a copy of the present letter. Such unanimity and precision of opinion from men attending to the spiritual care of the absolute majority of the Indians of Canada and identified with educational work in their behalf should carry a certain weight in the regulations of the Department on a subject of the importance of the one proposed.\n\nThanking you for asking our advice on the intended interpretation of the Indian Act and hoping that the Department will find agreeable to give its decision in the light of the principles referred to and deductions therefrom, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJoseph Guy\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nP 3 days \u2014 weaken our case.

This figure includes 2 institutions (Edmonton and Elkhorn) at which there are, at present, no Indian children. 43 of these residential schools are owned by the Church and 32 by the State.\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\nThere are 40 residential schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. 27 of these institutions are owned by the Church authorities. The Oblate Order owns 22 of these Roman Catholic church-owned boarding schools.\n\nAlbany Mission, Ont. (5)\nKenora, Ont. (1)\nPine Creek, Man. (1)\nCowessess, Sask. (1)\nMuscowequan, Sask.

(4)\nSt. Mary's Mission, B.C. (3)\nCariboo, B.C. (3)\n\nThe schools marked (1) are modern, up to date buildings, in good condition and are adequate for the purpose of Indian education. The Provincial of the Oblate Order in Winnipeg (Father Keys) has urgently requested that these 4 properties be purchased. In the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23 there is an item of $48,000 to provide for the purchase of the Kenora Boarding School, after an adjusting\n\n- of the valuation -\nof the valuation. If this amount is voted, the principle involved, i.e., the gradual acquirement of all residential school buildings owned by the churches, will be acknowledged; and from time to time, as Parliament provides funds, the other 3 institutions marked (1) and the 2 schools in British Columbia marked (3) could be purchased. These 2 institutions in British Columbia and a third one, the Squamish Boarding School, owned by the Sisters of the Holy Infant (R.C.), have been offered to the Government at a valuation (not stated) by the Church authorities in the western province. Beauval Boarding School, Sask., marked (2), has been named by the Oblates as the last school the purchase of which is desired.\n\nI wish to refer to the possibility of future requests on the part of the Roman Catholic Church that the State purchase the other church-owned residential schools. Those marked (4) are north of the main lines of communication and could be considered largely missionary activities for some years. The institutions marked (5) are either in poor condition or are not modern and would likely be turned over to the State from time to time, at practically no cost. As you are aware, it has hitherto been the policy of the Department to substitute modern, up-to-date buildings in place of the original residential schools erected with church funds which, owing to lapse of time and the development of the work, become dilapidated and inadequate. At the time of the transfer, the monetary consideration is generally nil.\n\n5 Roman Catholic church-owned institutions have not been listed above. This Department would never purchase the Fort William Orphanage, Ont., or the St. Albert Boarding School, Alta., as these are primarily convents for the education of white children. The Squamish Boarding School, B.C. should not be considered, as the property is entirely inadequate for Indian residential school purposes. The Christie Industrial School, B.C. is modern, and the possibility of taking it over, at a valuation, must be considered. The last named institution is owned by the Basilian Order. The Spanish Industrial School, Ont., a large, modern institution belonging to the Jesuit Order, is worth about $150,000, and I believe, may be offered to the State.\n\nChurch of England.\n\nThere are 21 residential schools under the auspices of the Church of England. 10 of these are not owned by the State. When the time comes to take over these institutions, the monetary consideration will be nil, because of the poor condition of the buildings or their situation.\n\nMethodist.\n\n7 residential schools are under the Methodist Church. 2 of these are church-owned, and would likely be offered to the Department, gratis, when we are able to re-build.\n\nPresbyterian.\n\n7 Indian residential schools are under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. 4 of these are church-owned. 3 are modern and well designed for the purposes of Indian education, and we will be asked to purchase these in the future. One is dilapidated, and we would pay nothing to the Church when we decided to re-build.\nRECAPITULATION.\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\nOblate Order\n\n1. Lenora $48,000.\n2. Pine Creek $33,000.\n3.

There are certain regulations governing the expenditure of public funds, and it will assist our officers if principals of Indian schools and church officials will remember the following instructions.\n\nThe Department's authority must be obtained for expenditures that are to be met other than from the school per capita grant. Requests should be forwarded through the office of the local Indian agent, so that his recommendation can be attached. It is quite in order for the principal to secure the assistance of the church authorities in the case of major expenditures, but the original request should come through the Department's officials in the field.\n\nThe requirements of the purchasing Commission must be kept in mind. If authority to purchase locally is granted, the principal or agent should secure competitive prices for all material over $15. If manufactured articles are desired, this Department will ask the purchasing Commission for the business houses that should be asked to quote. The principal, when requesting equipment, should intimate the type desired by referring to a price list or catalogue of some Canadian firm. The Purchasing Commission emphasizes the importance of buying, as far as possible, goods that are manufactured in Canada.\n\nWhen the business has been awarded to a firm the bill should not be paid by the principal, unless it is his intention to finance the purchase out of per capita earnings. The account, in duplicate, should be given by the principal, not to a church representative, but to the Indian agent, or direct to the Department in the case of some residential schools not in Indian agencies. Our agent will certify the accounts if they are in order, and this Department will send a cheque to the firm that has supplied the equipment. When authority has been granted to purchase locally, a memo must be attached showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted, and whether the goods selected were manufactured in Canada or otherwise.\n\nYour attention to the above requirements will assist this Department in its effort to administer the Vote for Indian Education in a satisfactory manner.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nTo Principals, Indian Agents,\nChurch and Department Officials.\n\n160 copies.\nOctober 5, 1922.\n\nI have to inform you that there has been an amendment of the definition of the words \"Protestant child\" and \"Roman Catholic child\" as they appear in Subsection 1 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. It is my request that you substitute the present communication for that of June 5th, last, and govern yourself accordingly.\n\nThe concluding part of Subsection 1 of Section 10 of the Indian Act, as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, Chap. 50, Section 1, provides as follows:\n\n\"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nThe opinion of the Department of Justice is that a Protestant child is one born of Protestant parents, or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices. A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. In other words, the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child should be brought up, and his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\nIn accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so; but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of the peace, Indian agent or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department.\n\nAs intimated in my earlier communications, I do not wish this ruling to be the occasion of requests that children be transferred from one school to another on the grounds of the present decision. I believe that a child, that has been resident in a school and may have imbibed religious opinions, should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 10, 1928.\n\nTo the Indian Agent:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has fortunately secured copies of the Department of Health's recent publication \"The Canadian Mother's Book\". This pamphlet has been prepared for the purpose of giving valuable information to young mothers. Your sympathy and cooperation is requested in connection with the distribution.\n\nThe Department is aware that each agency presents a special problem and will rely upon you to adopt any method that you see fit in an effort to place a copy of \"The Canadian Mother's Book\" in the hands of each young married couple that are capable of reading English. The assistance of field matrons, truant officers, day school teachers and missionaries who may be at work on the reserves might be sought in this connection.\n\nCopies of the pamphlet are being sent to you under separate cover. If more are needed for your agency, a communication to the Department will meet ready response until the supply available for us is exhausted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOTTAWA, May 17, 1932.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Teachers of Indian Schools:\n\nI have to inform you that arrangements have been completed with the Department of Education for your Province for the inspection of Indian schools by the staff of public school inspectors. This action has been taken with a view to standardizing the instruction offered and making it as bright and attractive as possible. Although the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, yet teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the course of studies prescribed by the Provincial Department should be used by each Indian school. Every assistance should be given to the public school inspectors in the discharge of their duties. This inspection by professionally qualified educationists is being done at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Terrier,\nSupv. of Indian Education.\nI have to inform you that there has been an amendment of the definition of the words \"Protestant child\" and \"Roman Catholic child\" as they appear in subsection 1 of Section 10 of the Indian Act.

Residential facilities in Eastern Ontario and in Quebec are very limited, and lately this Department has made arrangements with several institutions conducted under Christian auspices for the care of some of the promising orphan or destitute Indian boys and girls.\n\nThe procedure adopted is to follow the recommendation of Indian agents, teachers and missionaries on the reserves. Representations are made to us from time to time concerning the ability of an Indian child who, for some reason or other, is unable to live at home and attend a departmental school on the reserve. Our representatives indicate the religion of the child and suggest a home or residential school where he or she can be provided for and educated. The Department makes a grant for this purpose to the institution chosen\u2014the funds being provided from the Parliamentary appropriation for Indian Education. The individual merits of each case determine the Department's decision.\n\nFurther, we have assisted promising Indian boys and girls who have been in attendance at departmental schools. Parents are sometimes willing to provide a certain amount for the tuition of a child, and this Department has made a special grant for those fitted to undertake more advanced studies. Before providing for the tuition of an Indian boy or girl, this Department must be satisfied that the pupil in question is of the proper type and that careful supervision will be offered. Again, we look to our representatives for recommendations concerning each particular case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. R.

The section also provides the means of compelling this attendance. While this is the law, the Department has never, by regulation, made the age limit at Indian residential schools uniform with the Act. Nearly all pupils at Boarding and Industrial Schools are voluntary, and this Department believes it to be in their best interests to continue their studies for a longer period than that prescribed by the Act. We expect principals and agents to advise Indian parents, and others interested, that the children should be allowed to remain in school until they have reached the age of 18 years.\n\nFurther, if a school principal advances sufficient reason why a pupil should remain on the roll of a residential school after he has passed the age of 18, this Department will always give favourable consideration to the question of continuing the grant.\n| Province | Name | Denomination | Pupilage (Mar.31/23) | F.C.Grant (Incl.

Church-owned schools are grouped under denominations and also show the pupilage and grant allowed. In explanation, I wish to state that the amount of per capita grant for boarding schools is determined on three bases: 1, ownership - government or church; 2, geographical situation - east, west and north; 3, type of building - well equipped and modern or otherwise. Two schools in the Yukon receive a higher grant than any others, because of the costs of food, clothing and other staple articles. Industrial schools each receive a per capita grant of $150, except in the province of Ontario, where they are classified in the same manner as boarding schools. In the industrial school class there are two exceptions to the general rule - the Mohawk Institute, in Ontario, and the Lytton Industrial School, in British Columbia, which are financed solely by this Department and without assistance from any missionary society or order. I am hopeful that these two institutions will be able to finance on per capita grants of $160 and $180, respectively, during the fiscal year 1923-24. The information contained in the attached list is for the fiscal year 1922-23.\n\nFrom time to time, it is necessary to increase the pupilage at those residential schools where applications are numerous and when accommodation can be provided. The pupilage figures in each case are those that obtained at the close of the fiscal year 1922-23. Occasionally, when a school is accommodating its full quota of pupils, and the Department finds it necessary to admit orphan or destitute children, we allow supernumerary grant for them, until such time as vacancies occur among the regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nRelative to the second paragraph of your letter, I have to state that the per capita grant is to enable the principal to meet current expenses; food, clothing and salaries are the major items in this connection. Equipment and equipment replacements, repairs to buildings, pupils' travelling expenses, medical and veterinary services and supplies, and postage are the chief expenses at residential schools.\n\nW. Kearns, Esq.,\nAssistant Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nschools that are met by parliamentary appropriation, independent of the per capita grant. When funds are available, this Department meets expenses of every kind, with the possible exception of those incurred for food and clothing. The religious organization under whose auspices a school is operated may give grants to the principal, for salaries, to meet deficits and for any other purpose it sees fit.\n\nThere are some government-owned schools where church missionary societies or orders make special grants amounting to thousands of dollars per annum, in an effort to permit the school to give the type of instruction and residential care upon which we insist, and to keep the institution in a solvent condition.\n\nEnc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 31, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI wish to draw to your attention that there are a number of church-owned Indian residential schools, where parliamentary appropriation has been used to make replacements and additions.\n\nGeneral repairs have been made at the Mohawk, Shingwauk, Peigan C. of E., Peigan R. C., Cariboo, Pine Creek, Round Lake and Carcross Indian Residential Schools.\n\nBuildings have been erected at the Cecilia Jeffrey, Cowessess, Onion Lake C. of E., Ahouseht, Lytton, St. Mary's and Albany Institutions.\n\nI should be pleased to learn if it is your wish that a lien against the church property be taken out in each case.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nESTIMATES \u2014 1921 - 22.\n\nTo provide a further amount for Indian Education...$100,000.00.\n\nThe above item represents a bonus at the rate of $20.00 per capita for the 5,000 pupils provided for in the Residential Indian Schools. This amount will increase the total estimate for Indian Education from $1,112,415.00 to $1,212,415.00.\n\nA joint deputation representing the various religious denominations waited upon the Superintendent General a few days ago, and urged that this amount be granted as a bonus for the current year only. They are satisfied with the present per capita rate, which was increased by $10.00 in 1916 and by a further $10.00 in 1919. They state that while they have been able to conduct the schools on the government grants plus increased levies from their own funds, they have been unable to make good any repairs, carry out any improvements in their buildings, or to meet any incidental deficits from their current resources. Financial statements submitted to the Department show that during recent years the Churches have contributed approximately 25% of the cost of maintenance of these schools. It will thus be seen that the partnership existing between the Government and the Churches relieves the former of a large expenditure which would have to be met if a State system of Indian Education prevailed, and at the same time the State would lose the moral and civilizing influence of the Churches in its ultimate design of advancing the Indians towards full citizenship. The Churches confidently assert that if this bonus be granted for one year, they will be enabled during the following year to conduct the schools without any call upon the Government for maintenance beyond the authorized per capita grant.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the financial assistance given to our schools from Parliamentary Appropriations and like grants made to similar institutions in the United States from Appropriations by Congress.\n\nIn the United States the responsibility for Indian Education was some time ago assumed by the State. Previous to 1918 the per capita grant allowed by the United States Government for residential schools was $137.00. In 1918 this was increased to $200.00 for schools with a pupilage of one hundred or over, and $225.00 for schools with a pupilage below one hundred. During the fiscal year 1919-20 the average grant to Residential schools in Canada was approximately $137.00. During the year 1919-20 the average appropriation made by the United States Government for the education of Indian children in residential and day schools was $211.73 per capita, while in Canada for the same year the per capita appropriation was $141.37.\n\nSuperintendent General.\nThe amount provided for grant to residential schools includes the sum of $100,000.00, which represents a bonus at the rate of $20.00 per capita for the 5,000 pupils provided for in the residential schools.\n\nA joint deputation representing the various religious denominations waited upon the Superintendent General and urged that this amount be granted as a bonus for the current year only.

I have noted your criticism of the efforts made in these institutions to turn out young men who have a knowledge of the care of stock and of farming methods, and that you believe many of the principals are not qualified themselves in these matters.\n\nI am aware that there is room for much improvement in the training the boys receive at residential schools, but it is only when you or one of our inspectors name the school, and, if possible, the member of the staff that is responsible, the Department can remedy conditions. If Parliament would vote twice the present appropriation for current expenses at Indian residential schools we could engage our own principals and staffs and supervise their activity. The present arrangement with the churches permits of the conduct of our institutions at a minimum of expense to the country, and, in addition, allows the youth of our wards to grow up in a Christian environment. And I must add that the missionary Societies and Orders have shown a pronounced willingness to co-operate with the Department in its effort to improve the instruction. If you or your officers can lay the blame for any inefficiency on the feet of a member or members of a school staff, the church authorities, at our request, will arrange for efficiency up to the limit of their resources.\n\nYou have referred to the academic instruction offered in our residential schools, and the need for drastic reform. I must draw your attention to the fact that we have lately engaged the services of public school instructors, and we have made arrangements in Manitoba and Saskatchewan for our teachers to attend local conferences and gatherings held by the officers of the Departments of Education. These are definite steps toward better teaching, and I look for decided improvement in this connection in the near future. The Superintendent of Indian Education assures me that every few days instructions are given to a principal or other church authority relative to changes on the various staffs. Your remark that \"the schools of late have had a free hand in regard to the matter of employing teachers and instructors\" is not in accordance with the facts. Our supervision has become, in the past year or two, more strict than ever before.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIf provincial school inspectors will report on inefficiency in the classroom, and the Department officers on those workers who are training our boys to be farmers, I am prepared to arrange with the proper church authorities for any necessary changes in personnel. We can continue these efforts until the missionary Societies protest that high salaried instructors are beyond their means; then, if such action is warranted because we are getting better results, the per capita grant may have to be increased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSee Dr. Westgate's\n'Duties a Staff'\nin\n23\nSee letter June 21/1923\n\non 164-7-1\n\nCaretaker\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Father Natelle:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner at Regina has reported that the boys of the Thunderchild's Indian Boarding School receive no training in farming. I am surprised at this criticism, for it is understood that school authorities in the Prairie Provinces will engage instructors qualified to give the male pupils training in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Such instruction is highly important for boys at Indian residential schools, and I should be pleased if you would inform me what training has been given in past years and concerning the remedial measures you can undertake in the immediate future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. Natelle, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild's Indian Edg. School,\nBelmas, Sask.\nDecember 7, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWe wish to recommend that authority be granted to add a certain quantity of bedding and towelling to the furnishings allowed new Indian residential schools. The allowing of this type of equipment has been in the past the exception rather than the rule; but it is considered that our recommendation is in harmony with the present policy of caring for the major portion of the expense of educating Indian children.\n\nDepartmental Architect.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nFebruary 21, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Kearns:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the closing of the Dunbow (St. Joseph's) Indian Residential School during the fiscal year 1922-23. I have noted that you consider the financial wind-up of this school was not in strict accordance with the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act. I cannot agree that the funds and movable assets of a government owned Indian residential school which is managed, and has been managed for years, by church authorities are public moneys and property. The Church Missionary Society or Order supplements the per capita grant from year to year. Further, when the school management has made a futile effort to secure parliamentary appropriation for improvement to plant and equipment, church moneys are often used for the purpose. In other words, at a government owned Indian residential school, church authorities from time to time supplement parliamentary appropriation for both capital and current expenses.\n\nI consider the bank account, crop, stock, food and clothing and all equipment belong to the State and the Church jointly. Inspector Murison, in the case of the Dunbow Indian Residential School, was directed to assist the church authorities in the closing so that our equity in movable assets would be safeguarded. Our officer was instructed to cooperate with the Rev. Principal and to see that all bills were paid. Any equipment of value to the other Indian residential schools managed by the same Order in the vicinity was distributed gratis. The remainder of the movable assets were sold and the school bills having been paid, the balance, $477.42, was deposited to Casual Revenue.\n\nWhen Mr. Murison was paying the outstanding accounts, he telegraphed for permission to pay the arrears of salary. It developed later that these amounted to $5549.37. The Provincial of the Oblate Order at an earlier date had requested a total cash consideration of $16,589.98 for their equity in the property. In view of these facts I considered it advisable, before paying the arrears of salaries, to have Mr. Murison's audit and report before me. I therefore directed that the funds concerning which you have raised questions be deposited in a special account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Kearns, Esq.,\nAssistant Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 11, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham gives rise to certain general questions relative to the laundry and its equipment at Indian residential schools. The activity in the laundry serves a dual purpose\u2014the washing for the institution is done and the older girls receive instruction.\n\nIn a modern institution of 100 pupils and staff, a sufficient number of labour-saving machines should be installed to permit the washing and sterilizing of the clothes to be done with enough dispatch to eliminate the irksomeness attendant upon too many days' labour per week. I believe that power machines for washing, extracting and drying are desirable in the larger institutions. The washer should be fitted with steam connections, so that the clothes may be sterilized. A small steam boiler also is therefore required. This equipment is used for the regular bi-weekly washing of bed clothing, under clothing, shirts, dresses, aprons, etc.\n\nThe officer in charge of the laundry regularly gives the girls instruction in the steps to be taken with an ordinary domestic washing. An assortment of articles to be washed is put through by hand for instructional purposes. Further, the girls will receive other experience as in an institution there are certain articles that can best be done by hand and frequently there is clothing to be boiled and washed at short notice. There is plenty of opportunity for instructing the laundry girls in ironing as this is all done by hand.\n\nFor the work that is being undertaken by hand the laundry should be equipped with a receptacle for boiling small quantities of clothes, flat irons, a box stove for heating them, stationary tubs and two or three hand wringers. Large wooden receptacles for soiled clothes and tables for ironing and sorting complete the equipment.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nNovember 22, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMiss Gorrell.\n\nThe names of the following Church Authorities should be placed on the mailing list for the Annual Report of this Department. Each should receive one copy of our report and one copy of the Auditor General's Report on Indian Affairs:\n\nRev. J. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRev. Canon S.

Boys, O.M.I.,\n222 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nJanuary 24, 1925.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe following is a sample letter relative to the supplying of Cotton and Wool Sheeting to new Indian residential schools. In this case the institution has 100 children's beds, including those of the infirmary. At the present writing, the business is being given to the firms mentioned in the letter:\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has placed an order with the Horn Brothers Woollen Co., Limited, of Lindsay, Ont., for 250 yards of their \"Lester\" wool sheeting, 72\" wide (32 oz. peryd.) and an order with the Dominion Textile Company, 10 Victoria Sq., Montreal, for 700 yards of their 8/4 S. 22 cotton sheeting, 72\" wide. This wool and cotton sheeting which is being supplied at prices of . . . and . . . per yard, respectively, both prices f.o.b. . . . will be shipped to you freight prepaid. When you receive the goods you should compare them with the samples which are enclosed with this letter and, if satisfactory, certify to the accounts in duplicate from the firms who have been asked to direct them to you.\n\nThe wool sheeting should be cut up for bed covering and the cotton for sheets and pillow cases. The 72\" width in each case will be sufficient for the length of the beds. The Department supplies this type of equipment when furnishing new Indian residential schools; but replacements must be made in future from school earnings.\nMarch 31, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nAt different times, representations have been made to the Department that it would be advisable to increase the annual vacation at Indian residential schools to six weeks. Of late years, Mr. Inspector Cairns has urged a longer holiday and Rev. Father Guy, on behalf of R.C. principals, has made a similar request.\n\nThe reasons advanced are as follows:\n\n1. In extremely warm weather it is better for the health of the pupils if they are without classroom activity and without the restraint which is so irksome to the Indian child. (There is a general tendency to increase the duration of the summer vacation at educational institutions).\n\n2. A certain number of the staff have to be on duty at Indian residential schools at all times. If the vacation of the pupils is limited to one month, some of the officers do not receive any more than two weeks' holiday.\n\n3. One or two exceptions have been made and a holiday longer than 31 days is taken. Father Guy points out that some principals allow six weeks or more, without the permission of the Department, and have been doing it for many years.\n\nI wish to recommend an annual vacation of 43 days instead of 31 days as formerly. This will be fully 6 weeks plus a Sunday at the end of the holiday. With your approval, I will draft a circular letter to the Church and Department workers interested. I propose to send a copy to two or three representative principals and to Commissioner Graham and Inspector Cairns, with the request that they make suggestions. Then a circular would be directed to all principals and agents, after having been approved by yourself.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 14, 1925.\n\nTo Church Authorities, Principals and Department Representatives:\n\nThe Department has decided to allow pupils at Indian residential schools annual leave with grant for any period up to 43 days. Holidays may be taken consecutively, at the discretion of the principal, during the September quarter. Other dates may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department. The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise, and, in future, grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission. At no school should week-end holidays be granted.\n\nRequests for special or emergency leave for pupils, who are urgently needed at home, should be made to the Indian agent, who will give approval only when he considers such leave absolutely necessary and after he has the concurrence of the principal, who should understand that grant will be discontinued. Special leave in the case of any pupil should be reported to the Department by the Indian agent. If the medical officer advises that a pupil be sent home for a period because of illness, the Indian agent should be informed and the principal, when preparing the quarterly return, should not apply for grant for those days the pupil was out of school.\n\nOrphans and children of destitute parents should not be allowed summer holidays, unless satisfactory arrangements can be made for their care when away from school. Principals should not allow annual leave to children who have had to be brought in under escort upon the expiration of summer vacations and may refuse holidays to those pupils who have truanted during the academic year. Extreme care should be exercised in the case of pupils whose homes are distant from the school. Unless special safeguards concerning their return can be taken, holidays should not be granted.\n\nWhen the September quarter return is being prepared, the dates of the annual leave should be clearly indicated and grant for the full quarter may be requested for all pupils who have been away from the school no longer than 45 days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAddressed to those listed on the attached page.\nJune 18, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFollowing the recent fire at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, Mr. Commissioner Graham recommends that the Department arrange for a patrol by a member of the staff, once or twice each night, at government-owned Indian residential schools.\n\nI believe that most principals arrange for an inspection of furnaces, stoves, etc., quite late each evening of the winter months. There is, of course, during the cold weather an officer on the job quite early in the morning for the purpose of replenishing fires and heating the building for the day's activity. If you feel that there should be a patrol of all parts of our buildings during the night, I will prepare the necessary circular.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 19, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFor the past six fiscal years, the Department of Indian Affairs has paid bonus at a flat rate of $150 each to Indian day school teachers. This practice was confirmed by Orders in Council dated 11th November, 1922 (P.C. 2341) and 21st June, 1924 (P.C. 1036).\n\nOrder in Council dated 6th May, 1925 (P.C. 1/712) provided new ranges of compensation with a view to the discontinuance of the cost of living bonus.\n\nI wish to recommend that the authority of His Excellency in Council be secured (1) for a flat increase of $150 in the salaries of Indian day school teachers as from April first, 1925; (2) for a transfer at the end of the present fiscal year from Miscellaneous Vote No. 498 (which provides, subject to the approval of the Treasury Board, for salaries, reclassification, revision, promotions and increases) to Vote No. 274 (Indian Education) of the funds necessary to pay such increase.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRE: Payments on the Per Capita Grant Basis.\n\nP.C. 2810, dated 22nd October, 1892, was authority for changing the manner of financing Indian residential schools. This authority of His Excellency was secured with a view to more economical management, \"when the whole cost of an institution is directly borne by the Government, the same economy by those in immediate charge is not used as would be employed under other conditions.\" It was considered that \"the best way to effect the desired decrease (in expenditure) would be to place the schools under a per capita grant system similar to that\" in operation at government established schools, which had been given to church authorities to manage.\n\nThis Order in Council reads in part as follows:\n\"The Minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to the industrial schools in operation in the Northwest Territories and to such other similar institutions as may hereafter be established as soon as, in the opinion of the Indian Department, such institutions are in proper running order, at rates to be fixed upon as being fair and just. . . . . . . . payment to be made only for children authorized by the Commissioner to be admitted and in accordance with the scale now governing payments to schools under the per capita system, which may be altered from time to time to suit circumstances. This Order in Council also contained clauses which had to do with the agreement to be entered into by the churches and it mentioned the per capita grant rate in the case of four specific schools.\n\nOn May 25, 1897, the Auditor General asked for a list of schools showing the amount of per capita grant to each, the authority for paying per capita grant and a statement concerning what expenses the per capita grant was to meet. On the 12th of June of that year, the Department forwarded a statement in answer to this letter from the Auditor General and mentioned that the authority in the case of all residential schools, other than the four specifically mentioned in the Order in Council, was \"Parliamentary Grant.\" Two days later, the Auditor General asked to be informed what was meant by \"Parliamentary Grant\" as he did not find that these amounts had been voted to the different schools. He also pointed out that the Order in Council indicated $140 as the per capita grant to the Battleford institution and that it was now being paid at the rate of $145.\nIn connection with this last letter from the Auditor General, Duncan C. Scott prepared a memorandum for the file, which reads in part as follows: \"The principle of such payment was fixed by the details of the General Estimates for Indian Schools. The separate items do not appear in the Supply Act. The authority to pay per capita grants to schools established after the date of the Order in Council was granted by the Order in Council (here quote). The division of expenses is made as strictly as possible upon the terms of the Order in Council.\"\n\nThe departmental reply to the Auditor General was dated June 26th and the words of Mr. Scott's memo were used. The quotation, however, omitted that portion of the Order in Council which reads as follows: \" . . . . . . . . in accordance with the scale now governing payments to schools under the per capita system which may be altered from time to time to suit circumstances.\" I believe that, if these words had been included in the departmental letter, the Auditor General would not have replied on the 30th of July that it was necessary to have an Order in Council fixing the amount of the per capita grant to be paid to each school.\n\nMr. Scott then directed a memorandum to the Secretary, which reads in part as follows: \"The wisdom of passing an Order in Council fixing these grants is doubtful and I do not see upon what ground the Auditor requires it. I suppose he has made the demand because he knows that in the case of the larger industrial schools we have obtained an Order in Council; but this Order was passed, not to fix the grants solely, but to place the schools upon a new footing - the per capita system - and it was thought advisable to make the change as authoritative as possible at the beginning. That order (22nd October, 1892) lays down the principles upon which these schools are conducted and provides that other schools may come under its terms. . . . . . . . . These per capita grants belong to such . . . . . . and distinct class of expenditure that, at first thought, it might be said that the demand for an Order in Council is reasonable; but it is just as unreasonable as it would be to demand the authority of His Excellency for any or all of our fixed charges. The allowances to schools are no more permanent. In the end, the Auditor may ask for full details of our Estimates, a matter with which he has nothing whatever to do.\"\n\nOfficial letter of August 17, 1897, to the Auditor General states in part: \"It is difficult to see why a payment of this kind should be fixed by Order in Council and I should be glad to know your reasons for thinking it necessary.\" The Auditor General replied on the 25th of August that Council, having fixed the rates in four cases and authorized these rates, has established a precedent which must be followed in authorizing the grants payable to other schools. The Department's reply, on the following day, was \"that it is not possible for this Department to agree with your interpretation of Order in Council of 22nd October, 1892.\"\nThe Department's position at that time was that the O.C. established the principle of paying such per capita grants and it was therefore considered a sufficient warrant for the continuance and extension of the system. Following the Department's letter of the 27th of August, that it could not agree with the Auditor General's interpretation, the matter appears to have been dropped.\n\nI consider that this memo is not complete without reference to correspondence which commenced with a letter from the Auditor General dated March 22nd, 1923. The Department was asked for a list of the residential schools, indicating the grant, pupilage, religious denomination, ownership, and was requested to send advice concerning any changes that might be made in the future. Mr. Learns also requested a statement showing what expenses were properly payable by the Government in addition to the per capita grant. I cannot overlook the possibility that the old question of the Department's authority to fix per capita grants was in the background at this time. I prepared a lengthy letter which was to go with the list requested and, as is usual when details of arrangements and agreements are given, the writing is not nearly as satisfactory as if general terms only are used. There are a thousand and one types of expenditure in connection with an Indian residential school and, no matter how careful one compiles a list of the expenses that should be met by the State, there are bound to be omissions and subsequent questions by the Audit Office. The more detail in definition the more limited is the application. The Deputy Minister, other officers of the Department and myself were at a loss to know how to reply. On December 28th of the same year, Mr. Learns asked for a reply to his earlier letter, and, on February 11th, 1924, a list of Indian residential schools showing ownership, religious denomination, pupilage and per capita grant as on April first, 1924, was submitted. Mr. Learns was informed that it is necessary to increase the pupilage at certain Indian residential schools from time to time. It might have been advisable to have added that adjustments in the per capita grant rate also were inevitable. The correspondence ended here, as the Auditor General did not insist on the information which the Department seemed reluctant to offer. Of course, our position was that some of his questions had reference to policy and administration and were outside the jurisdiction of any department but our own.\n\nNo authority, other than that of the Superintendent General, has been secured for the establishing of residential schools, for the fixing of the grant to be paid in each case, for the determination of the pupilage to be allowed, nor for an adjustment of the amount of the grant from time to time.\nThe grant in the case of a few schools has been increased when it was found necessary, and, when considered advisable, the Department has decreased the per capita grant in the case of a few schools. At the beginning of the fiscal year 1924-25, a flat $20 increase was made in the per capita grant payments, when the bonus of this amount - paid for the fiscal years 1921-22 to 1923-24 - was incorporated in the regular per capita grant. For the fiscal years 1919-20 and 1920-21, the per capita grant bonus was at the rate of $10. The Department is making an upward revision and a new classification of the residential schools at the present time.\n\nAn increase which averages $10 per child is being made in the case of some schools as from April first, 1926, and in the case of others, a year later. It is proposed to make a final adjustment at a later date, so that there will be some measure of relief to the financial situation in which the churches find their Indian educational work.\n\nRussell T.

The report has been prepared and issued in order to provide the initial material for a widespread co-operative survey of the problems of teaching English as a foreign language, particularly to non-European peoples. Its purpose and the mode in which it may be used and criticized are sufficiently indicated both in the introduction and in the general covering letter which accompanies it.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to ask for the honour of your friendly interest and assistance in securing study and criticism of the report by those whose duties and experience are such as to render valuable any comments they may wish to offer. We are assuming that it may be possible for more than one such person to use one copy of the report. But if you would like additional copies of the report sent to you in order to ensure prompt consideration by those who are competent to deal with the subject, we will do our best to send the additional number that you require with due regard to our limited supply and claims from other areas.\n\nThe Institute of Education is deeply interested in this attempt at co-operative study of a widespread and complex problem of teaching. It is not concerned to press any particular technique of solution, but is interested only in gathering records of experience and opinion over the widest possible range. Material thus collected will be of great value in facilitating further study of the many issues of principle and of practical technique which are involved.\n\nIt is desired that comments and criticisms dealing with the report may be sent to the undersigned at the Institute of Education, Southampton Row, London, W.C.1.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\nF. Clarke,\nHead of Oversea Division, Institute of Education.\nDuring the year, 79 residential schools, 270 day schools and 10 combined white and Indian schools were in operation\u2014a total of 359 centres for Indian educational activity. The total enrolment was 18,033 and the average attendance, 13,849. The percentage of attendance was 76.79.\n\nTen years ago, there was a total of 341 Indian schools, with a total enrolment of 14,782 and an average attendance of 71.65%. Higher salaries and grants have attracted better qualified teachers and instructors. Further, Indian communities have evinced more interest in their children's welfare. The following table will show the increase in enrolment and attendance:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Day Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Total Enrolment | Percentage of Attendance |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| 1925-26     | 6,327                         | 5,658              | 8,455                 | 4,940             | 14,782          | 71.69                   |\n| 1926-27     | 6,641                         | 5,881              | 8,069                 | 4,660             | 14,710          | 71.66                   |\n| 1927-28     | 6,795                         | 6,043              | 8,223                 | 4,823             | 15,018          | 72.35                   |\n| 1928-29     | 7,075                         | 6,232              | 8,272                 | 4,976             | 15,347          | 73.35                   |\n| 1929-30     | 7,302                         | 6,476              | 8,441                 | 5,103             | 15,743          | 73.56                   |\n| 1930-31     | 7,831                         | 6,917              | 8,584                 | 5,314             | 16,415          | 74.51                   |\n| 1931-32     | 8,213                         | 7,400              | 8,950                 | 5,707             | 17,163          | 76.36                   |\n| 1932-33     | 8,465                         | 7,613              | 8,960                 | 5,874             | 17,425          | 77.40                   |\n| 1933-34     | 8,696                         | 7,760              | 8,852                 | 5,592             | 17,448          | 76.52                   |\n| 1934-35     | 8,709                         | 7,882              | 8,851                 | 5,560             | 17,560          | 76.54                   |\n| 1935-36     | 8,906                         | 8,061              | 9,127                 | 5,738             | 18,033          | 76.79                   |\n\nIn ten years, the enrolment has increased approximately 22 per cent. and, not only are more children attending, but they are attending more regularly. This has had an interesting effect on the academic standing of pupils. In 1925-26, 1,091 Indian children were studying in Grade 6 and higher. Last year, 2,098 were in the higher grades.\n\nThis is gratifying, but there is much yet to be desired as far as day school attendance is concerned. Every\nenergy is being bent to make instruction at these schools attractive. Better qualified teachers, more interesting texts and teachers' aids, more playground and outdoor activities and better correlation with the Indian home environment are the aims. The Department of Indian Affairs and the Churches interested are making special efforts to give better vocational training to pupils at Indian residential schools. It is the aim to make graduates of these institutions self-supporting members of their respective communities. Instructors have been asked to correlate classroom exercises with vocational training and home interests. To this end, more and better equipment for these schools is being provided as funds for the purpose permit.\n\nThe residential school activity was particularly encouraging. All these schools had an enrolment of pupils to full capacity. Indian parents are anxious to place their children in the schools of this class.\n\nSeveral of the churches are actively engaged in the management of Indian day and residential schools. This cooperation of the Church in the case of residential schools is as follows:\n\n| Church                  | Number of Residential Schools |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Roman Catholic          | 44                            |\n| Church of England       | 20                            |\n| United Church           | 13                            |\n| Presbyterian Church      | 2                             |\n| **Total**               | **79**                        |\n\nThe health of Indian children, particularly in residential schools, has been the subject for considerable thought and activity. A special effort is made in the matter of physical education and fairly comprehensive medical and dental supervision and treatment are provided. The Department is cooperating with the Canadian Junior Red Cross, with a view to better health for Indian children.\n\nAll the Indian schools are inspected frequently by department officials. In addition, public and separate school inspectors visit all classrooms, except in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, where there are special Indian school inspectors. More thorough inspection has resulted in a higher standard of instruction. Classroom activity in Indian schools is now comparable to the work in white schools of the same localities.\n\nIndian schools follow the provincial curricula but place special emphasis on language, reading, domestic science, manual training and agriculture. In the junior grades, there is a departure from the provincial courses, which were found not altogether suitable in either scope or content for Indian children.\n\nDuring the year, two modern, fireproof residential\nschool buildings were erected - the Shingwauk Residential School at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.; and the Qu'Appelle Residential School at Lebret, Sask. The former building provides accommodation for 150 pupils and the latter, for 260. Seven day school buildings were erected, four of which provide living accommodation for the teacher. Funds to erect these buildings were provided under the Public Works Construction Act. School buildings and equipment were maintained in a good state of repair, as the funds provided for the purpose would permit.\n\nApproximately 200 graduates of Indian schools, who showed academic promise, received grants for the purpose of continuing their studies at high schools, universities and business colleges. The policy is to make grants to the most promising, physically fit graduates of our own schools. If church and department representatives consider a graduate worthy, a grant is allowed when the bona fide intention of the pupil is evident and proper supervision can be secured for the period of advanced study. These tuition grants are continued only when satisfactory reports are received. Last year, besides those taking advanced work, there were approximately 180 Indian children attending white schools and orphanages. All these are in addition to the enrolment at Indian schools as shown in the tabular statements in Part 2 of this report. The expenditure from Parliamentary Appropriation on behalf of these special students amounted to $26,800.00 during the year.\n\nThe practice of assisting selected ex-pupils of residential schools to start farming and housekeeping has been continued. The expenditure for this purpose amounted to approximately $4,000.00.\n\nThe Department recognizes the cooperation and services given by the Principals and staffs of the residential schools and the teachers in the Indian day schools in the education of the Indian youth of Canada.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian Education for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1936, amounting to $1,936,744.17, is analyzed in the following table. In addition to this amount, there was expended for educational purposes, from a special appropriation for British Columbia Indians, the sum of $10,911.40. This last amount was used for technical training for British Columbia Indian schools and in assisting promising graduates to continue their studies.\nEDUCATION\n\nIt may be of interest to briefly sketch Indian educational activities. All the early efforts with Indian children were wholly missionary in character - for nearly 200 years the work was carried on without financial assistance from the Governments. There is record of Recollet Fathers' schools for Indian children in New France as early as 1616; the Jesuits were active early in the 18th century; and settlers in the British colonies established little centres of Christianity at this period. These intermittent and only partly successful efforts were continued under British domination - prominence being given to instruction in religion. Even the education of white children received very little attention - in fact the first school in Upper Canada (1784) was for the Mohawk Indians who had settled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte and the first church to be erected in the province (1785) was for the Six Nations Indians of the Grand River Reserve, near Brantford.\n\nPrior to Confederation, day schools were successfully conducted at Lorette, St. Regis, and Ferreville in Lower Canada. At Caughnawaga, educational work was made nearly impossible by local difficulties. However, there were interesting experiments at Chateauguay and Christieville, where Indian boys from Caughnawaga were taken into residence and given a training in the classroom and on the farm. All these school activities received grants from Lower Canada. The Seminary of St. Sulpice, at Oka, maintained a farm school, at which Indian boys were enrolled.\n\nIn Upper Canada, the Society for the propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts organized the earliest Indian school on the Tyendinaga Reserve (Bay of Quinte). The New England Company, an evangelical organization chartered in 1661 in the reign of Charles II, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society and the Jesuits interested themselves in Indian educational work early in the 19th century. Approximately forty day schools were established in Upper Canada prior to Confederation, but there is record of only two of them receiving grants from the Governments of the day. Special institutions for the education of Indians were established at this time: the Mohawk Institute by the New England Company; the Alderville and Mount Elgin Boarding Schools by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, and the Wikwemikong Boarding School by the Jesuits. In addition, there was a community training centre established by the Governor of Upper Canada at Manitowaning, on Manitoulin Island. This enterprise was for the education of both young and old; but, as it did not appeal to the Indian temperament, it was abandoned in 1856, after twenty years of effort.\n\nIt should be recorded that in 1848 certain Indian bands in Upper Canada agreed to set apart for the purposes of education one-quarter of the amount received in compensation of their annual distribution of ammunition. This Indian school fund was used largely for the maintenance of the Alderville and Mount Elgin Boarding Schools, payments being made on a per capita grant basis - so much per child per year. Right at the outset of governmental association with Indian educational activity, we find two of the outstanding characteristics of the present system - church\nco-operation in the work and per capita grant payments to residential schools.\n\nPrior to Confederation there was practically no organization of Indian schools in other parts of Canada. Missionaries interested in the education of Indian children were opportunists - classes being conducted whenever and wherever the activity gave promise of even a little success. The New England Company experimented with foster homes for Indian children in New Brunswick even before it applied its energy and funds to the work among the Six Nations. A Church of England chaplain to the Hudson's Bay Company conducted a boarding school for Indian children on the Red River as early as 1822. A Roman Catholic priest tried an agricultural school for young Indians at Rainy Lake, near St. Boniface, Man., in 1833. There is record of day schools in various parts of the West, all conducted by Roman Catholic, Church of England and Methodist missionaries. In British Columbia the New England Company began work early in the 19th century from which developed the present Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nAt Confederation Indian schools were supported for the most part by missionary societies, religious orders and the Indian bands - little financial assistance being given by the legislatures. Low salaries were paid and the attendance was irregular and, as a consequence, the schools were not effective. When the British North America Act placed the responsibility for the Indians of Canada with the federal Government, reports from Indian schools were forwarded to the Department of the Secretary of State, a branch of which was made the administrative office for Indian Affairs. In 1867 one residential school, the Mount Elgin Institute, with an enrolment of 52, and forty-nine day schools with a total of 1,664 pupils - all in Ontario and Quebec - were recognized by the Indian Office. There were several Indian schools, entirely missionary in character, that did not make return to the Government. The two most important of these were the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, supported by the New England Company, and the Roman Catholic boarding school at Wikwemikong.\nNew Indian Residential Schools Completed\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014Marked progress has been made in Canada in recent years in the extension and improvement of facilities for the education and vocational training of the Dominion's Indian population. New schools buildings, modern in every respect, are replacing old structures and better qualified teachers and instructors are being attracted to the Indian schools. There are 79 residential schools, 262 day schools, and 10 combined Indian and white schools in operation under the supervision of Honourable T.A. Crerar, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and Minister of the Interior. Eighteen thousand Indian children in Canada are enrolled in the schools and of this number 8,900 are in residential schools.\n\nTwo of the most recent additions to the residential school system are those erected at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Lebret, Saskatchewan. These, like other schools under the Department of Indian Affairs, are operated in co-operation with the various church authorities engaged in Indian work, a method of carrying on the education of Canada's Indian youth which has worked out most satisfactorily.\n\nThe Shingwauk Indian Residential School at Sault Ste. Marie is conducted by the Church of England in Canada. The new building was opened on October 3, 1935, under the principalship of the Reverend C.F. Hives. It replaces that built in 1875 and is one of the finest in Canada. The school has accommodation for 150 pupils and staff and is steam-heated and fireproof throughout. The new building is of steel construction, with reinforced concrete floors, tile partitions, steel stairs, and fireproof connecting doors. The outside walls are faced with brick and trimmed with stone. The main building is H-shaped, the centre portion being 80 feet long and the end wings 64 feet by 32 feet. The centre portion contains accommodation in the basement for dining rooms for the pupils and staff, boys and girls recreation\nrooms, toilets, baths, wash rooms, shower baths, etc. There is a wing at the rear approximately 70 feet by 50 feet which contains the kitchen, store rooms, boiler room, laundry, and cold storage. On the ground floor are located the class rooms, sewing room, and staff living quarters, together with a spacious assembly hall. The first and second floors contain the dormitories, clothing stores, staff bed rooms, and a well planned infirmary for the boys and girls.\n\nThe Lebret Indian Residential school in the Qu'Appelle valley of Saskatchewan was officially opened on May 29, 1936, and is being conducted under Roman Catholic Church auspices. This school replaces that destroyed by fire in November, 1932, and provides accommodation for 250 pupils and the necessary staff. The building is of re-inforced concrete construction throughout. It has a frontage of 246 feet, with a rear extension of 115 feet deep. In the basement of the main portion of the building are located pupil and staff dining rooms, boys and girls recreation rooms, toilets, baths, shower baths, etc. The rear wing contains the kitchen, scullery, cold storage room, laundry, and boiler room. It is worthy of mention that the basement of all Indian residential schools is practically a ground floor as the level of the basement floor is only 12 inches below grade, thus providing a maximum amount of light and ventilation. On the ground floor are located the class rooms, sewing room, staff bed rooms, offices, and a large chapel. There is also a large room for the accommodation of Indian parents when visiting their children. The first floor contains principally the dormitories, the Sisters living quarters, and infirmaries for the boys and girls. The second floor is entirely devoted to dormitories and a few staff bed rooms for supervision. The building is heated by steam and the water supply and sewage disposal systems were also installed by the Department.\n4103 Dufferin St.,\nToronto, July 18, 1937\n\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nDominion Govt.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBeing anxious to obtain information regarding our Indian schools I would respectfully ask you to send to above address any pamphlets and reports re their no., organization, equipment, costs, curriculum, management, progress etc.\n\nI would esteem this as a very great favour.\n\nVery truly,\n\nM. A. Garea B.A., B.F.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPlease have copy of report sent by P.P.\n\nRobert Scott\n29/7/37\nMr. STEWART: The minister said that in the interests of efficiency an additional employee had been taken on. May I ask what are his duties and when he was taken on?\n\nMr. CRERAR: The addition to the staff at the observatory is a young lady who was loaned in the first place from the statistical branch of the Dominion Bureau of Trade and Commerce. She has been at the observatory for a considerable time and is now being permanently transferred from the statistics branch to the observatory. I understand that she is highly efficient.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nDominion astrophysical observatory.\u2014Expenses connected with the dominion astrophysical observatory at Victoria, B.C., $20,000.\n\nMr. PLUNKETT: Will the minister tell the committee who succeeded Doctor Plaskett at Victoria observatory and also explain the decrease in this vote? I understood the minister to say a moment ago that we had the second largest telescope in the world at Victoria, and one would think that this might necessitate a larger personnel.\n\nMr. CRERAR: Doctor Harper succeeded Doctor Plaskett. He was Doctor Plaskett's assistant for many years.\n\nMr. PLUNKETT: What is the reason for the decrease in this vote?\n\nMr. CRERAR: As my hon. friend will have observed the decrease is not very large, being $1,203. It is due to the fact that the new employees who have been taken on the staff have come in at the minimum salaries.\n\nItem agreed to.\n\nIndian Affairs.\u2014To provide for expenses connected with the administration of Indian Affairs, including salaries, supplies, rent, fuel, heating, hospitalization, dwellings, agricultural activities, etc., and grants for the purposes of dyeing, education, etc., and a grant of $100,000 approved by parliament in session of 1926-27, $4,241,100.\n\nMr. BENNETT: It is desirable that the minister should make some statement as he can with respect to this whole Indian problem. I confess that during the last few years I have become considerably interested in it, and if the minister will take it up in detail and give us some idea of the present situation I think that would be appreciated by the committee.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I confess that my knowledge of the whole Indian problem in Canada is not as intimate as I could wish, but I might say in a general way that the Indian population in Canada today is about 112,000, and is increasing. The fact that it is increasing makes the Indian problem deserving of the attention of public officials with a view to studying the best methods for bringing education to the Indians, making them self-supporting, and generally improving their situation. Unquestionably a very large number of Indians are on relief at the present time. I am speaking from memory, but I think I am correct when I say that about one-third of the Indians in Ontario and Quebec have been on relief for the last two or three years. The rather superficial study that I have been able to give the Indian problem since I took charge of the department has convinced me of the view that the administration is rather expensive; that it costs a considerable amount of money and probably could be improved in some respects. I hope to submit estimates before I come again to submit estimates to the committee, if it is my good fortune to do so.\n\nThere are further problems in connection with education. In this connection we sometimes run into a rather delicate situation. It is frequently found that two or more denominations are carrying out their good work in one community, and this occasionally creates a problem. There is as well the question of the relations which are to discharge our obligations to the Indians in this connection, this matter will stand a very considerable amount of study. There is no problem of bringing the Indians to a better understanding of the methods of the white man and his way of living. At times I do not think we have acted wisely in this respect. In western Canada there in some parts of Ontario there are Indians who are making substantial progress towards becoming self-supporting. This is being achieved mainly through the cultivation of land. In more remote parts of the country trapping and fishing, the traditional occupations of the Indian, are practically his only means of support. Our Indians are scattered from Prince Rupert, Vancouver and from the international boundary to the Arctic circle and one realizes the magnitude of the problem when that vast area is considered. I do not know that there is much more that I can add to this statement.\n\nMr. MacNEIL: Has the minister investigated the complaints I forwarded him in connection with the Indians around Duncan on Vancouver Island? It is claimed that their habitations have not been repaired for many years, and some of these are definitely in an unsanitary condition. It is stated also that they are being fined for fishing within their own reserve.\nHon. T. A. CRERAR (Minister of the Interior): The increase due to this is that one additional member has been taken on the staff, and also some new equipment is required in the seismographical work. During the past year considerable damage was caused to the seismographical instruments.\n\nSir GEORGE PERLEY: By the earthquake?\n\nMr. BENNETT: I guess it was about the time of the election.\n\nMr. CRERAR: Yes, I think it was due to the election.\n\nMr. HEAPS: Can the minister state what work is performed in the observatory in Ottawa?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I freely confess that this work, which is of a highly scientific nature, is a little beyond the range of my knowledge or experience. I may say however that the work has to do with measurements as to the position of stars, and the relation of those measurements to measurement of time. Communications by radio are maintained with other observatories, and as a result we are able to have very accurate time. For instance, in Ottawa we have six hundred electrical clocks, three of which are in this chamber. It is important to have the correct time, otherwise the hon. member for Nova Scotia might have some time in one of the speeches he makes to the house. Then the observatory studies sun spots and their effects on climate, commerce, and plant life. Recent theories of the physicists indicate that sun spots have a material bearing on mundane matters, and we in Canada wish to make our contribution to the study of these matters. Therefore the seismo- graphical branch does an important work; when earthquakes take place we are able to do our share toward maintaining where they may be. There is here the absolute problem of getting an accurate method of measuring gravity. What particular relation this has to the ordinary affairs of the country I am unable to say, but I believe it is of considerable importance.\n\nMr. MacNICOL: I could see the minister's lips moving all right, and I noticed that hon. members sitting around him were apparently enjoying themselves. I did not hear a word of it over here. He likely gave a fair explanation of what this expenditure is for, but surely to goodness hon. members are entitled to hear what the minister has to say, and for my part I did not hear a word of it.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am really very sorry if my hon. friend did not hear me.\n\nMr. MacNICOL: Well, it is no fault of my care.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am quite willing to take all the blame for the inability of my hon. friend to hear me, but if he will read Hansard to-morrow he will get a general idea of the work that is being done in the observatory. It might remind hon. gentlemen that the observatory has been established for over thirty years.\n\nMr. HEAPS: The minister has shown a profound knowledge of all that is going on at the observatory. Although I noticed that at times he referred to his notes, still in spite of that he evidently knew something about gravity and the Einstein theory as well, and I observe how familiar he was about stargazing. I suppose he was looking at his political stars more than at anything else.\n\nSir GEORGE PERLEY: Are the telescope and other mechanical devices at the observatory to the same standard as those we use in which similar work is done in other countries? I should like to know whether our observatory is able to perform the functions it ought to in making its general observations throughout the world.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that the equipment at the observatory at Ottawa is reasonably adequate for the work it is doing. As my hon. friend probably knows, in the Victoria observatory they have the second largest telescope in the world, although that will not be the case when the new telescope is presently installed at Mount Wilson observatory.\n\nSir GEORGE PERLEY: Does that mean that the work of this observatory is not as effective as it used to be and that it is giving place to the one at Victoria?\n\nMr. CRERAR: No.\n\nMr. SPENCE: Will the minister give us a statement as to how much money is going to be spent, how many employees there are, and so on? How many men are hanging around doing nothing?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I can assure the hon. gentlemen that there are none hanging around doing nothing. There are seventeen of the staff of the observatory at Ottawa paid out of this vote.\n\nMr. SPENCE: I do not know what they can be working at.\nMr. CHERAR: I have not had an opportunity to look closely into the matters which the hon. member has brought to my notice. However I assure him that they are not being overlooked.\n\nMr. MacNEIL: I thank the minister for his evident intention to look thoroughly into this matter.\n\nMr. MacNicol: Mr. Chairman, I was very glad to hear the minister say that he is going to look carefully into the whole question of the administration of the Department of Indian Affairs. In checking over the public accounts for 1935 I notice that there is a great variation in the cost of different services rendered to the Indians. I assume that the item for hospitalization refers only to Indians. There seems to be also a great variation in the salaries paid to the doctors at the different reserves, as well as a difference in the salaries of teachers and other officials. I notice also that in some cases there is considerable amount of surplus. Upon looking over these items I can see a good deal in the old saying, \"Lo, the poor Indian.\" According to the best figures we spent approximately $4,000,000 on the Indians. According to the present estimates before the house\u2014and I assume the same ratio would apply in 1936\u2014the Indians are spending about $250,000 in grants while salaries amounts to a little over $800,000. There seems to be a great field here for the well known ability of the Indians to bring about a real reform in the management of this department. I shall be very glad to support any recommendation he desires to make in an effort to see that the Indians get all of what is voted while the general cost is reduced.\n\nMr. CHERAR: I appreciate the reference the hon. member for Davenport has made to my ability and I shall certainly endeavour to cooperate in the administration of this department. I think I am correct in saying that twenty-five years ago the cost of administration in Nova Scotia\u2014I do not take this province for any particular reason but merely it merely seemed to me the hardest to stick in my memory\u2014was around $10,000 or $12,000 a year. To-day it is almost ten times that amount. Hon. members will note that this general vote of expenditure is divided\u2014I have stated already that approximately one-third of the Indians have been on relief for the last two or three years\u2014medical attendance, hospitalization, dwellings, arts-cultural activities, surveys, roads, bridges, irrigation, dyking, and education. I am informed that forty-five per cent of the total vote is used for educational purposes. I think there is a chance for improvement and I hope to be able to hold this vote to the committee should it be my good fortune to be dealing with these estimates next year.\n\nMr. HEAPS: The minister has not told the committee the number of Indians who come under this item.\n\nMr. CHERAR: A little earlier I stated that the total number of Indians in Canada was approximately 112,000.\n\nMr. HEAPS: Would all the 112,000 come within the purview of the government?\n\nMr. CHERAR: Yes.\n\nMr. HEAPS: Is the number increasing or decreasing?\n\nMr. CHERAR: It is increasing. Practically the whole 112,000, I am informed, are under the care of the government.\n\nMr. BENNETT: The fact that the Indian population is increasing is in itself prima facie evidence that they are not being well looked after. Prior to a few years ago the Indian agents were not always medical men, nor are they yet; but an effort was made during the last report to provide that if possible they should have some medical training. The result is, I believe, that this is the first time a report has been made to the house of an increase in the Indian population. My memory is that it was several years ago; but during the last few years an effort has been made, whenever vacancies have occurred, to appoint as Indian agent, if possible, a medical man. As a result the children have received better care for, tuberculosis has been brought under control; disease has diminished, and the habits of life of the Indians have improved.\n\nI cannot speak of the Indians in the maritimes provinces. The report I received with respect to them on one occasion was rather alarming, and a special effort was made to have some medical relief efforts made. They are in a rather bad way. In Quebec, apart from the large bands, there are small bands scattered over many sections of the province, and in Ontario, apart from the large reserves, there are numbers of bands of Indians. When we get into western Canada we find that usually they have excellent reserves. At Medicine Hat the Blackfoot have a very fine reserve which they receive substantial revenues. The Blackfoot Indians have sold large quantities of their land, sometimes by public auction and sometimes not, and considerable sums of\nmoney have gone into their endowment fund. They have been greatly improved in their status during the last few years, for they have been fairly well treated. The Stony Indians west of Calgary, are in a bad way. They are hunters and fishermen and during the last few years have suffered acutely. A good deal of money has been expended in improving facilities at Morley, and perhaps they are better off than they were a while ago. So far as British Columbia is concerned, reports from there indicate that many of the Indians are in a pretty bad way, and a special effort was made to look after many of them.\n\nI have been astounded at the enormous amount of money that has been spent to accomplish the results. The year before last the situation was very acute, and when you realize that $4,000,000 has been spent on about 112,000 Indians, who then did possess adequate resources in the way of reserves, I can only say that the closest supervision ought to be exercised over administration. I believe in many cases they are rations which they have treaty money distributed to them, under the terms of surrender they made to their interests in lands and the taking up of reserves. They have been paid sums in the way of treaty money, and then they are charged on their own funds. I understand that they utilize their own funds for the construction of buildings.\n\nOne of the most difficult problems is that connected with education. I believe it is the outstanding problem in that regard. My memory is that cost per head in connection with these Indians is not high, but is a very substantial part of the appropriation. That is a matter which perhaps can be carefully considered during the recess, but there are some definite difficulties, as the hon. gentleman has said, by reason of the possibility of differences arising with respect to the religious denominations that should look after particular bands of Indians.\n\nIn the far north, the distressing tales came down two years ago of the condition of the Indians, and I hope that during this very hard winter they will not experience the hardship they did that year for in the western provinces, where the cold has been intense, the condition of the Indians in the last few weeks has been very trying. I think the relief measures afforded them have been as nearly adequate as possible.\n\nCanada, I believe, has discharged its obligations to its wards as fairly as has any country in the world, but during the last ten years there has been a decided increase in expenditures. The Indians have been receiving medical attention and care which they never had before, and with the rations they have received they have been in a much better position, very much better as a matter of fact than have other sections of our population. I realize the minister's difficulty, and it is only fair to say that he is not responsible for expenditure that will recur during the next fiscal year; he is responsible only for the sums he is asking for and for the work that will be done during the next fiscal year under existing conditions. But what is the $100,000 for?\n\nMr. CRERAR: That, I am informed, is a special vote given British Columbia under some legislation passed in 1926-27.\n\nMr. BENNETT: I was trying to ascertain what it was for; I did not know whether it was for the extinguishment of rights in Kettlelans or not. Perhaps the minister recalls that.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that it is in lieu of treaty money. Treaty money is not paid to Indians in British Columbia and the $100,000 is in lieu thereof. I might say, to augment what we might hear from his said, that this winter has proved a rather severe one with the Indians, and expenditures for supplies in the way of rations, clothing, etc., for them have been higher than they have been in the last few years. That of course is unavoidable considering weather conditions that have prevailed in western Canada for several months.\n\nIn reply to the hon. member for North Winnipeg I might give the details of this vote. The administration cost is $262,000, a very slight reduction from last year. That includes all administrative costs and Indian agents throughout the country. Education is of course the big item\u2014this year $1,691,000.\n\nMr. BAKER: Does the minister think we are getting results for that amount of money?\n\nMr. CRERAR: Frankly, I am not in a position to pass fair judgment on that question, but I may say that that is a reduction of $280,000 from the previous year. It seems somewhat that it is justified by those having to do with the education of the Indians, and were all to the effect that the funds should be increased and not decreased, but at any rate that is what it is for the present year. The medical services absorb\n$861,500. Then aids to Indians in various ways, implements of production, all the aids to get the Indians established\u2014and we have not succeeded\u2014\n\nMr. BENNETT: Continue their establishment? I should say.\n\nMr. CRERAR: \u2014in our efforts yet\u2014accounts for $931,000. That includes houses and repairs to houses and all that sort of thing. Then there is a small vote for irrigation surveys amounting to $31,000. That roughly, is the break-up of the item of $1,241,100.\n\nMr. HEAPS: How many children are being educated in the Indian schools?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that there are about 16,000 Indians engaged in receiving education at the present time in one form or another.\n\nMr. McCANN: Is there any attempt on behalf of the department to carry the education beyond the primary schools?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed there is an effort, in this way, that an additional grant of $25,000 is given for the benefit of those Indian pupils who show exceptional capacity.\n\nMr. TAYLOR (Nanaimo): Is any attempt being made to train Indian girls as nurses in the hospitals so that they may look after the sick of their own people?\n\nMr. CRERAR: That is being done. I am not at the moment prepared to give the number, but several Indian girls have qualified as trained nurses and are being used mostly in the Indian hospitals.\n\nMr. HEAPS: I wonder whether the amount of $1,691,000 is too high or too low for educational facilities for Indian boys and girls, but it seems to me that the government should pay $100 per annum for the education of each Indian child. That works out at considerably more than is being spent on education in the ordinary schools of the country. If we take our ordinary public schools, this works out at about $50 or $60 per year. Can the minister explain why there is that great difference between the cost of education given in the city or town or village as compared with that of the Indian who is being educated in somewhat different surroundings?\n\nMr. CRERAR: Yes. The explanation is very simple. By far the greater number of Indian schools are residential schools. These youngsters come in from the reservations. They live in the school; they are fed and housed and educated there. Of course that type of education is much more expensive than that which obtains in, for instance, a city school.\n\nMr. PERLEY (Qu'Appelle): Can the minister give us a little information with respect to medical attention, more particularly as it now applies to work at reserve. How many doctors, for instance, are employed in this work in Saskatchewan, and what progress are they making with respect to stamping out tuberculosis prevalent among the Indians?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I shall have to give the information later to the hon. member as to the number of doctors employed in the Indian service in Saskatchewan.\n\nMr. PERLEY (Qu'Appelle): I mean in special work.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I could not say as to that. I may be able to get that information. On the other question raised by the hon. member as to tuberculosis, that is a real problem so far as the Indian population is concerned. Already we have had some cooperation with one or two of the provinces that are making efforts to stamp out tuberculosis among the white population in order to see whether the same methods can be used to reduce the Indian population as well. That is a problem which must be studied. I recall that in one of the schools in an Alberta reserve we have been able to secure for a number of children who have tuberculosis in the incipient stages, to segregate those children from the others is done in a very haphazard fashion. At the moment that problem is engaging my attention.\n\nMr. DONNELLY: What percentage of the schedule of medical fees is paid for surgical operations, or is the full schedule paid?\n\nMr. CRERAR: Where special surgical work has to be done the fee paid to the doctor performing the operation is determined by the workmen's compensation boards in various provinces allow for similar operations, or in some cases the fees are taxed by the department itself. As such, I can assure the hon. member that the department is doing everything it reasonably can to protect the public interest in that regard. That was one of the matters I went into very early in my experience in the department.\n\nMr. TAYLOR (Nanaimo): Has it been found possible to police the reserves with Indians rather than white policemen?\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that the policing of some of the reserves in some of the minor work is being done in certain cases by Indians. That is a question which requires some study and, of course, some care. On the whole, however, in the matter I should say that to as great a degree as possible the Indians should be made self-supporting in the matter of policing, as in everything else.\n\nMr. WOOD: Are the band funds or the endowment funds included in that appropriation of four millions odd?\n\nMr. CRERAR: This is an appropriation by parliament for the maintenance of this work in all its varied aspects for the coming year, and it does not include expenditures from the band funds.\n\nMr. SENN: Are all the funds for educational purposes voted by parliament, or do some of the funds come from funds of the bands that are held in trust by the government?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I understand none of the band funds is used anywhere for educational purposes. Sometimes the increment of these funds is used for building houses and for improvements on the reserves, but not for education.\n\nMr. WALSH: Are there any special classes on the reservation such as are established under our regular school system for retarded children, or any vocational schools or technical classes or anything of a specialized nature?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I understand that many of the schools teach practically nothing. There are not any special classes for, shall I say, Indian children of low intelligence. There are none of those schools.\n\nMr. WALSH: Are all the teachers engaged by the government qualified teachers?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that the teachers are practically all qualified teachers. There may be one or two who have been teaching for many years who are not qualified, but they are practically all qualified teachers.\n\nMr. WALSH: If there are any unqualified teachers, does the minister not think, in view of the condition that exists in the teaching profession at present, this is an opportune time to replace them by certified teachers?\n\nMr. CRERAR: There are a few missionary teachers who have devoted practically all their lives to welfare work among the Indians, and they are continuing in the spheres in which they have lived and carried on their work. The others, as I have intimated, are qualified teachers.\n\nMr. WALSH: What is the average salary paid to teachers engaged by the government for this work?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I do not think I could give an average. The wages involve a schematized compensation, which at the moment I am not in a position to have made. These salaries range from $800 up to $1,000 per annum and perhaps in a few cases beyond that.\n\nMr. SENN: I wish to draw to the attention of the minister what I consider to be rather an injustice on a certain reservation in Ontario. A number of Indian children are attending a second-class school, if the cost of their instruction in those schools is paid. I understand, on an attendance basis. In the same reserve there are two or three churches who have children who are desirous of attending high school. But unfortunately the high school is in another county; the band is not willing to pay for the transportation, the parents are not up to the present but not been willing to do so, and because that particular locality does not pay any taxes to the county it is not willing to pay for their tuition. The result is that the children are unable to attend high school, as the father who is a missionary is unable to pay. I think I brought the case to the attention of the minister before, without any result. I would ask the minister to give it his serious consideration because a hardship is being worked on the children of those parents who are endeavouring to carry on in that reservation.\n\nMr. CRERAR: This is the first intimation I have had of the problem to which my hon. friend refers. I shall be very glad to get the details of the case and if there is any injustice or whether it cannot be corrected, I understand the hon. member is referring to children of the missionaries?\n\nMr. SENN: The children of white missionaries. They are not receiving any tuition subsidy because the parents are not able, the government grant is not available and the county in which they reside is not willing to pay for their tuition.\n\nMr. CRERAR: May I ask how many children are involved?\n\nMr. SENN: Only two that I have knowledge of. There are two missionaries in that\nreservation. The matter was brought to my attention some two or three years ago. I cannot say now just how many children there might be, two or three anyway.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I shall be glad to have my officials look into that matter and give me a report on it.\n\nMr. GREEN: What is the approximate number of Indians engaged in this work with the Indians and what are the types of work?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I presume the hon. member means in the total administration in Canada?\n\nMr. GREEN: Yes.\n\nMr. CRERAR: Between 900 and 1,000 regular employees, I am informed. That includes teachers.\n\nMr. GREEN: And the types of work they do?\n\nMr. CRERAR: They vary. Some are doctors, some nurses, some school teachers, some farm instructors, some Indian agents supervising the reserve they have charge of, and I daresay there are several other categories if I could think of them.\n\nMr. BROOKS: Is there any system of compulsory education for Indian children? I notice that a good many Indians seem to wander about the country during the school year and the children do not seem to be at school.\n\nMr. CRERAR: My deputy informs me that the Indian Act provides for a measure of compulsory education for the education of Indian children, to what extent I am not at the moment able to say. But the fact that the Indian population in Canada is roughly 112,000, and that more than 16,000 Indians attend the schools here is, I think, a pretty fair indication that their educational needs are not suffering badly.\n\nMr. McNIVEN (Regina): Is any sum provided in this vote for the new Indian school at Lebret and the new Indian hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle? Could the minister also tell us the cost of the new school at Lebret and also of the Indian hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, for both the erection of the buildings and the furnishings? Further, I should like to know what accommodation there is at the new Indian school at Lebret and at the hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am informed that the school cost approximately $200,000 and the hospital building approximately $100,000. In addition to that sum a further amount will be required for the hospital to equip it with beds and blankets and the sort of things that are required in a hospital.\n\nMr. McNIVEN (Regina): What accommodation is there for pupils in new Indian schools at Lebret, Saskatchewan?\n\nMr. CRERAR: Accommodation for 250 children.\n\nMr. McNIVEN (Regina): How many are there now?\n\nMr. CRERAR: The new school is not opened yet.\n\nMr. WOOD: I was not expecting that this vote would be discussed to-night. I am sorry I did not before me the information I should have liked to present concerning the Six Nations Indians who happen to reside in the constituency I have the honour to represent. Of the 112,000 Indians in Canada, 5,000 live in the reserve adjacent to the city of Brantford, and in the constituency of Brant. In my view they should not be treated as the average Indians of the dominion, when we learn that about thirty-three per cent of the Indians are on relief. From a conversation I had recently with the superintendent of the reserve, I understand of the 5,000 Indians in the Six Nations reserve only eighty-one are on relief. That would seem to indicate that they are capable in the main of taking care of themselves. For those reasons they have advanced more than many others of the aboriginals of the dominion.\n\nI believe that until within three years ago they administered their own educational system, but for some reason or another that privilege has been taken away from them. I have not been able to discover the reason. The department gave the excuse that they had appropriated the whole of the education of Indians in Canada and that because of that they must take away from the Indians the administration of their schools. In passing may I observe that the Indians built their own schools from their own funds, and prior to that time had contributed about half of the cost of their own education. They enjoy a reasonable amount of autonomy due to the fact that they elect their council, and it seems to me it was most unfortunate that the Indians were deprived of a degree of autonomy which, by virtue of their advancement, ought to encourage them to go further; it ought to give them more autonomy and more control over their affairs, in so far as they are able to manage them.\nIn that way we shall make good citizens of them.\n\nNow the few moments I shall speak\u2014and I shall not take too long\u2014may I state that the Indians in the Six Nations reserve are in a somewhat different position from that of the average of the aborigines of Canada, because they compare very favorably with our United Empire Loyalists. An agreement was made between Captain Joseph Brant and the British government which he well extend his loyalty towards the Brits at the time of the American revolution. The loyalists were granted certain concessions if they would remain true to the British crown. They came to Canada and were granted a number of land extending six miles on either side of the Grand river from its mouth to its source. They did not need all that land, so for some reason they sold a portion of it. The money was set aside and was held in trust in Canada as a trust fund for the maintenance of the Indians. This was a good business proposition, and I believe we have every reason to commend the Indians for their astuteness in having a sound account, only wish the government had put a bank account or some other place where those Indians, because if that were so we would be in a much better position than we are in today. The matter in regard to which I am speaking has been perennial subject.\n\nI believe my predecessor, Mr. Smoke, described conditions possibly better than I am in a position to do, because I know he has made a study of the subject, whereas at the time I am going through eighty-six pages of legal terminology. So far I have gone only about half way through, but it has been my endeavor to learn the history of the Six Nations Indians.\n\nMr. BENNETT: Read Mr. Smoke's speech and you will get the story.\n\nMr. WOOD: Yes, and I commend Mr. Smoke for his approach to the subject. Unfortunately I have not been able to get all the facts in the short time I have had at my disposal, but to the best of my ability I have endeavored to do so in my own way. For that reason I am not going into detail, because I do not want to misplace the another characters, or to put them in a wrong light.\n\nIt seems however, that about one hundred years ago a scheme known as the Grand river navigation project was devised, and was incorporated in 1832. Trustees were employed to enter upon the crown lands, or the lands belonging to the Six Nations Indians, after making compensation. The funds belonging to these Indians were at that time held by trustees. In 1832 the Hon. J. H. Dunn, then Receiver General of Upper Canada, had charge of the public moneys of the then province.\n\nHe was an active exponent of the policy of the company and held the office of president of the Welland Canal Company. The Grand River Navigation Company acted more or less as a subsidiary and was to supply the funds to the Welland canal. By virtue of that arrangement the two companies worked together.\n\nMr. Dunn filled the further position of trustee of the Six Nations Indians. He appears to have had an active part in their money affairs. On April 3, 1834, an order in council was passed stating the Indians ordered that the moneys invested in British funds should be transferred to Canada to be invested in provincial debentures or other government securities. I shall not go into detail regarding the ramifications of the charters or supplementary letters, nor view the various changes in the financial structure, but briefly I would state that they did get a charter from Sir John Colborne, the then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, to assist them in an endeavour to form a company to permit trade in western Ontario via the Grand river. He was successful in getting sufficient interest among men who had money to invest to organize the company.\n\nAs time went on the Buffalo and Goderich line of business was such a change that took place in the transportation, and thus impairing the possibilities of the Grand River Navigation Company. The competition of the railway would also impair the possibilities of the canal. These men found that they were going to be left in a precarious position. For some reason, of which at the present time I am not aware, they wished to withhold their obligations and pledge to Sir John Colborne and, to make a long story short, those who were responsible substituted the Indian funds to purchase stock and put those funds into a precarious investment.\n\nThe association of the Receiver General with the Grand River Navigation Company placed the government in a very difficult position; for it meant that they were investing funds which they held in trust for the Indians in a company in which some of them were personally interested. You will see, Mr. Chairman, that the security of the funds of the Six Nations Indians was thus jeopardized, and the Indians in consequence feel that they have been wronged.\n\nI believe that the result of this scheme of organizing a joint stock company and investing it in their funds which were held in trust for them by the government of the day. Whether the powers of a trust company had been defined at that time or not, it is\nnot lawful, as I understand the matter, for a minister to invest in a joint stock company funds which belong to the Indians.\n\nIt might be said that all this happened one hundred years ago and that we have no obligation today. While there may not be a legal obligation and I cannot speak as to that\u2014undoubtedly there is a moral obligation, and that moral obligation was incurred through the fiduciary from the coffers of the government of the trusteeship of funds which belonged to the Six Nations. I do not say that this was done with dishonest intent; it might have been done with the intention of doing good. The only thing that is unfortunate point is that the money was held in trust for the Indians and the government had no right to invest it in a joint stock company.\n\nMr. CRERAR: When did that happen, may I ask?\n\nMr. WOOD: It happened somewhere around 1834, and thirteen instalment payments on the stock were called for down to August, 1841. About \u00a325,000 had been paid from the Indian funds and the directors of the Bank whose in which the Indians' funds were invested at that particular time. All the interest on these Bank stocks which should have been paid to the Indians each year was absorbed in paying up these instalments on the stock as fast as the instalments were called for. The payment of the Indians' funds began in 1859. I might just quote from the order in council of January 16, 1840:\n\nThe council beg to state, for the information of Your Excellencies, that the trustees of the money of the Six Nations Indians, in the stock of the Grand River Navigation Company, took advantage of an order of St. John's, upon the recommendation of the trustees of the Six Nations.\n\nAnd he was president of the Grand River Navigation Company. I leave the house to deduce the motive. The order in council continues:\n\nTheir Excellencies Sir Francis Head and Sir George Arthur alike objected to the investment, but owing to the assumption of the government by Sir Francis Head the trustees felt the money had been already invested, liable to forfeiture in case the further stock should not be paid in.\n\nThese Indians are advanced. They are conscientious, they are industrious, they take their funds, and I think they are quite within their rights in their demand. I live within two miles of these Indians; I know their habits and the manner in which many of them have advanced, and many of them can take their places among the citizens of this dominion in the various professions and other walks of life. Many of their young women are qualified school teachers, and many of their young boys and girls are attending secondary and high schools in the community.\n\nI am speaking only of the Six Nations Indians because those are the ones I know, and I would urge upon the Department of Indian Affairs the granting to the Indians of more autonomy in keeping with the progress they have made.\n\nI think a great mistake was made when control of their schools was taken away from them. This was a disservice to them. I do not know why the purpose was, but it happened somewhere around 1932. I know it is nauseating to the Indians who are interested in their own schools to have some school board hired from the outside come in and teach their children when they have young lady teachers of their own quite capable of performing those duties. As to the motive why I do not know, but to me it savours of a little bit of politics. There may have been some good friends who wanted certain things done.\n\nI met recently the case of a young Indian just north of Brantford who asked for his enfranchisement. He had received a very good education and then became enfranchised, and by virtue of his enfranchisement he was assuming a position citizenship to all intents and purposes a white man. He was a good Conservative, and he was appointed to an Indian school. He had a splendid son, a brilliant student, who before he got his B.A. degree, and the son was engaged last summer to take one of the other schools. I believe it would be wise for us to give back to the Indians the right to administer their own schools. They do not take kindly to our administration of them. They are honest, industrious citizens, interested in their own welfare, and they do not take kindly to the government's method, particularly just because they happen to be of a certain political complexion, to come in and teach in their schools, particularly when they have people of their own who are qualified to teach in those schools.\n\nIn conclusion, I would ask the Department of Indian Affairs to give serious consideration to the claim of the Six Nations Indians to the sum of $100,000 of their funds that was taken away from them by the action of the Receiver General in a breach of trust. I believe the Indians will be very glad to receive the interest upon that sum, provided they assume greater obligations providing they are granted more autonomy and are given a more important voice in the administration of their own affairs.\nMr. CRERAR: I am afraid that the claim of the Six Nations Indians, a claim that originated over a hundred years ago, to $160,000, with accumulated interest, is one that the government could not possibly meet. I do not know the merits or demerits of the case, but the hon. member for Brant has put forward. Since this question originated 102 years ago or thereabouts, the federal government as we know it today would not be responsible for it.\n\nIf my memory of history is correct, this happened during the time when Upper Canada was still being governed as a crown colony.\n\nThe hon. member spoke to me only a little time ago about this question, but I have not had an opportunity of going into it. I am afraid I cannot hold out any hope that we will meet a claim, which originated over 100 years ago. Six Nations will interest me. I am afraid that a serious consideration of such a proposal would send my colleague, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Dunning) to the hospital.\n\nThere are some 6,000 Indians in the reserve to which my hon. friend refers. From information I have been able to obtain, I understand they have done remarkably well. There is a certain amount of the Indian work, which after all is the act under which matters pertaining to the Indian population of Canada are administered, comes into conflict with the suggestions made by the minister. I cannot pass any critical judgment on his statement. My information is that the majority of the teachers in the schools on the Brant reserve are of Indian origin. My hon. friend shook his head. Perhaps my statement is incorrect, but I understand that at any rate a number of the teachers have been trained from Indians who have been pupils in the years immediately past. It is the general rule that Indians should be made as independent as possible of outside assistance. No one would have greater pleasure than I do the day when the Indians of Canada could attain a position whereby they would be not only self-supporting but able to look after such matters as education and other things as their white brothers do.\n\nMr. CLARK (York-Sunbury): I am very much interested in the Six Nations reserve, and I was pleased to hear the minister sympathetic toward and so willing to investigate the Indian problem. I have known many Indians for many years, and at times I have been ashamed of their treatment by our Indian agents. More attention should be given to the employment of these agents. Only those who have a certain sympathy for the Indian, who would not have a disposition to exploit them, who would desire to help them, should be employed in this capacity. I recall having employed an Indian guide who was a fine type of man, but I found out that his relatives were being treated very unfairly by the Indian agent.\n\nMr. SENN: I listened with considerable interest to what the hon. member for Brant (Mr. Wood) had to say about the funds which were investigated in the Grand River Reserve. I agree with him. A part of this reservation is in my own county and I believe the Indians feel very strongly on the matter. I do not intend to carry this matter any further as the minister has given his answer. I was very interested in the allegation of the hon. member that politics were very much present in the appointment of teachers on the reservations. I have had many interviews with the Indians about this matter myself. Prior to the change which took place in 1852, as described by the hon. gentleman, there was considerable jealousy and quarrelling among the Indians as to who should teach in their schools. At times the appointments were made by the Indian council and it often became a matter of politics within the reservation. From time to time the personnel of the council would change, and teachers would change to suit the opinions of those newly elected. I believe this was one of the reasons why the change was made to the Indian department appointing the teachers.\n\nMr. WERMESINGER: What amount in this year will be used for the construction of dwellings? Will this cover repairs to dwellings and the construction of new buildings? What amount is to be spent in the village of Caughnawaga for this purpose? This village is situated from Quebec on the main highway to the United States by way of Malone and I think it is important that it should present a good appearance. I should like to know what amount is to be spent.\n\nMr. CRERAR: I have not the amount for Caughnawaga. The total amount for dwellings is $19,500, but the hon. member will bear in mind that that covers the whole vote.\n\nMr. BENNETT: The whole of Canada.\n\nMr. CRERAR: The whole of Canada. I am not at the moment in a position to say what portion of the vote will be applied to Caughnawaga.\n\nMr. BENNETT: That would be exclusive of band funds.\nMr. CRERAR: That is exclusive of band funds.\n\nMr. WERMENLINGER: Would that be for new dwellings?\n\nMr. POTTIER: How many Indians are there in Nova Scotia?\n\nMr. CRERAR: Approximately 2,000.\n\nMr. DUPUIS: The hon. member for Verdun spoke of the reserve at Caughnawaga.\n\nMr. LAPOINTE (Quebec East): The hon. member is no longer there.\n\nMr. DUPUIS: No; I was disfranchised by the present administration and forced to move eastward. Nevertheless I take an interest in Caughnawaga and I notice that the leader of the opposition has still a weakness for it, whereas he took his stand there in that reserve which is one of the largest in Quebec, the Indians have a territory of approximately 11,000 acres of good farm land which is practically all cultivated by white people who rent the farms. Very often we have requests from these white people, who are on the reserve with the permission of the Department of Indian Affairs, to investigate complaints they make against the Indians that they are not being well treated. In some instances these white men are barely tolerated on the reserve, and not being able to work they rely on relief. They have not the means of supporting themselves and they are in a peculiar position. Though they live on the reserve, the Department of Indian Affairs is not obliged to make provision for them. The provincial government, under the relief laws, is not bound to support them. They are therefore left without support.\n\nIt is a matter of importance for the department to come to the rescue of these white men in view of the fact that the department itself allows them to live there. A considerable quantity of land there could be abandoned, and I suggest to the government that it would be wise to look into the situation and see whether it would not be better to allow these Indians to sell this very important piece of land and use the proceeds otherwise. It is important inasmuch as it is near so large a centre as Montreal, and the Indians are not inclined to cultivate it. They are rather inclined to establish a hardware works or such employment in connection with the Dominion Bridge Company or other steel works. This is their only occupation, and if the Department of Indian Affairs were allowed to sell this large area the amount derived from its sale could be used for the benefit of the Indians themselves and would assist the department in the administration of the reserve. I make this suggestion to the department in good faith, hoping that they will take action. As the hon. member for Brant stated, the Indians of Caughnawaga generally speaking are likely to attain the same level as the so-called Indians who are living there if they were given more freedom, if they could inspire the government with a little more confidence and were allowed to sell their land on certain terms, within a few years this large area of good land could be disposed of, one farm after another, so that the people in the surrounding district might use it for farming purposes.\n\nMr. BENNETT: How many Indians are there?\n\nMr. DUPUIS: Around 3,800.\n\nMr. CRERAR: Less than that; a little under 3,000.\n\nMr. DUPUIS: As matters stand now, it would cost the Department of Indians Affairs a considerable sum to take care of these Indians properly from the point of view of education and hygiene. For the most part the village is built on rocks, and the construction of a sewer and water system would cost a great deal; the department would have to spend too much. For this reason, indicated by the hon. member for Brant, I investigated the matter; the inhabitants are unable to follow the rules of hygiene, and the doctors themselves say that in Caughnawaga some of the diseases that are prevalent on the reserve are undermining the health of the population. I believe the population of this particular reserve is diminishing, owing to the fact that the present department is unable to give the Indians the legitimate attention they should receive.\n\nIf the government would accept this suggestion and allow the Indians to sell their farms, retaining the proceeds at their disposal, the majority of the Indians would follow the ordinary pursuits of life, while those who preferred to retain their status could be more easily dealt with.\n\nAnother aspect of the question which interests me is hospitalization. If it is as it was when I was member for Laurier-Naperville, then there is no building for their hospital which is far too small for the needs of the reserve. If the department were to spend the amount required for that purpose the cost would be considerable, because I think it would have to erect a new building.\ndo not want to embarrass the minister. I make this suggestion only with the hope that the department will study the necessity of applying this policy. But may I know from the minister how much money has been voted this year for Caledonians, and especially how much is going to be applied for the hospital and for education?\n\nMr. CRERAR: So far as disposing of a part of the reserve for farming purposes to white men is concerned, my suggestion is concerned, it is necessary in all cases to get the approval of the band to the surrender of any of their property. I am not entirely familiar with the difficulties attending such surrender in Quebec, but I understand that the point arises that if a surrender is made it has to be made to the crown.\n\nMr. DUPUIS: I think the provincial government, if the question were treated seriously, could make a decision whether if the land is to be abandoned by the Department of Indian Affairs it would not revert to the crown as regarded by the provincial government, but the Quebec government might make an agreement allowing the Department of Indian Affairs to sell that land. I know this question involved some difficulties which were not solved in the past, but I discussed this matter with the provincial government some years ago, and if my memory serves me aright, I believe a solution of the problem can be found.\n\nMr. CRERAR: The consent of the Indians would be required anyway, in case of that kind. With regard to the other point raised by my hon. friend mentioned, namely, the presence of white people on the reserves, that presents another different problem. It has occasionally happeneded that a white man has married an Indian woman of the reserve. He may die, and then the Indian woman, who has taken the status of a white man, may have children return to the reserve. Under the Indian Act they are no longer Indians, but of course they are living on the Indian reserve, and the province has interfered, has been called upon to intervene with relief when that happens. This is one of the problems that arise perhaps inevitably in the administration of Indian affairs. I shall be very glad to keep in mind the observations made by my hon. friend. I am sorry to say that I am not in a position to state just how far we shall be able to go in meeting his wishes.\n\nMr. SENN: Referring again to the question of money that was invested by the crown some years ago in the Grand River Navigation Company and which belonged to the Sault Ste. Marie Indians, I discussed this matter at one time with a former Minister of the Interior, the Hon. Charles Stewart. He told me at that time that in lieu of this, the government has been granting some ten thousand dollars annually to the maintenance of the roads on this reservation. Is that item of ten thousand dollars included in this item?\n\nMr. CRERAR: I am sorry that at the moment I cannot give a definite answer to Mr. Dupuis's question. My deputy tells me that some special grant has been given to this reserve. Whether or not one is given consideration of a claim which they believe they have against the crown, and to which the hon. member for Brant has referred, I cannot say.\n\nMr. SENN: I should not like the minister to have the impression that I said \"in consideration of this claim\"; the amount was other than as a satisfaction in lieu of the claim itself. I know this money has been expended, and very well expended, on the reservation for the past few years in the building of roads, and that the roads are not nearly completed, and I suggest to the minister that the grant should be continued if possible.\n\nMr. CRERAR: We shall have that under consideration.\n\nMr. LOCKHART: Do I understand the minister to say that compulsory education is definitely established on the Indian reserves as well as in other public school systems in Ontario or the dominion? I did not catch his answer because of interruptions. I am referring to compulsory education.\n\nMr. CRERAR: According to the information I have, it was intended under the Indian Act that educational facilities should be made available to Indian children as far as possible, and that when they were available the Indian children should take advantage of them. In that sense there is a limit to compulsion. But my hon. friend probably knows that in attempting to enforce compulsory education, even in ordinary white communities certain difficulties are encountered. In Indian communities those difficulties are not less; perhaps they are increased.\n\nMr. LOCKHART: Is the adolescent age still applicable to Indian children the same as it is in other communities? The adolescent age is sixteen years.\nMr. TAYLOR (Nanaimo): May I ask whether there is any allocation of that nineteen thousand dollars plus for the building and repair of houses in the Cowichan reserve?\n\nMr. CHERAR: I cannot say at the moment. If the Cowichan reserve deserves some of the appropriation it is probably getting it.\n\nMr. BRADETTE: There are two problems I want to bring to the attention of the house. The first problem is connected with the extension of the Timiskaming and Northern Ontario railway from Cochrane to Moosonee. That has created a new situation.\n\nSome hon. MEMBERS: It is eleven o'clock.\n\nMr. BRADETTE: I was asking the indulgence of the house. But I am satisfied to let the matter go.\n\nProgress reported.\n\nAt eleven o'clock the house adjourned, without question put, pursuant to standing order.\n\nThe following items were passed in committee of supply:\n\nDepartment of External Affairs\nSalaries, including the appointment of L. C. Christie as counsellor at $6,000 per annum, $100,007; contingencies, $69,500.\n\nDepartment of Finance\nSalaries, and to increase the salaries of the Comptroller General, the assistant Deputy Minister of Finance by the sums of $7,000 and $1,500, respectively, in lieu of allowances not yet paid, $842,328.40; contingencies, $39,160.\nInspector General of Banks\u2014Salaries and contingencies, $22,905.\n\nDepartment of the Interior\nExpenses connected with the Dominion observatory at Ottawa, $46,500.\n\nDominion Astrophysical Observatory\nExpenses connected with the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory at Victoria, B.C., $80,000.\nBattlefields Memorials, $84,950.\nTo provide for the book of remembrance of members of Canadian regiments and Canadians in the forces of the British empire who lost their lives in the Great war, $8,000.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 30, 1936.\n\nDR.

He is visiting the island province in the interest of his department.\n\n\"Great progress has been made in recent years in the education of our Indian population, the literature indicates,\" he said. \"Due to the care now given Indian mothers at childbirth and because of the better care given in Indian schools on child welfare, infant mortality was no longer a problem as it had been.\"\n\n\"There are about 19,000 Indian pupils attending the 265 day schools and residential schools,\" Mr. Sutherland said. \"Canada's farthest north Indian school is at Fort Davis. The newest addition to the reservation schools are at Sault Ste. Marie and Fort Chapel. Prince Edward Island Indians were sent to the larger residential schools in New Brunswick, there being no school on the island.\"\nIndian Race Grows Swiftly\n\nHealth of Natives Has Improved Greatly, Superintendent Reports.\n\nSUMMERSIDE, P.E.I., Aug. 6\u2014The Indian race in Prince Edward Island is increasing rapidly, J. D. Sutherland, Ottawa superintendent of Indian Affairs, told the delegates attending the island province in the interest of his department.\n\n\"Great progress has been made in recent years in the education of our aboriginal population,\" the superintendent continued.\n\nDue to the care now given Indian children, the death rate and the number of instruction given at Indian schools and child welfare, infant mortality was considerably lower than it had been.\n\n\"There are about 19,000 Indian pupils attending the 265 day schools and 80 residential schools,\" Mr. Sutherland said.\n\nCanada's farthest North Indian School was at Aklakivik. The newest school buildings were being erected there at Sault Ste. Marie and Fort Chipewyan.\n\nIndians were sent to the residential school in New Brunswick, Mr. Sutherland pointed out.\n\n\"In former years, the death rate was heaviest from birth until seven years. Education and proper care of infants had greatly reduced the rate,\" Mr. Sutherland stated.\n\nSWEDISH CONSUL DIES.\nREFERENCE ESTIMATES DOES DEPARTMENT WISH AGENTS INCLUDE PER CAPITA GRANTS AND SALARIES SCHOOLS AS SAME NOT INDICATED ON FORMS\n\nC C PERRY.\nOttawa, August 31st, 1936.\n\nC.

EQUIPMENT - Purchase - $85,609.76\n2. EQUIPMENT - Maintenance & Repairs - 3,941.96\n3. BUILDINGS and WORKS (New Construction) - 114,620.52\n4. BUILDINGS and WORKS (Repairs and Alterations) - 54,702.17\n5. MATERIAL and SUPPLIES (Classroom texts, Stationery) - 41,968.43\n6. MATERIAL and SUPPLIES (Fuel, Janitors' and cleaning supplies & Midday Meals) - 22,159.05\n\n1. EQUIPMENT - Purchase:\n\nThis consists of Beds and Bedding; Kitchen and Dining Room, Laundry, Bakery, Cold Storage Lighting Plants; Stationary Engines; Classroom Desks; Farm Machinery and Stock; and various miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWhen a new residential school building is completed, the Architect decides what furnishings are to be supplied. For the greater part of this equipment, the purchase is made through the Purchasing Branch of the Department.\n\nRegarding renewals of equipment, the greater part is purchased locally, by the Indian Agents, who receive authority through the Schools Branch. The Agents are furnished with the names of the firms from whom to\nwhom to obtain quotations. In some cases, they are instructed to make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price, and, in other cases, where the purchase involves considerable money, they are required to submit the quotations to the Department and receive authority before placing the order. The Purchasing Agent arranges certain purchases renewing equipment, such as laundry machines, fire fighting appliances, engines and batteries for lighting plants. I would consider the amount of purchases in renewing equipment is made, approximately, one-third by the Purchasing Agent, at the request of the Schools Branch, and two-thirds by the Agents, locally, also upon instructions of the Schools Branch.\n\n2. EQUIPMENT (Maintenance and Repairs):\n\nThe Schools Branch carry out all correspondence and arrange for the maintenance and repair of all equipment.\n\n3. BUILDINGS and WORKS (New Construction):\n\nWhen it has been decided to erect a new residential or day school building or teacher's residence and the funds have been provided, all action being taken by the Schools Branch, the actual erection of the buildings, the preparation of the plans and awarding the contract are carried out through the office of the Architect of the Department, who supervises all this work, and, after the building is completed, the officers of the Schools Branch are responsible for its future maintenance and management.\n\n4. BUILDINGS and WORKS (Repairs and Alterations)\n\nAll minor repairs and alterations are carried out by the Schools Branch, who give the necessary instructions to the local Indian Agents.\n\nMajor repairs and alterations to buildings, repairs to water systems and sewage disposal systems are handled by the Architect. However, the greater part of all repairs is carried out directly through the Schools Branch.\n\n5. MATERIALS and SUPPLIES (Classroom Texts, Stationery, etc.)\n\nAll text books, library books, stationery, etc., are ordered, upon requisition, through the\n\n- Government\nGovernment Stationery Office. The Schools Branch informs the Stationery Office of the number of the various textbooks, scribblers, exercise books, pencils and other classroom equipment that will likely be required. The Stationery Office then stocks the equipment. When the teachers requisition for supplies, an order is forwarded to the Government Stationery Office, who send the classroom equipment required to the teachers and render accounts to the Department for the cost. There is considerable correspondence involved by the Schools Branch in the selection of textbooks and other classroom supplies. All work in connection with the supplying of classroom equipment is carried out by the Schools Branch.\n\n6. MATERIAL and SUPPLIES (Fuel, Janitors' and Cleaning Supplies & Midday Meals)\n\nThe purchase of Biscuits for midday meals, to the amount of approximately $6,500.00, is made by the Purchasing Branch.\n\nAll other purchases under this heading and the large correspondence in connection therewith is handled through the Schools Branch.\n915 8th Ave., E.,\nSaskatoon, Sask.,\nFeb. 18, 1927.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly give me information about the schools for Indians in Sask.?

C. Atkinson, Esq.,\nVice-President,\nGeneral Films Limited,\n1924 Ross Street,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nI have borrowed from the University of B.C. here a carefully prepared thesis or paper by one of the students in arts, Stanley Bailey by name and I am sending it for your perusal. If you think well enough to look over it, Mr. Popping is so pleased with it that he is placing it in the University library but he is trusting it to me so that I may send it to Ottawa and Toronto for information of some work which is being done voluntarily.\n\nStanley taught the Senior Classroom at Thompson B.C. while Mr. Jones was there and then went to Ontario. He is now working his way through University and he will take his Theological work for ordination. He will then offer himself for the work of Principal of a Residential School under the care of the United Church of Canada. I am sure he is the stuff of which a good line Principal is made. Please review it and not later than the 20th June send by insured or registered mail to Rev. R.B. Cochranne, 299 Queen Street West, informing me when it is mailed to him. I will write him of the plan. I hope you are all well. Do often think of you all. Please remember me to any inquiring friends.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArthur Barner\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\n\nWe have received your memo. dated the 17th May, 1937, in which you state that you would like to include in the Annual Report for the fiscal year 1936-37 comparative relief cost for the past ten years, and in which you request that a statement be supplied by this Branch for this purpose.\n\nWe would point out that figures are not readily available from the records for the past ten years; however, we have been able to secure figures for the past eight fiscal years, and we trust that these will serve your purpose. They will be found hereunder.\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount     |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 1929-30     | $711,523   |\n| 1930-31     | 823,343    |\n| 1931-32     | 988,340    |\n| 1932-33     | 935,734    |\n| 1933-34     | 883,362    |\n| 1934-35     | 845,428    |\n| 1935-36     | 995,162    |\n| 1936-37     | 983,537    |\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nADW/S\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nThe Welfare and Training division is one of the three new administrative units for which provision has been made in the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe reorganization of the Department was completed and the personnel of the staff announced on December first, 1936.\n\nIt is recognized, in the creation of this division, that a worthwhile welfare programme must be basically educational in character; that education is not something injected into a child during his sojourn at school but a process that should continue throughout life. It is difficult to think of educational effort in a realistic sense, in terms other than those which emphasize the welfare and progress of the entire Indian population. The activities of the division, therefore, are interdependent and complementary, directed toward clearly defined objectives. These objectives, for a generation or two at least, will be the training of pupils to make the most of their available resources, with talents consecrated to the service of the bands to which they belong, and an adult Indian population proud of their racial origin and cultural heritage, adjusted to modern life, progressive, resourceful and self-supporting.\n\nThe Welfare programme organized toward the end of the fiscal year consists in the main of the creation and cultivation of subsistence gardens and the extension of agricultural operations; the purchase of livestock and equipment; encouragement of arts and crafts and sale of handicraft products; the survey and development of territory suitable for the propagation of muskrats and other furbearing animals; purchase of traplines and leasing of timber limits, housing construction, administration of relief and the care of the aged and physically incapacitated.\n\nIt is estimated that during the year one-third of the Indian population were dependent, in whole or in part, on relief allowances. It is apparent, therefore, that we are confronted with the spectacle of vast natural resources awaiting legitimate exploitation, on the one hand, and an impoverished Indian population on the other.\n\nThe Indians of Canada have suffered acutely in recent years; unemployment, drought in agricultural areas, inadequate returns from steadily diminishing fur and game resources have contributed to the demoralization and disintegration of their economic and social life. Relief allowances are, at best, a palliative. Direct relief, unless wisely administered, tends increasingly to destroy initiative and to rob the recipient of that wholesome sense of satisfaction that ever follows the accomplishment of a worthwhile task.\n\nThe present Welfare programme is designed to encourage the Indian to support and sustain himself. It is sufficiently comprehensive, when supported with the parliamentary appropriations necessary, to enable him, whether he be farmer, trapper or fisherman, to obtain and utilize the tools necessary to sustain himself and those dependent upon him.\nA summary of Indian welfare expenditure during the last eight year period follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount   |\n|-------------|----------|\n| 1929-30     | $711,523 |\n| 1930-31     | 823,343  |\n| 1931-32     | 988,340  |\n| 1932-33     | 935,734  |\n| 1933-34     | 853,362  |\n| 1934-35     | 846,428  |\n| 1935-36     | 895,162  |\n| 1936-37     | 963,637  |\n\nTRAINING:\n\nAll Indian day and residential schools, with the exception of two residential schools destroyed by fire, were open and in operation throughout the year. New Indian day schools were built at Christian Island, Ont., Seine River, Ont., and Kitselas, B. C.\n\nA table of pupil enrolment and attendance follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1927-28     | 6,795     | 6,043         | 8,223    | 4,823              | 15,018    | 10,866           | 72.35                |\n| 1928-29     | 7,075     | 6,282         | 8,272    | 4,976              | 15,347    | 11,258           | 73.35                |\n| 1929-30     | 7,302     | 6,476         | 8,441    | 5,103              | 15,743    | 11,579           | 73.85                |\n| 1930-31     | 7,831     | 6,917         | 8,584    | 5,314              | 16,415    | 12,231           | 74.61                |\n| 1931-32     | 8,213     | 7,400         | 8,950    | 5,707              | 17,163    | 13,107           | 76.36                |\n| 1932-33     | 8,465     | 7,813         | 8,960    | 5,874              | 17,425    | 13,478           | 77.40                |\n| 1933-34     | 8,596     | 7,760         | 8,862    | 5,892              | 17,448    | 13,362           | 76.52                |\n| 1934-35     | 8,709     | 7,882         | 8,851    | 5,860              | 17,560    | 13,442           | 76.64                |\n| 1935-36     | 8,906     | 8,061         | 9,127    | 5,788              | 18,033    | 13,849           | 76.79                |\n| 1936-37     | 9,040     | 8,176         | 9,287    | 5,790              | 18,297    | 13,966           | 76.34                |\n\nAn attempt has been made during the year to bring the educational policy of the Department into closer conformity with the actual life needs of Indian children. Steadily increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of manual training. Material has been supplied, in an attempt to encourage gardening and carpentry work among boys, and dressmaking, crochet work and elementary domestic science among girls. Plans have been prepared for the construction of day schools, equipped to provide an educational programme designed to meet the needs peculiar to the reserves on which such schools are established. It is not too much to hope that these schools will become the focal points in community life - centres to which children and adults will turn for guidance, instruction and inspiration.\n\nAn encouraging feature of educational effort during the year was discovered in the multiplying demands for\nagricultural and homemaking short courses and in the tendency\nand willingness of the Indians to recognize the value and\ndistinctiveness of their arts and crafts. Consideration has\nbeen given to ways and means whereby the Indian population\nmight be encouraged to still further conserve their ancient\nvalues and skills and thus contribute to the cultural life\nof the nation.\n\nThe expenditure for Indian education for the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 1937, amounted to $1,820,977.80\nand is analyzed in the following table:\n| Province          | DAY SCHOOLS | RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS | STATIONERY | ASSISTANCE TO EX-PUPILS | MISCELLANEOUS | TOTAL       |\n|------------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Prince Edward Island | $1,006.41   | $76.77             | $799.34    | $1,882.52              |               | $1,882.52   |\n| Nova Scotia      | $10,098.86  | $29,381.49         | $795.48    | $756.83                |               | $40,943.66  |\n| New Brunswick    | $15,211.79  | $551.77            | $823.03    | $842.67                |               | $17,439.26  |\n| Quebec           | $54,540.59  | $6,676.38          | $2,597.51  | $5,668.09              | $40           | $69,482.97  |\n| Ontario          | $105,974.89 | $242,287.63        | $10,238.89 | $12,323.61             | $176.33       | $370,401.35 |\n| Manitoba         | $51,003.77  | $161,084.36        | $4,672.67  | $1,357.19              | $168.22       | $218,296.20 |\n| Saskatchewan     | $31,786.00  | $291,487.98        | $5,372.24  | $2,102.66              | $111.80       | $330,810.77 |\n| Alberta          | $1,863.21   | $306,087.42        | $4,661.45  | $1,848.41              | $164.46       | $316,615.95 |\n| British Columbia | $59,380.71  | $323,901.46        | $9,389.39  | $769.77                | $3,639.82     | $396,481.15 |\n| Yukon            | $2,998.26   | $16,100.87         | $540.79    |                       |               | $19,639.91  |\n| Northwest Territories | $1,579.56  | $36,285.61         | $1,128.90  |                       |               | $38,994.06  |\n|                   | $334,706.12 | $1,414,703.20      | $40,026.86 | $26,449.92             | $5,083.70     | $1,820,977.80 |\n\n*Poor copy*\nMoyer School Supplies Limited\n\n\"Canada's School Furnishers\"\n\u2014Since 1884\u2014\n\n106-108 York Street,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nAugust 26th, 1937\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWill it be possible to obtain a revised list of the Indian Residential and Day Schools in Canada, with names and addresses of their respective principals.\n\nA reply at your earliest convenience will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMOYER SCHOOL SUPPLIES LIMITED.\n\nGeneral Manager.\n\nGES/MMc.\n77 Charles St West\nOttawa, Ont.\nDec 2/37\n\nThe Dept of Indians\nOttawa but\nattention our ferrier\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am asked to\nspeak to the Indians at\nCulverville Ont.

S. - Sorry, I have not found it possible to secure a map of Ontario showing Indian reserves.\nSuperintendent-General of\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of Justice, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few years ago you generously supplied me with documentary material giving information regarding the relations of the Dominion Government to the education of the Indians. It was to be included in a larger volume planned from the documents now to be included in a larger study I have been working on since 1882. Details of actions since 1883 culminating in \"total government control\" since October, 1885 have held the completion of the study. I am now contemplating and hoping to bring the material I have up to date and get it ready for publication. I would appreciate deeply any courtesy you may be able to extend to me in securing needed data as heretofore indicated.\n\nI am an historical student engaged by your office in 1887. I believe my documents are in my office at the University of Toronto. The statement is made from the Department and in Upper Canada about 40 schools for the education of Indians existed of which number only two \"appear to have received aid from the Government.\" My question is can you give me the name and location and denominational connection of these two schools?\n\n2. According to the Census of Canada (1886) chapter 54, section 93, sub-section (a) was the basis for an Order-in-Council passed in August, 1883 which provided the north-west quarter of section 16, Township 44, range 2, west of the Meridian, for the support of Indian education. My questions are:\n\n(a) To date (1887) how many acres of land have been thus reserved?\n(b) What is the amount of the fund (1887) that has accrued from such reservations? Is it built up and invested with such interest being expended?\n(c) How is the fund invested? How appropriated for current use?\n\n3. According to 17-30 Vict., c. 22, s. 15 (1867) the Governor-in-Council was authorized to establish industrial or training schools for Indians. I assume this measure directly provided and administered by the government has distinguished from declaring, adopting and aiding such schools provided by the churches. Am I right in this assumption?\n\n4. Would it be possible for me to obtain a correct table giving a list of all the Indian schools, affirmed or established, if possible, named date to locate the name and location of each, if approved its denominational connection, if under the government only or independent, and the enrollment for 1887 or 1886.\n\n5. Attached appendage may afford a plan from information with the amount of money made available for the education of the Indians since 1820. The effect is not conceived. What should be a table showing (a) total number of Indians according to the census applicable to those years (b) estimates of number of children eligible for the benefits of the program for their education and (c) the amount of money actually spent by the Government each year for this unit of its service.\n\n(Signed)\n\nGladstone Hotel,\n620 N.

May I make the following inquiries:\n\n1. In accordance with the provisions of sub-section (a) of section 90 of \"The Dominion Lands Act\" (1872) an Order in Council was passed in September of 1873 providing for the support of Indian schools at certain points of Section 16, Township 44, Range 2, west of the third meridian.\n\nHas this Order in Council been made effective? How many acres of land has thus far been made available for the support of Indian schools? What has been the income that has come from such reserved lands each year since the inception of the plan up to and including 1881?\n\n2. Section II of 17-58 Vict., c. 32, s. 11 (1874) added section 128 to the Indian Act in which the Governor-in-Council was authorized to establish residential industrial schools\u2014as I understand\u2014distinctly from the reserve schools provided by the churches and would be maintained by the Government. Could you give me the names and locations of the first school established under this provision? Would it be possible to let me have a list of the residential industrial schools for Indians founded under this provision and wholly supported by the Government and those that are known as branch schools under the Government?\n\nAny comments you may be able to extend to me on subjects of this import will be deeply appreciated.\n\nI am sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. You may have an old friend corresponding between us. I am the Jane E.

On pages 58 to 60, inclusive, you will find the names and addresses of the Indian residential schools at present in operation.\n\nAt all the residential schools mentioned in our report, the Department allows a per capita grant for each pupil whose admission is approved.

This table would enable me\nto show clearly the financial aspect of the relationship between the Government and the\nstudents with respect to the residential schools. Am I right in my understanding\nthat the Government pays for all capital and all current expenditures for the day schools?\nIs the five cents grant for each pupil to which you refer an IP of your letter\nsupposed to cover tutoring only or all current expenditures of the residential school amounts?\n\nI feel sure you will understand my desire to clarify for myself\nthe financial aspect of the picture.\n\nI am sure you will understand when I say grateful I am to be you\nif you can let me have a complete table of the kind indicated above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames B.

Davidson, Inspector of Schools at Balcarres, Sask., saying that he is writing to you in connection with information for a study of Indian education in Canada.\n\nYou probably have a number of requests of this kind, and unless you know the persons making the requests, it must be difficult to distinguish those that are worth taking seriously. It is for this reason I write to tell you that I have met Mr. Davidson on several occasions in the last few years, and have talked with him at length about the selection of a topic for his doctoral thesis. It was really at my suggestion that he decided two years ago to explore the possibility of writing the story of Indian education in Canada. I suggested it to him by reason of the fact that the lack of a comprehensive record of the education of the native population has always seemed to me a shortcoming in Canadian educational documentation.\n\nDuring the last two years Mr. Davidson has studied a good number of volumes on native education in other countries to give him a background against which to view the work in Canada, but you would need to have no fear of him using the privileges you might extend to him to develop earning criticism. He is not that kind of person.\n\nMoreover, he is not interested in rushing off a piece of work in a few months just to meet thesis require-\nments. What he would like in order to make a job of it, I believe, would be to have permission to work in Ottawa for a summer or two in collaboration with your Department, where he might have the guidance of your officials and access to such records as would be useful in presenting the story of Indian education as a connected whole, over the years.\n\nIf you could see your way clear to help him to this end, I am sure the result would make for a more general and more intelligent interest in the education of the Indian people.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief, Education Branch.\n\nJER/LS\nOttawa, March 2, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Robbins:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you intimate that Mr. R.

If Mr. Davidson can make arrangements to visit Ottawa at any time during the summer months, I shall be glad to secure for him all the information we have at our disposal here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Since your letter arrived I have been able to secure some material on the history of one of the churches on its work in this field and am taking steps to obtain similar information from other churches.\n\nAt present it is not possible to state just when I will be able to visit Ottawa but hope it will be at a not too distant date.\n\nThanking you very much for your kindness,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

In a letter dated December 23, 1937 Mr. R. A. Henry, Chief of Welfare and Training gave me additional information, etc., I have indicated on my letter. I have been working on a study of the Education of the Indians and Government & Education in Canada. It is now practically completed. A copy of the chapter on the Education of the Indians is enclosed herewith. May I request you sending at your earliest convenience and that of Mr. Henry to make the suggestions indicated on page 13 of the manuscript.\n\nIf I remember correctly - I do not have any other file here - you included in your letter that you would be willing to work on your manuscript when it was completed. Any further you and Mr. Henry may extend to me in this way will be highly appreciated. I assume such action on your part would be most helpful.\n\nThe other chapters in the study have the following titles. They are on the one entitled the emphasis on an Autonomy.\n\nLand Rights on the basis of Canadian Constitutional and Federal Doctrine\nHigher Education\nVocational Education\nWomen of Status\nNational Defence and Education\n\nWhen I last wrote to Mr. Henry I was at the Hotel Royal York and Toronto, but, although there has been no change in charges, the long delay in the completion of the study (not to mention the fact that I have been for the past three years a man of total financial insecurity) has appeared that I shall be able to return to my work at the University of Pennsylvania next September for half time service. I have written about education in Canada before being the author of \"Social Work in Canada,\" that Organization Administration and Supervision, published in 1933.\n\nWith best wishes and good wishes for all concerns extended,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Limited,\n533-535 College Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\n\nREGINA, SASK., July 4, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that on Monday, June 20th, I had a conference with Bishop Burd and Archdeacon Paul at Prince Albert, with regard to school affairs.\n\nIn our conversation we covered selection of teachers; religious instruction for the schools; extension of the work into the homes through using married men as teachers, having their wives teach sewing, knitting, etc., to the children, and organize the women of the Reserves into Homemakers' Clubs or similar organizations; and the necessity of closer co-operation between all engaged in Indian work.\n\nDuring our conversation I asked the Bishop how we could overcome the objection of the Roman Catholics to sending their children to lay schools under Church of England auspices. He suggested that the Priest be allowed to use the school during certain hours for giving his children religious instruction, and that all the children who did not wish to attend be allowed to retire. I asked him if he did not think it would be better to make the teacher strictly responsible to see that when religious instruction was being given the children by a clergyman of any denomination, the children of the other denomination be required to leave the room, in this way removing suspicion of the school being used for the purpose of inducing the children to change from one denomination to another. The Bishop replied that he saw my point and agreed.\n\nHe asked what my stand was on the employment of clergymen as teachers. I replied that I could see no objection to it, provided they possessed the necessary qualifications, on Reserves where the Indians were all of one denomination, but that I thought it would be a great mistake to employ them on the Reserves where the Indians were mixed Roman Catholics and Protestants, as there would be an objection on the part of the people of both churches to sending their children to be educated under a clergyman of another denomination. He replied that this could be taken care of.\n\nHe also asked .......\nHe also asked my stand on the selection of teachers. My reply was that, as we were in accord on the policy that should be followed as to the qualifications the teachers should possess, I could not see that any benefit would be derived by making any change in the present procedure.\n\nThe Indian teachers and workers of the Prince Albert Diocese will meet in Prince Albert some time in August, and the Bishop has asked me to be present at this meeting. This I will arrange to do.\n\nI was well pleased with the conference, and feel that we can work together without any friction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Residential Schools are now equipped to provide worth while instruction in agriculture, gardening, carpentry work, boat building, tailoring, dressmaking, cooking, hand loom weaving and physical culture. These studies are combined with the regular courses of study supplied by the Provincial Departments of Education. In the cases of Indian pupils, however, and particularly those pupils who intend to establish themselves on Reserves, the tendency at present is to provide a practical course of study with less emphasis on academic subjects.\n\nThe one-room, ungraded rural school is, in most cases, a poorly equipped educational unit. In the absence of basement accommodation it is almost impossible to promote a programme of vocational instruction. It is the policy of the\nDepartment, however, to provide basement accommodation suitable for vocational instruction at all Day Schools constructed in the future. The fact that there are difficulties to be overcome in the case of the older schools does not mean that at these schools vocational instruction is wholly neglected. Indian Day School teachers frequently, at their own request, are supplied regularly with dressmaking material, yarn, tools for gardening, garden seeds and lumber for wood working projects. The fact that requests for these supplies have been multiplying during the year is an indication of one of the most encouraging tendencies in educational effort among our Indian population.\n\nWELFARE\n\nA special welfare programme was organized by the officials of the Welfare Division early in the year. This programme was designed to re-establish Indians, and particularly Indians in receipt of relief allowances, on a self-supporting basis.\n\nThe sum of $150,000.00 was set apart from the regular Welfare appropriation voted by Parliament for the promotion of projects and the purchase of supplies. An attempt was made by the field officials to give particular attention to Reserves where unemployment was most in evidence and where relief expenditures appeared to be increasing. The most urgent needs of the Indian population on each Reserve determined almost wholly the scope and details of the programme. Under the direction and supervision of Indian Inspectors and Agents live stock, farm machinery and tractors were purchased and supplied to Indians. A number of the unemployed were engaged in cutting pulp wood, cleaning land, boat building and in the construction of root houses.\n\nTwelve tractors were purchased during the year. These tractors remain the property of the Department but are placed at the disposal of Indian Bands and are operated under the personal supervision of our farm instructors.\n\nA number of surveys have been undertaken and completed in the northern regions of the Prairie Provinces with the object of securing from the Provincial Governments areas of land suitable for the propagation of muskrat and other fur-bearing animals. An area has been secured from the Government of Quebec which will enable the Department to proceed with the development of an area suitable for beaver in the territory lying south and east of James Bay.\n\nIt is gratifying to state that despite the crop failure of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta the results of the special programme have been satisfactory and\nencouraging. It must be borne in mind, however, that the rehabilitation of the Indian population calls for the exercise of patience and perseverance and is a process that cannot be unduly hurried. It is significant that the majority of young Indians are at this time anxious to establish themselves on Reserves. It is the policy of the Department to encourage this tendency and to make life on the Reserves as attractive and as satisfying as it is possible to make it.\n\nR. A.

They are inheritors of a tradition which is perpetuated not only in formal \"treaties\" but in memory also. The King was the Great Father of the Indians who was friendly and benevolent towards them; they could look for justice, who was the source and guardian of their charter of rights and privileges.\n\nThis tradition will stir the minds of the Iroquois to recall the eighteenth century, when they were allies of the Crown, a sovereign people in their own country. The Six Nations, the Iroquois Confederacy, were then, as they are now, the exponents of all that is admirable in the Indian character, and there are a few who still think of alliance with the white relations. But only a few; it took the stern realities of the Revolutionary war and all the struggles to establish themselves as themselves on the Grand River to make them realize that they were subjects of the Great Father and no longer partners in sovereignty. The idea of a race stronger than their own tribal laws prevailed and spread abroad wherever contact was made with aborigines, and we can quote the words of a princess of the Iroquois in 1876: \"Have compassion on the manner in which I was brought up; long ago it was good that I was first made. I wish the same were but again. But now the law has come and in that I wish to walk.\"\n\nAny estimate of the population of the territories included in the Dominion of Canada when the white man first explored the country is conjectural, but the most trustworthy places the number at 220,000. The census returns of the present gives us a total of 144,000.\n\nCOLONIAL PRECEDENT\n\nThe vicissitudes of the race in the intervening years have been so many and so severe that its preservation is a tribute to its strength. Maladjustment between aboriginal and civilized customs, disease among them, and the burdens of modern life have all taken toll. But it can now be reasonably asserted that the Indians of Canada will not perish through years of gradual decay and loss of characteristic stamina. That assertion may be supported by a survey of the policy of the Dominion Government, adopted from British Colonial precedents, which stresses the education of the Indian, his protection while in a state of tutelage, and which educates him and assists missionary endeavor and experiment both in education and christianization.\n\nEvery thread of that policy and the spirit of the Royal Proclamation Statute, which established the legal status of the Indians point to that end. It was wise and just of the British North America Act which gave to the Dominion the power to legislate for Indians; this ensured a uniform administration. Decision was thus made and there is disposed of doubt as to the legal status of any individual and Indian Reserve lands were protected from the pressure of encroaching settlers.\n\nThe Indian Reserve is in fact the foundation of Indian policy. The special areas set apart by agreement between the Crown and the Indians are almost always without the consent of both parties. While enjoying freedom to go and come, to acquire property elsewhere and to use all his faculties in a larger life, the Reserve has given the Indians a needed sense of security.\n\nIn the older Provinces, after more than a century and a half, the results of the policy are evident. In Ontario and Quebec, the native type of the Indian unit and of the individual life is worthy of comment. We find reserves developed into towns and villages, flourishing village communities; and everywhere we find individuals actively engaged in our cities and towns. They enter the professions; teach in both the best Indian schools, fill clerical positions in the public service and in business; they are employed in the mines, in the factories, bridges and buildings where steel is used; they are valued as domestic servants, and, in fact, are to be discovered in every walk of life.\n\nTHE FINAL CHANGE\n\nThe word \"discovered\" is used advisedly, for these Indians speak English or French fluently and often can hardly be distinguished by physical characteristics from their fellow-Canadians. They are imitative and quick to adapt themselves to modern conditions. They own electric cars, automobiles, and agricultural and domestic machinery; and the telephone, the radio, and the gramophone are in common use. This is not complete degeneration from the higher standard, but it is well maintained and at the lowest level the Indian does not fall below the white.\nSeveral of these Indian communities and many individuals are now ready for the full responsibilities of citizenship. The Indian Act has been a great social change; numbers have given up their Indian status; many more are deterred by the conviction that government guardianship is positive harm.\n\nWhen we look to the west, to the Prairie Provinces where the relationship has existed for only about 35 years, we find different and discouraging conditions. The Indians east of the Great Lakes never had to face such a major catastrophe as disappearance of the buffalo, and the Government never had to provide suddenly for them a food supply and a method of livelihood.\n\nBut in the west these problems confronted the parties and had to be solved quickly. The Government provided rations and the Indians had to become accustomed to an abundant food flow. Instruction in farming and ranching was introduced and lavishly supported, and the Indians, whose physique and habits were not fitted for this work, had to become mired to novel hardships. But the result has been, upon the whole, a success which can be measured by millions of bushels of grain saved from the prairies, and thousands of cattle marketed or consumed by the Indians.\n\nThe natives of British Columbia are, anthropologically, the most interesting of the Dominion Indians. They are a mountain and sea people, and in their primitive state possessed the vigorous qualities which come from these environments. They have deteriorated now and are fighting what may be a losing battle with our civilization, which has none of its degrading features has treated them cruelly. It is beyond the scope of this article to deal with the subtle characteristics of the social systems of the Northern tribes or to set forth the mastery with which they put their natural gifts to practical use, or to dwell upon their desire for something beyond the practical which resulted in unique carving and ornamentation by pigment or by other means upon even the most humble of their utensils.\n\nVery little can be recorded of progress among the mining and fishing Indians that large attention is being given the market with furs. Their children are in boarding schools and medical attendance and hospitals are freely provided, but they are subject to all the vicissitudes of the chase and to the competition of white hunters. Progress under these conditions is inevitable, but the outlook for native outlook is encouraging and sympathetic and the effort to add a permanent supply of buffalo meat to the native food stocks is one of the most interesting of later developments.\n\nAn educational system covers all the provinces and has the assistance of the religious denominations interested in the christianization of the Indians. The work of day and boarding schools is carried on in modern, well-equipped buildings by qualified teachers. Results in the Eastern Provinces are gratifying and allowing for inherent difficulties, the degree of success is noticeable among Indians whose forebears were nomadic.\n\nA highly proficient professional medical service has been developed and proven methods for the prevention and cure of tuberculosis are generally applied and trachoma is being controlled. The instruction of prospective mothers and care of children in their first days and years has resulted in the decrease of infant mortality. Many well-equipped hospitals have been established on reserves and a determined effort is being made to save the race by scientific methods adapted to the special needs of the Indians.\n\nThe review will not have failed to give an impression of native tribes surviving with a reasonable hope of permanence and with the destiny of the race not as a distinct race but through a process of neglect and decay, but by gradual increase of capacity for civilized life and by merging with the population of the Dominion.\nfrom THE TIMES, London, England,\nMay 15, 1939.\n\nTHE FIRST PEOPLE\n\nSurvival of Indian Life\n\nHail To \"Great Father\"\n\n\u2014by Duncan Campbell Scott, C.M.G., Litt.D.\n\nThe original Canadians, the Indians, will contribute a special quality to the general welcome accorded their Majesties.

The need of the Indian pupil for this form of instruction is even greater than that of the white pupil. Labour opportunities for him during the years that lie immediately ahead must follow relatively simple lines, such as farming, stock-raising, logging, fishing and hunting and trapping. (The opportunities existing at present for Indians to enter the professions are in no sense encouraging.)\n\nAn attempt has been made during the year to encourage a number of pupils who would ordinarily proceed with high school studies to take up vocational courses such as the diploma courses in agriculture and courses in auto mechanics and domestic science.\n\nIn addition to the regular vocational courses, for which provision has now been made at practically all day and residential schools, special courses have been organized, largely by way of experiment, at a number of Indian schools. At Caughnawaga, classes in hand-loom weaving have been organized. The girls engaged in this project have been successful in producing hand-loom woven ties, scarves and shopping bags. There appears to be a steadily increasing market for these...\nproducts. At the Qu'Appelle Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan, and at the Morley School, Alberta, two mink farms have been established. There has been a feeling for some time on the part of residential school principals that the care and feeding of fur-bearing animals should form part of the training provided at Indian schools. At the Brandon Residential school a group of students, under the direction of the Principal, are engaged in a bee-keeping experiment. This experiment is likely to provide practical training for the boys and an adequate supply of honey for the institution.\n\nAt the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ontario, the pupils have responded enthusiastically to the wrought metal projects which have formed part of their studies during the year.\n\n| Indian Education - Expenditure for Year 1938-39 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Day Schools | Residential Schools | General | Total |\n| Nova Scotia | 9,618.73 | 28,132.76 | - | 37,951.49 |\n| Prince Edward Isld. | 882.26 | - | - | 882.26 |\n| New Brunswick | 16,926.97 | - | - | 16,926.97 |\n| Quebec | 56,927.85 | 7,471.37 | - | 64,399.22 |\n| Ontario | 106,571.85 | 256,301.65 | - | 362,873.50 |\n| Manitoba | 60,471.60 | 159,834.18 | - | 220,305.78 |\n| Saskatchewan | 37,612.79 | 272,308.79 | - | 310,121.58 |\n| Alberta | 1,802.51 | 307,941.02 | - | 309,743.53 |\n| British Columbia | 69,501.52 | 312,575.27 | - | 382,076.79 |\n| Northwest Territories | 1,576.08 | 36,416.50 | - | 37,992.58 |\n| Yukon | 2,801.70 | 18,014.43 | - | 20,816.13 |\n| Assistance to Ex-pupils | - | - | 1,672.92 | 1,672.92 |\n| Freight and Express | - | - | 55.98 | 55.98 |\n| Salaries and Travel | - | - | 15,751.89 | 15,751.89 |\n| Stationery | - | - | 38,084.65 | 38,084.65 |\n| Tuition | - | - | 96,416.65 | 96,416.65 |\n| Miscellaneous | - | - | 122.02 | 122.02 |\n\nTotal: 364,402.56 1,339,646.97 82,104.11 1,846,153.64\nWELFARE\n\nLast year legislation making provision for the establishment of a revolving fund was passed by Parliament. Bands or groups of Indians can, by assuming collective responsibility, secure loans from this fund for the purchase of farm machinery, live stock, etc. Loans secured from this fund, which cannot exceed the sum of $100,000 per annum, are repayable over a five-year period. Seventeen applications from groups of Indians were approved during the year, involving advances amounting to $35,528. With the single exception of the Abenakis band, the members of which secured a loan for a basketry project, these loans are being used for the clearing of land and the purchase of farm equipment. Thirteen fully equipped community farms, supplied with equipment in whole or in part from this fund, are now in operation in the prairie provinces.\n\nAgricultural returns from Indian reserves, with one or two exceptions, have been more encouraging than they have been at any time in recent years. This is particularly true of returns from the prairie provinces, where a number of reserves were supplied with farm machinery, live stock, etc., from the welfare vote of last year. It is encouraging to note that there was a reduction in relief costs immediately following the harvest season. On the Blood Reserve, in southern Alberta, with a population of 1,300 Indians, the grain threshed this year amounted to 255,000 bushels. The community farm on the Cote reserve, Pelly, Saskatchewan, with an Indian population of 354, one of the first farms of its kind organized under the welfare programme last year, produced 11,000 bushels of grain and 2,300 bushels of potatoes.\n\nThe following is a statement of welfare expenditures, by provinces, for the years 1937-38 and 1938-39, showing the increase or decrease in each case:\n\n| Province          | 1936-39   | 1937-38   | Increase | Decrease |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Nova Scotia       | 78,241.88 | 73,197.71 | -        | 956.45   |\n| Prince Edward Island | 8,347.68 | 9,008.78 | -        | 661.15   |\n| New Brunswick     | 61,502.29 | 67,887.72 | 6,385.43 | -        |\n| Quebec            | 206,092.56 | 209,168.45 | -        | 3,075.89 |\n| Ontario           | 145,529.93 | 169,096.00 | 4,466.07 | -        |\n| Manitoba          | 114,396.71 | 125,911.66 | -        | 11,514.95|\n| Saskatchewan      | 103,924.41 | 129,308.98 | -        | 25,384.57|\n| Alberta           | 90,998.16 | 132,890.36 | -        | 41,892.20|\n| British Columbia  | 102,350.72 | 115,398.45 | -        | 10,047.73|\n| Northwest Territories | 26,781.45 | 26,898.30 | -        | 116.85   |\n| Yukon             | 9,907.02  | 10,040.18 | -        | 133.16   |\n| Triennial Clothing | 1,717.28  | 4,174.34  | -        | 2,457.06 |\n| Miscellaneous     | 31,432.27 | 14,886.62 | 16,545.65 | -        |\n\nNet Decrease: 76,548.88\n\nCompared with 1937-38: 70,732.01\nHANDICRAFT\n\nHandicraft projects have been organized on eastern reserves where relief costs were high and where the agricultural resources were either limited or non-existent. These projects have been particularly successful at St. Regis, Caughnawaga and Pierreville, Quebec, and at Muncey, Ontario. During the period under review, a number of worthwhile Indian handicraft exhibits have been organized and placed on display at Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver.\n\nIn the promotion of Indian handicraft projects, the present policy is to emphasize quality production on the reserves and b the establishment of a sample room and wholesale ware-house at Ottawa guarantee continuity of supply to the wholesale and retail trade.\n\nMost of the large commercial houses do their buying months in advance of the actual sale of the goods, and were not in a position to place orders immediately following the establishment of the ware-house. (Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) worth of goods were sold however toward the end of the year.)\nOttawa, July 15, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nYou will be interested to learn that Indian education in Canada and in the United States will be critically reviewed and discussed at a Seminar Conference, September 4 - 16, arranged by the Universities of Toronto and Yale.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to send forward a statement indicating the average salary paid in the province of Manitoba to teachers in charge of one or two room public schools. I have been informed on more than one occasion that there has been a substantial increase in the salaries paid public school teachers, but I have had nothing definite on the matter from the provincial authorities.\n\nIf you could, in addition to this, let me have some information with respect to the salaries paid in the other provinces, this information would be deeply appreciated.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey - 2\n\nsummary - Bulletin #1 - would be quite reliable. The information about our own Province is, of course, obtained from the teachers and would be a year sooner than the reports of Dr. Robbins. We get the information directly from the teachers or the majority of the teachers and in our experience we find the averages are practically the same as those derived from the complete reports of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.\n\nWe cannot see much of an increase in the salaries of teachers in this Province, particularly in the rural areas and towns. It is true that the cities and suburban areas have had some restorations, but the one-room school is still in the doldrums.\n\nWe shall be very happy if any of this information is of value to you.

Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare\nand Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of July 15th, in connection with salaries paid to teachers in this Province.\n\nI am sending to you, under separate cover, a number of printed and mimeographed returns from which you might find an item or two that would be of interest.\n\nAccording to our records, the average salary in the one-room rural school, according to contract, for 1938-39 was $539. This was an increase of $26 over 1937-38.\n\nThe average salaries paid in the two-room schools were $729 and $561 - the larger figure being for the Principals.\n\nThe highest salary paid in any one-room school, to my knowledge, is $1000, and there are cases where teachers get less than $300.\n\nThe highest salary paid to the Principal in a two-room school is $1255, and the lowest $475. The highest paid to any assistant in a two-room school is $850, and the lowest $475.\n\nIt is difficult to make comparisons between Provinces. In some of them the residence is counted as part of the salary; in others the residence and fuel are not counted. However, in general, this would not make very much difference.\n\nI have found the Dominion Bureau of Statistics quite reliable. We every year get information before the report is published, and we send out this information on mimeographed sheets to Teachers' Organizations in the different Provinces. This we get through the courtesy of Dr. Robbins.

I know of no man who has made a greater contribution to the cause of human advancement in Western Canada than he has made during the last 35 or 40 years.

I must say that your plan of closing the Indian schools for an extra month is a very good one. In fact, if the Indian schools were closed for a year perhaps they would appreciate their free education when the schools opened again. On some reserves I have often seen the children of even the so-called leaders, the chief and...\nII.\n\nConstable along with many others playing on the highway instead of being in school. I have asked the parents why their children were not in school and they just shrug their shoulders and say \"they go sometimes\" or else say Indians don't have to go to school nobody can make them go. No matter what Reserve one drives through he is sure to see children of school age playing on the road. It seems too bad when one thinks of all the money paid each year towards educating the Indians and they do not take advantage of it. I cannot see that the Indian will ever be brought to the level of the white man even the best educated ones fall back. A few years ago I happened to be speaking to the late Dr. Papineau who knew Indians very well. I mentioned to him the fact that the Indians were so neglectful in sending their children to school.\nHe told me that Indian children are let do pretty much as they please and that we must take the Indians as they are not as they should be. He said that many of them haven't even a clock in their homes. He laughed and said \"Time means nothing to an Indian and when the children do go to school they never get there on time yet the parents are always complaining that the teacher never calls school on time.\"\n\nI certainly do feel that you are doing the right thing in closing the Indian schools for a time at least to help win this war.\n\nYours truly,\nWm. Stevens.\nOttawa, June 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant and to thank you for the comments on our educational policy, contained therein.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that while certain groups of Indians still remain indifferent to the education of their children, the situation throughout the Dominion as a whole is more or less encouraging. I note that the average attendance for the last fiscal year amounted to 77.5%. This is a higher average attendance than the average attendance at public schools about 10 or 15 years ago. I certainly agree with you, however, that there is still room for improvement. It is my hope that by closing our schools during the month of September the attendance will steadily improve during the other months of the regular school year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. Wm. Stevens,\nHonor\u00e9,\nOnt.\n## Indian Education - Expenditure for Year 1939-40\n\n| Province                  | Day Schools | Residential Schools | General | Total |\n|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------|-------|\n| Nova Scotia               |             |                    |         |       |\n| Prince Edward Island      | 12,570.82   | 29,690.14          |         | 42,260.96 |\n| New Brunswick             | 905.98      |                    |         | 905.98 |\n| Quebec                    | 18,215.73   |                    |         | 18,215.73 |\n| Ontario                   | 58,642.52   |                    |         | 58,642.52 |\n| Manitoba                  | 111,732.93  |                    |         | 111,732.93 |\n| Saskatchewan              | 62,199.09   |                    |         | 62,199.09 |\n| Alberta                   | 49,056.78   |                    |         | 49,056.78 |\n| British Columbia          | 1,380.94    |                    |         | 1,380.94 |\n| Northwest Territories     | 85,695.94   |                    |         | 85,695.94 |\n| British Columbia Schools Vocational Instruction |             |                    |         |         |\n| Yukon                     | 1,375.59    |                    |         | 1,375.59 |\n| Assistance to ex-pupils   | 45,242.68   |                    |         | 45,242.68 |\n| Freight and Express       | 3,045.00    |                    |         | 3,045.00 |\n| Salaries and travel       |             |                    |         |         |\n| Stationery                |             |                    |         |         |\n| Tuition                   |             |                    |         |         |\n| Expanded by Survey and Engineering Branch |             |                    |         |         |\n| Miscellaneous             |             |                    |         |         |\n\nTotal: 404,821.32\n\nNote: The numbers in the table represent expenditures in Canadian dollars.\nWELFARE\n\nRelief and welfare costs for the year indicate a reduction amounting to $86,712.95 for the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and North West Territories and an increase amounting to $53,741.63 in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia or a net increase for the Dominion amounting to $6,971.72. Per capita costs have been as follows:- Nova Scotia $26.16; Prince Edward Island $22.84; New Brunswick $27.58; Quebec $16.30; Ontario $4.65; Manitoba $6.75; Saskatchewan $6.64; Alberta $8.75; British Columbia $4.52; North West Territories $6.17; and Yukon $9.15. It is significant that per capita costs range from $4.52 in British Columbia to $37.58 in New Brunswick. It would appear that despite slight advances in the price of a number of basic commodities - woollens, flour, etc. - relief costs remain low in the provinces where the Indians have at their disposal the lands and hunting and fishing concessions necessary for their support and remain high in provinces where such resources are limited or non-existent.\n\nA steadily awakening interest in the improvement of home conditions has been in evidence throughout the year. A large number of Homemakers' Clubs have been organized under the direction of the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan and a number of somewhat similar groups have been organized in the Kamsack and New Westminster agencies, British Columbia, in the Sittle and Fisher River agencies, Manitoba, and in the Six Nations agency, Ontario. The members of these clubs meet monthly. The programs provided usually consist of worth-while projects such as knitting, dressmaking, fruit preserving, the canning of vegetables, lectures on health, sanitation, child care, etc. The officers of the Provincial Extension Services have willingly responded to the requests that have reached them to arrange seasonal programs and provide lecturers for these clubs.\n\nThe number of Indians seeking loans from the Revolving Fund has not been as large as might have been expected. Nineteen groups of Indians have been provided with loans amounting to $35,530.78 from this fund. With the exception of two loans amounting to approximately $7,000.00, secured by the Caughnawaga and Akensaki Indians of Quebec, all loans secured were used for the organization and promotion of collective farm projects in the Prairie Provinces. The largest single item of expenditure has been the amount necessary for the purchase and operation of tractors. Loans are authorized only after a thorough investigation of local conditions by the Indian agent and by the inspector and then only to responsible groups of Indians and in amounts not exceeding $5,000.00 in each case.\n\nThe following is a statement of welfare expenditures by provinces for the year 1939-40:-\n| Province               | 1939-40   | 1938-39   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Nova Scotia           | 75,948.48 | 72,241.26 |\n| Prince Edward Island  | 7,534.59  | 8,347.83  |\n| New Brunswick         | 65,294.79 | 61,502.32 |\n| Quebec                | 216,356.06| 206,098.56|\n| Ontario               | 141,832.65| 142,529.33|\n| Manitoba              | 107,045.45| 114,298.71|\n| Saskatchewan          | 102,712.56| 102,934.41|\n| Alberta               | 95,425.59 | 90,896.16 |\n| British Columbia      | 107,487.95| 108,350.79|\n| Northwest Territories | 23,692.18 | 28,781.45 |\n| Yukon                 | 10,458.68 | 8,907.08  |\n| Triennial Clothing    | 3,465.06  | 1,717.98  |\n| Miscellaneous         | 94,910.13 | 31,432.27 |\n\nNet Increase: 284,770.44 - 979,949.78 = 5,567.30\nHandicraft projects remain in the experimental stage and from a promotional standpoint have been confined almost wholly to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Experience indicates that exhibitions and displays, coupled with practical demonstrations by skilled handicraft workers, are an important factor in stimulating interest in Indian welfare and in the sale of handicraft products. Two exhibit and demonstration centres were organized during the year. The exhibit organized at the Canadian National Exhibition, Toronto, received wide publicity and appeared to be one of the most attractive exhibits on the exhibition grounds. The display was arranged in an attractive and suitable setting provided in the courtyard of the National Industries Building. Black ash and sweet grass baskets, carved figures, bark work, beaded moccasins and hand-wrought metal utensils, valued at $2,000.00, were sold. Forty Indians took part in the demonstration.\n\nSix Indians took part in the exhibition and demonstration of handicraft work organized at Winnipeg and goods valued at $5,000.00 were sold during the display, which covered the period from November 25 to December 21, 1939.\n\nIndian handicraft projects, to be successful, impose upon the Department an obligation to provide constant supervision and this obligation has until now confined our efforts largely to reserves in Eastern Canada. Faulty workmanship and the failure of wholesale and retail marketing agencies to secure a constant supply of high standard quality handicraft products have in the past militated against the success of the Indians in building up their reserve industries. Only by constant and capable supervision can good workmanship and continuity of supply be guaranteed to a market which has grown steadily and encouragingly since the inception of this work three years ago.\n\nGrants to Agricultural Exhibitions and Indian Fairs, 1939-40\n| Province       | Event/Association                                                                 | Amount |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Quebec        | Canadian Handicraft Guild, Montreal                                               | $50.00 |\n| Ontario       | Caradoc Fair and Ploughing Association                                            |        |\n|               | Garden River Agricultural Society, Sault Ste.

schools were constructed during the year at the following reserves: Salmon River, N.S.; Bel Ground, N.B.; Maria, (4 rooms) Que.; Metegami, Sud Lake, (6 rooms) Six Nations and Sucker Creek, Ont.; Little Grand Rapids, Ont.; Big River, Sask.; Boothroyd, Comox, Little Qualicum and Seton Lake, B.C. Schools were established for the first time at Metegami, Ont., and at Big River, (R.C.) Sask. The other schools were constructed to replace buildings that had become unsuitable for educational purposes.\n\nThe Ste. Catherine's day school, Cowichan Agency, B.C., is a consolidated four-room school with full basement accommodation for vocational instruction. About 170 pupils are conveyed to this school daily by bus. If successful, schools such as this may in the course of time displace a number of residential schools now operating on Indian reserves.\n\nAn unusually large number of residential schools were destroyed by fire during the year. Residential school\nbuildings at Carcross, Yukon; Albany, James Bay, Ont., and Ahousaht, West Coast Agency, B. C., were totally destroyed. The boys' building at the Alert Bay residential school, Kwakwaka'wakw agency, B. C., was partially destroyed and the Indian day school at Hunter's Point, Timiskaming Agency, Que., was totally destroyed. In view of these losses and others sustained from time to time, it is doubtful if in the future residential schools should be built other than those of fireproof construction.\n\nThere appears to be a growing awareness on the part of our Indian population of the direct relationship between worthwhile secondary school courses - academic and vocational - and the ability of the members of the younger generation to establish themselves on a self-supporting basis. This awareness has led in recent years to a widespread demand for tuition grants. An arrangement has now been made whereby the first year high school course will be provided at a large number of Indian day schools. Assurances have been received from the Correspondence Branches of the provincial departments of education that they will be willing to co-operate with the Department in the promotion of these courses.\n\nIndian day and residential schools in the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are regularly inspected by public school inspectors and in the provinces of New Brunswick and British Columbia, by inspectors employed by the Department. The reports received from these officers indicate that courses of study have been adjusted to meet the peculiar temperament, outlook and needs of the Indian pupil. They indicate also that the teachers in charge of Indian schools with rare exceptions are fully qualified in a professional sense, deeply interested in the welfare and progress of their pupils and anxious to co-operate with Indian agents and farm instructors in the organization of women's clubs, the cultivation of subsistence gardens and general welfare work on the reserves.\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO\nLONDON, CANADA\n\nSeptember 3, 1940.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWill you kindly furnish me with a list of the teachers in the Indian Schools of Ontario with their addresses.

She is a poor mentally unbalanced woman and writes letters to all and sundry. She quite often creates a disturbance in St. Paul's Church (Anglican) by aimless talking. The parish more or less supports her and she also receives relief. Her reference to Indian school children merely refers to the fact that she used to work with the Anglican Young People's Association making clothing and contributions to Indian schools; she has never worked for the Department.\n\nThe wife of Canon King of St. Paul's Church says Miss Baxendale probably has forgotten ever having written the enclosed letter by this time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have no peace with those at St. Agnes' St. Paul's parvis St. Vancouver.\n\nThey shout me every day on the streets.\n\nI like to be more out of Vancouver.

The Federal Government in Canada has no jurisdiction whatever in educational matters. I am of the opinion, therefore, that you can secure the information you have in mind by communicating with the Deputy Minister of Education in each of the 9 provinces: Prince Edward Island at Charlottetown; Nova Scotia at Halifax; New Brunswick at Fredericton; Quebec at Quebec City; Ontario at Toronto; Manitoba at Winnipeg; Saskatchewan at Regina; Alberta at Edmonton and British Columbia at Victoria.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

That means that the latest you could send me this information, is on Saturday, if it is possible for me to have it for that night.\n\nPerhaps the Indian Department is the only one I should apply to, but I thought that there may be some other line of education under an Education Dept., such as education civil service extension.

Your courtesy and thoughtfulness in sending forward these samples is very much appreciated.\n\nA few months ago a head clerk was attached to this Branch, on the understanding that he would undertake a complete review of the courses of study at Indian day and residential schools and the text-books in use at these institutions. I have submitted to him the publications sent on by you, for any comment he may care to offer.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that this Branch has undertaken the preparation of a textbook, with the object of emphasizing conservation of fur-bearing animals. The story is based on certain muskrat developments that have recently taken place in northern Manitoba. These developments at this date have proved to be outstandingly successful.

Any particular points of interest regarding the work and results of the schools.\n\nIf you have any particular information regarding St. Michael's School, Alert Bay I would be interested in this the nearest.\nRe. school under the Anglican Church. I was a staff member there at one time, myself. I hope this does not seem too much to ask but I thought you may have pamphlets that would cover much of the information required.\n\nYours truly,\n(Miss) Kathleen Porter\nOttawa, May 9, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Porter:\n\nYour letter of April 26, addressed to the M. S. C. C., Winnipeg, Man., has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, the last annual report of the Indian Affairs Branch. You will find an answer to a number of your questions in the tables contained in this report.\n\nIndian residential schools, except in one or two instances, have been built and are kept in a state of repair by the Government. The Churches supply food, clothing and instruction, for which they are allowed per capita grants, ranging from $100 to $200 per annum. The teachers at residential schools are employed by the churches, and it is my understanding that practically all the churches are now demanding full academic and professional standing from the teachers they employ.\n\nRecruiting for residential schools is usually undertaken by the principal of the school in cooperation with the Indian agent. The aim of our educational program at the present time is to so equip the pupil that he can return to his reserve with the hope of establishing himself on a self-supporting basis and live a useful life. The courses at residential schools throughout the Dominion have become increasingly more vocational in character and this is particularly true of our schools in British Columbia. The courses provided at these schools compare, in my judgment, very favourably with the courses provided at any public schools -\n\nMiss Kathleen Porter,\nR. R. No. 2,\nChemainus, B. C.\nschools in the Dominion.\n\nThe question is constantly being asked: Do the Indians revert to their former level of living when leaving school? It is somewhat difficult to answer this question definitely. Indians in Canada differ widely in the progress they have made and in the extent to which they have detached themselves from primitive instincts and primitive modes of living. The Indians of Caughnawaga, Que., are the finest steel workers in the world and have recently been engaged on the construction of the bridge at San Francisco. As you are probably aware, Indians were employed on the construction of the Empire State Building, New York. These Indians are practically indistinguishable from ordinary white citizens. This is also true of the Indians of the Six Nations Reserve, Brantford, Ont. There are 14 Indian day school teachers employed on the Six Nations Reserve, and of these, 13 are Indians, who received their instruction in these schools and who at this date enjoy full academic and professional standing. The Head of the Economics Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources is an Iroquois Indian, as is also the Doctor now in charge of the Indian Reserve at Caradoc, Ont. It will thus be seen that Indians who have been intimately in contact with white civilization for a century or so are becoming gradually assimilated - or perhaps it would be more accurate to say - have reached a stage in their development when they can compete successfully with the white man and assume the full responsibilities of democratic citizenship.\n\nI am personally disposed to favour the Indian day school and thus avoid the necessity of moving Indian children from their homes. It must be borne in mind, however, that there are thousands of Indian homes in Canada, not equipped to provide the children with either the nourishment or the care necessary for their\ndevelopment. Provision, for the time being at least, must be made for the care of these children in residential schools.\n\nEconomies have been effected as the result of the war, but the reductions in the expenditures provided for Indian education and Indian welfare have not been drastic.\n\nI am sending forward herewith a brief summary of the Inspector's last report on the St. Michael's School, Alert Bay, B.

In addition to this new outlet, a number of the more progressive Indians, profiting by the instruction and supervision given by the Department, have been able during the year to secure a large number of orders for themselves and have made shipments direct to their customers.\n\nThree handicraft exhibits were held during the year; at St. Helen's Island, near Montreal, at which $1,200 worth of craft-work was sold, and at the Canadian National Exhibition, Toronto, and at Winnipeg. The amount received from the sale of goods at the Toronto and Winnipeg exhibits exceeded $10,000.\n\nCertain Indian bands have been encouraged to open roadside stands on public highways, close to their reserves. These bands have been assisted by the transfer in care of the local Indian agent of basketry products and novelties from other Indian reserves. The fact that these products are sold to the Indians at wholesale prices enables them to sell at a profit and place on display a variety of products likely to attract the attention of tourists.\n\nThe failure of Canadian and American wholesale houses to secure adequate supplies of novelty products from Europe is reflected in the steadily increasing number of orders now reaching the Department.\n| Province               | 1940-41       | 1939-40       |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Nova Scotia           | $70,650.58    | $75,948.48    |\n| Prince Edward Island  | $6,536.17     | $7,534.59     |\n| New Brunswick         | $48,508.52    | $65,294.79    |\n| Quebec                | $200,636.48   | $218,956.06   |\n| Ontario               | $126,471.28   | $141,693.65   |\n| Manitoba              | $93,518.42    | $107,045.45   |\n| Saskatchewan          | $94,647.13    | $102,712.56   |\n| Alberta               | $68,545.75    | $95,485.59    |\n| British Columbia      | $104,006.68   | $107,487.25   |\n| Northwest Territories | $21,336.18    | $22,593.13    |\n| Yukon                 | $16,913.88    | $12,453.68    |\n| Triennial Clothing    | $6,340.55     | $3,485.08     |\n| Miscellaneous         | $23,142.18    | $24,910.13    |\n| Handicraft            | $4,874.84     | -             |\n| **Total**             | **$882,928.34** | **$984,770.44** |\nWELFARE\n\nRelief and welfare costs for the year show a reduction amounting to $101,842.10. This is the most substantial reduction that has taken place at any time in recent years.\n\nA marked improvement in employment conditions was in evidence throughout the year. The skilled workers of the eastern reserves, particularly the steel workers of Caughnawaga, have experienced little difficulty in securing work in war industries. A large number of unskilled workers, however, have not yet secured permanent employment.\n\nAn attempt has been made in recent years to encourage reforestation on a number of reserves. It is gratifying to report that a steadily increasing number of Indian bands are cooperating with the Department in the extension of this work. Toward the close of the year 15,000 trees were secured from the provincial forestry station and planted on suitable lands at the Caradoc reserve. A start was also made at the Moravian agency, where 2,000 trees were planted. The trees at this reserve are designed to provide windbreaks and additional shelter for Indian homes.\n\nIt cannot be said that economic conditions in the Prairie Provinces have been wholly satisfactory. A number of community farms established in 1937 and financed from the revolving fund have experienced difficulty in meeting their obligations. An attempt has been made to adjust our farming program which should result in greater emphasis on subsistence farming. Indians have been encouraged to produce crops for home consumption rather than for export and to keep live stock - cows, pigs and sheep - in sufficient numbers to provide the meat necessary for domestic consumption.\n\nRelief and welfare costs in British Columbia remain low and appear to have reached a figure when further reductions can scarcely be expected, if adequate provision is to be made for the old and physically incapacitated members of the bands. Employment conditions in the lumbering and fishing industries have been satisfactory. The number of Indians engaged in agriculture has shown a substantial increase. Late in the year an interesting experiment was undertaken at the Seabird Island Indian reserve, where an experimental plot of five acres was seeded to fibre flax. The seed for this experiment was secured from the Agassiz Experimental Farm.\n\nThe following is a statement of welfare expenditures by provinces for the year 1940-41:-\nANNUAL REPORT\n\nWelfare and Training Service\n\nfor the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 1941.\n\nTRAINING\n\nA table of pupil enrolment and attendance follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1921-22     | 8,113     | 7,400         | 6,850     | 5,707         | 17,163    | 12,107         | 76.36                  |\n| 1922-23     | 8,485     | 7,616         | 6,820     | 5,744         | 17,475    | 12,470         | 77.30                  |\n| 1923-24     | 8,806     | 7,780         | 6,850     | 5,800         | 17,648    | 12,250         | 76.30                  |\n| 1924-25     | 9,709     | 7,882         | 6,951     | 5,900         | 17,690    | 12,440         | 76.54                  |\n| 1925-26     | 9,906     | 8,061         | 9,177     | 5,788         | 18,073    | 12,448         | 76.70                  |\n| 1926-27     | 9,040     | 8,176         | 9,257     | 5,700         | 18,297    | 12,868         | 76.34                  |\n| 1927-28     | 9,433     | 8,191         | 9,510     | 5,768         | 18,743    | 14,299         | 75.68                  |\n| 1928-29     | 9,179     | 8,276         | 9,573     | 6,332         | 18,742    | 14,606         | 77.66                  |\n| 1929-30     | 9,097     | 8,343         | 9,363     | 6,317         | 18,356    | 15,000         | 81.07                  |\n| 1930-31     | 9,774     | 8,243         | 9,651     | 6,110         | 17,415    | 14,254         | 82.27                  |\n\nAn encouraging feature of the work of this year was the progress made in the development of an educational program designed to meet the needs of an Indian population scattered over 9 provinces, the Yukon and North West Territories. This Indian population includes the highly skilled steel workers of Caughnawaga, Que., the fishing and trapping Indians of the northern sections of the Dominion and the Pacific coast, and the Indians engaged in extensive farming operations in Ontario and the Prairie Provinces.\n\nThe progress made at Indian day and residential schools in the province of British Columbia has been particularly gratifying. In addition to the regular academic courses, special vocational courses have been successfully organized. These courses, for girls, consist of the treatment and spinning of locally grown\nwool and the knitting of woollen garments, Cowichan sweaters, socks, etc., dressmaking, fruit preserving, crochet work and home management, and for boys, boat-building, auto mechanics, Indian arts and crafts and elementary agriculture. The Koksilah, Inkameep and Ste. Catherine schools have been outstandingly successful in the organization of these courses, all of which are based on the needs of the Indians on the adjoining reserves.\n\nMr. Anthony Walsh, the teacher in charge of the Inkameep Indian day school, has succeeded in the dramatization of a number of Indian legends. The presentation of these at the Banff Drama School created a great deal of interest amongst Indian educationists in Canada and the United States. Mr. Walsh, in addition to these presentations, published during the year, in cooperation with his pupils, a booklet entitled \"The Tale of the Nativity\". This teacher has had a number of invitations to organize drama festivals in the United States.\n\nAn interesting experiment in fur ranching took place at the Morley residential school, Alberta, when a small mink ranch was established 2 years ago. This ranch started with 6 mink, netted 75 mink last year and still has on hand 50 mink as breeding stock. The principal of the school, commenting on the work of the ranch, states: \"The Indian boys have taken to this work in a very fine way and I believe that at least a dozen boys could find employment if they so desired among the large fur ranches in the vicinity of Calgary\".\n\nToward the end of the year a representative of the Department spent 3 months at the schools of Alberta. This visit was arranged in an attempt to bring the courses of study into conformity with the vocational opportunities on the reserves of the province. This is the first vocational survey that has been undertaken by the Department. If successful, it will be gradually extended to the other provinces of the Dominion.\n\nThe four-room classroom building, constructed at Alberni as a unit of the residential school completed in 1940, was totally destroyed by fire in February, 1941. A fire which resulted in the destruction of the blacksmith and carpentry shops at the Kootenay residential school also occurred during the year.\n\nA number of educational problems remain to engage the attention of the Department. Of these, perhaps the most difficult is irregularity of attendance. Attendance at Indian day schools, even in the case of schools where transportation is available for pupils, is far from satisfactory.\n\nAn acute shortage of fully qualified teachers exists throughout the country, and it has become increasingly difficult to secure male teachers for Indian day schools in outlying districts. It is difficult to over-emphasize the effect of this condition on the educational\nstandards that have been reached at our schools and upon the general progress of Indian pupils.\n\nA textbook for use in Indian day schools, the subject matter of which emphasizes forestry and wild life conservation, was prepared during the year. This is the first textbook prepared and published by the Department.\n\nIndian Education - Expenditure for Year 1940-41\nMEMORANDUM\nRe.: A. J. Hatcher.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs deals with Indian Education. Some of the phases of this Education may have points in common with Half Breed Education. The following brief is sent in the hope that it may be suggestive and helpful.\n\nSOME AIMS OF INDIAN EDUCATION:\n\n1. The Indian School must seek to develop a love for the life the child must later lead and to prepare him to live it efficiently.\n\n2. To promote social adjustment and responsibility.\n\n3. To develop skills and impart information.\n\n4. To promote health, both physical and mental.\n\n5. To provide activities suitable to child development.\n\n1. To develop a love for the life the child must lead and to prepare him to live it efficiently.\n\nThere are but three careers available to the Prairie Indian: Farming, cattle raising, hunting and fishing. It is true that some may find their way to some profession but these will be the exception and must be classed as exceptions.\n\nTo make these people happy in their mode of life should be one of the important concerns of the school. A system concerned primarily with the acquisition of academic skills will prevent the continuity of the school and 'Life' so necessary to happy efficient living.\n\n2. To promote Social adjustment and responsibility.\n\nThe Indian leaves a small social group, the family, for a larger social group, the school. In most cases the family social conditions demand changes. It is at the school that these readjustments must be made. It is at the school that children should learn to be helpful and dependable. They should partake in activities that will encourage this development: Sports, Student Councils, Manual Training, etc.\n\n3. To develop skills and impart information.\n\nThe Indian should be able to handle efficiently the skills of basic academic subjects: Reading, Writing, Arithmetic. He should moreover develop manual skills necessary to his mode of life. General Shop should be a part of every Indian School.\n\n4. To promote health, physical and mental.\n\n5. To provide activities suitable to child development.\n\nDramatization, chorals, music, rhythm bands, singing games, etc.\n\nNote: Inspector E. C. Stehelin, Provincial School Inspector Alta., is gathering data for Half-Breed Education.\n\nMr. Z. Hamilton, McCallum Hill Building, Regina, Sask., is considered an authority on the Western Half-Breed.\nThe Pas, July 18, 1941.\n\nHon. Robert Haig,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Haig,\n\nI am chairman of a Special Committee here to study the problem of the \"Education of the Half-Breed,\" with the idea of producing a special curriculum for such schools.\n\nWe thought your Dept might be doing some experimental work and we should like to know about them and the results.\n\nWhile discussing the matter of history it was generally agreed that we should have some material which would tend to produce a \"pride in Race,\" but no one seemed to know.\nsources for such matter and it was felt that you might be able to help us out in this particular field.\n\nI shall appreciate hearing from you at your early convenience.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J. Hatcher\nOttawa, August 6, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Hatcher:\n\nPlease pardon me for not acknowledging receipt of your letter of July 18 until now. I have been absent from the office on holidays - hence the delay.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, a number of excerpts taken from Inspectors' reports that have reached the Department on Indian day and residential schools. These excerpts will enable you to grasp to some extent the courses of study that we have been attempting to promote at our Indian schools. It would appear that we have made greater progress in the province of British Columbia than we have in the other provinces. This is due in part to the fact that we have our own Inspector in that province. Capable teachers and regular supervision make up about four fifths of the battle in Indian educational effort. Latterly our aim has been to devote about one-third of the regular instruction period to vocational projects.\n\nIt would appear that during the period ahead of us there are but three careers available to the Indian and half-breed\u2014farming; cattle-raising; hunting and fishing. It is true that some may find their way to the other professions, but these will be the exception and must be classed as such. An educational program, therefore, in my judgment should have a vital and direct relationship to the tasks the pupils are likely to undertake immediately following their departure from school.\n\nI was very much interested in your reference to the History that might be taught in half-breed schools -\n\nA. J. Hatcher, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nThe Pas, Man.\nschools. I have been giving this matter a certain amount of thought since entering the Department, and I am rather disposed to think that insofar as Indians are concerned History might very well be taught by the almost exclusive use of biographies. I have in mind the Life of Joseph Brant; the Life of Tecumseh; the Life of Father Lacombe; Studies in the Life of Pauline Johnson, etc. All these books are available and might be used, in my judgment, very profitably either as textbooks or as supplementary reading matter.\n\nI have just learned that Inspector E. C. Stehelin, Provincial School Inspector, Alberta, is at present engaged in the task of getting data for half-breed education. Mr. Z. Hamilton, McCallum Building Regina, Sask., is also considered an authority on the western half-breed. It is just possible that you have been in touch with both these gentlemen.\n\nMay I express regret that I am unable to send forward to you more worthwhile data on this important subject. I can only send forward what I have, in the hope that you will find it at least suggestive.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, August 12, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Hatcher:\n\nThe following excerpts are taken from a letter received by the Department from Mr. Z. M. Hamilton, Secretary of the Saskatchewan Historical Society, Regina, Sask.:\n\n\"You asked about the \"Pride of Race\" possessed by the western Metis. I can assure you that to them it is a very real thing. The original Metis were the off-spring of the early French explorers, the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the officers of the North West Company, and, usually, the women of the Indian Chiefs of the tribes amongst whom they lived.\n\n\"In the early days of the last century, a number of the children of the fur traders of the mixed blood received their elementary education at the parochial schools of the Roman Catholic and the Anglican Church which were established on the banks of the Red River, and some of them were sent to eastern Canada for their education, and, in some instances, even to the old country.\n\n\"Originally, the Metis people were reliable and trustworthy, and some of them became very important in the life of the country. Such names as the two Louis Riels\u2014p\u00e8re and fils\u2014Ambroise Lepine, Gabriel Dumont, Charles Nolin, John Norquay, an early Premier of Manitoba, Hon. James Mackay of Silver Heights, a Minister of Agriculture in an early Manitoba Government, William Mackay, of the Hudson's Bay Company, who was the Hudson's Bay officer in command of Fort Ellice who ruled practically the whole prairie country, and in more modern times, Hon. Mr. Justice Mackay of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, and his brother, Thomas Mackay, an early member of the Territorial Legislature, indicate that the western natives of the mixed blood were no mean people.\n\n\"There is a book dealing with the history of the Metis people written in French, by a gentleman named du Tremondon, (I am not perfectly sure, however, if this is the correct spelling of the name), that you would find of great service. I do not have a copy of the book in the office or I would send it to you, but I think you could procure one by writing to Samuel Nault, President of the Manitoba Metis Society, Great West Permanent Building, Winnipeg. Another book that I am sure you would find very interesting\u2014\n\nA. J. Hatcher, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nThe Pas, Man.\ninteresting is \"A Critical Account of the Red River Insurrection of 1869-70,\" written in English by Rev. Father Morice, O.M.I. I think you could get that by writing to the Rev. Father Deschambault, Archbishop's Palace, St. Boniface.\n\n\"I have several sketches of Louis Riel in this office but I am not quite sure which one you refer to in your letter. Perhaps you might give me a lead and I will then send you a copy of it.\n\n\"There are two other books both of which I am sure you could obtain from the Parliamentary Library in Ottawa, that are accurate and reliable. One is 'The Memoirs of Archbishop Tache' written in French in two volumes, by Dom. Benoit. The other is 'The History of Manitoba and the North West' in three volumes written in English by Alexander Begg. Begg was a store-keeper in Winnipeg at the time of the Red River Insurrection of 1869-70, and kept a daily journal of everything that happened. I have a manuscript copy of his journal in this office.\"\n\nI am sending forward these excerpts in the hope that you will find them suggestive and helpful in the preparation of the curriculum on which you are now working.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

W. Button\nSecretary of Kent Presbytery\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant in which you forward resolution passed by the Kent Presbytery of the United Church of Canada protesting against the reduction of the academic year at Indian day schools from ten months to nine months.\n\nBefore taking this action all circumstances in connection with the operation of Indian day schools were very carefully considered and at the present time it is not possible to revert to the ten-month academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.W. Button,\nSecretary of Kent Presbytery,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nCharing Cross, Ont.\nTo All Teachers of Indian Residential and Day Schools\n\nAlthough at this time and under the present state of affairs it is hard to anticipate what might transpire a year hence it is, however, requisite to plan ahead, taking for granted that the usual course of events will not be disturbed. By this I am referring to the annual Indian Exhibit at the Regina and Prince Albert Fairs, which we hope will take place in 1942.\n\nA new curriculum has been issued by the Provincial Department of Education, which designates certain changes to be brought about in the daily program of school education. Undoubtedly it will be necessary, as a result, to modify the prize list for Indian exhibits, so as to conform to the changes brought about in the School subjects. To deal with this more effectively is to ask the Principals of the Schools, and the teachers, to suggest what changes should be made, and, in doing this I would advise them to take the old prize list, look it over, and submit to this Office their suggestions for a modification.\n\nWhen your suggestions are received here they will all be given closest attention, and from this an Indian Exhibit list will be drafted for examination and approval of the School Exhibit Committee.\n\nI might say here, for future guidance, and while it is fresh in my memory, that, with reference to Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of this year's list, the Judges were critical of some of the exercise books. They were saying that some students exhibited books not in compliance with the instructions in the prize list. Some books seemed not to be the daily work of the pupil, as required, but a special scribbler into which was copied the daily work. If this is true this practice will have to be stopped and closer attention should be paid to the regulations in the Prize list.\n\nAnother matter I want to emphasize is with reference to the shipping of the exhibits. Not enough attention is given to this. Some schools send their exhibits wrapped up in two or three, or even more, carton packages, tied with strings. The unpacking of such containers, and peaking again, involves a great deal of work and grief on the part of the Exhibits Staff. Each school could have, as some do, a wooden box made at the school, with a lid hinged, in which these exhibits could be sent. I wish to impress upon you that this is important.\n\nUpon going over the list of schools that participated in the Indian Exhibit at Regina and Prince Albert I note that too many of them were not heard from. Every teacher must know to a certain extent child psychology\u2014that children must be inspired to work. This can only be accomplished through some incentive which might vary from day to day or from year to year. Competition amongst children is one incentive by which better results in education might be attained. Indian children particularly lack a competitive spirit, or shall I say it lies dormant in them and needs to be aroused. I am, therefore, very much convinced that if your pupils were encouraged to participate in the school exhibits at the summer Fairs they would find themselves competing against other children in other schools and would thus be inspired to improve their educational standard. Teachers also could use this as their gauge in the educational standing of their pupils. Consequently I am interested to see that more schools take part in exhibiting their work and would ask the teachers to encourage their pupils in having their work forwarded for competition at the Provincial Exhibition.\n\nI also find that some of our teachers have carried on their work at the school, teaching year in and year out but have done nothing to improve their own standards, or to refresh their own knowledge. By this I mean they have not been attending Teachers' Conventions nor have they been participating in other formal functions arranged by teachers or an educational institution for discussion of better teaching methods. It is a well known fact that once a teacher, or anyone, becomes...\nthat once a teacher, or anyone, becomes a recluse in his own vocation, he also becomes somewhat stale and careless in his work. It is, therefore, suggested that Indian teachers attend teachers conventions and participate in everything that will help them to improve their teaching standard at their school. They should seek ways and means by studying the experience of other teachers so as to use newer methods to bring about better results in the Indian school.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say that this letter is intended to include my general remarks and views on school activities for Indian children. I cannot over emphasize the fact that while many of our teachers are doing good work and obtaining magnificent results there are too many whose schools are found to lack sufficient life and are making no progress. This is particularly true, and you will agree with me to see that not taking an active part outside the school, to remedy the situation. In most instances the teachers are not aware of the sad state of affairs and this is because they do not know what other teachers are doing. It is quite obvious that the responsibility of the whole school lies with the teacher and his influence extends far beyond the school. It is, therefore, urgent that no efforts should be spared to bring life into a school, which can only be done by the teacher taking an active part in everything that will help them in this direction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

I am herewith attaching copy of a letter drafted for this purpose and also a statement indicating therein the names of the schools, the equipment as shown in the report dated March 31st, 1942, the number of exhibits forwarded to the Regina and Prince Albert Exhibitions, the number of prize winners such as first, second, third, and fourth, and the percentage secured in prizes.\n\nAs you know, the exhibits for the Regina and Prince Albert Exhibitions are handled through this office and I have been in a position to know which schools take an active part and have their pupils exhibit their work. This has been a great source of information regarding the work the various schools are doing and I am of the opinion that one way of encouraging and putting new life into a school is to more or less insist upon the teachers submitting the work of their pupils to one or both of these Fairs.\n\nIn conclusion, after this circular has been perused I would ask that the Branch write me a letter expressing their opinion in this connection. Any further suggestions will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOctober 7, 1941.\n\nRe: School Exhibits.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 30 and also draft of the circular letter addressed to the Indian day and residential schools of Saskatchewan, attached thereto.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare and Training Division are of the opinion that the receipt of this circular letter by the teachers may arouse their interest in the annual exhibits and prompt them to put forth a greater effort to make the contributions from their schools really worthwhile. These officials agree with you that the element of competition or rivalry in school work should be encouraged.\n\nYou are probably aware that an official of the Department, Mr. A. J. Doucet, undertook a survey of the Indian schools of Alberta during the last year, with the object of organizing worthwhile academic and vocational courses at these schools. Mr. Doucet has since his return completed this course of study and forwarded it to the principals in charge of our schools in Alberta. It is our intention to have a somewhat similar survey undertaken in the other provinces, but the officials are of the opinion that the experiment now being made in Alberta should be followed closely for a year, with the object of determining its suitability. If no weak spots appear in this course of study during the year, a somewhat similar course might be adopted in Saskatchewan. The principals in charge -\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nREGINA, Sask.\ncharge of the Alberta schools will be called upon to submit a report each month on the work accomplished.\n\nYou are aware that our Indian day schools throughout the Dominion are now operating on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis. In view of this fact, a number of inspectors in the province of Ontario recommended that school fairs and school exhibits at agricultural fairs be temporarily abandoned. These inspectors were of the opinion that the time consumed by the average teacher in organizing these exhibits was out of all proportion to their actual worth. They pointed out that it was particularly inadvisable to devote so much time to the organization of exhibits toward the close of the academic year, when the teacher should be engaged in reviewing the year's work, preparing the pupils for their tests, etc. There is a suggestion here that the teachers in Saskatchewan should be reminded that too much time should not be devoted to the actual organization of exhibits at their schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. F. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n32 Wellington St.\nSt. Thomas Ont.\nNov 2, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Thomas General Secretary,\nMinisterial Association proposes to discuss \"Indian Education\" at its regular meeting Monday Nov. 5th and I doubt they will ask many questions which I as a former Principal of the Huron Institute should be able to answer. Kindly send me by return mail copy of Blue Book on this question and I will do my best to give correct information.\n\nS.R. McVitty\nOttawa, November 7, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. McVitty:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your post card of November 2, I am sending forward, under separate cover, certain reports and certain excerpts from Inspectors' reports, which I trust you will find helpful in taking part in the discussion which is to be held on November 10, under the auspices of the St. Thomas General Ministerial Association.\n\nIn view of the fact that this information is not likely to reach you until the morning of the 10th, it is my hope that the members of the Ministerial Association will see their way clear to postpone the discussion to a later date and thus enable you to become reasonably up to date on the subject.\n\nWe have at this date an Indian population in Canada of approximately 120,000, increasing at the rate of approximately 1% per annum. This means that each year we have at least 300 additional Indian pupils for whom it is necessary to provide educational facilities.\n\nOur school enrolment at this date - approximately 19,000 - is divided somewhat evenly between Indian day and residential schools. The tendency on the part of the Government in recent years has been to multiply Indian day schools rather than residential schools. You may be interested to learn that a great deal of criticism has been directed against residential schools since I entered the Department about 5 years ago. There seems\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty,\n32 Wellington Street,\nSt. Thomas, Ont.\nto be a growing feeling that with the exception of the remote northern regions our Indians have outgrown the necessity for such institutions. I have been primarily interested since I entered the Department in promoting vocational courses of study at our schools. The Minister of the Department at the present time is of the opinion that our courses of study must become increasingly more practical in character. The excerpts from inspectors' reports, a copy of which I am enclosing, will give you a fair idea of the success we have had in the promotion of manual training and practical projects at a number of our schools.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that should you require additional information, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

We use it to provide transportation for Indian pupils going to the Spanish Residential School and for Golden Lake children attending high school in Ottawa. We also use it for our own officials, as often they prefer to have transportation by warrant rather than by accountable advance. There is then less trouble with the retention of ticket stubs, writing out of expense accounts, etc.\n\nBernard F.

Hannum -\nMEMORANDUM: THE DIRECTOR,\n\nTransportation Warrants\n\nAt the present time there are in excess of 100 books of Transportation Warrants in the hands of officers of the Branch at various locations.\n\nOf the above, the following officials at Head Office have presently books in their possession:\n\nG. Armstrong\nM. McCrimmon\n\nJ.E. Morris\nB.F. Neary\n\nIn view of the fact that cash advances are made for travel purposes sufficient to take care of the cost of railway transportation, etc., perhaps you would consider the recall of the books in question.\n\nThe case of Mr. G. Armstrong should, however, be considered in a somewhat different light from that of the other officers. The warrants he has were never intended for personal travel purposes but rather for issue to Indians as a welfare measure in certain circumstances.\n\n(agd) W. Lauchlan\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDecember 1, 1949\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOnce again, it is time to start planning for the employment of university students at the end of the academic year. Although many veteran students have already graduated there will still be exceptionally large classes, due to the presence of veterans, in 1950 and 1951. It is obviously important that employment be found for them - permanent for graduates and temporary for undergraduates.\n\nIt may seem rather early to introduce this subject but dealing with the problem involves several months' work and an immediate start is therefore imperative. The full resources of this Department and the National Employment Service will be used to assist in filling your requirements and in finding positions for students seeking them. However, your assistance is vital without it the problem could not be solved. It would be greatly appreciated therefore if you would list your estimated requirements on the enclosed form and return it to the address given at the top of the form. It is requested that, in listing requirements you supply as full information as possible on such items as remuneration, types of training, whether you will consider applicants from all universities or on some more restricted basis, etc. Complete information will greatly assist in efficient selection of applicants.\n\nEven at this early date you will no doubt be able to give a fairly close estimate of the 1950 graduates you will require. It is realized that at this time it may be more difficult to judge exact requirements for summer employees. However, it will be most helpful if you will list known openings now and indicate a date when further information will be available. Officers of the National Employment Service will then get in touch with you at the time indicated.\n\nShould you make a practice of visiting universities to make your own selection of students, this letter will serve as a reminder that it is time to consider your planning on student employment. It is also a request that employers who make a direct approach will nevertheless furnish the National Employment Service with information as to how many students will be engaged so that the general picture of available openings will be known. Lastly, it is to advise you of assistance available from the National Employment Service in such matters as arranging interviews on the campus, etc. At the Prairie universities, full time N.E.S. offices operate on the campuses throughout the academic year. At other universities, N.E.S. liaison officers work in co-operation with university staffs.\n\nWhen you avail yourself of this service, it would greatly increase the efficiency of the whole scheme if, when positions are filled, you would immediately notify the N.E.S. local office in your city. When this is done, all offices will be notified and be governed accordingly.\n\nYour cooperation in this matter will be of great assistance and will be appreciated by the students themselves and the university authorities, as well as the government organizations concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDear Sir:\n\nAnother interesting subject will be under discussion at the next meeting of the Group, which will be held on Thursday evening, December 9.\n\nDr. H. L. Keenleyside, Deputy Minister of Mines & Resources, will be in the Chair and will lead the discussion on \"Canadian Policies and Administrative Activities in the North\".\n\nOther speakers will include G. E. B. Sinclair, Chief of the Lands Division, J. G. Wright, Chief of the Arctic Division, and B. F. Henry, Superintendent of the Indian Affairs Education Service, all of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nDr. Keenleyside and his associates will deal with various aspects of the administration of our Northern natural resources, the Government's activities in the Eastern Arctic, native education and welfare, and other interesting problems that arise in connection with the development of our vast northern reaches.\n\nDate - Thursday, December 9\nTime - 8:00 p.m.\nPlace - Room 231, Centre Block (Railway Committee Room)\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Perry\nR. H. Taber\nProgram Committee.\nMemorandum:\n\nColonel Neary\n\nIn compliance with your request I am attaching hereto a statement showing the annual holiday leave credits of the Indian Education Division Staff for the current year 1949-50, also overtime credits.\n\nEnc.\n\nPersonnel Section\nNovember 30, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Rioux attend the next meeting of the Panel on Indian Research and if you wish, I will phone him directly and arrange to have an interview so that I can explain how our Panel is working.\n\nI will shortly be sending to you the minutes of the first meeting of this Panel.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Since I have no means of publishing this revision, it occurred to me that you might be interested in publishing this booklet for your schools. If you were interested I could get the revised edition typed out and send it to you for examination.\n\nIn Kelowna, we have made an attempt to sell Canadian Quarterly to both New and Old Canadians, and I believe that some success has been achieved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. W. Bann, Teacher\nP.O. Box 448,\nKelowna, B.C.\n10 December, 1949.\n\nMr. J. M. Barre,\nTeacher, Kelowna Junior High School,\nP. O. Box 448, Kelowna, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have read with much interest your mimeographed bulletin on \"What a Canadian Should Know\".\n\nHave you sent a copy of this to the Citizenship Branch? I believe they would be interested in this edition.\n\nI do not know how useful this type of material would be in our Indian schools. From your own experience, you will realize how difficult it is to get Indian children interested in historical or geographical facts. In fact the most useful book of this kind which we have used is \"A Story Workbook in Canadian History\". In this book the trend is away from a factual presentation of facts towards the storybook type of history.\n\nWe might possibly try out the use of this bulletin in, say, the Kamloops Residential School. In fact I am sending Father O'Grady, the Principal, a copy of this letter, in the hope that you will write to him with a copy of your bulletin so that you may get his reaction and that of his teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

One of the men at the Printing Bureau has these cards made for each meeting and, for some reason which I have not yet learned, they are always done in duplicate. Hence I enclose your card in duplicate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD.) R. H. TABER\nfor Program Committee.\n\ncc: G. E. B. Sinclair,\nJ. G. Wright,\nB. F. Neary,\nJ. H.

Keenleyside, Esq., Ph.D., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nThe 'History in the Making' series of weekly commentaries on current international developments, sponsored jointly by the Adult Education Committee of Carleton College and the Ottawa Branch of the United Nations Association in Canada, is resuming on Thursday evenings beginning January 12.\n\nA considerable number of regular members of the group are officers of the three Services working towards promotional examinations. They have suggested the usefulness of an evening on Canada's Northland, and I am writing to ask if you could suggest some member of your Department who would be prepared to talk for 35 or 40 minutes about the topography, resources, development and future prospects of this area, and to answer questions from the group. The date suggested is Thursday, January 19, at 8.15 p.m.\n\nThe previous meetings in this Series have been of a high level of discussion, and we would like to have this atmosphere continued by the most authoritative meeting we can provide. May I therefore ask your help in securing a speaker for this date?\n\nWe would also welcome any suggestion you might make for a speaker on the St. Lawrence Seaway Project (tentative date, Thursday, February 2).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Gibson\nProfessor of History.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR,\n\nUnless notified to the contrary, I will be available for the evening of January 19 for the talk referred to in the attached correspondence.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nENCL.\nNovember 9th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department directs your attention to the necessity of the most careful examination of application forms in regard to Indian children who are presented for admission to residential schools. I have, therefore, to invite your attention to, and compliance with, the subjoined facts and instructions.\n\nOn the \"Application for Admission\" form, the agent signs the following declaration: \"I hereby approve of the admission of the above child and certify that he is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\"\n\nThere is a departmental ruling to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life or a reserve are eligible for admission to the boarding and industrial schools, or, more fully: \"While it was not considered that the children of half-breeds proper of Hamilton and the Prairie Provinces should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. However, every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a half-breed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been adopted by or otherwise brought into association with Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\"\n\nAt the time you forward an application, write a covering letter in the case of half-breed or non-Treaty children, giving your reasons for believing the child to be a charge on the Indian Department.\n\nWhen you have reason to believe that the accommodation of the boarding or industrial school is limited, preference should be given to orphan children or those that are neglected by their parents.\n\nExercise every care to ensure the placing of the child in a residential school under the auspices of the religious denomination to which the parents adhere. No Roman Catholic child shall be sent to a Protestant school and vice versa. You will please adhere strictly to this provision of the Act. (See Section 10 (4) of the Indian Act.) Concerning the age of applicants for admission to our residential schools, only in very exceptional cases will the Department authorize the admission of any child other than between the ages of 7 and 13 inclusive.\n\nCheck carefully all applications that come before you, giving particular attention to the age, religion and status of the applicant before asking the Department to admit them as grant-earning pupils to a boarding or industrial school.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDear Mr. Walter,\n\nPlease be good enough to read and accept this article.\n\nI should be glad to take up many copies of the publication containing it. Yours sincerely H.L.Bergan.\n\nWhat is the best method of teaching primitive people? The same as that of teaching primitive children, not by making them listen to lectures, but by making them work. They should take an active part in the work of the class. Gestures are more important than words. Doing something is more important than listening to a lecture. Body exercise will improve their health. They should know something about the geography of the world and have first place to places from country to country. In this way they will easily learn all that they are being taught.\n\nI applied these principles in my world-class. For this reason I bought a plot of ground (60 yards long by 30 yards wide) in 1948. The pupils of my class laid out a world-garden in it. This garden was, as it were, a large map of the world.\n\nEach of the pupils had a little plot of ground of his own which represented a certain country. They sold the products of their own countries and, if possible, grew them in their own gardens. The world and their own countries were their \"center of interest\" for years and years.\n\nIn this way every teacher can use his own textbook. The pupils will be more receptive than in the old class. They will work in this world and the teacher will give them a useful general knowledge of this world instead of a dangerous knowledge of special subjects.\n\nH.L.Bergan, Student No. 11146, 1-5-49.\n11. What is the best method of teaching primitive peoples?\nThe same as that of teaching primitive children, which method is this? The method of working hard. The best method for primitives demands few new words and ideas, no jumping from one thing to another, one structure, only one building-up factor, which word unites the education from the primitives to farmer, practically and theoretically? This word is \"work\", movement, hard work is the base of the worldclass. Why an education without base? Without fundament? One word, unitwork is needed. The worldgarden will give an idea of this work.\n\nHow to make clear that hard work is needed for the rise of peoples? The answer is: by numbers numbers which demonstrate that hard work is the corner-stone of the building (rising) of generations and the world. Numbers as reliability-factors... not by making them listen to lectures but by making them work. They should take an active part in the work of the school. Gestures are more important than words. Especially primitives are poor in words, but movements can say much. A gesture to ear, eye, or mouth can say sentences like: hear, see, be silent.\n\nThe method of movements before productively, in stead of reproduction. For in the art of teaching, the great art of teaching primitives is: how can these movements be made ten times more instructive? By movements in the worldgarden. The world is reviewed from 26 different points of view (branches of the curriculum). There is, consequently, some repetition which will serve a useful purpose as revision and production - in stead of reproduction.\n\nIdleness is the root of all evil. Movements are the root of saying, creating, eating, breathing. To act and say sentences like the above mentioned is double as instructive. The productive method is worth twice as much as the reproductive. Movements from place to place can be double as instructive again, for the memory of place is the strongest, especially with primitives. Even fictive movements are tenfold instructive within the worldclass.\n\nMovements can be tried as instructive as reproduction from books. Four times more instructive can be movements, then going from place to place. This multiplied instructiveness is doubled if the place lies in a fixed, regular, symmetric structure like the worldclass. These movements for primitives 10 times more instructive than the reproductive... the art of teaching.\n\nA number of experts have come to this conclusion here.\n\nI put these principles into practice in my worldgarden and worldclass. For this reason I bought a plot of ground (50 yards long, by 30 yards) in 1945. The pupils of my class laid out a worldgarden in it.\n\nThis garden was, as it were, a large map of the world. Every pupil occupies his country, has his place, which is indicated by a number denoting the longitude and the latitude of the country, on a square or field. If need be without frontiers this plain or field represents the world as a world-wide farmland representing the grasslands, etc., in 35 countries. In 35 places or pupils on the field or in the classroom without the map-character.\n\nGiven without frontiers for the world the class can play there all branches. The pupils grow the food, fictively or in reality. They are instructed in order to become servants of the Uncsoo. They sell their product and keep their book (book-keeping).\n\nHow to make the reproductive method productive? One of the pupils e.g. lives in San Francisco, California; his name is chosen from the environment and his surname, but, from one of its products, Cal Nut. From this name the class evolves a sentence from 33 names 33 sentences, self-made. This lesson in 10 tenses, 10 persons, 10 forms, with 10 determinations (adjectives), consequently so in 10,000 forms is an introduction to the book \"The world\".\n\nAfterwards in 4 languages. Every teacher can type and multiply his own book. His mind has a natural tendency to reject the other books. Translations of the book are to be learned in one tenth of the time, for the move this are known, the succession, the composition too.\n\nStadskanaal, Holland, ... H.J. Borgman. 1-9-49.\nSchool, food and people.\n\nFundamental education. Movement is the fundamental question.\n\nHow are we to fight famine in this devastated world? How are we to cultivate enough food for the rapidly increasing population of the world? How are we to secure a higher standard of living? How can we prevent slums and unemployment? In short, how can we build a better world, create mutual understanding and secure a feeling of safety?\n\nBy a change in food production. Hard work. The change that would most increase food production would be to transform the present predominantly peasant type of rural economy to a mixed farm type as adopted in the more advanced countries.\n\nWhile increases in food production can be confidently expected, they will certainly involve considerable work and much scientific study. There is no prospect of easy living.\n\n1000 of millions of people suffer from food shortage now.\n\nEvery year the population of the world increases by 1%. But every year the area of food-producing soil decreases by 2%.\n\nWhat will the situation be like after a century? After a comparatively short time the population will be doubled, the cultivated soil halved, the need quadruples.\n\nHow can double the population be fed on half the cultivated soil?\n\nThis is possible, if:\n\nFirst - the food-shortage is fought not,\nSecondly - the farmer-to-be (peasant) not is disaccustomed\nfrom hard work, from vigorous movements,\nThirdly - the farmers are given an agricultural-scientific\neducation, prepared in the primary school,\nFourthly - we prevent the hoarding of food for the next war,\nif the world restore this as world, as unity.\n\nIn 1870 the war was won by the teacher. In 1970 the war will be won by the teacher who gives his pupils a good technical education (electricity, etc.). The pupils should be taught, not only to fight in a military war, but also to fight food-shortage and unemployment.\n\nUnemployment increases with the poverty in the world. The more-sale of the U.S.A. was every year 600 million dollar.\n\nIn June 1949 there were four millions of unemployed labourers.\n\nThis proves that even the richest nation of the world cannot fight unemployment successfully in its own country.\n\nUnemployment is an international problem.\n\nIf new agricultural countries produce and sell more agricultural products, they can buy more and fight unemployment.\n\nHow to increase this production? In 1850 Mr. Van Hoek came to Noord-Brabant, a province of the Netherlands, as a teacher of agriculture. At the time there was only one dairy-factory in the whole province. In 1857 there were 125 dairy-factories, with a large export-trade, and less unemployment also in the other parts.\n\nTo increase the number of these factories in this district from 1 to 125 takes up less energy and time than to raise that number from 125 to 250. Therefore the best plan is to begin with the development of underdeveloped regions. Unesco tries to educate the backward nations. They should be quickly educated. Their soil should be cultivated and their agriculture be developed.\n\nThis is an international experiment of the greatest importance, because national experiments are bound to fail.\n\nSound agricultural instruction is essential. The guidance of the Unesco is necessary. The agricultural instruction should be adapted to the country where it is given. Already in the primary school physics and biology should more frequently be taught.\n\nThe elementary school will give this preparation without to be technical. With the view to education in agriculture and hygiene the class is as a worldwide fixed form in the classroom. The pupils, the desks are the countries, 3x1 countries, symmetric, regular, in the same structure as the numbers, one structure and not more.\n\nBy more structures there are orders and contra-orders with the physical distress, the psychological press with the stuttering, with the destroy instead of the construction.\nJanuary 17th, 1950.\n\nMr. B.F.

Our Branch endeavours to guide Indian pupils into channels for which they are best suited. In many cases these Indian children adjust themselves quite well to this different mode of life and become assimilated into the communities of Canada.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 17, 1950\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY\n\nRe: International Labour Office\n\nIn the beginning, Indian Affairs introduced Indian boys and girls activities by an integrated programme of studies. Following its first phase Indian boys and girls are gradually introduced to special training - the boys to shop work which includes mechanics, woodwork, gardening, farming, metalwork and leatherwork - the girls to Domestic Science which includes cooking, housekeeping, sewing, weaving, gardening and leatherwork. As soon as these students show aptitude and desire they are placed in provincial or privately operated trade schools. Indian girls and boys have been encouraged to complete their academic training and take business training such as nursing and teaching. The Department employs Indian teachers in its own schools, while a number of Indians are teaching in provincial schools. The Department also employs Indians in its other services.\n\nIndian Affairs endeavours to guide Indian pupils into channels for which they are best suited. In many cases these Indian children adjust themselves quite well to the new method of life and are making successes of their careers.\n\nA.J.

The attached newspaper article describes the work of our welfare teacher at Fort McPherson. Three years ago there was no school at Fort McPherson and most of these Indians had never been educated.\n\nI will let Miss Hinds' article describe the changes which have resulted since the little day school has been established for these Indians and their children. I would emphasize that we are trying to do more than merely educating the Indian children. This article should convince the members of the Treasury Board that communities such as this are desperately in need of educational facilities. We have been able to provide them at Fort McPherson - we can only provide them at similar Indian communities elsewhere if funds are available. Mr. Bryce and the other members of the Treasury Board might also read with profit the article which recently appeared in the Toronto Star on \"Higher Education at Caughnawaga\". There they will read how we are trying to educate the Indians of the southern regions into Canadian citizenship. There our problem is entirely different and it is a matter of providing facilities for higher education for Indians rather than the simple elementary education provided in such places as Fort McPherson.\n\nIt might be also pointed out that our schools have for years lagged behind the provincial schools. We are now\ndevoting every effort to improving our educational standards. That we are succeeding is best illustrated by the article on Caughnawaga - entirely unsolicited and written without prior knowledge of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nBernard F.

Also attached are copies of a mimeographed memorandum furnishing general information in regard to the course. Of the quota of 80 set for Mines and Resources, 10 have been allocated to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and I believe that of this number 10 might be assigned to your Branch.\n\nIt is desired to make full use of this course and I would be glad to have the names of those officers that you think would benefit most from participating therein and as a result would become more useful members of our organization. For the initial course, at least, it is thought that senior officers should be given the preference but this may have to be varied to meet special circumstances.\n\nThe course may be taken by those located at Ottawa and away from Ottawa, and there should be a fair division of your quota.\n\n(sgd) Laval Fortier\nDeputy Minister\nCitizenship and Immigration\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\nCANADA\n\nSTAFF TRAINING DIVISION\nOTTAWA, January 11, 1950\n\nMr. G.W. Jackson,\nDirector of Administration & Personnel,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nRe: Correspondence Course - Office Management\n\nFollowing a recommendation made by a sub-committee of the Interdepartmental Committee on Staff Training, the Officers of the staff of the Comptroller of the Treasury prepared a correspondence course in Office Management. The course was offered to their supervisory personnel with gratifying results and the basic material of the course was made available to the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission who have adapted it for presentation to supervisory employees of all government departments across Canada. The course is available in English and the subject matter is to be translated into French so that during subsequent enrolments it will be available in both languages.\n\nTo facilitate the setting up of records and controls and to give each department an opportunity of offering the course to its senior supervisors before junior personnel are enrolled, it appears desirable to enrol candidates on a quota basis rather than to advertise the course by means of posters. Such a procedure will also permit the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission to obtain comments from senior employees before the course is offered to others.\n\nAllotment of courses has been made on a per capita basis and your quota has been set at 30. Candidates for the most part should come from the supervisory group but this does not preclude the enrolment of potential supervisors if they are recommended. Quotas should be equitably divided between Ottawa offices and offices outside Ottawa.\n\nThe course will start on February 28th, 1950 and allowing for a two month summer recess and for a two week Christmas holiday, the Final Examination will be held in February 1951. For more details about the mechanics of this course, please refer to the attached \"General Information\" and \"Course Outline\" which will be forwarded to each student by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission when registration is completed.\n\nTo help students put theory into practice, instructional matter of each paper will be followed by topics for group study. This is an important aspect of the course. It will help students to apply the principles advocated in the course and will supply them with an opportunity for exchanging valuable ideas with civil servants from other sections of their own department or with members from other departments who encounter similar problems. Staff Training Officers in the field will be able to assist in organizing and coaching these study groups.\n\nMay the names and home addresses of your candidates be prepared by your department and forwarded to the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission not later than February 15, 1950.\n\n(Sgd) G.K. Smith, Training Officer.\nCORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN OFFICE MANAGEMENT\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n1. Origin of this course:\n\nThis course came into being as a result of a recommendation made by a sub-committee of the Interdepartmental Committee on Staff Training. It was originally prepared by Officers of the staff of the Comptroller of the Treasury and presented to their employees holding supervisory positions. It has now been revised by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission to adapt it for presentation to Civil Servants throughout the various government departments across the country.\n\n2. Purpose of the course:\n\nThe course has been designed to give personnel employed in a supervisory capacity and personnel who look forward to such responsibilities, some practical instruction in management techniques to help them acquire the knowledge and ability to handle an executive position more efficiently.\n\n3. Structure of the course:\n\na) Papers - The revised course is made up of twenty papers with a detachable assignment at the end of each. These assignments are of the objective type, namely: True-False, Multiple Choice, Completion or Matching types. A proper time limit for the completion of each assignment is two weeks. In this way every registrant will be able to have completed the necessary papers by the dates set for the Term-Tests. The corrected assignments will not be returned to candidates.\n\nb) Term Tests - A mid-term test will be forwarded to each candidate immediately after Paper X has been completed. This test will be of the Essay type and candidates will have two weeks to handle it. To be eligible to write this test, all of assignments 1 to 10 inclusive must have been received for correction by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission, Ottawa.\n\nA Final Test will be administered under supervision at specified centres across Canada. This test will be held about two weeks after completion of Paper XX. This test will also be of the Essay type and will be devised to ascertain whether candidates have applied or can apply to specific tasks the principles advocated in the course. To be eligible for this Final Test, all of assignments 11 to 20 as well as Mid Term must have been completed by each candidate.\n\n4. How to Study:\n\nInstructional matter contained in each paper should be mastered fully before attempting the assignment at the end of each paper. Likewise, time spent on studying references listed below would be time well spent. The assignments are done on your own and you should be able to answer questions without back-tracking to the paper itself. This is most important in order to derive maximum benefit from each paper. Where two or more candidates are located in the same area they may benefit by setting up a study group of their own. Suggested topics for such study groups are to be found at the end of each paper.\n5. References:\n\nMany interesting and enlightening books have been written on Office Management and Personnel Management. It is recommended that you study at least a few of these to supplement instructional matter contained in the twenty papers. Students are referred to the following which are probably available in departmental or public libraries.\n\nThe Office Supervisor - by Henry E. Miles and Mary C.H. Niles published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nTextbook of Office Management - by Leffingwell and Robinson published by McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\nManual of Practical Office Short Cuts - by National Office Management Assoc. published by McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\nOffice Management - a handbook by Coleman L.

Ratings:\n\nRatings will be based on the twenty assignments and the two term tests. An official certificate will be issued to successful candidates by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission.\n\n7.

Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: School Hours - Day Schools  \nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nI beg to inform you that there seems to be a lack of uniformity in school hours in the Day schools, Hobbema Indian Agency.\n\nCould I please receive an outline of the required teaching hours per day and also any deviations that may be made; for example, closing hours on Friday afternoons or late starting hours in winter months.\n\nIt would be appreciated if an indication was given of the time that is to be allotted to religious instruction by the various missionaries, per day or week.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth  \nSuperintendent  \nHobbema Indian Agency  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\n\nHNW/ehg\nPROGRAMME OF STUDIES FOR INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nThe programme of studies herein prescribed shall be followed by the teacher as far as the circumstances of the school permit. Any modifications deemed necessary should be made only with the sanction of the Branch.\n\nTextbooks: While in the case of most subjects, Provincial textbooks are used, it should be noted that the Indian Affairs Branch prescribes certain books which have been found specially suitable for Indian Schools. Particulars regarding these books may be obtained on application to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRequisitions: When preparing requisitions for school material ask only for those texts authorized above. The Indian Affairs Branch requires you to adhere strictly to this rule. Teachers will please note the instructions on the \"Requisition for School Material\" form No. 413. Indian agents will supply these forms.\n\nTEACHERS \u2014 NOTE THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS\n\nLanguage: Every effort must be made to induce pupils to speak English and to teach them to understand it. Insist on English even during the supervised play. Failure in this means wasted efforts. (In some schools in Quebec, where French is the classroom language, the word \"French\" should be substituted in the above instruction where the word \"English\" appears.)\n\nReading: Do not hear the children read, teach them to read. Do not use the phonetic method to teach beginners unless it is for children with serious disabilities. Remember reading is a basic skill. Great care should be taken to teach it properly. The primary division members should be grouped and regrouped for reading practice upon the basis of their reading ability and not upon the time spent in school. Pupils should be tested at the beginning of each year and grouped accordingly. Apply remedial measures whenever necessary.\n\nVocational: Teachers are expected to emphasize the importance of vocational instruction. Dressmaking, crochet work, knitting, hand loom weaving, elementary domestic science, gardening and care of poultry are recommended for girls; and elementary carpentry work, general shop, Indian handicrafts, gardening, and poultry raising for boys. At residential schools the care of livestock, auto mechanics and cultivation of land should be emphasized. Cultivation should conform to the requirements of the home of each pupil. This is especially true of residential schools where pupils come from different reserves.\n\nPhysical Education: Lay stress on physical activities that will strengthen the body and improve physique. Special attention should be given to outdoor group games, supervised play and exercises, accompanied by singing, to afford variation and improve physique.\n\nVocal Music: Simple songs and hymns; the theme of the former to be interesting and patriotic; the tunes bright and cheerful.\n\nReligious Instruction: Spiritual reading, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Life of Christ, etc.\n\nCharacter Training: Teachers will strive to develop the spirit of responsibility among the children, giving responsibility in turn, even in small things; gathering books, pencils, etc., for the smaller ones. Give greater responsibility as the child advances in age. Commend success and tactfully reprimand failures. Teachers will stress obedience, courtesy, cleanliness, self-respect, thrift, self-maintenance and patriotism. Cultivate honesty and the spirit of fair play. Teach respect of law, order, authority and public property. Explain the relation of the sexes as to labour, home and public duties.\nHealth Education: The object of health education is to have the pupils form worthwhile habits. Habits cannot be taught in the traditional way as book-learning; but must be acquired by constant practice. Methods must be worked out by the teacher, who will have the pupils make health posters, join classroom health activities and health games, etc. It is of the utmost importance that Indian pupils be taught to recognize the value of a well-balanced diet. Recommend the use of meat, milk and vegetables. The teacher should stress the relationship of such diet to physical fitness, growth and general health.\n\nGreat care must be exercised by the teacher to see that the school-room is kept thoroughly clean. The floor should be swept daily and scrubbed frequently. The air in the schoolroom should be completely changed during recesses and at the noon hour, even in the coldest weather, by the opening of windows and doors. Spitting on the floor, or inside the school building, should not be allowed. Cleanliness in the classroom as well as in the surrounding buildings and school yard is a definite phase of health education. Great stress will be emphasized on these by the teacher.\n\nGeneral: Whenever possible the teachers will employ the activity programme. Teachers must keep in mind that the text-book is but an educational instrument. Pupils must be well grouped according to their ability. Objective achievement tests should be used as frequently as necessary.\nMarch 3, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nSchool Hours - Day Schools\n\nReference your 112-6-3 of February 21\n\nThe hours of instruction and the arrangements for religious instruction will normally be the same as for schools under provincial control.\n\nDuring most of the year in Indian schools the hours will be:\n\nMornings 9.00 - 12.00\nAfternoons 1.30 - 4.00\n\nThrough November, December, January and February by arrangement between the Superintendent and the teachers the hours may be as follows:\n\nMornings 9.30 - 12.00\nAfternoons Terminating at 3.30\n\nYou will note the exceptions that may arise concerning the length of the noon intermission. During the months when the weather is severe and the daylight of shorter duration, as the children usually bring lunch to school, the noon intermission is usually reduced to one hour. In other months a longer noon intermission is usual, and it is expected that there will be supervised play.\nIt may be, however, that at some schools in your jurisdiction there exist certain conditions which require modification of the length of the noon hour. You should discuss these with the teacher and decide upon the schedule which seems to suit the particular situation best, so that, allowing for a recess of 15 minutes each morning and each afternoon, the hours of instruction may be:\n\n|       | Summer | Winter |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| Mornings | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours |\n| Afternoons | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours |\n\nDenominational religious instruction is allowable for one-half hour session each week. This period is to be regularly scheduled, and you should arrange, accordingly, with the missionary workers and teachers concerned that the visits of missionaries adhere to a regular schedule i.e., always on the same week day and at the same time, preferably the last half-hour of the afternoon session.\n\nWhere there are two or more denominational groups, arrangements should be made for them to receive instruction simultaneously. For example at Hobbema the United Church minority could receive instruction in the nearby manse. At Louis Bull the Roman Catholic minority could be sent to the nearby mission. At Montana there is no minority to be considered.\n\nYour attention is invited to the Department's suggestions to teachers as printed on the back cover of the register. A copy of these suggestions is attached. Under \"Religious Instruction\" an indication is given of the inter-denominational religious instruction recommended for those schools where denominational differences are\nnot accentuated and where specialists are not available to give instruction. In implementing these suggestions the teacher must ensure that nothing is included in the opening exercises or other lessons to all the pupils that would be a cause for disharmony.\n\nBernard F.

Neary:\n\nCould you kindly obtain the following information. I have on hand two samples of minerals, which were given to me by two Indians and they would like to have them assayed. I have heard that I can have them tested in Ottawa by the Government. I understand that the Dept. of Mines will make the assay. I would like to know to whom I should address the samples and how much would the test cost. One of the samples contains tin and I have seen the territory where the samples were taken. I expect the Indians back from the trap lane this month and they will stay around a few days and then go back for muskrat trapping; they would like to have news of the assay before they leave for the North.\n\nI have heard that the Indian Dept. intends to establish a new Agency at Nakina; if this is so, my we have a Catholic Agent. Most of our Indians in this district are Catholics. Fr. Rolland and myself have two men in view.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. M.J.

Grantham, Education Division, Northwest Territories Administration, Department of Resources and Development, was re-elected Group Secretary-Treasurer. Mr. Jos. McCulley, Deputy Commissioner of Penitentiaries, Department of Justice, and Mr. Ted Parkinson, Director, Staff Training Division, Department of Veterans Affairs, were elected as representatives on the Council of the Professional Institute. These officers comprise the Executive of the Group.\n\nThe Group decided to hold its next meeting on March 13, 1950, this to take the form of a dinner followed by short addresses from certain group members, the subject of each member's address to be based on his own particular work. Arrangements for this meeting were left in the hands of the Executive, which chose the following members to give these five minute addresses: Messrs. Ernest Lee, Jos. McCulley, John E. Lyon, H. C. Hudson, A. W. Crawford, B. F. Neary.\n\nThe dinner and meeting will be held in the dining room of the Albion Hotel, corner of Daly Avenue and Nicholas Street, commencing at 7:00 P.M. sharp.

Henry, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration.)\n\nDue to the time limit of ten minutes the speaker divided his talk into ten questions and answers covering the points most commonly asked about Indian education.\n\n1. Q. How many schools are operated by this Division?\n\nA. There are nearly 450 day school classrooms in operation, mainly one-room schools; there are 70 residential schools, 7 hospital schools and about 20 seasonal schools. There are also a few schools jointly operated with the provinces.\n\n2. Q. How many children are receiving education in these various schools?\n\nA. About 27,500.\n\n3. Q. What kind of schools are operated by your Division?\n\nA. The day schools are for Indians living on settled reserves. The residential schools are for welfare cases and the children of Indians whose parents earn their living by trapping and similar occupations. The hospital schools are for both children and adults in Indian hospitals. The seasonal schools are for Indians particularly in Northern Quebec and Ontario, who come out to trading posts for three or four months in the summer holidays. The joint schools are increasing in number and are operated for both Indians and Whites.\n\n4. Q. Where are these schools situated?\n\nA. They are located in each of the provinces, in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. The majority of the schools are in Ontario and British Columbia, which two provinces have the largest Indian populations.\n\n5. Q. How are the Day schools operated?\n\nA. By the Department with teachers being classified as Civil Servants mostly on a seasonal basis (ten month year).\n\n6. Q. How are the Residential schools operated?\n\nA. These are conducted for the Department by various religious denominations. A per capita grant is paid for the maintenance and education of each Indian child.\n\n7. Q. How many teachers of various types do you hire?\n\nA. There are over 450 teachers hired with nearly 400 being classified as school teachers and 30 as welfare teachers. These latter teach in the hospital schools and on isolated reserves where their duties are many and varied. We also hire a number of seasonal school teachers and part-time teachers.\n5. Q. What curriculum do you follow?\n\nA. With few exceptions we conform to that of the province in which the school is located. Special emphasis is of courses held to health and physical education and the stress in social studies is on Canadian history and geography.\n\n9. Q. What are your urgent educational problems?\n\nA. (a) Supervision and inspection of a widely scattered school system.\n(b) The building of schools in isolated districts.\n(c) The hiring of good teachers when the schools are isolated and so far from stores, doctors, etc.\n\n10. Q. How many Indians are receiving tuition benefits for higher education?\n\nA. There are nearly 400 Indian children receiving provincial secondary education including vocational training, teacher training and enrolled in university courses. There are also nearly 200 Indian children enrolled in secondary grades in our own schools.\nEDUCATION OF CANADA'S INDIANS\n\n(Summary of talk given to the Professional Institute of the Civil Service of Canada on March 13, 1950, by R.F.

Q. How many Indians are receiving tuition benefits for higher education?\nA. There are nearly 400 Indian children receiving provincial grants for education including vocational training, teacher training and students in university courses. There are also nearly 200 Indian children enrolled in secondary grades in our own schools.\nAs you know, considerable discussion has been carried on lately in the newspapers concerning changes in the Ontario curriculum which possibly will result in the elimination of entrance examinations.\n\nFor a number of years, children from the Quebec side of our Agency have been writing entrance examinations in Cornwall to qualify them for admission to Ontario high schools. If such Ontario Departmental examinations are now going to be discontinued, how will our children from our Quebec schools qualify for admission to an Ontario high school.\n\nI would be interested in obtaining all the information I possibly can concerning these changes as they affect our schools.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nOttawa, March 25, 1950.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nChanges in Ontario Curriculum\n\nReference your 33/25-1 of March 20\n\nThe projected changes in the Ontario system of education amount to the introduction of a junior high school. I understand that the Entrance examinations will still be held this year and that the elimination of these tests will not take place until 1951.\n\nI will be seeing the officials of the Ontario Department of Education in Toronto in April, when I will further discuss the problem of children from the Quebec side of your agency being qualified for admission to Ontario high schools.\n\nIn view of the fact that most of your pupils attend Ontario high schools, it might be advisable to have all your schools follow the Ontario course of study. This of course would be a serious change and we would require more detailed information than we have at the present time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 27, 1950.\n\nRegistrar,\nScarritt College,\nRural Centre,\nCrossville, Tennessee.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOne of our teachers has attended your Rural Centre and has written favourably to our Department concerning the courses which you offer there.\n\nCould you please send me the bulletin of your courses so that we may advise any other of our teachers who might wish to attend your college during the coming summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/WMoN\nOttawa, March 31, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1939-1949\n\nMany changes have taken place in Indian education during the past 10 years. The following statistics will show the growth of the Indian school population during that time:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Day Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Total (All Schools) Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1938-39     | 9,179                         | 8,276              | 9,573                 | 6,232              | 18,752                        | 14,508             | 77.36                   |\n| 1948-49     | 9,368                         | 8,345              | 12,511                | 10,320             | 21,983                        | 18,759             | 85.33                   |\n\nYou will note that the total includes more than the pupils at the residential and the day schools as there are a number of children attending joint schools.\n\nThe greatest growth in school population has taken place during the past 3 years. For example, in the year ending March 1949, the enrolment at day schools had increased by 1,529 pupils.\n\nIn addition to the 21,983 pupils shown above, there were 925 Indian children in elementary grades and 377 in secondary grades in provincial schools. This meant a total of 23,285 Indian pupils enrolled in educational classes. It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of school age children until the next census is completed. The 1944 census showed 28,429 children between the ages\nof 7 and 16. It is therefore safe to estimate that there are now about 31,000 of school age. This means that there are over 7,000 children for whom no educational facilities are yet provided.\n\nPercentage of Attendance\n\nDuring the past few years there has been a steady increase in the percentage attendance. This is particularly noticeable in Indian day schools where formerly the pupils attended irregularly. The day school attendance, however, is now improving steadily as a result of family allowance payments, the better calibre of teachers employed, the improvement in classroom techniques and equipment, and finally the awakening interest of Indian parents in the education of their children. We intend to stimulate this interest by the formation of Parent-Teacher groups, adult education classes, and other community movements.\n\nEducation in Association with Other Children\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, we have been accomplishing major changes in having more Indian children admitted to white schools. In British Columbia alone the number has increased from about 200 in September 1948 to nearly 700 in September 1949. We will continue to work towards the admission of more Indian children to provincial schools in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee.\n\nErection of New Schools\n\nThe number of new schools erected can best be illustrated by the fact that the Department hired 285 day school teachers in 1948 and is now employing nearly 450. This growth represents the opening of new schools and also additions to existing facilities.\n\nAt residential schools we have erected several classroom blocks and one dormitory block. One new residential school is presently under construction and the tender has been let for the erection of another. Both of these are in northern Canada.\nImprovement in the calibre of teachers\n\nUnless good teachers are appointed to fill the new classrooms being provided, educational progress among the Indians will not continue to improve. Therefore, the department has been constantly weeding out unqualified and inefficient teachers and replacing them with certificated teachers as conditions permit.\n\nIn spite of the great teacher shortage which presently exists, we have been able to accomplish a great deal during the past 3 years. A review of the situation can best be presented graphically as follows:\n\n| Day School Teacher Percentages | January 1948 | January 1950 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grade 1 (Third Class or no certificate) | 34 % | 22 % |\n| Grade 2 (Second Class Certificate) | 30 % | 25 % |\n| Grade 3 (First Class Certificate) | 27 % | 39 % |\n| Grade 4, Principals and Welfare Teachers | 9 % | 14 % |\n\nTo summarize the above statistics, you will note that we have reduced the number of non-qualified teachers from one third of our staff to nearly one fifth of our staff in a space of 3 years. During the same time we have increased the number of teachers with First Class Certificates from 27% to 39%.\n\nSecondary Education\n\nThere has been a steady increase in the number of Indian children who are enrolled in the secondary grades. In the academic year ending June 1949 there were 277 children in high school grades in provincial schools and 284 in our own schools.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 31, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nROYAL COMMISSION ON INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nIndian Education 1939-1949\n\nMany changes have taken place in Indian education during the past 10 years.

We will continue to work towards the admission of more Indian children to provincial schools in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee.\n\nErection of New Schools\n\nThe number of new schools erected can best be illustrated by the fact that the department hired 285 day school teachers in 1946 and is now employing nearly 450. This growth represents the opening of new schools and also additions to existing facilities.\n\nAt residential schools we have erected several classroom blocks and one dormitory block. One new residential school is presently under construction and the tender has been let for the erection of another. Both of these are in northern Canada.\nImprovement in the calibre of teachers\n\nUnless good teachers are appointed to fill the new classrooms being provided, educational progress among the Indians will not continue to improve. Therefore, the department has been constantly weeding out unqualified and inefficient teachers and replacing them with certificated teachers as conditions permit.\n\nIn spite of the great teacher shortage which presently exists, we have been able to accomplish a great deal during the past 3 years. A review of the situation can best be presented graphically as follows:\n\n| Day School Teacher Percentages | January 1948 | January 1950 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grade 1 (Third Class or no certificate) | 34 %         | 22 %         |\n| Grade 2 (Second Class Certificate) | 30 %         | 25 %         |\n| Grade 3 (First Class Certificate) | 27 %         | 39 %         |\n| Grade 4, Principals and Welfare Teachers | 9 %          | 14 %         |\n\nTo summarize the above statistics, you will note that we have reduced the number of non-certified teachers from one third of our staff to nearly one fifth of our staff in a space of 3 years. During the same time we have increased the number of teachers with First Class Certificates from 27% to 39%.\n\nSecondary Education\n\nThere has been a steady increase in the number of Indian children who are enrolled in the secondary grades. In the academic year ending June 1949 there were 377 children in high school grades in provincial schools and 284 in our own schools.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP & IMMIGRATION\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nOttawa, March 16th, 1950.\n\nTO: Principals of\nIndian Residential Schools\n\nQuarterly Return\nQuarter Ending March 31st, 1950.\n\nIt has been impressed on the Principals of\nResidential Schools that the quarterly return should be\nprepared at the end of each quarter and forwarded promptly\nto the Department through the office of your Superintendent.\n\nHowever, many Principals evidently delay\npreparation of the return, as many of the returns do not\nreach the Indian Affairs Branch until 4 or 5 weeks following\nthe end of the quarter, and in several instances, the\nBranch has found it necessary to write Principals regarding\na delayed return.\n\nIn future, we expect that each and every Principal\nwill forward the quarterly return immediately following\nthe close of the quarter.\n\nThis year we are particularly anxious to have\nthe March quarter return reach us promptly, and therefore,\nwe will expect this return to reach Ottawa not later than\nApril 15th, 1950.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 27, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL ACLAND\n\nEducation of Indians\n\nPlease find attached a statement of statistics which should do a great deal to correct the misstatements made by Brigadier Martin.\n\nThe figures show that we have reduced now to about 6 or 7000, the number of children for whom educational facilities are provided. The number of day school classrooms has risen from 285 to nearly 450 within the last three years.\n\nWe can not provide statistics for the qualifications of teachers in residential schools as these are controlled by the denominations concerned. In the day schools, however, we can definitely report on the improved qualifications of our teachers.\n\nIn 1948 we hired 352 day school teachers of whom 120 (or 34%) had only teaching permits, licenses or no certificate. We had 97 teachers (or 28%) with First Class Certificates and 120 (or 34%) with Second Class Certificates.\n\nIn January 1950 we were hiring 432 teachers of whom 95 (or 22%) were Grade 1 teachers, 172 (or 40%) were Grade 3 teachers and 109 (or 26%) were Grade 2 teachers.\n\nA review of this situation can be presented graphically hereunder:\n\n| Teachers | January 1948 | January 1950 |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|\n| Grade 1  | 34%         | 22%          |\n| Grade 2  | 32%         | 26%          |\nTeachers\n\nJanuary 1948 | January 1950\n---|---\nGrade 3 | 28% | 40%\nGrade 1, Principals and Welfare teachers | 6% | 12%\n\nIn other words, we have reduced the number of non-qualified teachers from 1/3 of our staff to 1/5 in a space of two years. We have increased the number of teachers with First Class Certificates from 28% to 40%.\n\nSECONDARY EDUCATION\n\nWe have noted Brigadier Martin's statement concerning part-time education. This did apply to our schools three years ago but we have greatly reduced the number of schools in which the children are not fully occupied in classroom work. By the introduction of labor-saving devices such as potatoe peelers, washing machines etc. and by the large increase in the per capita grants we have attempted to make the school management less dependent on the use of children for work in the schools.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs I was dictating the above information, there was placed on my desk a letter from the Canadian Education Association outlining the shortage of teachers in schools across Canada. Several provinces report schools closed because of the lack of teachers and the number opened but without qualified teachers is indeed a revelation. There are 750 such schools in Nova Scotia, 703 in Saskatchewan, 609 in New Brunswick, 603 in Manitoba and even 300 in Ontario. I, therefore, feel that our day schools have little to be criticized in this regard.\n\nEncl:\n\nBernard F.

MACKAY.\n\nThe following question asked by Mr. Diefenbaker has been made an Order for Return, Votes and Proceedings No. 26, Page 158: \"1. How many appointments to the Civil Service (a) Permanent; (b) temporary, were made by the Civil Service Commission month by month from the first of January 1949, to the first of February 1950, both inclusive? 2. How many appointments were made to the Civil Service (a) other than by the Civil Service Commission or (b) after certificate granted by the said Commission?\"\n\nParts 1 and 2(b) will be answered by the Civil Service Commission. Will you please furnish a statement in answer to Part 2(a) - month by month for the period covered by the question. If there is any explanation required to cover any large number of appointments it may be indicated, for example school teachers.\n\n(Sgd.) W. C. Bethune.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your 1-1-1 (E), March 25th, please be advised that for a number of years we have found it necessary to follow as closely as possible in our Quebec schools the Ontario course of studies. This has been possible, of course, through the splendid cooperation given by Mr. Wescott who has been our inspector for a number of years and is thoroughly conversant with our situation here. What would happen should Mr. Wescott ever be changed to another district would be hard to predict. I might add that Mr. Matthews, the Ontario inspector, has been very sympathetic as well in this matter. No doubt if a permanent solution could be worked out it would be much better for all concerned.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn of any further developments following your interview with officials of the Ontario Department of Education next month.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nMarch 3, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nSchool Hours - Day Schools\n\nReference your 112-6-3 of February 21\n\nThe hours of instruction and the arrangements for religious instruction will normally be the same as for schools under provincial control.\n\nDuring most of the year in Indian schools the hours will be:\n\nMornings 9.00 - 12.00\nAfternoons 1.30 - 4.00\n\nThrough November, December, January and February by arrangement between the Superintendent and the teachers the hours may be as follows:\n\nMornings 9.30 - 12.00\nAfternoons Terminating at 3.30\n\nYou will note the exceptions that may arise concerning the length of the noon intermission. During the months when the weather is severe and the daylight of shorter duration, as the children usually bring lunch to school, the noon intermission is usually reduced to one hour. In other months a longer noon intermission is usual, and it is expected that there will be supervised play.\nIt may be, however, that at some schools in your jurisdiction there exist certain conditions which require modification of the length of the noon hour. You should discuss these with the teacher and decide upon the schedule which seems to suit the particular situation best, so that, allowing for a recess of 15 minutes each morning and each afternoon, the hours of instruction may be:\n\n|        | Summer | Winter |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mornings | 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) hours | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours |\n| Afternoons | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours |\n\nDenominational religious instruction is allowable for one-half hour session each week. This period is to be regularly scheduled, and you should arrange, accordingly, with the missionary workers and teachers concerned that the visits of the missionaries adhere to a regular schedule i.e., always on the same week day and at the same time, preferably the last half-hour of the afternoon session.\n\nWhere there are two or more denominational groups, arrangements should be made for them to receive instruction simultaneously. For example at Hobbsma the United Church minority could receive instruction in the nearby mission. At Louis Bull the Roman Catholic minority could be sent to the nearby mission. At Montana there is no minority to be considered.\n\nYour attention is invited to the Department's suggestions to teachers as printed on the back cover of the register. A copy of these suggestions is attached. Under \"Religious Instruction\" an indication is given of the inter-denominational religious instruction recommended for those schools where denominational differences are\nnot accentuated and where specialists are not available to give instruction. In implementing these suggestions the teacher must ensure that nothing is included in the opening exercises or other lessons to all the pupils that would be a cause for disharmony.\n\n(sgd.)

Chouinard, Meadow Lake Indian Day School.\n\nConsideration might also be given to replacing Mr. W.F. Cavanaugh, at the St. Francis Indian Day School. Mr. Cavanaugh is doing fairly good work, but is quite aged, and is doing nothing but strictly classroom work.\"\nI believe that the time has been reached when we should discontinue employing aged teachers at Indian day schools. It is beginning to appear to me that Saskatchewan teachers are now realizing that salaries at Indian day schools are fairly good, and the number of applications from well qualified teachers is gradually increasing. However, there is also another increase which is not so promising, and that is the increase in the number of teachers who, having retired from Saskatchewan schools, on pension, try to get into our service. If they are too old to teach white schools they are certainly too old to teach Indian schools. It is time for us to start weeding out our presently employed aged teachers and to refuse to accept any more of them. In this connection I refer particularly to such cases as the case of Mrs. B.C. Eugenie Thomas, referred to in Department Letter of March 17th, 1956, File 1-1-12 (S), who is applying for a teaching position, and such teachers as Miss Moore, Mrs. Stewart, Mr. Domachy, Mrs. Burbridge, Mr. Cavanaugh, Mr. Redner, Mr. Monaghan, and Mr. Pick, to mention some of them. We need to cheer them up, their careers in front of them, rather than behind them. This fact is especially emphasized at this time because of the fact that our teachers, if young and well qualified, can become permanent Civil Servants, making a career of their work, and having a substantial superannuation at the end. There is also the other important factor which must be considered, and that is the fact that most of these teachers who have retired from Provincial schools have done so because they were too old to want to, or be able to, comply with new and improved teaching methods. They come to our service hoping that we are so old fashioned that we won't ask them to change their methods. If there is any one thing needed more than any other thing in our Indian education, it is a willingness to continually change for the better.\nIt is very difficult for elderly people to change, at least they do not, whether we hope they will, or not.\n\nWhen you are discussing this matter with the Deputy Minister I feel that Mr. Ostrander's views should be presented to him.\n\nIt is very difficult for the Department to decide in each of these eight cases as some of the teachers may be doing good work in the classroom but not impressing the Indian Superintendents in other ways. Naturally, our Indian Superintendents are not professional educators and are not qualified to report upon the teaching efficiency of these various teachers. This places me in a difficult predicament in that we have only non-committal Provincial School Inspectors' reports on most of these teachers. I need a frank report from one of my own School Inspectors so that a proper decision can be reached on the proposed replacement of such of these eight teachers.\n\nWe are now employing 478 teachers in this Division, and with no adequate supervision system, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the efficiency of our educational system. The need for these Regional Inspectors is so apparent that even the Civil Service Commission Investigator has recommended the establishment of such positions.\n\nBernard F.

Ontario School Inspectors' Association\n\nThis meeting took place on Monday April 10 and as usual, the officials from this Branch were made welcome to these meetings which are restricted otherwise to Ontario school inspectors. The main discussions were on the new curriculum for grades 7, 8 and 9. Reports were received from the various committees which had been established for each subject of the course of study. There was heated discussion from the floor concerning the revised curriculum and we were able to get valuable advanced information concerning the changes in the Ontario course of study.\n\nAt the annual luncheon of the Ontario School Inspectors' Association we were very pleased with the reception given to the choir from the Six Nations No. 2 Indian Day School. There were only 8 girls in this group but they performed most admirably under the direction of their teacher, Miss Jamieson. We received many personal compliments from the school inspectors after the luncheon concerning the fine singing of these Indian girls.\n2. Education Association Lectures\n\nThe three outstanding lectures were given by Dr. A. S. Artley of the University of Missouri, Sir Alfred Zimmern of Oxford University and the Honourable Dana Porter, Minister of Education for Ontario.\n\nDr. Artley is a specialist in the teaching of the language arts and his two lectures on \"Helping Children Become Independent in Word Attack\" and \"Vocabulary Development\" were most applicable to our Indian schools. I was able to obtain valuable notes and will later write an article for our Indian School Bulletin on the information thus received.\n\nSir Alfred Zimmern's lecture was on \"Education for Life in the Atomic Age\". His address was given before several thousand people and was an outstanding example of the ability of a trained lecturer to hold the attention of even a large audience. His philosophy of education is exemplary for all teachers in a democracy and his lecture left a vivid impression of the importance of the work of the teacher.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Porter's address was concerned with the new curriculum for Ontario.\n\nI also attended other lectures on social studies in the primary grades and on rhythmical activities in the junior grades.\n\n3. Meetings with Officials of the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nAs every school inspector is required to attend this meeting, I was naturally able to solve many problems with regard to our many Indian day schools in this province. Their co-operation is always most keenly appreciated and much correspondence can be avoided by this annual meeting.\n\nI attended a meeting with Dr. Brown, the Registrar of Teachers, and Mr. Elborn, the Superintendent of Professional Training. At the present time, teachers in Ontario can obtain teaching certificates after two years of teaching, two good\ninspector's reports and two professional summer schools. However, such teachers are required to sign a statement certifying that they will teach for at least one year in a provincial school after obtaining such a certificate.\n\nI was able to gain a valuable concession from this regulation and in future our Indian school teachers will be able to obtain certificates without signing such a declaration. As I have at least five teachers in this predicament now, I feel that this effort was indeed worth while.\n\nI also met Mr. Cannon, the Superintendent of Elementary Education, concerning joint schools in the northern part of the province, and Mr. J. G. Walsh, concerning future plans for joint schools.\n\n4. Meetings with Officials of Church Denominations\n\nI met Dr. Dorey and Mrs. Loveys on Wednesday April 12 and will submit separate reports concerning the various schools and problems which were discussed.\n\nUnfortunately, the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church was absent from Toronto on holidays and I was unable to meet her, as I usually do.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n129 Jameson Ave.\nToronto 3.\nOntario.\n\n27th Feb. '60.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI have just discovered that you are a friend of Dr. Gaitshell's (I taught Indian craft on his summer course for teachers two years ago) so I phoned him today to enquire whether you ever had headquarters in Toronto. He said not but that you did come to Toronto occasionally. I suggested I should write and ask whether you might care to see me. I would perhaps very kindly let me know when you would be in Toronto.\n\nI came to Canada ten years ago to study Indians. I married a treaty Indian and am a member of Lake Nipissing Reserve. I put a brief in the Project Manual Committee re Indian craft.\n\nAt present I am collecting information for a Who's who of talented Indians which I hope to reproduce in mimeograph.\ncomes later - under the heading of each province will be lists of Indians talented in crafts, painting, writers, leadership, woodcraft, singers etc. - a list Indian organizations or white people actively interested in Indians.\n\nThis would provide some communication by which both Indians & whites could hear of talented Indians & contact them.\n\nI am doing this as much as possible directly through Indians, many of whom are quite active in the field. I am also collecting paintings by Indians, portraits if they can be had from me for exhibition - e.g., Gaitskill would like to show them at his summer course.\n\nI am greatly interested in Indian affairs in general, a topic of the subject which I would greatly appreciate an opportunity of discussing with you. Various commercial Indians have suggested our I contact you - the whole subject is one\nI have already had a meeting with Mr. Asher, but he does not.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGisela Commanda\n\nPlease kindly return my enclosures.\n\nNews cutting, 2 photos.\n\nI have made recordings for the B.B.C. Commonwealth Women's programme on present day Canadian Indians.\nMarch 7, 1950.\n\nDear Mrs. Commanda:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 27 and while I may not be going to Toronto myself, here is a possibility of Mr. I. Eisenhardt our Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation may be there in April.\n\nI am passing to him your letter and clippings so that he can write to you when the date has been settled for his visit there.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Gisella Commanda,\n129 Jameson Ave.,\nToronto 3, Ont.,\n\nBFN/HM\nToronto 2, April 14, 1950.\n\nMr. D. M. MacKay,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you be good enough to inform me of the most reliable sources of information in regard to education for Indians, particularly in Ontario, and to forward any official pamphlets dealing with the question.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nHistoriographer.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 14th and regret to advise you that there is very little information available in printed form upon the education of Indians in Ontario.\n\nI am arranging to send you some of our annual reports but we do not have anything on the history of Indian education either in Ontario or in Canada. We are trying to interest graduate University students to consider such topics for their dissertations for the Ph.D. Degree.\n\nWe have all the old annual reports of the Department going back to Confederation and there is a wealth of material for such work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. G.N. Bramfitt,\nHistoriographer,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto 2, Ont.,\nDear Mr. Marr:\n\nReferring to your letter of April 11th, file No. 40654-W, I am forwarding you a statement showing the schools in Nova Scotia as requested by Miss E.

You will note that there are 32,421 Indians in Ontario.\n\nThe total population of Indians in Canada is now over 125,000 and the next province to Ontario in the number of Indians in population is British Columbia with 25,515.\n\nUnfortunately, it will take a few days to break down the schools by agencies as we do not readily have such statistics. However, I know you are anxious to obtain the number of Indians by agencies and I am therefore sending you this information immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This has resulted in a total increase during the one year of 2,615 (including children enrolled in combined schools).\n\nIn tables 2 and 3 are listed the Indian children enrolled in provincial and private schools. There are now 925 Indian children in elementary grades and 377 Indian children in secondary grades in such schools. Added to the totals above, this means that there are now 23,285 Indians enrolled in educational classes.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of attendance from 80.34 to 85.33 is also noteworthy. Children have been much more prompt in returning to Indian residential schools after the summer holidays. At Indian day schools, the attendance has steadily improved as a result of Family Allowance payments, the better calibre of teachers employed and improvements in classroom equipment and materials.\n\nThe building of new day schools and the opening of classroom blocks at residential schools has continued at a steady pace. The number of day schools increased during the year from 285 to 309 and extra classrooms were added to several schools. In all, nearly 90 more classrooms were provided in day and residential schools.\n\nThe Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons appointed to continue and complete the examination and consideration of the Indian Act, in its Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence\nNo. 5 covering the period Tuesday April 13, 1948, to and including Monday June 21, 1948, made the following recommendation concerning the operation of Indian schools:\n\n\"Your Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nTherefore, the Education Division has been negotiating with school boards and provincial Departments of Education for the training of Indian children in provincial schools. The following statement shows the enrolment of Indian children in such schools in the elementary grades:\n\nTable 2.\n\n| Provinces          | Grades |\n|--------------------|--------|\n|                    | I     | II    | III   | IV    | V     | VI    | VII   | VIII  | Totals |\n| Nova Scotia        | 7     | 1     | 6     | 3     | 4     | 4     | ...   | 1     | 26     |\n| New Brunswick      | 3     | 3     | 5     | 5     | 4     | 4     | 2     | 1     | 27     |\n| Quebec             | 5     | 6     | 6     | 12    | 15    | 13    | 12    | 8     | 77     |\n| Ontario            | 44    | 52    | 46    | 39    | 27    | 28    | 10    | 10    | 256    |\n| Manitoba           | 36    | 8     | 5     | 3     | 2     | 5     | 1     | ...   | 60     |\n| Saskatchewan       | 13    | 9     | 10    | 9     | 3     | 2     | 2     | ...   | 48     |\n| Alberta            | 19    | 5     | 5     | 5     | 5     | 4     | 1     | 3     | 47     |\n| British Columbia   | 99    | 81    | 51    | 37    | 38    | 28    | 24    | 19    | 377    |\n| U.

In addition to the 286 pupils enrolled in our own schools (as shown in table 4) the following summary shows the Indian children attending provincial and private schools in the secondary grades. This brings the total of Indians attending secondary schools and universities to 661.\nNo. 5 covering the period Tuesday April 13, 1948, to and including Monday June 21, 1948, made the following recommendation concerning the operation of Indian schools:\n\n\"Your Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nTherefore, the Education Division has been negotiating with school boards and provincial Departments of Education for the training of Indian children in provincial schools. The following statement shows the enrolment of Indian children in such schools in the elementary grades:\n\n| Provinces       | Grades |\n|-----------------|--------|\n|                 | I     | II   | III  | IV   | V    | VI   | VII  | VIII | Totals |\n| Nova Scotia     | 7     | 1    | 6    | 3    | 4    | 4    | ...  | 1    | 26     |\n| New Brunswick   | 3     | 3    | 5    | 5    | 4    | 4    | 2    | 1    | 27     |\n| Quebec          | 5     | 6    | 6    | 12   | 15   | 13   | 12   | 8    | 77     |\n| Ontario         | 44    | 52   | 46   | 39   | 27   | 28   | 10   | 10   | 256    |\n| Manitoba        | 36    | 8    | 5    | 3    | 2    | 5    | 1    | ...  | 60     |\n| Saskatchewan    | 13    | 9    | 10   | 9    | 3    | 2    | 2    | ...  | 48     |\n| Alberta         | 19    | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5    | 4    | 1    | 3    | 47     |\n| British Columbia| 99    | 81   | 51   | 37   | 38   | 28   | 24   | 19   | 377    |\n| U.S.A.          | 1     | 1    | 2    | ...  | ...  | ...  | 3    | ...  | 7      |\n| Totals          | 227   | 166  | 136  | 113  | 98   | 88   | 55   | 42   | 925    |\n\nThe number of Indians receiving secondary education continues to increase at a satisfactory rate. In addition to the 26% pupils enrolled in our own schools (as shown in table 4) the following summary shows the Indian children attending provincial and private schools in the secondary grades. This brings the total of Indians attending secondary schools and universities to 661.\nThe standard of teachers employed in our Indian day schools continues to show improvement. The number of non-qualified or Grade I teachers decreased by 15 and the number of teachers holding First Class certificates increased by 36. This trend in the hiring of day school teachers will continue to be departmental policy and we hope for the eventual elimination of non-certificated teachers entirely from our schools. At the present time the implementation of this policy is made difficult by the serious shortage of qualified teachers across Canada.\n\nThe supply of school textbooks and materials is now much better and we are able to provide our schools with teaching aids which have been difficult to obtain during the immediate post-war years. Our teachers are advised of the availability of this equipment through the medium of our teachers' magazine, the \"Indian School Bulletin\".\n\nThe provision of school lunch supplies has been extended and many day schools are now serving a hot meal daily. The distribution of vitamin biscuits was again made to day schools in Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe following tables include a summary of attendance, sex, religious and grade distribution, and a breakdown of attendance by provinces:\nEDUCATION\n\nThe table of pupil enrolment and attendance follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Day Schools Enrolment | Average Attendance | Total (All Schools) Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1939-40     | 9,027                         | 8,643              | 9,369                 | 6,417              | 18,396                      | 15,060             | 81.87                   |\n| 1940-41     | 8,774                         | 8,243              | 8,651                 | 6,110              | 17,425                      | 14,353             | 82.37                   |\n| 1941-42     | 8,840                         | 8,283              | 8,441                 | 5,837              | 17,281                      | 13,935             | 80.63                   |\n| 1942-43     | 8,830                         | 8,046              | 8,046                 | 5,395              | 16,876                      | 13,441             | 79.04                   |\n| 1943-44     | 8,729                         | 7,902              | 7,858                 | 5,355              | 16,587                      | 13,257             | 79.92                   |\n| 1944-45     | 8,865                         | 8,006              | 7,573                 | 5,159              | 16,438                      | 13,165             | 80.09                   |\n| 1945-46     | 9,149                         | 8,264              | 9,532                 | 6,601              | 18,805                      | 15,043             | 79.99                   |\n| 1946-47     | 9,304                         | 8,192              | 10,181                | 7,344              | 19,622                      | 15,641             | 79.91                   |\n| 1947-48     | 9,866                         | 7,863              | 10,982                | 8,178              | 20,101                      | 16,151             | 80.34                   |\n| 1948-49     | 9,368                         | 8,345              | 12,511                | 10,320             | 21,983                      | 18,759             | 85.33                   |\n| 1949-50     | 9,316                         | 8,593              | 14,093                | 12,060             | 23,409                      | 20,653             | 88.23                   |\n\nThe enrolment at residential schools has decreased slightly but there has been an increase in the day school enrolment of 1,582. Since 1947 there has been a total increase in day school enrolment of 3,111 pupils.\n\nIn tables 2 and 3 are listed the Indian children enrolled in provincial and private schools. There are now 1,120 Indian children in elementary grades and 465 Indian pupils in secondary schools. Added to the totals above, this means that there are now 25,054 Indians enrolled in educational classes.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of attendance reflects the effect of better teachers, schools and equipment and the increasing realization of the Indians of the need for education.\n\nThe building of new day schools has continued and the effect of this program can be seen in the increase in day school enrolment of over 3,000 pupils within the last two years. We are reducing the number of children for whom educational facilities are not provided and are building new schools in the northern sections of the provinces and in the Northwest Territories. Previously, many of these Indian children had no schools whatsoever.\n\nTable 2 shows an increase of nearly 200 children enrolled in provincial schools. New agreements are being negotiated now to further increase the number of Indian children attending such schools.\n\nIn table 3 it will be noted that the number of Indian children receiving secondary education continues to increase at a satisfactory rate. We now have 465 children attending secondary grades in provincial and\nprivate schools. In our own schools (as shown in table 4) we have a total of 369 children. This raises the total of Indians attending secondary schools and universities to 834 as compared with 661 pupils last year.\n\nTeachers at Indian Day Schools\n\nA steady improvement is shown in the qualifications and experience of teachers employed in our Indian day schools. The number of non-qualified or Grade One teachers decreased by 7 and the number of teachers holding First Class Certificates increased by 39. The raising of the standard of teaching has resulted in improved attendance and a reduction in \"drop-outs\". This is shown in table 4.\n\nVocational Education\n\nThe Supervisor of Vocational Education has reported that the Proficiency Badge system has proven quite successful. A total of 7,648 badges have now been distributed to Indian pupils for proficiency in various basic operations.\n\nIn day schools it is often difficult to encourage a programme of manual training because so many of our schools have but one teacher. In order to help these teachers and also other manual training teachers, two booklets have been prepared entitled \"First Year Woodwork\" and \"Second Year Woodwork\". A third book is in course of preparation.\n\nIn residential schools we are gradually securing the services of more and better qualified instructors. We are also beginning a programme of erecting small manual training shops at the larger schools.\n\nPhysical Education and Recreation\n\nA new supervisor has been recently appointed and is now conducting surveys at various reserves and schools. We have purchased considerable supplies of sports equipment and have encouraged athletic activities of various kinds. Our school teams have been particularly successful in hockey and several bantam, midget and juvenile championships have been won.\n\nA programme of adult education has been started and we intend to encourage further courses, particularly at day schools. Some home and school associations have been started and this new official will encourage the formation of others. It is felt that Indian parents must be encouraged to take an active interest in the education of their children.\nOttawa, May 25, 1950.\n\nCOLONEL NEARY:\n\nOne copy of statement on this file was sent to Miss E.

One of these aspects is what Unesco calls \"fundamental education\". This might be defined as the education ab initio of illiterate persons of all ages.\n\nSince the Indian Affairs Branch is concerned with the education of the native people of the North-West Territories and the Arctic, I should appreciate it if you could give me a brief report on the work which has been done in educating them.\n\nUnder-Secretary of State for External Affairs.\nOttawa, May 26, 1950.\n\nThe Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs,\nExternal Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFundamental Education\n\nReference your No. 5582-T-40 of May 17\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find attached copy of the report of the Education Division for the 1949-50 fiscal year.

The nature of the sources will determine to some extent how the subject is approached.\n\nCanon Cook has suggested that I write to you. I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know if anything has been done on this subject recently, and what materials are available.\n\nIn the event that I am able to work on this topic, I should like to spend the month of June, which is my vacation, going through the material.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rev.

Mohawk Institute:\n\nI arrived in Brantford at noon Sunday May 14 and there met Mr. Morris and Colonel Randle. We visited a new brick four-room school being constructed at Princeton, near Brantford. This is the type of building which Colonel Randle wishes for an intermediate consolidated school at Ohweken. I will submit a separate recommendation on this proposal.\n\nWe found things improved at the Mohawk Institute with Mrs. Zimmerman in a better state of health. I would recommend that we proceed with the principal's residence as soon as possible. We are wasting valuable space in the main building and are further jeopardizing her mental health by leaving things as they are.\n\nThe work being done on the upper dormitories is proceeding satisfactorily. The workmanship is good and I am particularly impressed with the use of Masonite panels instead of plaster. I feel that we could use this on all the lower walls in dormitories hallways, etc., in future.\n\nWe are including an amount for further work on this building in our Supplementary Estimates as we can now proceed with the many repairs required to the walls in the various rooms.\n2. Diocese of Huron\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to see the Bishop of Huron as their Synod was in session. However, I did meet the Diocesan Commissioner and discussed various matters with him. We naturally discussed Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman.\n\n3. Bank Settlement School\n\nThis opening was held at 10:30 a.m. on May 15th. There was a good crowd of Indians in attendance. The Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Oakes, Mr. Joblin and Mr. Morris all spoke well. Pictures of the building indicate the good workmanship. This was erected by Indians under a white foreman-carpenter.\n\n4. Oneida No. 2 School\n\nThis opening took place at 2:30 on the same afternoon. There was an even larger crowd of Indians. The school was opened by Mr. R. McCubbin, M.P., Mr. W. Smith, the Provincial School Inspector for this section of the reserve,\nspoke very highly of the building. Mr. Joblin, Mr. Morris and some of the Indians also spoke. This is an even better building than Back Settlement with electricity and running water. The teacher, Mrs. Johnstone, had it beautifully decorated and all the visitors were noticeably impressed. The concert put on by these children was very good.\n\n5. Moraviantown\n\nThis opening took place at 2.30 Tuesday May 16. It was held outside and attracted a very large group of Indians. This building is undoubtedly the best of the four we opened. There was very little white supervision and the Indians really put in many extras in their work. I have already sent you a newspaper account of this opening and attach additional photographs. The children put on a very fine Chinese play. Mr. Barrett, the Provincial School Inspector and other white officials spoke well but the Indian Chief here was most outstanding. His address was exceptionally fine and sincere. Mr. Spence proved a good chairman and this opening was a great success.\n6. Walpole Island\n\nThis school was built by contract and the finish is not as good as on those buildings erected by Indian labour. You will note that there is no basement, due to the low lying land surrounding the building. It is not possible to have a proper basement on Walpole Island. This opening was held indoors and the school was packed. The Provincial School Inspector, the Mayor of Wallaceburg, the Principal of Wallaceburg High School and the Indians all spoke. Mr. Stallwood proved a very capable chairman and the programme put on by the children was diversified and interesting. The Indian number shown in my photograph was particularly good. The other photograph shows the Provincial Policeman playing with the children after the opening.\n\nI would like to recommend that the Deputy Minister be given an opportunity of looking at this report, particularly of the buildings erected by Indian labour. I feel that we are getting exceptionally good value in these buildings and that the finishing details are better than those erected by contractors.\n\nBernard F.

Mohawk Institute:\n\nI arrived in Brantford at noon Sunday May 14 and there met Mr. Morris and Colonel Randle. We visited a new brick four-room school being constructed at Princeton, near Brantford. This is the type of building which Colonel Randle wishes for an intermediate consolidated school at Ohweken. I will submit a separate recommendation on this proposal.\n\nWe found things improved at the Mohawk Institute with Mrs. Zimmerman in a better state of health. I would recommend that we proceed with the principal's residence as soon as possible. We are wasting valuable space in the main building and are further jeopardizing her mental health by leaving things as they are.\n\nThe work being done on the upper dormitories is proceeding satisfactorily. The workmanship is good and I am particularly impressed with the use of Masonite panels instead of plaster. I feel that we could use this on all the lower walls in dormitories hallways, etc., in future.\n\nWe are including an amount for further work on this building in our Supplementary Estimates as we can now proceed with the many repairs required to the walls in the various rooms.\n2. Diocese of Huron\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to see the Bishop of Huron as their Synod was in session. However, I did meet the Diocesan Commissioner and discussed various matters with him. We naturally discussed Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman.\n\n3. Back Settlement School\n\nThis opening was held at 10.30 a.m. on May 15th. There was a good crowd of Indians in attendance. The Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Oakes, Mr. Joblin and Mr. Morris all spoke well. Pictures of the building indicate the good workmanship. This was erected by Indians under a white foreman-carpenter.\n\n4. Oneida No. 2 School\n\nThis opening took place at 2.30 on the same afternoon. There was an even larger crowd of Indians. The school was opened by Mr. H. McCubbin, M.P., Mr. W. Smith, the Provincial School Inspector for this section of the reserve,\nspoke very highly of the building. Mr. Joblin, Mr. Morria and some of the Indians also spoke. This is an even better building than Back Settlement with electricity and running water. The teacher, Mrs. Johnstone, had it beautifully decorated and all the visitors were noticeably impressed. The concert put on by these children was very good.\n\n5. Moraviantown\n\nThis opening took place at 2.30 Tuesday May 16. It was held outside and attracted a very large group of Indians. This building is undoubtedly the best of the four we opened. There was very little white supervision and the Indians really put in many extras in their work. I have already sent you a newspaper account of this opening and attach additional photographs. The children put on a very fine Chinese play. Mr. Barrett, the Provincial School Inspector and other white officials spoke well but the Indian Chief here was most outstanding. His address was exceptionally fine and sincere. Mr. Spence proved a good chairman and this opening was a great success.\n6. Walpole Island\n\nThis school was built by contract and the finish is not as good as on those buildings erected by Indian labour. You will note that there is no basement due to the low lying land surrounding the building. It is not possible to have a proper basement on Walpole Island. The opening was held indoors and the school was passed. The Provincial School Inspector, the Mayor of Wallaceburg, the Principal of Wallaceburg High School and the Indians all spoke. Mr. Stallwood proved a very capable chairman and the programme put on by the children was diversified and interesting. The Indian number shown in my photograph was particularly good. The other photograph shows the Provincial Policeman playing with the children after the opening.\n\nI would like to recommend that the Deputy Minister be given an opportunity of looking at this report, particularly of the buildings erected by Indian labour. I feel that we are getting exceptionally good value in these buildings and that the finishing details are better than those erected by contractors.\n\nBernard F.

I expect that this came from you and wish to thank you. If you can spare an extra one we would be very pleased to be put on the Mailing List.\n\nWe have Junior Red Cross in some of the Indian Schools in Nova Scotia and last year one of the Principals was honored with the Red Cross Service Badge.\n\nWe have a list of the schools but not a complete list of the classrooms. I understand that you are in charge of this, and if it is not too much trouble, may we have a complete list of the schools, the number of rooms in each and how they are distributed, for example:\n\nGrade I  \nGrade 7 & 8, etc.\n\nso that we know how many teachers there are in each school.\n\nThank you, and assuring you of our interest,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nElizabeth C. R. Browne  \nDirector, Junior Red Cross,  \nNova Scotia Division.\nJune 14, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nGlobe and Mail Editorial\n\nI have noted the contents of this editorial and agree that we are still far from providing educational facilities for all our Indians. These figures are taken from the 1948 report and are accurately quoted. I am pleased to point out that we now have 6,199 pupils in Grade One, 3,866 in Grade Two, 3,294 in Grade Three with 1,005 in Grade Eight as compared with 534 in 1948. We now have 38 pupils in Grade Ten as compared with 3 in this grade when reported by this editorial.\n\nI agree that a more aggressive educational policy should be followed and feel that this can best be done by having capable regional school inspectors appointed, who can actively work on educational problems within a given district.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 15th, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCOLONEL E. ACLAND\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of the 13th instant and apparently the only section referring to Indian Education reads as follows:\n\n\"Page 207 of the report says 'lack of accommodation prevents the operation of all grades on a full-time basis. At Kamloops the whole school operates on the half-time system; with 4 classrooms for an enrolment of 305 pupils'. It may be interesting to know that the school on the Poundmaker Reserve (in Sask.) remains closed because of the difficulty of obtaining a teacher.\"\n\nFor several years past we have had five classrooms at the Kamloops Residential School. In addition, we are just completing a new classroom block which will provide four classrooms for academic work, together with space for a Domestic Science class.\n\nThe reference in the letter \"At Kamloops the whole school operates on the half-time system\", refers to the usual practice in many residential schools of giving academic classroom work during half the day, and during the other half of the day the older pupils receive industrial instruction.\n\nWith reference to the Red Pheasant Indian Day School, there was a teacher in charge of this school to June 30th, 1949, at which time the teacher resigned.\nEvery effort was made to engage a new teacher for the academic year 1949-50 but we were unable to secure one during the period September 1st to December 31st, 1949. However, a teacher was engaged and began duties effective January 1st, 1950, and this day school has been in regular operation since that date.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nJune 22, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacBEE.\n\nVocational Education\n\nSince the appointment of a Supervisor of Vocational Education in 1940, there has been a steady increase in the vocational education offered in Indian day and residential schools. We are now hiring manual training instructors and domestic science teachers at many of the residential schools and in the larger day schools.\n\nThe number of Indian children who are receiving professional and trades training after they leave our schools is also on the increase. In the academic year now ending there were 5 Indian children attending Normal School, 7 attending Nurses' Training Schools, 6 in nurses' aide classes, 20 in Commercial and Business Classes and 8 attending Trades Training Schools. We have already received and approved a number of tuition grant applications for Indian pupils now finishing high school and who wish to enroll in professional and vocational classes next year. There has been a noticeable increase in those who intend to undertake Trades Training.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 22, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL AGLAND\n\nVocational and Commercial Education\n\nquestion asked by Mr. Noseworthy - pages 3713 - 3714 of Hansard.\n\nSince the appointment of a Supervisor of Vocational Education in 1940, there has been a steady increase in the vocational training offered in Indian day and residential schools. We are now hiring 50 manual training instructors and domestic science teachers at our various day and residential schools. In other cases we are co-operating with the provinces in the visits of county and township vocational instructors.\n\nThe number of Indian children who are receiving professional and trades training after they leave our schools is also on the increase. In the academic year now ending there were 5 Indian children attending Normal School, 7 attending Nurses' Training Schools, 6 in Nurses' Aide classes, 20 in Commercial and Business Classes and 8 attending Trades Training Schools. We have already received and approved a number of tuition grant applications for Indian pupils now finishing high school and who wish to enroll in professional and vocational classes next year. There has been a noticeable increase in those who intend to undertake Trades Training.\n\nThere are now 5 Indian children in Grade 11 in provincial schools and 5 in first year university (which is the equivalent of Grade 13 in some provinces).\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL ACLAND\n\nPermanent Appointments\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that a number of Departments are now proceeding with appointments to permanent classification for temporary civil servants who were formerly advised that they could not be so classified due to a number of veterans who had not yet received permanencies.\n\nI would appreciate definite information being obtained upon such action by other Departments and would like to know whether this Department is proceeding with any such classifications. If so, you will find that I have already made specific recommendations concerning certain of the staff of this Division.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Elizabeth O.R. Browne, R.N.\nDirector, Junior Red Cross,\nNova Scotia Division,\n71 Morris St.,\nHalifax, N.S.,\n\nMFT/HM\nEDUCATION OF THE INDIANS.\n\nFrom the time of the Recollect Fathers in 1616 until Confederation formal education of the Indians was limited almost entirely to missionary activities of the churches. In lower Canada there were day schools in Lorette, St. Regis and Pierreville and residential schools in Chateauguay, Christieville and St. Sulphice seminary where general education and some instruction in farming were offered. In Upper Canada some 40 schools were established mostly by the Wesleyan Methodist and Roman Catholic churches. In Western Canada the churches took the initiative but as in the East received some financial support from the Government and associations of Indian band councils.\n\nIn 1868 Indian Affairs were placed under the direction of the newly-created Department of the Secretary of State and transferred five years later to the Department of the Interior. In 1894 the Indian Act was amended to provide for compulsory attendance and the establishment of industrial boarding schools which are conducted under the auspices of the churches. In 1948, 45 such schools were conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, 18 by the Church of England, 8 under the United Church and 2 under the Presbyterian. The day schools were provided by the government.\n\nThe Indian schools follow the curricula of the province in which they are located with emphasis on languages, reading, domestic science, manual training and agriculture.\n\nIn 1947-48 there were a total of 365 Indian schools in operation, including 73 residential schools with an enrolment of 8966, and 285 day schools with an enrolment of 10,982 Indian pupils and 7 combined public and Indian schools with 133 Indian pupils enrolled. The total enrolment of Indian pupils was 76,101 in 1947-48, the average attendance about 80.34 p.c. of the enrolment. High school work was taught in some of both the day and residential schools. The sum of $3,614,804.04 was expended on Indian education during the year.\n\nA large number of Indian pupils are now attending provincial schools and a survey is now being made to determine the actual statistics. In many cases the fees are paid by the Indian parents and the Department has previously had no record of such attendance.\n\nIndian Schools:\n\nThe Governor in Council has placed Indian schools under the duties of the Department of Mines and Resources, (Indian Affairs Branch).\n\nThe Crown may establish day schools on any Indian reserve and provide Industrial or boarding schools for the children of any reserve or other designated territory.\n\nThe Crown may declare as an industrial or boarding school any school or institution whose managing authorities have entered into a written agreement with the Minister to admit Indian children and provide them with board, lodging and instruction.\n\nThe Minister is empowered to prescribe standards for buildings, equipment, teaching, discipline and inspection of the schools and may provide for the transportation of Indian children to and from the boarding or industrial schools and for the annual vacations.\nThe Chief and Council of any band have the right to inspect any school in which the band has children, at such reasonable times as are agreed to by the Indian agent and principal.\n\nEvery Indian child between the full ages of seven and sixteen years, who is physically able to, shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as designated by the Minister for the full period the school is conducted. Whenever it appears that an Indian child should be retained in school for a longer period, the Minister may direct that such child remain in school up to but not beyond the full age of 18.\n\nNo Protestant child shall be assigned to a school under Roman Catholic auspices and no Roman Catholic shall be assigned to a school under Protestant auspices.\n\nThe Minister may appoint any officer or person as truant officer, vest him with the powers of a peace officer and the privilege of entering any place where he has reason to believe there are Indian children of school age, or when requested by a teacher, chief or Indian agent. He shall warn the truants and their parents or guardians in writing; after three days notice such parent or guardian on complaint of the truant officer is liable to a fine of $25 and costs or ten days or both and such child may be arrested and conveyed to school.\n\nAbsence is excusable when such child is unable to attend because of sickness or other unavoidable cause; has passed the entrance examination; has been temporarily excused by the Indian agent or teacher to assist in husbandry or necessary household duties.\n\nThe Governor in Council may take the land of any Indian for school purposes upon payment of such compensation as is agreed upon or determined by the Minister.\n\nEvery member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and any constable on an Indian reserve shall be a truant officer.\n\nThe Chief or Chiefs of any band in council may, subject to confirmation by the Governor in Council decide the religious denomination to which the teacher of the school in the reserve shall belong. If the majority of the band belong to any one religious denomination the teacher shall belong to the same. With approval a Roman Catholic or Protestant minority may have a separate school established.\n\nSuch council may also make rules and regulations as to the construction and repair of school houses, council houses and other Indian public buildings and the attendance at school of children between the ages of 6 and 15. In practice this is seldom done.\n\nTuition grants are provided to enable Indian children to receive higher education. A special tuition grant application form is completed and signed by the teacher and Indian superintendent. On this form is indicated the amount to be provided by the parents and the sum required from the department. As a result of this aid Indian pupils and adults are now enrolled in practically every type of educational institution from universities to trade schools. Officials are stressing the necessity of vocational guidance and are pointing out the need for more Indians in two professions particularly; teaching and nursing. There are now some forty qualified Indian teachers and an increasing number enrol in Normal Schools each year. These teachers are proving successful and a few are now teaching in provincial schools.\nFree textbooks and school supplies are provided for Indian pupils and teachers requisition for such supplies annually.\n\nThe position of Indian Welfare Teacher was created to assist in improving living conditions for the Indians on isolated reserves. It will give recognition to those teachers who form Homemakers' Clubs, Institutes, etc.; sponsor community recreation of all kinds; encourage home gardening and home improvement clubs, endeavour to improve living conditions, encourage adult education and co-operate with Indian agents, doctors, and nurses in administration. Such teachers will be allowed the usual Civil Service holidays consisting of eighteen days a year and statutory holidays. Each three years they may be granted seven weeks to attend summer school.\n\nAcademic Year.\n\nThe school term consists of 195 days. Holidays include Saturday, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, Remembrance Day, Victoria Day and the King's Birthday, Christmas vacation and Easter vacation of about 10 days each, and the longer summer vacation from the end of June to the day after Labour Day. Roman Catholic Indian Day schools are allowed three Holy Days extra. The summer holidays may be changed to some other time on the recommendation of the local Indian agent and with approval of the Department. Schools may be closed for epidemics, local fairs or Teachers' Conventions.\n\nTypes of Indian Schools.\n\nAs indicated previously there are two main types of schools, namely day and residential. The latter type of school is necessary because of the nomadic nature of certain Indian tribes and because of the type of occupation followed by them such as trapping, fishing, etc.\n\nIn addition, there are two other categories namely seasonal and hospital schools. As the name implies the seasonal schools are operated for three of four months in the year only, usually in the summer. They are provided for Indians whose main occupation is trapping and who live in the bush except for a few months in the summer when they come out to the trading posts. There are now twenty-five such schools mainly in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. The teachers are usually male university students who are planning on teaching or medical careers.\n\nWith the entire approval and cooperation of the doctors in charge, patients in seven Indian hospitals in Western Canada now \"go to school\". Qualified school teachers are attached to the staffs of Indian hospitals at Millar Bay, Coqualeetza and Nanaimo in British Columbia; Edmonton, Alberta and Brandon, Dynevor and Clearwater Lake, Manitoba. Later others will be placed at North Battleford and Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan.\n\nTeachers in Indian Schools.\n\nAs previously indicated, the Indian residential schools are operated by denominational authorities for the Department, therefore all the teachers in them are appointed and paid by these churches. The Department can recommend the dismissal of any such teacher whose work is found to be unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the Indian day schools the teachers are appointed by the Department. Greatly concerned by the difficulty in obtaining qualified and experienced teachers, it has recently made a distinct effort to attract a better calibre of teacher. In September 1947, a salary schedule was introduced, similar\nto those in effect in various provincial departments of education.\n\nShortly after, Indian day school teachers were made eligible to contribute to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund as permanent civil servants when qualified. As a result there was, in one year (1948) an increase of 20% in the number of qualified teachers and a corresponding decrease in the non-qualified teachers.\n\nSALARY SCHEDULE FOR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL TEACHERS.\n\nA salary schedule for Indian day school teachers was approved by the Treasury Board in 1947. Salaries are based on qualifications and experience and provision is made for the Indian school teacher who teaches 10 months a year and the Indian Welfare teacher who conducts school for 10 months but remains on the reservation for 12 months with 18 days holidays as in the Civil Service. The welfare teachers are posted on isolated Indian reserves located at some distance from the nearest Indian Agent and in Indian hospital schools.\n\nThe salary ranges are as follows:\n\n| Teacher Indian School Grade | $1020-1320 | Grade I | $1260-1860 |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------|------------|\n| \" II                        | $1440-1920 | \" II   | $1920-2400 |\n| \" III                       | $1500-2200 | \" III  | $2280-3000 |\n| \" IV                        | $1800-2520 | \" IV   | $2340-3060 |\n\nThe grades should not be confused with the practice in many provinces of classing teachers with the minimum qualifications, possibly Grade X plus normal as third class while first class refers to teachers with senior matriculation and normal training.\n\nGrade I teachers are those holding third class certificates and teaching permits. They are hired during the present teacher shortage and departmental policy is to replace them with Grade 2 and Grade 3 teachers when such teachers are available.\n\nTo qualify for a Grade II under this classification teachers must have junior matriculation or its equivalent and have completed a teachers' training course (Second Class Certificate). Grade III teachers must have high school matriculation or its equivalent and normal school training (First Class Certificate) or be classed as a specialist with a First Class Certificate in Industrial arts, Household Science, Agriculture etc.\n\nFor a Grade IV certificate teachers must hold a High School Teachers' Certificate or its equivalent or a specialist high school certificate in Industrial Arts, Household Science, Agriculture etc., and spend 50% or more of their teaching time in high school subjects.\n\nThe above categories salaries begin at the lowest level with some ten increments for experience but credit is also given for improved academic standing. Increments in all cases are $60 each.\n\nSalaries for Indian Welfare teachers are for a twelve month year and are as indicated above. The regulations for these teachers are as for the above groups. Provision is made for them to improve their standing through correspondence courses and a leave of 7 weeks each 3 years is allowed during which they will take courses in social welfare, child psychology or related topics in a Canadian or American University or school recognized by the Indian Affairs Branch.\nPrincipals are classed as Grade I, Grade II, supervising Grade III and supervising Grade IV with salary ranges of $1620-2340, $1740-2460, $1980-2700, $2100-2820. Grades I, 2 and 3 must have a first class teaching certificate. Grades 1 and 2 must have at least 3 years of successful teaching experience. Grade 3, 6 years or more.\n\nA Grade I principal must supervise 3 or 4 classrooms. A Grade II, five or more classrooms. A Grade III (Supervising Principal) up to 11 classrooms and a Grade IV (Supervising Principal) 12 or more. The Grade IV principal must have a high school teachers' certificate and 8 years experience.\n\nThese last two categories of principal are often responsible for the supervision of all the day schools on a reserve.\n\nFive years experience may be allowed for teaching experience in public schools outside the Indian Affairs branch.\n\nEnglish speaking teachers shall be employed in English-speaking schools and French-speaking in French-speaking schools.\n\nSuperannuation:\n\nTeachers who receive permanent appointment become permanent civil servants and automatically contribute under the Civil Service Superannuation Act. Such teachers are required to take a physical examination and may elect to make contributions for past service, provincial pensionable service and war service. Day school teachers with valid certificates and two years successful teaching in the Indian schools can make application to become contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\nAgencies Swing Towards Film Medium\n\nWe don't know whether it is caused by the advent of TV film production (see attached item from Advertising Age), or the fact that every account executive of every agency regularly receives this newsletter, or even because we make quality films on reasonable budgets, but we certainly notice a decided increase in the number of film production contracts placed with us through advertising agencies.\n\nEither just completed or presently in production are nine films for these seven well-known agencies - Cockfield Brown, J.J. Gibbons, James Lovick, McKim Advertising, Spitzer & Mills, Walsh Advertising, and Young & Rubicam.\n\nLeading agencies in Canada, the United States and England are becoming extremely film conscious. They realize that only film can guarantee ten to thirty uninterrupted minutes of the public's concentrated time. They realize that this can be delivered for only a few cents per person through the vast network of 100 Canadian film libraries and councils. And they realize that films can dramatize a product, a plant or a plan and thus move people to action.\n\nMany agencies now employ their own film experts and departments as liaison between their client and the producer. Many U.S. agencies group Film and TV into the same department and this may well be the pattern here. We like working with such agencies - through them industry is sponsoring more and better films which increase production and distribution and provide a higher standard of life for us all.\n\nCanadian Sport Films Available\n\nLast year we were privileged to produce the films of Canada's two top sporting events - the football and the golf championships.\n\n\"Parade of Champions\", Neilson's exciting colour film of the Grey Cup Football Classic, is getting terrific distribution from coast to coast and there's a great deal of comment about the freeze frame technique used to explain the T-formation. The film is available to schools, clubs and groups of all kinds in either English or French from your nearest community film library or direct from the Distribution Department of Crawley Films Limited, Ottawa.\n\nAnd if you golfers want to lower your handicap, get your club to ask us for \"Par Breakers\" the dramatic story of the winning of the 1959 Seagram Gold Cup! Not only do you see the hole-by-hole story of Dutch Harrison's driving finish, but the film features a golf clinic with some of the world's best-known golfers demonstrating their specialty shots.\n\nOperation Holidays\n\nIn the interest of production efficiency this H.Q. will close for staff holidays at 1700 hours Friday June 30 and reopen at 0830 hours Monday July 17. A small rear party will remain, but the studio, the service department and the equipment sales division will be closed.\n\nHEAD OFFICE AND STUDIOS IN OTTAWA \u2022 TORONTO BRANCH AT 21 DUNDAS SQUARE\nBusiness Film Survey\n\nBusiness Screen Magazine of Chicago reports the significant results of their extensive survey of business films in the United States.\n\nThe average business film runs 25 minutes, although most films made for public showings do not exceed 20. 58% are in colour.\n\nThe main classifications of sponsors come in this order: electrical manufacturers, petroleum refineries and distributors, railways and airlines, public utility companies, health associations. Other leading sponsoring industries are farm implements, chemicals, automobiles, banks, insurance companies and building equipment.\n\n58% of business films are produced for the general public or consumers.\n26% produced for definite prospects or prospective customer groups only.\n10% for salesmen and dealers only.\n6% for sponsor's employees only.\n3% created for the schools alone.\n2% created for stockholder showings.\n\nIs This a Fair Question?\n\nIf you had gathered together an important group of men and women to whom you very much wanted to put across your advertising or public relations story, which method would you prefer to use?\n\n1. Give them pamphlets and papers to read on the subject.\n2. Talk to them about it through a loud speaker.\n3. Screen for them a sound colour film dramatizing your story.\n\nYou would?\n\nWell then, why not?\n\nFive-Second Items\n\nR.C.A.'s General Sarnoff predicts that 9 million homes will have TV by the end of this year and that within five years TV will be a $3 to $5 billion industry.....More than 4,000 businesses in the United States have public relations men or departments.....Dynamic and charming Kate Aitken, well known radio commentator called \"the world's busiest woman\", in the studios last week starring in a new film \"Pride of Possession\" for Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.....designed to show steps in obtaining C.M.H.C. house building loans, film is to be premiered at the Canadian National Exhibition.....sequences were shot at C.K.O.Y. which promptly aired what may be the first actuality broadcast of a film being shot in a radio station.....youth and experience make an effective combination - of the 45 men and women on our staff, none are over the age of 42 - yet they combine a total of over two centuries of film experience!\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGraeme Fraser,\nAssistant General Manager.\nHere's something we thought you'd be interested in reading\u2014\n\nAdvertising Age, March 13, 1950\n\nAll TV Shows on Film Soon,\nSays Y&R's Telford\n\nNEW YORK\u2014Within a year nearly all TV shows will be on film.\n\nThis is the prediction of Frank Telford, producer-director of \"Silver Theater\" (CBS), who is demonstrating that a filmed telecast need not be more expensive than a live one.\n\nYoung & Rubicam recently sent Mr. Telford to Hollywood to work with the Jerry Fairbanks Studio on the filming of a new 30-minute International Silver dramatic telecast. Filming the show, which had been carried live since its inception last fall, was viewed as a strictly experimental move.\n\nInternational Silver and Y&R were so pleased with the experiment that the show will be filmed in Hollywood for the remaining 13 weeks of the current season. The rent-production cost for the telecast will remain $7,500 weekly.\n\nCareful planning, which has made possible efficient use of everybody's time, has enabled the show to switch from live to filmed without increased production expenses, Mr. Telford explained.\n\n\"We know what we want before we start shooting. And we use the television technique of shooting with three cameras simultaneously,\" he said. \"Films of the past have been very expensive because they were shot for 40 shots and then decided what they wanted. We decide what we want, then take one shot.\"\n\nMr. Telford's reasons for seeing films especially made for TV as an important factor in the future of video go much further than the cost aspect, however.\n\n\"Certainly, things that can't be done on live television become routine. It's a superior method which enables you to eliminate the mistakes that would go on the air in a live show. We can concentrate on one segment at a time. In two days of rehearsal are required compared with the seven days we spent rehearsing the show for radio,\" he said.\n\n\"There is another very important consideration. When you film a show you own it. It's your property; you can take it out of a drawer later and repeat it when TV's circulation has changed sufficiently. This, of course, makes such a show an even better investment for a sponsor.\"\nJune 1, 1950\n\nThe Education and Training Group of the Professional Institute of the Civil Service of Canada met in the Board Room of the Civil Service Commission, Jackson Building, on Monday afternoon, May 16, 1950, with 21 members in attendance.\n\nSome discussion took place concerning the relationship between the Education and Training Group and the Education Committee of the Professional Institute. It was agreed that each group could be of assistance to the other. Dr. T. Shore, Chairman of the Education Committee, was in attendance.\n\nThe Group was addressed by Dr. O.E. Ault, of the Civil Service Commission, who outlined the purpose for the Group's existence. He stressed the following purposes:\n\n1. To protect the interests of Group members concerning such matters as classification, pay, hours of work, superannuation, etc.\n2. To maintain a sort of solidarity by working with those engaged in similar work.\n3. To help to give professional status to the Group the members represent.\n4. To maintain a high standard of entrance into the Group.\n5. To maintain a high standard of craftsmanship.\n6. To advance new methods and research.\n7. To maintain professional relationships.\n8. To maintain high ethical standards.\n\nThose associated with Education in the federal service play largely the role of fund dispensers and that of teaching wards of the Federal Government. Those associated with the Training role perform a service in their own right. However, all must help to develop and further a rational educational consciousness. Wider educational activities are likely to develop in the near future which will result in the expansion of the Group. The problems of the moment are those connected with international relations and culture and the training of people for public administration.\n\nThe Group can render a worthy service by supporting educational programmes and ventures put forth and by advancing the idea that learning does not stop with leaving school.\n\nDr. Ault advanced a number of topics for research by way of presenting specific things that the Group might undertake thereby helping to make its existence worthwhile. These topics included:\n(1) an educational profile of the Civil Service in its various classifications and grades, (2) the need for scholarships for Civil Servants (3) how much money is being spent on Education from the Federal Treasury and how is it being spent? (4) recommendations to the Civil Service Commission on such matters as classifications, educational qualifications, etc.\n\nThe Group should decide what should be given priority. Dr. Ault suggested that a Research Committee might be set up within the Group.\n\nYour Group Executive recommends as the first topic for research the following:\n\n\"What is being done by the Canadian Government in (a) Education and (b) Training, and what is the cost of such services?\"\n\nA dinner meeting will be held on Monday, June 12, 1950 commencing at 7 P.M. in the Buccaneer Room of the St. Charles Hotel, 200 Queen Street. The price of the meal will be according to menu and should not exceed $1.00. Your Executive is experimenting with various places by way of finding a suitable one for dinner meetings and would appreciate your comments and suggestions for future meetings.\n\nThe entire programme for this meeting will be devoted to Staff Training and will be in three parts: Orientation; Staff Relations and Public Relations, including actual demonstration of methods of instruction.\n\nYour Executive particularly desires to have as large an attendance as possible at this meeting as it will be the last one of this season.\n\nE.N.

Thanking you in advance,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMrs. K.G. Kern,\nExecutive Secretary.\nJuly 12, 1950.\n\nMrs. K. G. Kern,\nExecutive Secretary,\nThe Canadian Home and School and Parent - Teacher Federation,\n4373 West 12th Avenue,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 28 concerning the recent resolution passed at the 13th convention of the Canadian Home and School and Parent-Teacher Federation.\n\nAs our recent annual reports will indicate, we are endeavouring to provide high school education for an increasing number of Indian children. This is often very difficult, due to the isolated location of many of the reserves from which these children come. In many cases we bring the children to towns and cities where they board while attending high schools, technical schools, and normal schools.\n\nThere are now 465 children attending secondary grades in provincial and private schools. In our own schools we have a total of 369 children. This raises the total of Indian children attending secondary schools and universities to 834 for the 1949-50 academic year as compared with 661 pupils in the 1948-49 academic year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nLemnox Island, P. E.

E. Kennedy\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nP.E.I. Indian Agency.\nJuly 27, 1950.\n\nMr. G.E. Kennedy,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nLennox Island, P.E.I.\n\nCatholic Indian Day School Teachers\n\nRef. your 57/3-32 of July 21\n\nThe questions which teachers might ask are so numerous that the practice in the Department is to refer all such matters to the Education Division. The salary schedule is contained in the September, 1949 issue of the Bulletin but we require a completed application form before a specific salary is quoted to a teacher. This is due to the fact that provinces differ in the granting of teaching certificates of various classifications.\n\nBernard F.

I should be so grateful if you could give me any information or pictures re background, dress and ways of living.\n\nI do hope you will excuse my taking the liberty to write to you but your address was given to me by a Canadian visitor from British Columbia whom I met recently.

The Blue Quills Residential School is only 75 miles from this reserve and with the building of day schools at Goodfish Lake and Frog Lake, these Cold Lake children could be admitted to this residential school.\n\nWe have previously had our field officials discuss with the Indians the possibility of erecting a day school on the Cold Lake Reserve. To date, they have not been in favour of such a move.\n\nRESOLUTION - Samson's Reserve:\n\nThis resolution requests a non-denominational school on the Samson's Reserve. Under the present Indian Act it is not possible to establish such a school.\n\nBernard F.

I have just realized that the Indian Education Division contributed to a great extent to the success of that Convention and that I have neglected to say thank you for the use of your school rooms both at Sarnia and at Kettle Point, and the use of the Caradoc School Bus. Without the bus many of our Indian women from neighboring Reserves would not have been able to attend the sessions.\n\nI appreciate Mr. Phelan's kindness in coming to Sarnia to address the Indian women. They did appreciate his talk. I must also thank Mr. Eisenhardt who appeared to be extremely successful in carrying out his missionary work for sports.\n\nThanks again for all the assistance that you so cheerfully made available.\n\nH.

Minister's signature.\nAck. P. Secretary's signature\nBy Department.\nThe result of the quinquennial census of Indians completed during the fiscal year 1949-50 reveals clearly the vigor of this, the oldest, Canadian racial group and its proven ability to perpetuate itself.\n\nNotwithstanding enfranchisements, whereby the Indian population is diminished by the provisions of the Act, there were 10,825 more Indians reported than in 1944. In that year there was a 7,308 increase over those reported in the previous census year of 1939.\n\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the Indian population, receiving increasing welfare benefits such as Family and Old Age Allowances, better housing, medical care and schooling, will continue to increase at a proportionate rate, thereby increasing administrative responsibilities year by year in no small measure.\n\nThe trend towards higher education was again apparent and increased attendance in the secondary school grades and at universities is a reflection of the progress being made in the whole field of education. In the 1948-49 school year there were six hundred and sixty-one Indian pupils attending classes above Grade VIII; this represented a considerable increase over the previous year. However, during 1949-50 eight hundred and thirty-four students attended classes above Grade VIII. This splendid record indicates not only more class-rooms and improved teaching methods but also the fact that Indian youth is taking greater interest in his own education.\n\nThe enrolment at residential schools decreased slightly over the previous year but there was an increase in the day school enrolment of 1,582. It is of interest to note that since 1947 there has been a total increase in day school enrolment of 3,111 pupils.\nDuring 1949-50 there were 1,180 Indian children enrolled in the elementary grades of provincial and private schools and 465 in such secondary schools. When these pupils are added to the total of those attending Indian schools it reveals that during the year 25,054 Indians attended educational classes.\n\nThe construction of new day schools continued during the year and the effect of this program can be seen in the increased day school enrolment which has risen by more than 3,000 in two years. This also materially reduced the number of Indian children for whom previously no education facilities were provided. During the year particular attention was given to the construction of schools in the northern sections of the Provinces and in the Northwest Territories.\nOctober 18, 1950.\n\nMr. Sylvester Charleton,\nNanaimo Indian Hospital,\nNanaimo, British Columbia.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 5 concerning Indian schools. This letter has been referred to me for answer by our Minister's office.\n\nBy now, you will have seen the new Bill and will have noted that the Educational clauses do not have any great changes.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe Story of \"Totem Land\"\n\nCheerful Students at Miller Bay Hospital\n\nThese are the boys and girls who have been attending school most of this year in Ward E of Miller Bay Indian Hospital.\n\nMr. Wrathall, photographer of Prince Rupert, came out on School Closing Day. The boys were \"dressed up\" for the occasion. You will see that King George and Queen Elizabeth were there and also \"Little Miss Muffet\" in her smiling costume. The nurses and doctors were there in attendance and also the \"Lone Ranger\" kept a wary eye.\n\nNames of the boys in each picture with the names and addresses of their parents in brackets, are as follows:\n\n- Alfred Davidson (Alfred Davidson, Massett)\n- Philip Stewart (George Stewart, Prince Rupert)\n- Clyde Johnson (Clyde Johnson, Massett)\n- Wilfred Wilson (Harry Wilson, Prince Rupert)\n- Eric Ryan (Philip Ryan)\n\nAlfred are the King and Queen of this group.\n\nIT Lawrence Williams (Sam Bud Williams, Smithers); Joshua Jeffreys (Marion Jeffreys, Greer)\n- Expert Wood, Aiyansh; John Miller (John Miller, Kitamaat)\n- Shus (Shus, Kitamaat)\n- John Miller (John Miller, Kitamaat)\n- Profession achieved by pillows and caps, both of which\n- Edgar Davis (Guy Davis, Aiyansh); Wilfred Adams (Mrs. Esther Adams, Aiyansh)\n- B.

It should be noted that the material was written before this group of Chippe-\n\nwas signed a treaty with the federal government.\n\nThe Chippewa were visited by Peter Panyman when he travelled the North Saskatchewan river in 1798 and they traded with the Hudson's Bay Company at Rocky Mountain House when David Thompson arrived in 1798. They continued to trade with the Hudson's Bay Company at Rocky Mountain House as long as there was a trading post kept by that Company on the north bank of the North Saskatchewan river on section 26, township 47 range 27, west of fifth and in full view of the confluence of the Clearwater and North Saskatchewan rivers. They still bring their furs to sell to the Hudson's Bay representative (Henry Selkirk) in Rocky Mountain House.\n\nFamilies who are living in a state of abject poverty and who are in dire need of such help as suitable shelter, accommodation, food and clothing ought to be suitably cared for, whether they are Indians or otherwise. If they were white people, the public would openly demand that the provisions be made for them and I venture to say that the Mounted Police Force in Alberta would see to it that they were cared for.\n\nWhy is it that the Non Treaty Chippewa Indians who have not even a house to live in although they can call their own as passed by unnoticed like fallen leaves and left to wither and die.\n\nWhat Can Be Done\n\nTHOSE of you who have a spark of love and kind thoughts in your hearts for those who are less fortunate than yourselves can surely express your feelings by doing something of a material nature for these Indians. No, not by sending your old coat off clothing or anything else by giving lavishly of your bounty to those whom you owe a debt to which you will never fully pay.\n\nWhen I think of the millions of dollars worth of oil being annually drawn from the oil fields of Alberta, it amazes me that a portion of it is not utilized for the purpose of bringing cheer to the homes of Indians who today are destitute. The vast resources of Alberta are actually a portion of the heritage of the people of Alberta, then why is not a portion of the revenue which is derived from these resources utilized for these same Non Treaty Chippewa Indians in a manner beneficial and agreeable to them.\n\nI don't want any of you who read this article to get the impression that the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources at Ottawa has not tried to help these unfortunate Non Treaty Chippewa Indians. The said Department, in fact, year after year offers help in the form of food, clothing, medicines and a Reservation of Land, but such help was refused by the old Chief and his Council because they felt that they had never been suitably compensated for the land which the English-speaking people took from them and for the buffalo and other wild life which white people exterminated on the land which the Chippewa claimed to be their God-given land.\n\nAlthough they have spurned help from the Indian Affairs Branch of the Government of Mines and Resources, they do appreciate help from individuals or societies which are interested in their welfare. And they do ask that the Government of Canada grant suitable areas over which they can hunt and trap unmolested by white men so that they can carry on their own natural avocation of making a living and be in a position to buy the necessities of life for their families.\n\nVisit to Yellowface\n\nA FEW weeks ago I visited the grave of my old friend and brother \"Yellowface\" Kowasate-Kwan which is on a high spur of ground on the north bank of Prairie Creek overlooking the valley. It is a lonely place which the old chief chose for his last resting place and is situated in a poplar grove commanding a magnificent view of the surrounding country and of the eastern slope of Rocky Mountain House in the southeast corner of the southwest quarter of section 26 in range 47, 8 west of the 1st meridian, on land belonging Henry Selkirk Comber.\n\nAs I stood at the grave of my old friend the many pleasant memories came back before his eyes as he heard the sound of the wind through the trees whom he thought was his son. He roved over to the point where he thought there was a little animal that looked something like a little man but could change itself into a kind of a figure. This animal changed itself into a bear and led the father deeper into the woods until he came to a spot where nobody could see him. After they were out of sight, the animal changed itself back into its proper form.\n\nAmong the trees of the forest God...\nAn Indian Legend\n\nBy WILMA JOHNSON\nAge 15, Grade 8, Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nLONG ago, when I was about six years old, I was told an Indian legend by my great grandmother.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who wanted a drink in the middle of the night. His father told him that there was no water in the house, and then he started to cry and he kept on crying until it was about four o'clock in the morning. His mother kept telling him that it would soon be morning, then he would be able to get a drink. But this little boy kept on crying and asking his mother for some water. This went on for a long time until his father got tired of hearing him cry, so he told him to get up and get some water himself.\n\nThe little boy got up and took a dipper with him down to the creek. When he was about to drink, he heard someone behind him and he turned around to see who it was, but there was nobody there. He drank as soon as he began to drink the water something grabbed him and he screamed. His father heard him screaming and got up to see what was wrong with him. When they got there he was too late for the boy was nowhere in sight. All they could hear was his voice but they could not see him. The next morning all the people in the village went on a searching for the boy, failing to find him, although they tried to go to where his voice was coming from.\n\nThe boy's father kept on searching for his son and he traced his voice to the river bank. Then he got in a canoe and when he was in the middle of the river, calling for his son, he heard someone answer him. He answered back until someone stepped out from behind the trees whom he thought was his son. He rowed over to the little island and when he got there, there was a little animal that looked something like a little monkey but could change itself into any kind of a figure. This animal changed itself into the man's son and led the father deeper and deeper into the woods, until they came to a spot where nobody could see them. After they were far out of sight, the animal changed himself back into his proper form.\n\nWhen the father didn't come back, the boy's mother went to her father, the chief, and told him that her husband hadn't come back from the search. Then the chief told his only daughter that he would go and see if he could find his son-in-law.\n\nThe chief had a big dog which he left behind to look after the Indian Princess. The dog was very attentive. The Princess was never allowed to go anywhere or to see anybody and yet she was the prettiest of his three daughters.\n\nWhen the chief left to look for the boy and his wife, he left his dog behind to look after her and see that nobody came around the house.\n\nAbout a day after the chief left, the big dog changed himself into a man and knocked at the door and the Princess opened it without thinking of her promise to her father. She let the stranger into their house.\n\nFor a few days she was happy because she was going to marry this stranger without her father's consent. A few days before her father came back she told him she was going to go with him and she told her father of this marriage to him. He left the house and transformed himself back to a dog. Even though the father got back and she told him about it, she found out that she was going to have a child he told her to pack up and he paddled her out in a canoe to the same island where her brother-in-law had been led by the animal.\n\nWhen the child was born it was a little pup which changed itself into a human being. It was the belief among the little island which grew into a community.\n\nThey never found the boy's father nor the son. When they asked the Chief what became of the boy's aunt, he would say that she got lost. The Chief forbade the people of the island ever to go over to the island where he had left the Princess. The people of long ago believed that the face in the moon was part of the son's face.\n\nIndian Arts Society Awards Announced\n\nDorothy Morgan, pupil at the Alberni Residential School, was awarded the $75 Memorial Art Scholarship during the annual exhibit of Indian art work sponsored by the B.C.

During his drunken spree, he came upon a settler named John Smith and terrorized him. Mamachtoga was arrested and confined in the town jail to await his trial.\n\nWhen the trial came up he was defended by H. H. Breckinridge. The only defense offered was that Mamachtoga was intoxicated when he killed Smith and did not know what he was doing. This defense was promptly overruled by the judge. The Indian said that he did not know why he had killed Smith. Mamachtoga was put in Hanamstown jail to await execution.\n\nWhile the Indian was awaiting his end, his wife's little girl became ill. The Indian, who liked the jailer, heard of the illness. He told the jailer that if allowed to, he would go into the forest where he knew of a certain herb from which he could make a medicine that would cure his daughter. He promised on his word as an Indian, that he would not try to escape. The jailer, who knew Indians, allowed Mamachtoga to go into the woods after the medicine. The Indian returned after a while, and, using the medicine, the girl recovered.\n\nOn the day of the hanging, the Indian again asked permission to go into the forest to secure earth and roots to prepare his \"Death Paint.\" His request was granted. He soon returned with his face painted a deep red. He was taken to the gallows where he calmly walked to the top.\n\nHe sang his death song and stepped off the log platform. His fall broke the rope and, though stunned, he arose with a smile and again ascended the gallows. The broken rope was mended and the second fall snuffed out the life of Mamachtoga.\n\nThe Indians' assent to a treaty was always binding. In ancient days the greatest insult to an Indian was to doubt his honor or truth.\n\n\u2014M.P.\n\nJustice At Last, Perhaps?\n\nTHE OTHER day I picked up the newspaper. I noticed as I turned the pages, an article titled, Tama Indians Gather to Discuss Possible Payment From Government. As I read further, I noticed that ever so long last was the thing the Indians of the United States had been fighting for these many years. Yes, here before me was proof that our government was at last trying to make amends for the injustices practiced on the Redman. There has been nothing definite as yet done about it, but the Indians and their friends are behind it in full strength and I believe that in the end it will become a reality.\n\nThere is a short summary of what took place here in Tama, at the Tribe's annual meeting, March 23, 1956.\n\nLouis Allen Youpe of Washington, D.C., a Cree Indian, representing the Indians of America, was present and his speech was very inspiring from the standpoint of both Indians and whites.\n\nHe told all those present, that as far back as three hundred years, the government has owed the Indians for land they allegedly had underpaid them for.\n\nHistorically, here is what took place:\n\nIn 1894, a small band of SAC and FOX Indians signed the Treaty of St. Louis, with white invaders. For a few top hats and treaty medals and about $2,000 worth of provisions, they gave up one-third of Illinois, a million acres in Wisconsin, and two million acres in Missouri.\n\nLater, with the treaty, they reputedly ceded another sixty million acres, including two-thirds of Iowa. Then jointly with the Sioux and Omaha tribes, they ceded 15,000,000 acres more.\n\nSo now, under Youpe's guidance, 26 tribes have banded together in a lawsuit-minded alliance known as the Northern Confederacy. The Sac and Foxes have the largest claim among any of the 26.\n\nColumbus Keshta, Tama is actively bringing tribesmen here into the confederacy, along with Sioux Indians who also have not yet joined. The Sac and Fox people also have a claim for part of Kansas, from where they came to this settlement in 1857.\n\nThe 400 to 500 Sac and Fox tribesmen here constitute about one-third of the whole Sac and Fox nation. Others live in Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nThe pool of white attorneys backing Youpe is understood to include men from all over the United States.\n\nThe Indians were barred the right to sue in 1863, but finally won the right through an act of congress in 1947. This same measure had been defeated four times previously.\n\nMr. Ed Davenport is acting president, and Mr. Columbus Keshta is acting secretary.\n\nKA-RON-TA-WAH-NIN.\n\nIndian Facts On High\n\nMrs. Katherine Green has been reading The Native Voice readers, and she says that the attendance of Indian children in school has been high during the past year.\n\nA letter from Mrs. Green says: \"I am glad to express the wish that 'all Indian children attend school regularly and keep up in their schooling and keep in touch with their parents.'\"\n\nGreen says Mrs. Crammes and Povesh Gladstone are doing good work at University of B.C. To be away from home. To our residents, your parents, are interested in your future. If you only put yourself in their place, it is yours, for the advancement of the Brotherhood and Sistership of man, and interest and are willing to do your part.\"\n\nMrs. Green concludes.\n\nThe letters received from Mrs. Green read as follows:\n\nAlert Band\n\nDear Mrs. Green,\n\nThis is the report of our monthly attendance for the school year: September, 90.32 per cent; October, 89.41 per cent; November, 89.41 per cent; December, 90.24 per cent; January, 82.63 per cent; February, 86.68 per cent; March, 89.07 per cent.\n\nThis month it will not be so good because of measles. I feel that we should credit the parents for seeing that their children never miss school unless they are sick. It is just certain families who allow their children to stay home without a valid reason and still maintain attendance of the whole school. It is a shame that these parents do not realize that regular attendance is necessary if their children are going to progress.\n\nThere are four teachers here. Miss Rutherford has the beginners. Miss Merrett has Grades 2 and 3. Miss Lucas has Grades 4 and 5. I have Grades 6, 7 and 8. Since these children have had measles, they have progressed very well and have the eight pupils in Grade 9 this year and all will be promoted to Grade 9. The discouraging thing is that they may not go to Grade 10. The teachers have appreciated the co-operation of the parents who helped us last year to purchase a moving picture machine with sound. The National Film Bureau supply us with a wonderful program and it is encouraging to see the amount of knowledge that they gain from the films.\nIndian Kiddies Seldom Miss School\n\nKatherine Green Gathers Facts On High Attendance\n\nMrs. Katherine Green has gathered, for the information of Native Voice readers, some interesting statistics on school attendance among our children which reveal that these kiddies have a high standard in this field.\n\nA letter from Mrs. Green which accompanies her reports, and which was received too late to be published earlier, expresses the wish that \"all our school children enjoy a happy holiday and I would like to encourage them to carry on their schooling and make the most of our ever widening world.\"\n\n\"Greetings to Mrs. Ellen Need in her work of art. To Gloria Crammes and Percy Gladstone, also my nephew, Alfred Scow, at University of B.C. To all the High School students away from home. To our residential schools and day schools. We, your parents, are interested in your work. You have a great future. If you only put yourself into your schooling. Education is yours for the asking; make good use of it. We, the members of the Brotherhood and Sisterhood are watching you with great interest and are willing to help you solve your problems,\" Mrs. Green concludes.\n\nThe letters received from schools contacted by Mrs. Green read as follows:\n\nAlert Bay Day School\n\nDear Mrs. Green:\n\nThis is the report of our monthly attendance for the school year: September, 90.32 per cent; October, 89.41 per cent; November, 88.64 per cent; December, 90.24 per cent; January, 82.63 per cent; February, 96.06 per cent; March, 92.42 per cent; April, 94.6 per cent; May, 89.07 per cent.\n\nThis month it will not be so good as we have quite a number of cases of measles. I feel that much credit is due to some parents who see that their children never miss school unless they are sick. It is just certain families who allow their children to stay home for ridiculous reasons and spoil the attendance of the whole school. It is a shame that these parents do not realize that regular attendance is necessary for their children's progress.\n\nThere are four teachers here. Miss Rutherford has the beginners. Miss Merrett has Grades 1, 2 and 3. Miss Lucas has Grades 4 and 5. I have Grades 6, 7 and 8. Since these children have had four teachers and a full day at school they have progressed very well. I have the eight pupils in Grade 8 this year and all will be progressing to Grade 9. The encouraging thing is that they do not all go on.\n\nThe teachers have appreciated the co-operation of the parents who helped us last year to purchase a new picture machine with seed. The National Film Board supply us with a weekly programme and it is encouraging to see the amount of knowledge that they gain from these films.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nELMAH J. TENCH.\n\nBella Coola Day School\n\nDear Mrs. Green:\n\nI was sorry to have missed you when you called. I am enclosing the average attendance of the school month by month as recorded in each room. We regret this is not better. There are many faithful attendants but the few who are very irregular reduce our average.\n\nBoth Miss Nicholson and I feel that a greater degree of cooperation on the part of the parents of those poor at attending would soon remedy this.\n\nThese are our enrollment averages:\n\nSr. Class, 32 Jr. Class, 36\n\nSeptember \u2014 19.66 12.97\nOctober \u2014 28.15 25.7\nNovember \u2014 26.79 29.15\nDecember \u2014 27.72 24.66\nJanuary \u2014 18.38 20.97\nFebruary \u2014 24.25 28.40\nMarch \u2014 24.83 27.58\nApril \u2014 22.66 22.92\nMay \u2014 30.66 18.54\nJune \u2014 21.75 16\n\nI hope this is what you were wanting.

The boat is the last thing in modern combination herring and salmon seiner.\n\nBOAT CONSTRUCTION. Fir planking on bent oak frames yellow cedar beams, huge clamps, main clamp and ceiling are rim-timber. House is of red cedar with yellow cedar beams and framing. Galley is lined with arborite and counter of mahogany finish. The galley is fitted with an Olympic white enamelled stove, complete with deluxe oil burner and hot and cold running water is available in galley and also in wash basin in toilet and stateroom. The engine is a 150 H.P. Caterpillar diesel with a 3 to 1 reduction gear and air started. Also included in a first-class engine room are two vacuum centrifugal pumps, two air compressors and two only 1\u00bd kilowatt hour generators, etc. Radio, echo-sounder and direction finders are all installed to make it one of the most modern boats on the coast.\n\nALSO LAUNCHED at the same yard on July 12 was a second seiner for Mr. Jake Stillin of Quathiaski Cove. The boat was christened \"Peter S\" by Mrs. Stillin's mother, Mrs. F. Dalby of Ladysmith. The boat is named after Jake Stillin's son.\n\nA number of persons were present at the launching and refreshments were served at the plant following the launching.\n\nThis boat is powered by Crown Chrysler with a 4 to 1 reduction gear, swinging a 32-30 propeller and has all the latest innovations of the smaller and up-to-date seine boat which has become more popular every year. It will have a radio installed and also navigational instruments. This boat is built mainly for seining in Johnstone Strait area and will be skippered by Capt.

When Columbus arrived he thought that he was in India or close to India, and so the mistake was made. He was in the right latitude, but as he had no maps or charts for checking his longitude, his error was to be expected. I can see no good reason, however, for perpetuating the word. You might just as well call all White men Japanese.\n\nThe word \"Redman\" has had a better acceptance in the English language than the word \"Indian.\" In histories and stories we find the word \"Redman\" coupled with \"Brave\" and \"Noble\" while \"Indian\" has been all too often linked with \"wild,\" \"savage,\" \"cigar store\" and others of even less desirable nature.\n\nApparently, a great many of those who write for the \"Voice\" are of the opinion that \"Redman\" is the better word, and so avoid the word \"Indian.\"\n\nA European is quite satisfied with the term \"White Man,\" an African takes no offence at \"Black Man,\" and I don't think any Original Americans would object to \"Redman\" or \"Red Men.\"\n\nThere is also a very practical reason. As a school teacher, I have spent I don't know how many hours explaining this matter to children; all time wasted because of the word mistake in 1892. How many other people all over the world have had to waste time in the same way since that date? I suppose hundreds of thousands of mangy, half-hungry heads have been dissipated, and still more will be unless action is taken.\n\nI have no doubt that if the Native Brotherhood took the matter up with Ottawa and Washington the word \"Indian\" as applied to Redmen would soon be out of use.\n\nSo if I were a Redman, I would go after that word and put my foot down on it, hard.\n\nQUALITY LEADS THE WAY!\n\nFISHERMEN make more money by getting back fast with fish in prime condition. At all times freshly caught fish must be kept on ice or in a cold place and the swifter the processing, the better its quality is preserved. With our modern fish-packing plants located close to the best fishing-grounds, we are enabled to receive fish fresh from the sea and to freeze it more rapidly. Our facilities for ice manufacture and storage are so extensive that we are able to meet not only our own needs but to supply crushed ice to a large number of the vessels of the salmon and halibut fleets. In safeguarding the world-famous quality of CANFISCO products, we increase their demand and make fishing a more profitable undertaking for you.\n\nFRESH\u2014FROZEN\u2014CANNED\u2014SMOKED\u2014SALTED FISH & BY-PRODUCTS\n\nThe CANADIAN FISHING CO. LTD.\n\nVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA\nBrotherhood Convention in Retrospect\n\nBy THOMAS SHEWISH\n\nPlease allow me a small space in your valuable paper to thank the good people who have assisted me in writing for a short report of the Convention, also to answer the question that has been asked me regarding the organization.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that the Convention was opened on April 14 at Bella Bella with the battle song \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The Business of the Native Brotherhood was conducted like any other big convention with punctuality.\n\nThe organization was marvelous; every visitor had been assigned an Indian host and had breakfasts with the family. In the other two meals were cared for by the village women. At meal time, young men escorted the visitors to their seats. After being seated, blessing was asked and then entered two processions of young Indian girls each carrying dishes and tray of food to the serving tables.\n\nA brass band furnished music for the evening banquets.\n\nMr. Caleb Williams did a good work as master of ceremonies.\n\nOne evening, our host, Charlie Moody Humchitt of Bella Bella, was officially declared hereditary Chief of the Village by President William Scow to succeed his father who had passed away last fall.\n\nHearty Welcome\n\nHospitality was not limited. Everybody who tied up to the Bella Bella float found a hearty welcome at the Indian hall where meals were served.\n\nI shall never forget and will remember to hear the 300 Natives singing the battle song, \"Onward Christian Soldiers,\" with all their hearts. Thanks be to God for the foundation of the Native Brotherhood is built upon that rock so that when the wind blows up on that rock, the Native Brotherhood will never move for it is founded on that rock. This has been proved and I am speaking by experience. I am referring to the West Coast and this is why I started by saying that I wish to thank the people who have assisted me and made a mistake in trying to get away from the Organization which has done so much for them and I am sure the Organization has accepted my apologies.\n\nLet me say this, that as long as you are Indian, whether you are a member or not, the Organization is for you and you will benefit from the gathering of the people. Never think that the Native Brotherhood is only for the fishermen, that is a mistake. It is for all the Indians who are under the Indian Act.\n\nTo those who are not members of the Native Brotherhood, let me say to you that Mr. Guy Williams was chosen to speak for the unaffiliated Indians of British Columbia, for the Indians who have waited over 80 years for their land. Friends, do you realize that the task was tremendous and it was for us Indians. Your friend, Mr. Williams sincerely made the presentation one of the best. In reading Hansard, one member said, \"We have not heard any who have surpassed you in your presentation.\" So, friends, let me say again, do not believe whoever may say that your Organization could not get a hearing. Just read Hansard and get the real facts and not false reports.\n\nAt the long table, at the convention, sat the president of the Native Brotherhood, Chief William Scow, and the members of his Executive.\n\nThere were delegates from all parts of the province.\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nThe Indian Department was represented by Commissioner, W. S. Arnell who was warmly welcomed by the Convention.\n\nMr. Arnell told the Convention that the building program of the Department has been delayed by the war and it has only been possible during the last two years to begin on long deferred plans for improvements. Last year, 13 one-room schools were built, this year they expect to double the effort. The department was handicapped by contractors' refusal to go into remote areas to do the work and the only solution in such cases was putting up pre-fabricated schools which has been done in several instances.\n\nWhile 1200 children from Nomadic tribes tribes wandering from place to place are getting education of any kind, there are five thousand Native children in the province being educated. Of this number, over 2000 are in residential schools and the rest in day schools. There are nine in high schools and 9 at University. There is no Native child in British Columbia who will be denied higher education, said Mr. Arnell, stressing that the Native children will fill teaching positions. Mr. Arnell paid a tribute to the Churches which in the early days had taken full responsibility for Indian education and had invested millions of dollars for this purpose. They had made a great contribution at a time when there was no alternative service. The trend today is toward cooperation with white communities, sharing costs with them whenever possible in order that Native children may attend white schools, thus helping to end segregation.\n\nWarm appreciation was voiced to Mr. Arnell by the Brotherhood for his effort in behalf of their people, and promise of full co-operation in plans for the future.\n\nYour M.L.A., Frank Calder, spoke to us and outlined the proposed bill of rights for British Columbia Indians.\n\nA matter of vital concern was the return of the Japanese fishers. In reading Hansard, one member said, \"We have not heard any who have surpassed you in your presentation.\" So, friends, let me say again, do not believe whoever may say that your Organization could not get a hearing. Just read Hansard and get the real facts and not false reports.\n\nDo Your Part\n\nMy Indian friends do now realize that your Organization is important. If you believe in these as your part, let us wake up and do our part. In the Brief which your Organization presented to the special joint committee, reads as follows: \"If housing and the need of better houses in the Indian villages, communities and settlements must receive very serious consideration standards should be set and insisted upon for the relief of overcrowding and also the revision of sanitation. Carrying this into effect may mean a better appreciation of the improvement of health generally, and family independence.\n\nNow my friends, what do we see today? Is there any provision for the Indians by the Indian Department? I do not need to tell you; you can look around and see for yourself.\n\nOn Sunday there were two services, there were forty voices in the choir they sang Gloria in Excelsis, the Heaven are Telling, and after the sermon was preached, rendered the Hallelujah chorus to overflowing congregation.\n\nIt would be easy to say that I cannot tell you about the case, the cost of which you have contributed. I do hope that the elected delegate for the West Coast has told you in your own tongue and in camera.\n\nHis Question\n\nNow to the question which I said I would like to answer. The question was something like this, \"Why is the Native Brotherhood doing a white man's way; they say it is on Christian principles!\"\n\nFriends, I always want to speak or answer any questions in a very friendly way. We all have learned that the old things have passed away and new things have come. We believed our (territorial) traditions but they have never carried us anywhere, and civilization reached us and the word of God tells us that when a Nation forgets God shall be utterly destroyed, and again it says, If God be for us who can be against us, so we as an Organization had a President who first formed the Native Brotherhood in British Columbia who was a true Christian and he knew that without God's help, we never would accomplish anything. I am referring to the late President Adams, whom I know by faith, he was working on at our Conventions and I am still praying for the Organization. We as members have decided that we will keep on the course that our late President has given us to steer. Of course, there will be deviations of the compass, I have seen it myself at the West Coast but the adjustment has been made.\n\nIn closing, I wish to thank the West Coast people for the confidence placed in me representing them for the period of five years. Perhaps, let me tell you that we still own British Columbia. We have never surrendered our title to our land. My sisters and brothers, let us continue. We need a stronger Native Brotherhood. Support your Organization to the limit.\n\nPATRONIZE THE ADVERTISERS IN THE NATIVE VOICE\n\nWatts & Nickerson\n\nWe have the Most Complete Stock of MEN'S CLOTHING and FURNISHINGS\n\nCALL AND SEE US\n\nPRINCE RUPERT\nConstructive Holiday For Eastern Editor\n\nAldersley Park,\nLake Simcoe, Ontario,\nJuly 18, 1950.\n\nPublisher, The Native Voice.\n\nDear Mrs. Moore:\n\nJUST A LINE OR TWO to let you know that at the time this will have reached you, our holiday will be all over for another year. But we did have the most enjoyable time and my good wife and I even visited all the more important historic sites in this part of old Ontario.\n\nThis part of the province is so full of intriguing Indian history, dating back to Champlain's time and beyond that. Re: The Huron Indians and Peton Indians and the warlike and ferocious Iroquois and the Six Nations Indians who almost completely wiped out the Huron or \"Wendat's\" and murdered the Jesuit Fathers who sought to Christianize their friends and brothers, the Hurons.\n\nTODAY, A GREAT memorial stands at the partially re-built old Fort Ste. Marie where Fathers Brebeuf and Lelemont, the brave Jesuit missionaries, were buried after meeting such a cruel fate at the hands of the fiery Iroquois warriors. It was a far-off days when life must have been a daily risk and a great adventure.\n\nAN IMPOSING double-spired church or shrine now stands upon a lofty hill just a few miles out of the beautiful town of Morland, Ontario, just a short walk from the old Fort Ste. Marie, in fact, upon the hill that cradles the Martyrs Shrine, there once was the famous lookout point for the Huron Indians.\n\nI HAVE TAKEN many pictures with my kodak and at a later date, I may be able to give you a more comprehensive report and offer in greater detail the facts and other discoveries which I have made while visiting the various historical sites, the interesting present day hamlets, towns, and lakes, battlefields, rivers etc.\n\nI WISH TO MENTION that I had the pleasure of accepting an invitation to visit a Church of England Boys' Camp situated on the lovely shores of Lake Couchiching, Onto., Canada. They have many fine buildings, a very friendly and competent staff and a very kindly and truly godly gentleman, Rev. Wm. Bothwell, assistant pastor of the St. James Cathedral in Toronto, Ontario, is Supervisor.\n\nIN THIS CAMP there are about 120 young boys ranging from the ages of 9 to 16 years\u2014the Counselors are all over twenty-one age and older. Each Counselor has charge of the young lads under his charge day and night. The boys are taught swimming by a very capable instructor who could quite easily take a competitive swim. Other kinds of crafts and art craft work is under the capable and kindly direction of Mrs. Parks\u2014a clever and talented and lovely lady. Sports of every kind are also a part in every day's program.\n\nTHE INDIAN LORE PROGRAM is something definitely new for the camp and the boys and the staff were very thrilled by what little I could contribute to their benefit. I performed the ancient Delaware Indian Scalp Dance for them and excited for them a particular little story which goes with the Doll Dance. Also, I gave them a few pointers on Indian Sign Language and I finished off the evening by telling an old Indian legend called \"The Legend of the Red Man.\"\n\nI WAS THRILLED by the rapt attention I received, and by the light of anxious interest shining from the eyes of so many young boys who are growing up to take their places in the life of Canada. I thanked the Great Spirit when I arrived back to my cottage that night for giving me such a grand opportunity of spreading the gospel of the Red Indian in the hearts of little children who showered upon me their love and thanks.\n\nBY THE WAY, we had a huge Council Fire beside the lake shore for the occasion and all of the little boys and their Counselors had \"war paint\" on their faces. There were many games of skill and strength, and everybody had to wear a blanket over their shoulders and the blankets came in mighty handy that evening, because there was a terrific breeze blowing off the lake and it was chilly enough to make goose pimples rise on the flesh of even the honored guest\u2014the Chief\u2014himself. The boys and the staff were pleased and thrilled and asked me to visit them again next year.\n\nSTE. MARIE, STE. LOUIS, Ste. Ignace, in this part of Ontario\u2014the cradle of Ontario's history\u2014was once known as Huronia, in fact, I believe it was a modern name, as names in this country go. It is descriptive of the lovely bit of Indian territory which once could be found around the beautiful and picturesque Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada.\n\nWHERE I HAVE my summer cottage, Lake Simcoe, is quite a motor drive from the south-eastern shore of Georgian Bay. All of this land too, was once Indian land\u2014at present there are three islands in Lake Simcoe still belonging to the Ojibways.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJASPER HILL, \"Big White Owl\"\nEastern Associate Editor,\n\"The Native Voice.\"\n\nJONES NEWS STAND\nMagazines \u2014 Stationery Novelties\nGET YOUR HOME TOWN PAPER HERE\nPhone 352 P.O.

E. Thompson President of Totem Land Society\n\nI feel sure that the message I am giving you today will be of interest to all of the people of British Columbia and particularly to our Indian citizens.\n\nIn this supplement of \"The Native Voice\" I am grateful for the opportunity of telling my Indian brothers something of \"Totem-Land\" Society.\n\n\"Totem-Land\" was incorporated under the Societies Act on the 1st of August of this year. Its objects are to collect in writing and disseminate the legendary history, customs and philosophy of our native Indians; also to encourage and preserve their ancient weaving, painting and sculptural arts; to promote the use of a Thunderbird Totem and the slogan \"Totem-Land\" as the symbol of the color and romantic interest of the British Columbia Indians together with their singular totemology and unique weaving artistry. It is to assist, encourage and support British Columbia Indians in overcoming obstacles that stand in the way of their attainment to the enjoyment of citizenship.\n\nWhen one of your tribes did me the honor to make me Honorary Chief, I accepted that honor with the mental reservation that I would assume some of the attendant responsibilities.\n\n\u2014Continued on Page\u2014\n\nVancouver's Mayor in Indian Regalia\n\nChief Tom Shewish of the Sheshats of the Aht Tribe and Vice-President of the Native Brotherhood, bestowed the name of his grandfather, Hy-a-pen-cuth, on Mayor Charles Thompson of Vancouver and now President of Totem-Land Society, during an impressive ceremony attended by Chief William Scow, President of the Native Brotherhood (right).\n\n\u2014Courtesy Vancouver Daily Province\nMessage From Mayor Chas. E. Thompson\n\nI am pleased to accept the appointment as honorary vice-president of the society. He and his successors ex-officio will be able to obtain for \"Totem-Land\" the invaluable services of the association's members of the Native Brotherhood. Mrs. Maisie Allagoo Moore, her wise counsellor and member of the committee of the society will ensure the closest approach in all of the problems of our Indian brothers at may arise to be dealt with.\n\nThe Native Voice, your own newspaper and stout defender of Indian rights, has graciously agreed to become the official organ of \"Totem-Land\" Society.\n\nOne of the problems which I am bringing to the attention of the Society is the nondescript production and sale of spurious articles purported to be of Indian origin, more particularly of totem poles. Perhaps we may be successful in bringing about a new order of things in this regard.\n\nIndian Treasures Almost Lost To B.C.\n\nAF OF VANCOUVER'S unique attractions is the Edward and Mary Lipsett Indian Museum at Hastings Park. Mary Lipsett has been made an honorary life member at Totem-Land.\n\nBecause this remarkable exhibition was opened during the war, and because it is located off the beaten trail, many citizens are not aware that Vancouver has the only Indian Art Museum in Canada, one of the finest collections of its kind in the world. It is valued at $6,000.\n\nTwo large colorful totem poles stand on guard at the entrance, mutely telling passersby to investigate within. Here the art of Indians from the Atlantic to the Pacific; from the Eskimos in the north to the Pomas in the south may be seen and studied.\n\nIn the past, students of ethnology and anthropology from all parts of the world have come to study the life and culture of the Coast tribes. Now that the Canadian Government are beginning to realize the extent and value of the material lying on their doorstep.\n\nBecause of the wise foresight and generosity of the Lipsetts, representative examples of this art have been made available to our own people for all time and will prove a great attraction in the years ahead.\n\n\u2014Continued on Page 11.\n\nRemarks by Totem-Land President\n\nHis Worship, Mayor Thompson, has been kind enough to allow me to use his name as an Officer of \"TOTEM-LAND\" Society where in this Supplement I shall do justice to the responsibilities.\n\nWith the comprehension of the importance of the President's position, I feel that I could not but be proud to serve him and assist in any way possible in carrying out so worthy an organization.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the citizens throughout this province, particularly those who are not interested in the Society's operations would be most interested in the personal views of the officers and Executive Committee.\n\nThrough the publication of \"The NATIVE VOICE\" the Society's operations will be brought to the notice of the world.\n\nIf there are any readers who would like to contribute to the consideration of the Society's affairs, please write me at 200 West 4th Boulevard, Vancouver, B.C., for consideration at the next meeting.\n\nThe following is the composition of the Executive Committee:\n\nTo HONORABLE\n\nHON.

WISMER K.C.\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\n\nFamous Indian Artifacts\n\nto countless visitors who come to see the early history of this part of the world.\n\nUp the coast, in the midst of the stern and haughty Haidas, aristocratic and warlike, more than 300 and probably 500 intricately complicated\u793e\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7cfb\u7edf exist. In these they perpetuated their art in the form of carved wood, which have disappeared.\n\nThey also became famous for their beautiful silver bracelets and necklaces.\n\nThen there were the Tsimshians, who shared much with their own neighbors in the patterns of their designs.\n\nVery interesting is a fact concerning them. It must have been a trouble to the Indians to have their art stolen from them ever voiced a protest against the mortuary pole or merely pointed out that it was a Native art.\n\nThere is a wonderful display of artifacts which have been collected with great care and arranged in a very large and strong basket, which is now used in the old style ceremonies of Indians.\n\nHow strange it seems that Indians were smart enough to make such wonderful carvings out of a handful of sand and a piece of wood!\nRemarks by Secretary-Treasurer\n\nTotem Land Officers Include Prominent British Columbians\n\nRemarks by Harry Duker\n\nHis Worship, Mayor Thompson, President of our Society, has been kind enough to make reference to my appointment as an Officer of TOTEM-LAND\u00ae in his address printed elsewhere in this Supplement and I state my earnest desire that I shall do justice to the responsibilities entrusted to me.\n\nWith the comprehensive personal organization which our President is provided with, one could not but be proud to serve and assist in any way possible with so worthy an organization.\n\nIt has occurred to me that our citizens throughout the Province, particularly the Indian population, would be most interested in the personnel of our Officers and Executive Committee.\n\nThrough the publication of \"The NATIVE VOICE\", our Society's operations will be presented from month to month.\n\nIf there are any matters which you would like to present for the consideration of the Society or its Executive Committee, please write me at the NICHEWA HALL, 42nd and West Boulevard, Vancouver, B.C., so that it may be placed for consideration at the first available meeting.\n\nThe following is the list of Officers and Members of the Executive Committee:\n\nTotem-Land Officers\n\nHONORARY PRESIDENT:\nHON.

WISMER, K.C., M.L.A., Attorney-General of British Columbia.\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 10\n\nFamous Lipsett Museum\n\nto countless visitors who will come looking for just such records of the early days of our part of the world.\n\nUp the coast, in the misty Queen Charlotte Islands dwelt the proud and haughty Haidas, aristocrats of the Coast tribes; also the terror of more peaceful and less predatory peoples. Their religion and their complicated social system gave rise to the symbols and ideas which they perpetuated in their mighty totems, and in the smaller argillite carvings which have aroused the wonder of the world.\n\nThey also had beautiful metalwork, and many of their beautiful shell bracelets may be seen in the Lipsett collection.\n\nThen there were the Tsimshians, the fierce Kwakiutls, and the Salishans, each with their own designs and distinctive forms of art according to the patterns of their thinking.\n\nVery interesting is a Kwakiutl burial box painted in bold designs. It was made of a tamarack canoe, using the planks to form a coffin, to fold up into this small space but there are no records that any of them ever voiced a protest. These boxes were usually placed on a military site, or merely put in a tree where they were left to the tender mercies of Mother Nature.\n\nThere is a wonderful display of Tlingit basketry in beautiful patterns which are often quite unlike nature's. Thompson River Indians made very large and strong baskets with bold geometric designs all of which had a meaning in the old days, but most of it is lost to present generations.\n\nHow many people know that a very fine quality of jade is found right here in British Columbia, along the Fraser and around Lillooet? Don't think of expecting to gather up a fortune, however. Only the Indians were smart enough to polish it, and even then the amazing patience carved out of it wonderful wedges and similar tools, using nothing but a handful of sand and a piece of hide to cut this intensely hard substance.\n\nHON.

Stetfox of Rocky Mtn. House I decided to subscribe after glancing through his paper.\n\nWe are becoming established as a mission on one of the reserves here and find your work very interesting and also find that the Indians generally is not being assisted the way he deserves to a more comfortable and self supporting existence and as one of the white race, we are interested in their welfare not alone materially, but morally and most of all from a spiritual standpoint. That they might come to know \"the only true God and his Son whom he has sent.\"\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain, sincerely,\n\nA. J. WILSON\n\nGrandmother and Grandson\n\nBy EDWARD DICK\nAge 13. Grade V. Songhees School\n\nONCE there lived a very smart little boy with his grandmother, who raised him after his parents died. They used to work very hard for their food and one day they ran out of food.\n\nThen his grandmother made him a bow and arrow and told him to go hunting for deer or elk. He took the bow and arrow with him and went his way.\n\nHe was not gone long when he saw an elk drinking water from a stream. He killed the elk and then he went to tell his grandmother.\n\nShe went down to the stream where he wanted to butcher it up. They dried some of the meat for winter use. One day the grandmother took very sick, so she called him to her bedside and told him she could only think she wanted him to do. She told him he must take a bath every morning before he ate his breakfast. By doing this it would make him strong and do what she said and go to see for the rest of his tribe.\n\nIn those days there were lots of witches around at night who took all the children and put pitch on their eyes so they wouldn't be able to see where she was taking them. In that way they could not run away from her.\n\nShe used to kill them and eat them. Everyone tried to kill her but could not.\n\nOne day the boy went fishing. While he was fishing the witch woman came out of the bushes and asked him to take her across the river.\n\nHe did not want to do any favor for the wicked witch woman, but he thought it was his chance to try and kill her and that was what his grandmother wanted him to do, so he went.\n\nThe witch woman was so pleased with him. He told her to lay right down on the bottom of the little canoe and not move. So she lay down. The boy was singing some of his songs for her, so she fell asleep.\n\nAfter she was fast asleep, he went to the deepest part of the river. He took his spear and turned his canoe over. The witch was under the canoe in the water. She was calling him to help and save her life.\n\nHe could tell her he was doing his best to save her but he was pushing her down to the bottom of the river with his spear. In that way this wicked witch ended her life.\n\nAll the other members of the tribe rejoiced and had a feast. They were so glad that they wanted the young man to have the head of the witch. They even offered him the best young girls they had in the tribe. His grandmother was ever so glad that her grandson did what she wanted him to do.\n\nShe died a happy death, thus ending the story of the Grandson and Grandmother.\n\nANTI-DISCRIMINATION EFFORT BY NORTH VANCOUVER GROUP\n\nJuly 29, 1956\n\nEditor, The Native Voice:\n\nDear Friend: We are very disappointed that no notice has been taken of our Brotherhood campaign on the North Shore. We have received many letters of commendation from interested organizations and from the local Indians themselves but if no notice is taken by the Indian paper there is no encouragement for our committee to work on.\n\nWe have led the fight in this province against discrimination and are the first group to send a resolution to the government of B.C. asking for a \"Fair Employment Practice Act.\" We are also of labor by three years. This resolution has been endorsed by the Provincial Council of Women and will be formally presented to the government next winter.\n\nWe have been successful in raising the Indian question during every Local Council in BC and it will be discussed at their next Convention. Through my association with the North Shore Local Council of Consumers of Service as a member of the Inter-Religious Committee of the Vancouver branch of the United Nations are able to get our views before the international organizations.\n\nMr. Sinclair has asked us to send him our criticisms of Bills and suggest changes which he will forward to the government.\n\nWe would be glad to receive information on the Indian situation. No doubt the authorities will want to concentrate on certain changes and the more support they get from outside organizations the stronger their position will be.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEMMA J.

Agent made a trip to that part of country. The general idea was for him to become acquainted with the people of that district and the many problems confronting them.\n\nAmong them, one of the few literate of Anahim Lake who was able to read and write, made a trip to attend the eighteenth Annual Convention of the Native Brotherhood at Bella Coola in 1937. He expressed the wish that every effort be made to have a school at Anahim Lake. Many children according to Squinas, were school age and these children needed education. Finding assistance also needed and this was also requested.\n\nThe Native Brotherhood approached the Indian Affairs Department for B.C. in regard to this request with the result a small school was built and a teacher sent from eastern Canada to teach the children. However, the economic conditions of the Native Brotherhood made it impossible for a school to be opened and the result that people were forced to venture to other parts of the province to make a living and this included the children also.

Children on horseback galloping back and forth, gaily clothed; oldsters strolling through the jamboree with no thought of age. This is their three days of fun and then back to their homes in the Rainbow and Rchla Valley, the land of the Ulkatcho's.\n\nThree full days of the Stampede are scheduled for November 15th and 16th and 17th. Natives and whites in which each shared equal honors and at the conclusion of the event, a dance was held, in which all took part. The colorful days were over for a year.\n\nPack horses were again being loaded with what provisions could be bought at sky high prices, covered wagons were again being used and many camps would be necessary before arriving home in the wilderness.\n\nA meeting at Anahim Lake by the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia was held in the school house after the church service. It was well represented by members from Ulkatcho, Williams Lake, Redonda, Creek Clan, Blackwater, Anahim Lake and Nemiah Valley. The school, though quite large, was filled to capacity and the corridors were doorways.\n\nThis meeting was very successful as all were dressed in their best. The Range Riders and ten-gallon hats were in evidence everywhere. Women sat on the floors as there was no room to accommodate them. The pictures will give the reader an idea of the meeting and the various tribes represented.\n\nBusiness Agent E. Nahane ended the meeting by expressing his thanks at the large attendance and the interest shown by the people showed by the attendance.\n\nTHE AGED ALLOWANCE\n\nThe first subject to be discussed was the Aged Allowance. As they were told that in the future they would receive the sum of $25 per month. Some objected to the amount and said that it was not enough and that some instances the price of milk was 2 cents per can of milk which would give the reader an idea of what the $25 per month meant. $25 per month would replace milk and it would be a big weight off.\n\nBill 267 was explained. The people were informed that a copy of the Bill would be sent to them on the Business Agent.\nBrotherhood Meet at Anahim Lake\n\nA meeting at Anahim of the Native Brotherhood of B.C. was held in the school house after the church services and it was well attended by members from Ulkatcho, Anahim Lake, Redstone, Alexis Creek, Claskus, Blackwater, Ootsa Lake and Nemak Valley. The school house, quite large, was filled to capacity and many crowded the doorway.\n\nThis meeting was very colorful, as all were dressed in the garb of the Range Riders and ten gallon hats were in evidence everywhere. Women sat on the floors as there was no room left. Accompanying pictures will give the reader an idea of the meeting and the many tribes represented.\n\nBusiness Agent E. Nahaney opened the meeting by expressing his pleasure at the large gathering and the interest that the people showed by the attendance.\n\nTHE AGED ALLOWANCE was the first subject to be explained to the people and many aged wept, saying they would glad that some time they would receive the sum of $25 per month. Somehow, this meant new life and the urge to live. The former $8 per month Aged Allowance was not discontinued. However, the cost of living in that country is high\u2014prices are double and triple in some instances. The price of 40 cents per day can be made to give the reader an idea of what $8.00 per month meant. $25 per month would replace this and it is no wonder the aged wept.\n\nBill 267 was explained briefly. The people were informed that a copy of the Bill would be sent to them on the Business Agent's return home and for them to become familiar with its contents.\n\nMANY OTHER SUBJECTS were discussed and the people were very attentive, despite the long talk by the Business Agent. Their enthusiasm amounted as the Convention reports were made, similar to those made by Thomas Squinas. For the first time the Natives of this district heard news of other Natives located in other parts of the province and across the Dominion of Canada. They listened with great interest as the problems of their brothers and sisters in the east were discussed and from reports like this they will benefit. After explaining the work of the Native Brotherhood, discussions on local problems were in order.\n\nULKATCHO. Here is a problem that will take a lot of study and time in order to achieve for them proper administration. Ulkatcho is situated between Rainy and Itcha mountains and is very far from any sort of civilization. Their only means of getting supplies into and out of this remote area is by pack horse and saddle. In this valley, the people live in meadows miles apart from each other, their main diet, as mentioned by some of the older people, consists largely of moose meat. In the winter when the snows lie deep, they are unable to travel any great distance and their life depends on what they can get from the little Medical Aid is out of the question and no relief from the Department is available. Fifty miles through swamps from the end of the road to Williams Lake which is 260 miles away is the nearest source of relief. Bella Coola on the coast, some 90 miles which must be made on horseback through mountainous country, offers the next choice.\n\nAN INSTANCE WHERE a little boy took sick and ill and needed medical and hospital attention, he was carried by one of the men on horseback who attempted to make the trip to Bella Coola Hospital. The boy was wrapped carefully in warm clothes and was mounted on the rider in order that he would be made more comfortable. However, after travelling some 20 miles, the boy died and the rider returned to the village. Several instances similar to the one mentioned take their toll as the years go by.\n\nThese people are at a loss to know under what Agency to appeal for help. On times, Bella Coola is contacted and other people are informed that Williams Lake is their Agency and vice-versa. They feel that they are the forgotten tribe and for this reason have asked the Business Agent of the Native Brotherhood to identify and appeal on their behalf for some sort of understanding.\n\nIN COVERING THE ABOVE report the situation is serious because of road conditions. Where there is a rainy spell and the roads from Williams Lake become impassable on account of mud and washouts and on the other hand the difficult travel from Bella Coola is also liable to create difficulties and it would appear that the only solution would be to bring the Ulkatcho tribe nearer to a road end.\n\nBringing the Ulkatcho tribe nearer the road end has its possibilities. A large ranch has been offered for sale to the Indian Department for their use, and this ranch comprises some 3300 acres. This ranch is an ideal cattle ranch and has 15 beautiful log houses built on different sections of it. There are numerous corrals, breeding pastures, and other commodities, including farming implements of all description, horses, machines etc. This ranch is surrounded four miles on every side and this is mere travel by horseback in which the children are experts.\n\nThirty-five miles of new fence surround this place and plenty of water is available. It is believed that this is the answer to the Ulkatcho situation and it is hoped that the Indian department will give every consideration to this offer. On the other hand, if this offer is turned down and the rancher decides to sell out to others, a good chance will have been missed.\n\n(Continued on Page 16)\nBrotherhood Meeting in Anahim Lake Area\n\nSEVERAL NATIVES are working at the ranch at present and do work is seasonal and when it is completed they have no place to travel elsewhere to seek employment and the children are forced to follow. The answer, no doubt, lies in the ranch. Enquiries made by farmers who employ Native people to attend to the farms brought gratifying results. The men do not hesitate to say that boys are very efficient and need not be supervising them and they do e work.\n\nWITH THIS EXPERIENCE, hat would prevent them from seeking other jobs? They have no experience; they have not been hard way what work must be done in order to accomplish gratifying ends. Why not give them a chance? Must this passing-the-buck go forever?\n\nSeveral other matters came up for immediate attention and these were taken up with the proper authorities and will be taken care of. Louis Squinas, father of Thomas, raised cattle and his present herd has about 100 head; he is very ambitious and sought to buy more land. He bought a tract of land and did considerable work and management on it and paid the tax of $600 for it.\n\nA FEW MONTHS LATER, he was given the money back and was allowed a certain amount for his work. Louis wonders what it is all about. Thomas Squinas has a rather large range and is quite prosperous. His boys lack ambition have no land at all and are applying for same without results. These are the boys with considerable land and there are the boys who are forced to roam the country with their families seeking employment. Covered wagons along the road are not uncommon as man and wife and kiddies push their weary way looking for a farm that needs help. The answer is the ranch that is for sale.\n\nREDSTONE RESERVE is composed of farmland and here we meet another native looking for assistance from the Indian Department. They informed the Business Agent that many years ago, they applied to the Indian Department for an irrigation system from a lake which flows five miles away. Engineers were sent in and reports made, more agricultural men sent, more reports made, yet no word of the irrigation. The people who wrote these requests would like to know if their request is being honored.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner reports that a soil test was made by a university expert and is still waiting for the outcome of the report. It is hoped the answer will be found and the report given in order that some definite answer will be given to those people at Redstone Reserve.\n\nWE HOPE TO PUBLISH some encouraging news for the Anahim Lake and surrounding district in the near future.\n\nDesecration of Graves Deplored By Native\n\nThe Native Voice.\n\nDear Editor: Enclosed is $1.50 for which please send me the Indian paper, \"The Native Voice.\"\n\nI am a Cherokee Indian and am very much interested in the Indians' rights\u2014especially in the matter of Indian burial grounds that have been forgotten and gradually being desecrated and torn up.\n\nIt is high time that we Indians woke up on the burial ground issue for where would we be today if it hadn't been for our ancestors? We wouldn't be here, would we?\n\nWell, we must learn how to make a solemn tribute and show some respect for the graves of our ancestors that have been there for 500 years or longer. Just because the whites have been there a long time is no reason to forget them. For if we go and allow the white people to come from colleges and schools and dig and desecrate our sacred Indian graves\u2014and allow the real estate men to desecrate them\u2014there's nothing left for them around all these branching out towns and cities all over the United States and Canada combined\u2014where in a few years there won't be any ancient Indian graveyards. The whites will have them all desecrated and torn up.\n\nEven the farmers (some of them) every once in awhile clear up a woodlot on an old farm where Indian mounds are and pull the stumps out and dynamite 'em out and then plow it all up for a corn field or something.\n\nNow, I ask you, how much longer are the Chiefs of the tribes going to let this sort of thing go on? There should be a law to protect these graves.\n\nIt is high time the Chiefs got behind it. It was bad enough for the white people to come in here and take all the land away from the various Indian tribes, let alone coming out with their damned old cotton pickers' shovels and buying up all the old farms and cutting roads through the mand building a damned village right over the poor old Indians' graves\u2014and nobody does anything about it!\n\nWe Indians have got to appoint an overseer of burial grounds\u2014who can go around and find out\u2014by going over the various parcels of lands; go through each country in the state; go through the subdivisions and farms on the outskirts of the towns and cities and look for Indian burial mounds, make a note of them on a map, especially along lakes and streams where they used to hunt and fish and have battles with other tribes. Where they used to see a village, a burial ground would be close by. There are some real estate men in Flint, Mich., here, tearing up an old Chippewa burial ground on Flint at Tippin-Scott Boulevard, building F.H.A. houses in there.\n\nHave you any suggestions on how to stop these guys?\n\nB.

Canada\n\nAugust 19, 1950\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI have just read letter in the NATIVE VOICE which alluded to your writing that letter, and I am very glad that the editor of NATIVE VOICE understands.\n\nYou are quite right about school. Your comments apply to churches here the same as they do to Canada. The schools here have too many funny books which are not humorous and not enough serious INFORMATION which tells us how to live in this world.\n\nThe trouble is that the enormous wealth of the world in many countries has been stolen by the powerful machinery and the lazy people who get rich by getting rich for themselves. We must see to the proper distribution of the finances and the people who have failed to receive their money to buy things that they have produced. We must all help to put the world in condition. To do so we must be educated. We must see to it that what is causing the trouble before we can do much about it.\n\nThe crimes of the white man against the Native American continent are almost beyond belief. I have been learning about them ever since I joined the GREAT PEACE LEAGUE. It was set up here in Five Points, New York, long before. Consideration was told to me by a woman in my tribe and I joined immediately. I attended a formal confirmation ceremony. In which I was given a certificate of NATIVE VOICE. As a result, we have been making contact with the world. We tell our story by means of pictures or screen. It was the Indians who started the first NATIVE VOICE. We who live today should be about it. Also the young people of the Indians should know about the greatness of their fathers and mothers.\nEnjoys Life at Miller Bay Hospital\n\nKitkatla, B.C.\n\nEditor, The Native Voice:\n\nDear Friend: I just made up my mind to write to The Native Voice although I'm not good for anything. But I am still learning yet.\n\nMy husband was in the hospital two years and three months now, and I am not well myself. I have had to be in the General Hospital about five times and waiting another time yet for my operation. I have three children to support since my husband is in the hospital.\n\nI went to the Indian office and asked for help but no, they can't because I had a little business store.\n\nBut still I wouldn't give up. I wrote a letter to Mr. Anfield, Indian Superintendent, and asked him to take my son into school, so he did and my son is now in the Alberni School now. His family allowance was cut off since he has been in school and I have to send him money and clothes, candy and fruit every month. Just my daughter gets her family allowance but that isn't enough for her, everything costs so much.\n\nIn the summertime, I worked in the Cannery, B.C., and now my husband is in the hospital. The manager, Mr. Wallace, sent a boat to get me to the cannery and after the season took me home again. I am really proud of him.\n\nI prayed to God to help me and give me strength in mind and a pure heart. I just don't care what the people say about me so I made up my mind to pray to Mr. Wallace when I was in town to ask him to help me get a job at Miller Bay Hospital. He did, and now I have been working at Miller Bay for two months and one week today.\n\nI am so glad I can't wait for another day to start to work in the kitchen staff. Oh, I enjoy myself. I felt that I was back to school again. I don't want to miss a day's work. The matron is Mrs. Davis, then there is Miss Stevenson, and Miss Hall, and Miss Vincent is my boss in the kitchen.\n\nThe nurses are nice and there is good recreation for the maids and good meals too. On the 11th a party was held in the nurses' residence for Dr. Irene, who is leaving Miller Bay. Dr. Burgess presented a gift from the nurses to Dr. Irene. Dr. Olaf and Dr. Myron's baby received gifts from the nurses. Oh, it was a wonderful party and I enjoyed it.\n\nI have forgotten all my worries since I have been at Miller Bay and now the government closed up my store.\n\nMRS. KATE RIDLEY.\n\nLETTER TO JOHN NOON\n\nMr. John Noon (6035FTO), Thunderbird Reserve, Turtleford P.O., Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Noon:\n\nI have just read your very interesting article in the last NATIVE VOICE. I am very glad that you wrote that letter, and I am very glad that the editor of NATIVE VOICE put it in.\n\nYou are quite right about the schools. Your statement agrees with the schools here the same as they do to Canadian schools. There are too many funny books which are NOT funny at all. There is not enough serious INFORMATION that tells us how to live in this very crazy world.\n\nThe trouble is that the natural wealth of the world in many of the countries has been virtually stolen by a few people who use power machinery and the labor of millions of people to make profits for themselves. There is no proper distribution of the finished goods. The people who do the labor, do not receive enough money to buy the things which their labor produces. This does all help to correct that very bad condition. To do so we must all be educated. We must understand what is causing our troubles before we can do much about it.\n\nThe troubles between white man against the Native peoples of this continent are almost beyond belief. They have been going on until them only recently. I heard about the GREAT PEACE LEAGUE that was formed long before Columbus. This was told me by a woman who is an old Indian. She was initiated into the Sioux Indian tribe in a formal confirmation ceremony. It is she who told me subscribing to NATIVE VOICE. As a result, we have been making colored Indians know to tell this great story by means of pictures on the screen. It was told me that man has the first UNITED NATIONS and we who live today should know about it. Also the young people of the Indians should know about the greatness of their fathers, and our schools have utterly FAILED to teach that to any of us. I am trying to do what I can use pictures in teaching these great and important facts about a land and the most picture material should be used to tell the truth about should NOT be used to present a false image and lie.\n\nI know that you worked hard to write that letter, but I can easily understand it. I think I will send it to some of my young friends in Japan who are also interested. Perhaps I could send some very fine young people there also. Get all the pictures you can. It is possible learn about the importance of motion pictures in schools, and learn how to use them yourself. The ordinary theatre pictures are NOT GOOD, but good pictures can be made and they can be used. The thoughtless and poorly pictures about the Indians have made all of us believe things about native life which are NOT TRUE at all. Good pictures must be used by schools and churches to correct all this.\n\nI hope you will write to me, and maybe I can send you something that might help in some way. I could tell you more about picture movies and films. Thanking you for your effort and writing this letter, I am, your sincere friend,\n\nWALDO HALLSAP,\n1298 New Hampshire Ave.,\nLos Angeles.\n\nTHE WESTERN FISHING Co.

Though he no longer engages in seining, he still owns the seiner \"J14\" which is operated by his nephew, Ben Alfred, Jr.\n\nAt one time, Moses Alfred dragnet-seined in the Nimpkish River but now concentrates on operating his herring boat pante on Cranberry Pass, across from Echo Bay.\n\nIt is said that Moses was the first Native to own a seine boat, and this is probably true. The old J14 still catches more fish than many of today's more modern seine vessels.\n\nThere are now reported to be some fifteen seiners owned by the Nimpkish people.\n\nBen Alfred, Senior, Moses' brother, was skipper of the \"J14\" after Moses, but he is now in Saint Paul's Hospital in Vancouver.\n\nMoses Alfred is regarded as kind and an example to many of his people.\n\nHe has eleven children living and his three eldest sons have followed their father's vocation, all of them now carrying on as seine boat captains.\n\nMoses is the proud grandfather of 40 children, seven of them the family of his eldest son, Alvin, and seven also the children of his daughters who are the wife of James Seals of Alert Bay.

Chairman of the meeting was Jacob Louie; secretary was Pat Murphy, and those present at the meeting included Moses Smith, North West Coast District Vice-President of the Brotherhood.\n\nEd Nahaney opened the meeting by reporting the latest developments on the proposed breakwater that was now to be built by Coast Quarries if certain concessions were obtained regarding the future use of the rock necessary for the construction.\n\nA full explanation was also given as to the reason that this would assist to speed up operations. If passes were obtained by the Basil, it would mean that further negotiation would be required and that it was now late in the season and could mean an unnecessary delay.\n\nTHE YUQUOT MEMBERS held a long discussion on the matter and each phase was carefully considered and these discussions were also explained in the Native dialect of the Nootka tribe.\n\nMaurice McLean, \"I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Native Brotherhood of B.C. for all the great work they are doing in the interest of the Native People. And I also wish to thank the Business Agent, Ed Nahaney, who has travelled a great distance to be with us today in order to solve our problems and to give us advice. Therefore, on behalf of the Chief and the tribe,\n\n\"I move that we the Yuquot tribe grant full permission to the Coast Quarries Construction Company to remove from this Reserve whatever rock necessary to construct the breakwater in order to speed up the operation, and this Rock be given free of charge. Also that we co-operate to the fullest extent with the company regarding the assignment to the machinery and be employed and to the use of the Reserve for the machinery for construction.\"\n\nSeconded by August Murphy. Carried unanimously by a hand vote.\n\nMr. D. Ross, Superintendent of Coast Quarries then addressed the meeting and wished the tribe to take up the matter of renting the house of John Jumbo, for compensation. He assured the tribe that John Jumbo would be contacted and familiarized with his request. Ross also explained that water would have to be piped from a lake nearly a mile away for the construction crew and this would be taken up on his return to Vancouver.\n\nShips of rock were taken from the break-water site and these were being forwarded to Ottawa for testing.\n\nSamples of the lake water were also sent.\n\nAUGUST MURPHY then proceeded to relate the wishes of the Yuquot tribe regarding the behaviour of the crew members while working on the Reserve.\n\nD. Ross assured the people that this would be well taken care of under his supervision.\n\nThe question of the Fisheries was the next problem and this was in regard to a letter from the Superintendent Fisheries regarding the closure and opening dates of the West Coast to net fishing. The dates proposed by the Fishery Department suggested in the interest of salmon conservation that the closure should be from September 1st, 1950 to October 1st, 1950 in the district of Quatsino and Kyuquot.\n\nA LETTER WAS THEN read from the Business Agent from Allen George, secretary of the North West Coast who had held meetings with Kyuquot, Newchaltz, Queens Cove and Ehatisat and these tribes had agreed with the recommendations of the Fishery Department and the opening dates in that district were satisfactory on October 1st, 1950.\n\nThe Yuquot Nootka tribe gave the matter serious consideration and they moved that the opening dates suggested would also be accepted by them. This was seconded and carried unanimously.\n\nMOSES SMITH SPOKE in regard to the matter and explained the situation regarding the spawning year of 1945 and the complete closure of 1949 and the reason, mentioning the fact that it was on record that the Native People of the West Coast had taken the brunt of this means of allowing the escapement of fish to the spawning grounds. The sacrifice, he believed, was well worth the effort and that the future generations would benefit by sacrifices of this kind. He warned the people that no doubt more sacrifices might be necessary if the salmon were to be saved from being obliterated.\n\nIt was moved and seconded that the recommendations regarding boundaries etc. be tabled until a full meeting of the fishermen concerned would be possible and their decision be forwarded to the Business Agent at Vancouver.\n\nIT WAS THEN SUGGESTED the question of the Natives using their Native dialects on the boat to be put up to the Department of Transport on behalf of the West Coast people.\n\nIt was moved and seconded that the appointed Fishery Officer on duty on the North West Coast refer the right to catch commercial fish while on duty and that he be required to leave trolling poles down when making rounds.\n\nIt was moved and seconded that the above be forwarded to Fishery Department and the motion was carried unanimously.\n\nRE A OF SUNSHINE\nPOWER IS THE PAY-OFF\n\nAt sea, power is vital...power you can depend on at all times, in all weathers.

Indian Arts and Welfare Society.\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nMemo randum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nThe Minister's Notes on the School Section of the Indian Act\n\n1 (a) Day Schools\n\nThis is correct but there are still a few day schools remaining which were built\n\n(a) by the churches\n(b) by the Indians (band funds)\n(c) by the Department in conjunction with (a) and/or (b).\n\n1 (b) Residential Schools\n\nBuildings\n\nSome of these schools were built by the Department and are referred to as \"Government-owned\". Of the 69 residential schools, some 46 are in this category. The remaining schools were built by the churches (18 Roman Catholic and 5 Anglican) and are referred to as \"Church-owned\" schools.\n\nOperation\n\nA per capita grant is paid to the school management for the education and care of each Indian child whose attendance is duly authorized by the Department.\n\nMaintenance\n\nIn addition the Department pays the following items:\n\n(I) Major repairs in accordance with our regulations. At a \"Government-owned\" school we can exceed where necessary, items listed in our Estimates. At a \"Church-owned\" school this cannot be done without approval of the Governor-in-Council. For example, if a repair job at a \"Church-owned\" school costs $1,005.00 and the Vote only allows $1,000.00, then we must arrange a transfer and secure an Order-in-Council for the additional $5.00 required.\n\n(II) Equipment such as desks, blackboards, laundry machinery, electrical generators, etc., in accordance with our regulations. As in (I) above, the \"Church-owned\" schools cannot exceed the sums specifically voted.\n\n(III) School supplies including texts, scribblers, manual training tools, etc.\n\n(IV) Grants towards salaries of night watchmen for winter months at certain schools.\n\n(V) Grants towards salaries of manual training instructors where their qualifications meet our requirements.\n\nI would also point out for the Minister's information the fact that the Department can request the dismissal of staff members or of the Principal. This has been done on several occasions in the last few years and we have always had the co-operation of the church concerned.\nWe agree that in Section 10(2) of the old Act the difference between \"A Roman Catholic (or Protestant) School\" and a \"School conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" lay in the point of ownership. In other words, it is believed that the meaning of a \"Roman Catholic (or Protestant) School\" was a school both owned and operated by the church concerned. A \"School conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" is believed to have referred to a school owned by the Government but operated on its behalf by the religious denomination concerned.\n\nNomination of Day School Teachers\n\nIn certain day schools the Department allowed the churches to nominate the teachers but retained the right of dismissal if such teachers proved unsatisfactory. This practice of nomination has been greatly reduced in the last three years and will probably disappear. The Department of course will have to make certain that teachers are appointed who are of the denomination of the majority of the Indians concerned as provided for in Section 121 of the new Act. This precludes the appointment of teachers by the Civil Service Commission, and leaves the matter in the hands of the Department as authorized by Order-in-Council.\n\n3. Provincial schools vary of course in the use of the term \"public\". In Quebec these are Roman Catholic schools; in other provinces they are \"non-denominational\". We pay tuition fees for Indian children who attend such schools.\n\nThe Minister is correct in his summary of the three types of schools to which Roman Catholic children might be sent but we might also add a fourth category of school,\n\n(d) a provincial school or private school in which religious instruction in the Roman Catholic faith is given by the teacher or by a priest.\n\nSection 118\n\nI agree with the Minister's summary concerning this section and feel that the adjective \"residential\" school should be eliminated throughout this section.\n\nOur practice at the present time where we have pupils of a religious minority, insufficient to establish a school, is to take one of the following actions:\n\n(a) send the children concerned to a residential school of the faith concerned,\n\n(b) send the children to a nearby provincial school or separate school if available.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nNovember 1, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Doucet  \nMajor Clark  \nMajor Eisenhardt  \nMr. Trapp\n\nTravelling Expenses\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the officials of this Division are lax in forwarding to Treasury their travelling expense claims and in accounting for advances made for inspection trips.\n\nThis Division is by far the worst in the Branch and therefore I have been told that all officials in future must account for these advances within ten days of their return from an inspection trip. If there are special circumstances, I would like to hear about them.\n\nIn future, I am not prepared to sign a requisition for an accountable advance for a trip unless previous accountable advances have been settled with Treasury. The only exception will be where an official is in town only two or three days and is being required by special circumstances to make another trip.\n\nBernard P. Hearst  \nDept. of Indian Education\nOttawa, November 7, 1950.\n\nAndrew Paull, Esq.,\nPresident,\nNorth American Indian Brotherhood,\nP.O. Box 211,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Paull:\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 25, I am pleased to supply you with some information additional to that which may be found in the Annual Reports of the Department which I expect you have.\n\nThe post-war period has seen the emphasis shift from the construction of residential schools to the provision of day schools wherever the Indian community is prepared for them.\n\nHowever, as materials and labour became available construction of three residential schools has been begun. These are at Lower Post, B.C., Hay Lakes, Alta., and Seven Islands, P.Q. To build and equip such schools requires a minimum of $300,000.\n\nDuring the same period the Department acquired a former Army barracks at Prince Albert, Sask., for use as a residential school. This institution now enrols 349 pupils. The Department also contributes to a privately-operated boarding-school for Indians and others at Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nSince World War II the number of teachers in our day schools has increased from 285 to 505 (November, 1950). There has been a gratifying improvement in the professional standing of our Indian school staff as will be seen from a study of the figures that appear in the attached table A.\nThe increase in day schools is most notable in Alberta which was formerly served by eighteen residential schools and three small day schools at Sarcee, Frog Lake and Kehewin.\n\nThere are now nineteen residential schools. The three day schools named have recently been replaced by up-to-date buildings. In addition, day schools are now being conducted or are under construction at: (North to South)\n\nUpper Hay River    Stony Plain (two)\nFort McKay         Ermineskin\nAtikameg           Hobbsma (three)\nWhitefish Lake     Louis Bull\nJanvier            Montana\nSaddle Lake (two)  Bighorn\nGoodfish Lake      Sunchild\nAlexander          Eden Valley\nMichel             Blackfoot\nAlexis             Peigan\n\nIn the Yukon, Indian children may now attend day school at: (North to South)\n\nOld Crow           Burwash Landing\nMoosehide (Dawson) Whitehorse\nMayo               Teslin\nCarmacks\n\nIn the Northwest Territories, Indians of the Mackenzie River area who formerly were served by four residential schools now have day school facilities functioning, or nearing completion at:\n\nAklavik            Fort Rae\nFort McPherson      Yellowknife\nArctic Red River    Fort Simpson\nFort Good Hope      Roche River\nFort Franklin       Hay River\nFort Norman         Fort Smith\n\nI include the most recent map of the Yukon-Northwest Territories area, showing the places I have mentioned above.\nOne of the Department's recent innovations is the Hospital School. The teachers at these schools are included under the classification \"Welfare Teachers\" in table B herewith. They are on duty all year round except for the usual annual leave of eighteen days. Hospitals and sanatoria where such teachers are employed are situated as follows:\n\nIn British Columbia\n- Coqualeetza\n- Miller Bay\n- Nanaimo\n- Alert Bay\n\nIn Alberta\n- Charles Cassell (Edmonton)\n\nIn Manitoba\n- Clearwater (The Pas)\n- Dynevor (Selkirk)\n- Brandon\n\nIn Ontario\n- Sioux Lookout\n- Moose Fort\n- Weston\n- Fort William\n\nThe Parliamentary Committee's recommendation that wherever possible Indian children should receive their schooling along with other children is being implemented more and more each year as opportunities arise. I include a summary of the latest figures available of Indian children attending provincial and private schools in (a) the elementary grades and (b) secondary grades and special courses. The latter includes university students and teachers in training. These figures, you will observe, are greatly increased over the numbers for which provision was made before the recent war. In those days the vote for \"tuition grants\" from which the expenses of these pupils were defrayed was between $30,000 and $40,000. Last year the sum of $135,000 was voted and spent for this purpose. The highly interesting details of such attendance and expenditure in British Columbia, in which I gather that your P.T.A. members would be\nparticularly interested may be confirmed by Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell who may also have other information of particular local interest that he can make available.\n\nPlease be assured that I appreciate very much your interest in these matters and your desire to support the Department's efforts to improve the educational facilities available to Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nCAFC/MMcN\nNovember 4, 1950.\n\nMr. Emile Vincent,\n1647 Aylwin St.,\nMontreal, P.Q.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 16.\n\nI attach copies of our last Annual Report in which you will find a section devoted to Indian education.\n\nI could provide you with additional information, were I informed of your particular interest in Indian education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

The children, wishing to actually correspond with the Indian child of today, have written their letters.\n\nNot knowing the correct address and whether or not they will reach their destination, I am appealing to you. Would you please put the correct address on the\nenclosed envelopes. These are to the Indians on the reservations. I hope this is not out of order with your policy, because my children are very eager to hear from some third or fourth grade Indian children. Thank you very much for your kindness.\n\nSincerely yours,\nGeraldine Hindley\nNovember 10, 1950.\n\nMr. R. Moffatt,\nMuskoka Sanatorium,\nMuskoka, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour name has been given to me by Dr. Stothers, with the suggestion that I write to you concerning your teaching techniques.\n\nWe have now a large number of teachers employed in Indian hospitals and are naturally on the lookout for new techniques and devices. I realize this will be difficult for you to write about but would like to have one of our Inspectors visit you at the school early in the new year.\n\nIf this is possible, I would be pleased to hear from you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I realize that one is an Anglican clergyman and the other is about to be ordained. However, arrangements can always be made for the Catholic children to be excused if religious instruction is being carried on in the classroom. This is done in some of the Catholic day schools which are attended by Protestant children.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Clark, I am glad you give him the benefit of the doubt as we have had no complaints concerning him previously in this regard.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMuskoka Hospital\nFOR THE TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS\nESTABLISHED 1896\nOPERATED BY\nNATIONAL SANITARIUM ASSOCIATION\n\nNovember 16, 1950.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThank you for your letter of November 10 inquiring about our teaching techniques in Muskoka Hospital School.\n\nI agree that an on-the-spot inspection would be preferable to a written description. We shall be very pleased to have one or several of your inspectors visit us for a day or two early in the new year. Dr. Ross, our superintendent, has asked me to advise you that we shall be happy to provide meals for your representatives and, if quarters are available at that time, we shall welcome them as guests in that respect also.\n\nSo that I may be sure of being home, I would appreciate your setting a date for anytime after January 2.\n\nWe shall look forward to a mutual exchange of ideas; I am sure advantage will be derived on both sides.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. M. Moffat,\nEducational Director.\nNovember 24, 1950.\n\nCHIEF EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nLetter from Professor S.R. Laycock\n\nI suggest the following for inclusion in the answer to Professor Laycock:\n\nMy dear Professor Laycock:\n\nWith regard to the suggestions that appear on page 3 of your letter I am pleased to supply the following information.\n\n(Para. 1) See copy of Hansard.\n\nWith regard to the last sentence of Para. 1 I quote from the report of an Educational Survey Committee which recently worked in your own province at Broadview:\n\n\"The Committee has made recommendations intended to ensure that the organization of these schools and their integration with other units of the school system shall provide the Indian children with educational advantages comparable to those now enjoyed by other children.\"\n\nOfficials of this Division are on the move throughout the country from time to time seeking to achieve this ideal.\n\n(Para. 2) Per Capita grants.\n\n(Para. 3) In the Day schools the Department makes generous provision of materials for the teaching of a variety of manual arts wherever the teacher possesses any degree of professional competency for this instruction.\nand often where the teacher is only an amateur and is seeking to develop additional skills which she can cultivate in her pupils. A notable example is the work of Miss Lillias Farley (formerly of the Vancouver School of Art) at the Whitehorse Day School in the Yukon where the children are being trained to work in a variety of fine and useful arts and materials. Again on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford the pupils of 12 scattered schools are taken to a recently-established centre where the boys receive instruction in Manual Training and shop work and the girls are taught Home Economics by highly qualified instructors employed by this Department. At Caughnawaga near Montreal, similar provision is made for the pupils of two schools having a total of 15 classrooms. In the Maritimes at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni where residential and day pupils are concentrated in the same buildings, similar provision is made. Elsewhere at points where there is not a concentration of Indian pupils which would permit the full-time employment of instructors by this Department, arrangements are made with local school boards to admit Indian pupils to the Manual Training and Domestic Science classes conducted by local school boards. Examples of this development may be seen at Sipece in Alberta where the pupils are transported to Calgary and at Alberni in British Columbia. Most of our residential schools, of course, have these facilities and where day school pupils attend a residential centre (a development which is being encouraged) they receive the same instruction. The Department faces, of course, problems very similar to those of school districts which find difficulty providing even the rudiments of Vocational Training and guidance to the pupils of small and scattered elementary schools. There is an increasing number of Indian students who receive \"tuition grants\" i.e., monetary assistance that provides them with the cost of room and board as well as the necessary fees to attend installations that complement the training received in Indian schools. The Department is subsidizing the attendance of pupils at vocational schools in such cities as Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver. Your Federation may be assured that as opportunities to extend this form of education arise they will be fully exploited by our officials.\nparticularly by the Supervisor of Vocational Training who has been in the employ of the Indian Affairs Branch for the past 10 years.\n\n(Para. 4) In view of your suggestion that the Indian Affairs Branch should seek the advice of Major Eisenhardt, formerly Director of National Fitness with the Department of Health and Welfare, it will be gratifying to your Federation to learn that Major Eisenhardt has for some months held the appointment of Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation in the Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch. This official has already made an extensive survey of existing facilities and probable requirements in his field. An increased allotment of funds has been made for this purpose, and considerable expenditures have already been made to provide on an increased scale the equipment which your Federation desiderates. Because many of our schools are situated where the winters are long much emphasis has to be placed on indoor play activity, and consequently gymnasia are under construction or are projected at various points. By the same token there has been a great increase in the provision of motion picture apparatus and films to each school. I attach a circular describing the most recently established film circuit.\n\n(Para. 5) There has lately been a closer relationship between field officials of this Branch and executive members of your Federation and attempts have been made at points as far apart as Munsey, Ontario and Sarcee, Alberta. The Indian Affairs Branch expects that there will soon be other local associations formed. It is possible that some of the numerous \"Homemaker's Clubs\" which have been functioning for many years, particularly east of the Great Lakes, may take the name of Home and School organizations which, in effect, they really are. Meanwhile the Indian schools by means of pupils' associations and clubs are seeking to give new aspects of citizenship - ideals which will fit and inspire the pupils in adult life to be active in parent-teacher liaison work. It is expected that the Indian School Inspectors shortly to be appointed will give added impetus to this development, just as the recently appointed social workers have also made their influence felt in the \"Home and School\" movement. As all these officials work within either the Indian Commissioner's office in Vancouver or the offices of the Regional Supervisors in the capitals of the Prairie Provinces, North Bay, Ontario, Ottawa, and Eskasoni, N.E., the literature provided by your\nFederation might well be directed to these offices, and where there is any charge for such literature you may be assured the charges will be paid as one of our more welcome expenditures.\n\nIn regard to your comments on the type of education provided, your Federation is invited to visit and inspect some of our installations which serve as models of what we are trying to do in other places where it is possible to improve the situation. I have already mentioned Caughnawaga and Nansay, and your Federation members are acquainted, no doubt, with the very superior installations which exist at Alberni, Kamloops, Fort Qu'Appelle. Your attention is particularly invited to our installations at Prince Albert where we are attempting to serve the needs of nearly 500 Indian children. In Prince Albert special provision is made for the adolescent beginners and an attractive programme is provided under enlightened guidance.\n\nYou mention your Committee's concern over the limited number of Indian children enrolled in the High School grades. I shall direct the officials of the Education Division to provide you with the latest statistics which will show the increasing number of Indian children enrolled in secondary schools. It is the policy of this Department that wherever possible secondary education for Indians shall be received in schools attended by other children. For the moment I can assure you that the total of Indians enrolled in High Schools in Brantford, Ontario, Brandon and Birtle, Manitoba, Edmonton, Alberta, and Alberni and Alert Bay in British Columbia, is a very encouraging figure.\n\nAs far as the curriculum in the Department's elementary schools is concerned the usual practice is to follow the curriculum of the province with adaptations recommended by provincial school inspectors, the Department's own travelling officials and those teachers and other workers who have acquired knowledge of local requirements. All teachers are encouraged to associate themselves with local professional groups in the discussion of subjects calculated to give the Indian child the same opportunities that are available to other future citizens.\n\nYours most sincerely,\nNovember 21, 1950.\n\nCol. R.F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Harrett was in to see me a few days ago and said that you were interested in putting a teacher in this institution to carry on the teaching of Indians who are patients here.\n\nI think that you probably know a fair amount about our attempts at teaching the Indians while they are here. At the moment we have 12 full time teachers, 8 part-time teachers and 6 full time occupational therapists. Attempts are made up to grade level of normal capacity. We have the facilities to teach in both primary and secondary schools and, as a matter of fact, usually have a few patients who are taking extra-credit work for universities.\n\nThe Indian children are scattered throughout the institution and are engaged in different types of work. Therefore, any teacher supplied by you would, of necessity, have to be included in the joint pay roll. I believe that the salary would be quite adequate if we usually had between 20 and 30 Indians here so that it would be impossible for one teacher to take over the Indians' patients and give them an adequate number of hours. Therefore, I think it would be best for us to hire the teacher and have her on our regular pay roll and in turn charge you for the salary.\n\nOur proposal at the moment would be that we average the salaries paid to the teachers and charge you the average rate. This would therefore balance the cost out over the entire group.\n\nI think that this is a very commendable effort on your part and you can be assured that we appreciate it. We feel that the work that we are undertaking is extremely important and does a great deal to raise the level of those unfortunate citizens who are suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nIf this is satisfactory could you please confirm the arrangements, that admitting me what books, etc., are available through your Department and how they may be obtained.

T.H.L. MacINNES\n\nI enclose ten letters which explain themselves. The information requested is not available in our office, and I thought that you might be able to reply to them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nNOTE FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE MINISTER\n\nRe School Sections of the Indian Act\n\nNotes regarding school sections have been amplified after consultation with the Superintendent of Indian Education and checked and confirmed by him. Note that there are no general grants\u2014all grants are specific.\n\nSection 10 (2)\n\nRe Attendance at Roman Catholic or Protestant Schools or Schools Under Respective Auspices\n\nThis provision was put in the Act in 1920, 10-11 Geo. V. Cap 50, Section 1 (6). No reference can be found in Hansard. There was a Special Committee of the House of Commons on the 1920 amendments to the Indian Act, but the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence were not printed.\nSchool Section of the Indian Act\n\n1. The present Act, section 10 (1), makes provision for compulsory education of all Indian children at \"such day, industrial or boarding schools as may be designated by the Minister.\" There is a qualification in 10 (2) that such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required, and that no Protestant child should be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and the reverse.\n\nThere seem to be the following kinds of schools:\n\n(a) The day school on the Reserve built, operated, and maintained by the Department in which the teacher is hired by the Department and under the present Section 100 (2), the teacher shall belong to the religious denomination of the majority of the persons on that Reserve.\n\nThere are, however, still a few day schools remaining which were built by (a) the churches, (b) by the Indians from band funds, and (c) by the joint expenditure of the Department and churches, by the Department and Indian band, and by the Department, churches and Indian band, which are operated and maintained by the Department.\n\n(b) The residential school conducted by any one of four religious denominations, Roman Catholic, Anglican, United and Presbyterian. Most of these schools were built by the Department and are referred to as \"Government owned.\" Of the 69 residential schools, some 46 are in this category. The remaining schools were built by the churches and are referred to as \"church-owned\" schools. The Department pays a per capita grant to the school management for the education and care of each Indian child whose attendance has been duly authorised by the Department, and also pays for general maintenance such as major repairs, equipment and school supplies and grants towards salaries of night watchmen during winter months at certain schools and salaries of manual training instructors where their qualifications meet our requirements. The staff of these schools, appointed and paid by the churches concerned, are under their direct control, although the Department can request the dismissal of staff members or of the principal, and where such action has been taken in the past few years, the Department has always had the co-operation of the church concerned.\n\n2. \"A school conducted under (Roman Catholic) auspices\"\u2014\n\n(Protestant)\nThis has not been defined, but in the present Act, Section 10 (2), the difference between a \"Roman Catholic (or Protestant) school\" and a \"school conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" has been taken to be that of ownership. In other words, the meaning of a \"Roman Catholic (or Protestant) school\" was a school which was both owned and operated by the church concerned. A \"school conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" is believed to have referred to a school owned by the Government, but operated on its behalf by the religious denomination concerned. For both government-owned and church-owned residential schools, the Department pays management a per capita grant for each pupil duly admitted. The Department allowed the churches to nominate teachers in certain day schools, retaining the right of dismissal if unsatisfactory, but this practice has been greatly reduced in the past few years.\n\n3. The provincial school to which Indian children go by agreement with the Provincial Government. This is a public school, and we pay the tuition fees of Indian children who attend. Provincial schools vary, of course, in the use of the term \"public.\" In Quebec these are Roman Catholic schools; in the other provinces they are \"non-denominational.\"\n\nThe practice now is, therefore, that the Roman Catholic church may and does insist that children of their faith go to any one of the following schools:\n\n(a) a Roman Catholic residential school\n(b) a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices\n(c) a day school with a Roman Catholic teacher\n(d) a provincial school or private school in which religious instruction in the Roman Catholic faith is given by the teacher or by a priest.\n\nBoth (a) and (b) are residential schools. The Department has not admitted that a day school in which there is a Roman Catholic teacher is under Roman Catholic auspices. On the contrary, it is under the auspices of the Department.\n\nThe practice has been, however, that a Roman Catholic parent did not have the right to send his child to a residential school abroad if there were a day school with a Roman Catholic teacher. Without admitting that such day school is \"under Roman Catholic auspices\", the Department has allotted that child, on occasion, to that school in the discharge of its duty under 10 (2).\nSection 118 of the Bill as revised leaves the Act 10 (2) virtually unchanged.\n\nThe present Act 100 (3) provides for establishing separate schools with approval of and under regulations made by the Governor in Council. Section 122 of the Bill provides for establishing separate schools with the approval of, and under regulations made by the Minister, unless in the opinion of the Governor in Council the number of children of school age does not so warrant.\n\nThe practice followed at the present time, in cases where there are insufficient pupils of a religious minority to establish a separate school, is to send the children concerned to a residential school of the faith concerned, or to a nearly provincial school or separate school if available.\n\nSo that at the moment, the Roman Catholic parents can, undoubtedly, see that their children take instruction from any one of four different kinds of schools in which, at the minimum, they would be instructed by a Roman Catholic teacher, but under the new Act, they could be assigned to a school taught by a Protestant if the Minister refused the separate school under Section 122.\nCitizenship and Immigration\n\nOTTAWA, December 14, 1950.\n\nURGENT\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Phelan\n\nThis is with reference to our conversation of this morning, concerning the information required by the Minister's office as follows:\n\n1. (a) Number and place of day schools built by the Department.\n\n   Number and place of schools built by\n   (i) Churches\n   (ii) Indians from band funds\n   (iii) by Department and churches\n   (iv) by Department and Indian band\n   (v) by the Department, Church and Indian band.\n\n   (b) A list of residential schools showing ownership - government or church (denomination).\n\n2. Amount of per capita grant and per cent of total cost of the education of Indian children.\n\n3. Are all day schools on Indian reserves?\n\nHerewith attached copy of memorandum previously submitted.\n\nPlease return.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nExtract from the Minutes of meeting between the Honourable W. E. Harris and Indians of the Southern Part of Saskatchewan held at Regina, on Wednesday, November 15th, 1930.\n\nJoe Ironquill, from Peepeekisis Reserve, Pine Hills-Qu'Appelle Agency, stated he thought it would be a good thing to get that point cleared up. He went on to say: \"We are fortunate in having our Superintendent of Education right here. Now I want him to bring another picture about this moving of Indians away from a town. This is my idea right here. Now I come from a little town where we have a lot of difficulty in sending our children to a day school. We are living right alongside the town. Our reserve is touching the town right now. They had all kinds of lame excuses why I could not send my children to school in the town. They stated I had to buy a piece of land and pay taxes, and the town passed a by-law that if an Indian wanted to send his children to a school in the town, he had to move into the town. My idea is to bring the Indian up to the same standard of education as the white man. Most people think if you are an Indian you are nothing much, but to my mind I have a different opinion of an Indian. I do not take a back seat to anyone. If you give us the same education as a white man, we will stand alongside the white man, therefore, I say, Mr. Harris, give us the same education as a white man, and we will take our place beside him. I am speaking on behalf of the Peepeekisis Reserve in that remark. Give us the same education as the white man, and we will do things the white man is doing, and work with him. Give us good teachers to teach our children, and after they are educated they will come back and work for us. Colonel Neary reported to me just a few minutes ago that there are 40 Indian school teachers in Ontario. That is my hope for this province, to have our own Indian teachers in our own schools. We have to have somebody here besides Mr. Ostander. He is not going to be here forever. I believe in educating the Indian like the white man, but not moving him away from the towns or villages.\"\nOttawa, October 18, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe DIRECTOR\n\nIndian Education\n\nPlease find attached hereto a draft of the material suggested for inclusion on this topic in the Canada Year Book.\n\nThe Indian school system has continued its steady growth in both numbers of schools being operated and numbers of children being educated.\n\nIn 1934 there were 256 day schools in operation with 309 teachers employed. In 1939 this had increased to 283 schools with 333 teachers. By the end of 1949 there were 364 day schools with 562 teachers. These figures indicate the rapid growth which has taken place in the Indian school system during the last few years. In maintaining a steady growth in the number of day schools being operated, there has also been a steady improvement in the qualifications of the teachers who are employed. Since the introduction of a Salary Schedule we have been gradually reducing the number of unqualified teachers. Our policy has been clearly stated as follows:\n\n1. The elimination of unqualified teachers;\n2. A gradual reduction in the number of teachers holding Second Class certificates;\n3. The employment, wherever possible, of teachers holding First Class Certificates.\n\nThe following chart will indicate clearly the great improvement which has taken place since the introduction of our salary schedule in September 1947:\n\n| Qualifications of Teachers | January 1948 | January 1949 | January 1950 |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| No. of teachers with First Class Certificates | 97           | 133          | 172          |\n\n(see page 2)\nQualifications of Teachers\n\n| Qualification                  | January 1948 | January 1949 | January 1950 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Number of teachers with First Class Certificates | 97           | 133          | 172          |\n| Number of teachers with Second Class Certificates | 106          | 104          | 109          |\n| Number of teachers with Third Class Certificates (or unqualified) | 120          | 102          | 95           |\n\nIt should be further pointed out that many of the unqualified teachers have Third Class Certificates, Permits, etc., and have been employed for many years in our schools. During this time they have come to understand their Indian pupils well and have rendered valuable service.\n\nThe growth in the number of classrooms being operated reflects the heavy building program which has been undertaken. Our aim is of course to provide educational facilities for every Indian child. To accomplish this, we must assess carefully every reserve and decide the type of school which can best serve the children. Educational survey committees are established to carefully investigate these matters and often large areas and many reserves are covered. As a result of these investigations, decisions are made with regard to the size and type of school to be erected and also its location.\n\nThere then follows a period of overcoming the difficulties and obstacles which must be faced in erecting schools in the isolated sections of Canada in which these Indians live. It may be the carrying of materials by tractor train to a reserve in the Norway House Agency of Manitoba; it might involve the transporting of a prefabricated school to a fishing village on the coast of British Columbia; or the hauling out of logs for the erection of a log school in the Yukon. For we are now dealing with the Indians who have been\nneglected in the past and for whom it is difficult to provide schools. These are the Indians living on the so-called \"fringe of civilization\". Transportation is our main difficulty and our schools are erected in many and varied ways, with buildings of logs, metal, and prefabricated parts all being found.\n\nWhere day schools are not feasible, due to the nomadic habits of the Indians concerned, residential schools are erected. Three such schools are under erection now, all in isolated parts of Canada. One is at Lower Post near the Yukon - British Columbia boundary. The other is at Hay Lakes in Northern Alberta near the boundary with the Northwest Territories. The third is at Seven Islands on the north shore of the St. Lawrence.\n\nThe success of our building program is best indicated by the fact that since 1947 there has been a total increase in day school enrolment of 311 pupils.\n\nAn entirely different problem from that of providing a basic elementary education for these northern Indians is presented by the need for changes in our school system on reserves located close to white communities. The Parliamentary Committee on Indian Affairs recommended that Indian children be educated wherever and whenever possible in association with other children. To this end, we have been negotiating continually with local school boards and provincial departments of education. There are now 1180 Indian children in elementary grades in such schools. This is a growth of 255 pupils in one year. While statistics were not accurately kept, there were only about 200 children enrolled in provincial schools in 1934.\n\nThe increase in the number of pupils in our schools and the improvement in the teachers being hired has resulted in a steady trend towards higher education. In 1949 there were 661 pupils attending classes above Grade 8; this represented a considerable increase over the previous year. However, in 1950, there were 834 students attending\nsecondary classes and we expect to reach the thousand mark by next year. This splendid record indicates that Indian youth is taking a greater interest in its own education. Many of these young people are going through for vocations which will be of assistance to their fellow people. We are encouraging as many as possible to go through for teaching and nursing. In addition, in education particularly we have been pleased with the results and many of our day schools are now being taught by qualified Indian teachers. On the Six Nations Reserve the supervising principal and the eighteen teachers in charge of classrooms are all Indians. We are proud of this achievement and hope that other reserves will follow this pattern.\n\nIn conclusion it is emphasized that we are still far from our goal of providing educational facilities for every Indian child. Slowly, we are pushing into these isolated reserves and our teachers are blazing new frontiers in education and social progress. Many of them are classified as welfare teachers, living on the reserves for 12 months in the year and working towards the steady improvement of living conditions on these reserves. The isolation and the loneliness of these northern posts hold no fears for these teachers and their contribution towards the steady progress of our Indian people can never be measured. Theirs is a great public service and one of which we as Canadians can all be proud.\nCOPY\n\nP.C. 3455\n\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\n\nWEDNESDAY, the 19th day of July, 1950.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, is pleased to make and doth hereby make the following regulations governing the payment of school fees and transportation costs in respect of the children of certain employees of the Government of Canada who reside on Government property and who by reason of the conditions of their occupancy are not subject to municipal taxation in respect thereof:\n\nREGULATIONS\n\n1. In these Regulations,\n\n(a) \"child\" does not include a person who has attained the age of eighteen years at the commencement of the school year;\n\n(b) \"federal land\" means land owned by His Majesty in right of Canada;\n\n(c) \"Minister\", when used with reference to an employee, child of an employee, or land, means the Minister having the direction, control and management of the employee or land;\n\n(d) \"non-taxable employee\" means an employee of His Majesty in right of Canada who, by reason of the conditions of his occupancy of federal land, is not subject to municipal taxation in respect of that land, and who applies to the Minister for financial assistance towards the cost of educating his children; and\n\n(e) \"school authority\" means, with reference to a school, the corporation, board or other body that, with due authority, levies taxes to meet the expenses of operating and maintaining the school.\n\n2. Where a non-taxable employee resides on federal land that, in the opinion of the Minister, is within easy access of a school established by the Minister of National Defence, the Minister shall, unless the facilities are insufficient, arrange with the Minister of National Defence for the accommodation at that school of the children of the employee, while he is so resident, in accordance with the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 44/2300 of 6th May, 1950.\n3. (1) Where a child of a non-taxable employee is not accommodated at a school mentioned in section two, the Minister may arrange for the child to be accommodated at a school in another municipality in which the employee resides. If, in the opinion of the Minister, the school facilities in that municipality are inadequate, or a school in a municipality having adequate facilities is not available, a report shall be submitted to the Treasury Board whenever attendance at a school outside the municipality in which the employee resides becomes a necessity arising from the arrangement and the additional costs resulting, if any.\n\n(2) Where a child is accommodated at a school pursuant to an arrangement under subsection (1), the Minister may pay to the school authority in such amount during each school year as the Minister considers reasonable, but not exceeding the school fees actually charged for the accommodation of the child resident at the school.\n\n(3) The amount payable under subsection two may be paid to a non-taxable employee to the extent that he has paid school fees to the school authority in respect of the child's attendance at school, and the school authority shall be reduced by the amount so paid.\n\n4. (1) Where a child of a non-taxable employee, pursuant to an arrangement under section three, attends a school in a place other than fifteen miles and not more than thirty-five miles from the place of residence, and to attend the school uses a public transportation service approved for the purpose by the Minister under the provisions of either subsection two or an urban public transportation service, the Minister may pay to the employee the difference between the cost to the employee of the service that is rendered to the child exceeds three dollars a month.\n\n(2) Where the Minister of National Defence provides a transportation service for the purpose of rendering a child for the purpose of attending a school pursuant to an arrangement under section three, the Minister may arrange for the transportation service on such terms and conditions as the Minister of National Defence may prescribe.\n\n5. Where federal land is made available for reallocation, the Minister shall, except where in his opinion it is not feasible, lease the land on terms that will not deprive the municipality in which the land is situated, or its ratepayers, of the benefit in respect of his occupancy of the land.\n\n6. No payment shall be made under these Regulations in respect of a person who resides in federal lands:\n\n(a) that is included in Crown property in a municipality that receives a grant under section five of the Municipal Grants Regulations for the purpose of computing the grant; or\n\n(b) that is situated in a municipality in which he is subject to municipal taxation in respect of his occupancy of that land.\n\n7. Any payment or arrangement made under these Regulations shall be made through the Municipal Grants Division of the Department of Finance.\n\n8. These Regulations, except section nine, are deemed to have come into force on January 1, 1949.\n\n9. The following Orders in Council are revoked:\n\nGroup A - respecting employees of the Fortuniery Commission:\n- F.C. 224/1946 of 9th June, 1946\n- F.C. 49/1946 of 31st March, 1946\n- F.C. 170/1947 of 6th December, 1946\n\nGroup B - respecting members of the National Research Council:\n- F.C. 78/1947 of 8th October, 1947\n\nGroup C - respecting members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force:\n- F.C. 154/1948 of 26th February, 1948\n- F.C. 49/1949 of 20th April, 1949\n- F.C. 209/1949 of 11th February, 1949\n- F.C. 144/1949 of 7th July, 1949\n- F.C. 137/1950 of 15th January, 1950\n\n(Sgd) N.A. Robertson\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nMEMORANDUM FOR\n\nYour attention is called to Order in Council P.C. 3455 of July 19, 1950, copy of which is attached. Additional copies of the Order in Council and of these instructions will be forwarded as required.\n\n2. If there are within your Branch children of non-taxable employees attending or desiring to attend a school in the municipality in which the employee resides (see para. 3 (1) of P.C. 3455) the following procedure will be followed:\n\n(a) The senior outside officer of the Division concerned will obtain from the school board of the municipality a statement of the average cost per school year for each pupil attending;\n\n(b) He will certify on such statement that he has examined the school records upon which the statement is based, that the statement is in accordance with such records, and that he recommends payment at that rate;\n\n(c) He will then send such statement and certificate to his Division head together with a list stating the names and dates of birth of the children who it is proposed will attend such school during the next ensuing fiscal year, and the number of days of anticipated attendance during such fiscal year;\n\n(d) Division heads will collate the information so received and forward it to Branch heads;\n\n(e) Branch heads will prepare in quadruplicate a submission to Treasury Board in respect of each municipality concerned, in letter form only, and attach thereto copies of the information received from outside officers and forward such submissions...\nin triplicate to the Assistant Deputy Minister (Administration) for review;\n\n(f) Upon approval, the Minister will sign the submissions and forward them in duplicate to Treasury Board.\n\n3. If it is desirable to send a child to a school outside the municipality in which the employee resides (see para. 3 (1) of P.C. 3455), the senior outside officer must also send to his Division head for attachment to the submission a statement that school facilities in the municipality in which the employee resides are inadequate, giving reasons and the additional costs resulting, if any.\n\n4. If an employee has since December 31st, 1949, paid school fees in respect of a child covered by P.C. 3455 (see para. 3 (3)) the senior outside officer must also send to the Division head for attachment to the submission a certificate by the employee stating that he has paid school fees to a designated school authority in respect of a designated child, giving the dates of such child's attendance at such school, the amount paid by him to the school authority in respect thereof, and if available a receipt for the amount so paid by him.\n\n5.

Please return.\n\n\"T.R.L. MacInnes\"\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDecember 15, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. T.R.L. MacINNIS,\nSECRETARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant, I submit the following:\n\n1 A. Attached is a list of the Indian Day Schools built by the Department (see pages 1 to 7 inclusive).\n\nA. (1) Day Schools operated by the Department but originally built by a Church (see Page 3).\nA. (2) Day Schools operated by the Department but built from Band Funds (see Page 9).\n\nA. (3), (4) and (5) I cannot recall any Day Schools that come within these categories.\n\n1 B. and 2\n\nPages 10, 11 and 12 attached give the names of each Residential School, the denomination under which each Residential School is operated, whether the building is Government-owned or Church-owned, and the per capita allowance.\n\nThe per capita grant is intended to provide the expenditures required for operating a school. This includes salaries of teachers and other staff members that are necessary; purchase of food and clothing for the children; replacement of minor items of equipment and other miscellaneous expenses. At many schools the management supplements a per capita grant by cultivating a farm.\n\nAt Government-owned Residential Schools all major repairs and replacement of equipment is paid by the Department.\n\nAt Church-owned Residential Schools a certain specific amount is allowed each year towards the cost of repairs and replacement of equipment. Any expenditures necessary in excess of the amount allowed by the Department, has to be provided by the Church under whose auspices the School is operated.\n3 All Indian Day Schools are located on Indian Reserves with the exception of:\n\n(a) Aroland in the Fort Arthur Agency which was purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company, and\n\n(b) Longlac and Lake Helen in the Fort Arthur Agency, which were built by a Church.\n\n\"Philip Phelan\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n| PROVINCE       | SCHOOL                  | PLACE               |\n|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Prince Edward Island | Lennox Island           | Prince Edward Island Agency |\n| Nova Scotia    | Eskasoni                | Eskasoni Agency     |\n|                | Middle River            |                     |\n|                | Sidney                  |                     |\n|                | Indian Cove             | Shubenacadie Agency |\n|                | Millbrook               |                     |\n|                | Salmon River            |                     |\n|                | Shubenacadie            |                     |\n| New Brunswick  | Kingsclear              | Kingsclear Agency   |\n|                | St. Mary's Devon        |                     |\n|                | Woodstock               |                     |\n|                | Big Cove                | Miramichi Agency    |\n|                | Burnt Church            |                     |\n|                | Bel Ground              |                     |\n|                | Bel River               |                     |\n|                | Red Bank                |                     |\n| Tobique        |                         | Tobique Agency      |\n| Quebec         | Manawan                 | Abitibi Agency      |\n|                | Mistassini              |                     |\n|                | Obedjiwan               |                     |\n|                | Weymontaching           |                     |\n|                | Waswanipi               |                     |\n|                | Bersimis                | Bersimis Agency     |\n|                | Caughnawaga R.C.        | Caughnawaga Agency  |\n|                | Caughnawaga U.C.        |                     |\n| Lorette        | Maniwaki                | Maniwaki Agency     |\n|                | Congo Bridge            |                     |\n| Maria          |                         | Maria Agency        |\n| Oka Country    |                         | Oka Agency          |\n| Oka Village    |                         |                     |\n| St. Francis    |                         | Pierreville Agency  |\n| Pointe Bleue   |                         | Pointe Bleue Agency |\n| Chenail        |                         | St. Regis Agency    |\n| Cornwall Island E. |                   |                     |\n| Cornwall Island W. |                   |                     |\n| St. Regis Island |                   |                     |\n| St. Regis Village |                   |                     |\n| Temiskaming    |                         | Temiskaming Agency  |\n| Ontario        | Cape Croker             | Cape Croker Agency  |\n|                | Port Elgin              |                     |\n|                | Back Settlement         | Caradoc Agency      |\n|                | Bear Creek              |                     |\n|                | Mount Elgin             |                     |\n|                | Oneida #1               |                     |\n|                | Oneida #2               |                     |\n|                | Oneida #3               |                     |\n|                | River Settlement        |                     |\n| Province | School | Place |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| Ontario  | Constance Lake | Chapleau Agency |\n|          | Mountbatten | \" \" |\n|          | Christian Island R.C. | Christian Is.

T.R.L. MacINNES,\nSECRETARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant, I submit the following:\n\n1 A. Attached is a list of the Indian Day Schools built by the Department (see pages 1 to 7 inclusive).\n\nA. (1) Day Schools operated by the Department but originally built by a Church (see Page 8).\nA. (2) Day Schools operated by the Department but built from Band Funds (see Page 9).\nA. (3), (4) and (5) I cannot recall any Day Schools that come within these categories.\n\n1 B. and 2\n\nPages 10, 11 and 12 attached give the names of each Residential School, the denomination under which each Residential School is operated, whether the building is Government-owned or Church-owned, and the per capita allowance.\n\nThe per capita grant is intended to provide the expenditures required for operating a school. This includes salaries of teachers and other staff members that are necessary; purchase of food and clothing for the children; replacement of minor items of equipment and other miscellaneous expenses. At many schools the management supplements a per capita grant by cultivating a farm.\n\nAt Government-owned Residential Schools all major repairs and replacement of equipment is paid by the Department.\n\nAt Church-owned Residential Schools a certain specific amount is allowed each year towards the cost of repairs and replacement of equipment. Any expenditures necessary in excess of the amount allowed by the Department, has to be provided by the Church under whose auspices the School is operated.\n3 All Indian Day Schools are located on Indian Reserves with the exception of,\n\n(a) Aroland in the Fort Arthur Agency which was purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company, and\n\n(b) Longlac and Lake Helen in the Fort Arthur Agency, which were built by a Church.\n\n\"Philip Phelan\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nFELL'S, Sask.\nDec. 20, 1950.\n\nMr. G.

I feel quite confident that we can select an Indian girl who will be a credit to her race and to this country.\n\nIf you think a letter from our Minister to Mr. Weston would help, I will gladly arrange for such correspondence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 3, 1951\n\nURGENT\n\nLieut.-Col. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nYou are probably aware that last year Mr. Garfield Weston brought fifty English boys to Canada and took fifty Canadian boys to England on a six-week tour with all expenses paid. Mr. Weston proposes in the summer of 1951 to bring fifty girls from England to Canada and to send fifty Canadian girls from Canada to the U.K. for a six-week tour. Mr. Weston's representatives in Toronto in connection with this tour, Public and Industrial Relations Limited, have asked, with Mr. Weston's concurrence, the CEA to be responsible for the selection of the Canadian girls. They will be high school girls who are in their second last year of school. Most of them will have passed their sixteenth birthday and not have passed their seventeenth birthday.\n\nAll expenses are paid by Mr. Weston, even to the extent of luggage, a certain amount of clothing, and pocket money. The girl's economic situation will not prevent her from taking this trip, but of course she will have to be a competent student as well as a lively and co-operative type of person.\n\nMr. Weston has requested that one girl be selected from the North West Territories and one from the Yukon. While the CEA is in a position, through the co-operation of the departments of education, to arrange for selection of the girls in the various provinces, I am somewhat at a loss as to the appropriate procedure in selecting a girl from the N.W.T. and the Yukon.\n\nI should be grateful to have your advice as to the most appropriate procedure. If you are not the proper person to contact for the selection of school girls in these areas, would you please provide me at your earliest convenience with the name of the proper person to address so\nLieut.-Col. B.F. Neary\n\nJanuary 3, 1951\n\nthat I may ask for his co-operation. I believe that last year Public\nand Industrial Relations Limited made a direct approach to Dr. Keenleyside.\nSince then, however, he has gone with the U.N.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.K. Stewart.\nTHE CANADIAN EDUCATION ASSOCIATION\n\nPAST PRESIDENT\nL. W. SHAW\nDEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION\nCHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I.\n\nPRESIDENT\nM. E. LAZERISCH\nDEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION\nUNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nVICE-PRESIDENT\nH. P. MOFFATT\nDEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION\nHALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA\n\nEXECUTIVE SECRETARY\nF. K. STEWART\nASSISTANT SECRETARY\nA. ST-JEAN\n\n206 Huron Street - Toronto 5, Ont. - PR. 1135\n\nJanuary 5, 1951\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. Ronald Hulland,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nDawson City, Yukon Territory.\n\nDear Mr. Hulland:\n\nRe: Weston's Tours for Girls\n\nYou are probably aware that in 1950 Mr. Garfield Weston, British industrialist, provided fifty Canadian boys with a six-week tour of England and brought fifty British boys to Canada for a tour of this country. I believe one of these boys was chosen from the Yukon Territory and one from the North West Territories.\n\nMr. Weston proposes in 1951 to carry on these same tours but will, instead of boys, present this opportunity to girls. It is Mr. Weston's wish that one of these girls be selected from each of the territories mentioned above.\n\nAgents in this project for Mr. Weston are Public and Industrial Relations Limited of Toronto and that firm, with the consent of Mr. Weston, has asked the CEA to undertake the selection of these girls. Selection within the Canadian provinces is comparatively easy for us since we are requesting the ten provincial departments of education to recommend names. The ten departments maintain lists of girls. I was not sure how selection might be made in the Yukon where the Indians have no co-operating agency. However, I am advised by Colonel Henry of the Indian Affairs Department that you are the appropriate person to address. I should therefore be grateful to learn if you would undertake to co-operate with this Association by undertaking responsibility for selecting a high school girl in the Yukon Territory to be a member of this party.\n\nThe CEA is not laying down rules for procedure as to selection, but very specific suggestions will be made regarding the type of girl who should be selected.\n\nThis letter is merely to ask for your co-operation. If this is forthcoming I shall be glad to provide you with full data about the tour in duplicate of that which will be sent the provincial departments of education. At the present time this is only in draft form. I may say\n\nPlease address correspondence to the Executive Secretary\nMr. Ronald Hulland  \nJanuary 5, 1951\n\nthat all expenses for the tour will be paid by Mr. Weston; luggage will be provided and even a limited amount of clothing; a small amount of pocket money will also be given each girl. It is Mr. Weston's intention that this trip be as free as possible of expenses to those having the opportunity to go. The party will leave Montreal about July 13 and will return about August 20. Transportation to and from the point of embarkation will also be paid by Mr. Weston.\n\nI hope to hear at your early convenience if we may count upon your assistance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. K. Stewart.\n\nPKS:BB  \nc.c. Colonel Neary  \nPublic & Industrial Relations\nRecent Developments in Indian Education in Canada\n\nThe Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons into Indian Affairs began its sittings in 1946 and focused the attention of the Canadian people upon the inadequacies of the Indian school system. As the hearings continued it soon became evident that there were complaints not only from the Indian people but from the churches concerned and also from other interested organizations. The striking fact was the large group of Indian children of school age who were not receiving any education, the number at that time being estimated at 11,000.\n\nThe Government, realizing the seriousness of the situation took immediate steps by providing greatly increased sums of money for the improvements which were obviously necessary.\n\nSchool Building Program:\n\nA program of building new schools was inaugurated at once and construction commenced on various Indian reserves. At the end of 1947 there were some 219 day schools with 382 teachers employed. By the end of 1950 these had increased to 373 day schools with 487 teachers employed. This increase in the number of classrooms being operated reflects the heavy building program which has been undertaken.\n\nThe aim of the Indian Affairs Branch is, of course, to provide educational facilities for every Indian child. To accomplish this it is necessary to assess carefully every reserve and determine the type of school which can best serve the children. Educational survey committees were established to carry out such investigations and often large areas and many reserves are covered; as a result of these studies, decisions are made with regard to the size and type of school to be erected and also its location. Then there follows a period of overcoming the difficulties and obstacles which must be faced in erecting schools in the isolated sections of Canada in which these Indians live. It may be the carrying of materials by tractor train to a reserve in the Norway House Agency of Manitoba; it might involve the transportation of a prefabricated school to a fishing village on the coast of British Columbia; or the hauling out of logs for the erection of a log school in the Yukon.\n\nThe main problem is that of the Indians who have been neglected in the past and for whom it is difficult to provide schools. These are the Indians living in the so-called \"Fringe of Civilization\". Transportation is the main difficulty and the day schools are erected in many and varied ways with buildings of log, metal and prefabricated parts all being found. Where day schools are not feasible, due to the nomadic habits of the Indians concerned, residential schools are erected. Three such schools are under construction now, all in isolated parts of Canada.\n\nWe may summarize the success of our day school building program in particular by the fact that since 1947 there has been a total increase in day school enrollment of 3,111 pupils. It is confidently expected that this number will have risen to over 4,500 by the end of the present academic year.\n\nIn addition to the program of building new schools, there has been carried out a thorough overhauling of existing educational facilities both in day and residential schools. A modernization of these schools has cost millions of dollars.\nEducation in Association with Other Children\n\nThe Parliamentary Committee made a fourth report on the 2nd of June, 1946. In this report it made the following recommendation with regard to Indian education:\n\n\"The Operation of Indian Schools.\n\nYour Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\nYour Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nAn entirely different problem from that of providing a basic elementary education for the northern Indians mentioned above is presented by the need for changes in the Indian school system on reserves located close to white communities. In carrying out the above recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has been negotiating with local School Boards and Provincial Departments of Education. We are now appointing Regional School Inspectors who can deal locally with such problems by being in constant contact with provincial and municipal officials. There are now over 1300 Indian children in elementary grades in such schools. This is a growth of over 300 pupils in one year and we expect similar increases in future years. While statistics were not accurately kept, there were only about 200 children enrolled in Provincial schools in 1934.\n\nQualifications of Teachers\n\nIt has been fully realized that the building of schools alone will not improve the educational standards among Indians. The calibre of teachers in the schools must be improved in order that the Indian schools might keep pace with the Provincial schools. It was fully realized that many of the Indian schools were on isolated reserves where living conditions were far from attractive. Therefore, good salaries had to be paid and comfortably furnished living accommodation provided. To this end, the Department has introduced a salary schedule which now places teachers with First Class Certificates in a range of from $1650 a year to $2100; those with Second Class Certificates in a range from $1560 to $2040. In addition to these salaries, free teacherages are provided in practically all day schools. This salary schedule is now under revision and will be increased in line with the recent salary raises given to Federal Civil Servants. As an aid in retaining teachers, the benefits of the Federal Civil Service Superannuation Plan have been extended to them. Many teachers have taken advantage of this offer and are now permanent Civil Servants.\n\nThe efforts of the Department to improve the teaching standards in Indian schools may then be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The introduction of a salary schedule with regular increments as described above,\n\n2. The provision, free, of a better class of living accommodation for teachers and improved classroom facilities for the children,\n\n3. The extension of superannuation benefits to teachers.\nIn hiring new teachers, the policy of the Department has been clearly stated as follows:\n\n1. The elimination of unqualified teachers;\n2. A gradual reduction in the number of teachers holding Second Class certificates;\n3. The employment, wherever possible, of teachers holding First Class Certificates.\n\nThe results of the above program in attracting better teachers has been most encouraging. The following chart will indicate clearly the great improvement which has taken place since the introduction of the first salary schedule in September of 1947:\n\n### Qualifications of Indian Day School Teachers\n\n|                | Jan. 1946 | Jan. 1949 | Jan. 1950 | Jan. 1951 | Increase over previous year |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| No. of Schools Operating | 249       | 258       | 304       | 373       | 69 (22.4%)                  |\n| No. of Classrooms Operating | 352       | 383       | 432       | 487       | 55 (12.7%)                  |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade IV | 3         | 3         | 5         | 5         | -                           |\n| No. of Teachers, \" III (1st Class Certificates)\" | 97        | 133       | 172       | 212       | 70 (40.7%)                  |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade II (2nd Class Certificates) | 106       | 104       | 109       | 107       | -2 (1.8%)                   |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade I | 120       | 102       | 95        | 74        | -19 (20%)                   |\n| No. of Principals | 10        | 14        | 18        | 19        | 1 (5.6%)                    |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade III | 5         | 9         | 14        | 17        | 3 (21.4%)                  |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade II | 8         | 13        | 11        | 12        | 1 (9.1%)                    |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade I | 3         | 5         | 8         | 9         | 1 (12.5%)                  |\nIn one year, therefore, there has been an increase of 49% in teachers holding first class certificates and a decrease of 20% in unqualified teachers. It should be further pointed out that many of the \"unqualified\" teachers hold third class certificates, permits, etc., and have been employed for several years in our schools. During this time they have come to understand their Indian pupils well and have rendered valuable service.\n\nWhile statistics are not available for residential school teachers as they are hired by the churches concerned, there has also been a definite improvement in the calibre of these teachers.\n\nSecondary Education:\n\nThe increase in the number of pupils in Indian schools and the improvement in the calibre of teachers being hired has resulted in a steady trend towards higher education. In 1949 there were 661 pupils attending classes above Grade 6, this representing an increase of about 300 over the previous year. In September of 1950 there were 874 students attending secondary classes and we expect to pass the 1000 mark by next year. This splendid record indicates that Indian youth is taking a great interest in its own education. Many of these young people can go through for vocations which will be of assistance to their fellow people. They are being particularly encouraged to make their profession either teaching or nursing. In education, the Department has been pleased with the results of many of the day schools which are being taught by qualified Indian teachers. On the Six Nations Reserve, the Supervising Principal and the eighteen teachers in charge of day school classrooms are all Indians. The Department is proud of this achievement and hopes that other reserves will follow this pattern.\n\nIn conclusion it is emphasized that the Department realizes it is still far from its goal of providing educational facilities for every Indian child. Slowly, it is pushing into these isolated reserves and its teachers are blazing new frontiers in education and social progress. Many of them are classified as \"self-taught teachers,\" living on the reserves for twelve months in the year and working with the assistance of qualified social workers toward the steady improvement of living conditions among the Indian people. The isolation and the loneliness of these northern posts hold no fear for these teachers and their contribution toward the steady progress of our Indian people can never be measured. This is a great public service and one of which we as Canadians can all be proud.\nOttawa, January 5, 1951.\n\nMr. A. D.

The following chart will indicate clearly the great improvement which has taken place since the introduction of the first salary schedule in September of 1947:\n\n### Qualifications of Indian Day School Teachers:\n\n|                | Jan. 1948 | Jan. 1949 | Jan. 1950 | Jan. 1951 | Increase over previous year | Decrease |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|---------|\n| No. of Schools Operating | 249       | 258       | 304       | 373       | 69 (22.4%)                 |         |\n| No. of Classrooms Operating | 352       | 383       | 432       | 487       | 55 (12.7%)                 |         |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade IV | 3         | 3         | 5         | 5         |                            |         |\n| No. of Teachers, \" I \" (1st Class Certificates) | 97        | 133       | 172       | 242       | 70 (40.7%)                 |         |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade II (2nd Class Certificates) | 106       | 104       | 109       | 107       | -                          | 2 (1.8%) |\n| No. of Teachers, Grade I | 120       | 102       | 95        | 76        | -                          | 19 (20%) |\n| No. of Principals | 10        | 14        | 18        | 19        | 1 (5.6%)                   |         |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade III | 5         | 9         | 14        | 17        | 3 (21.4%)                  |         |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade II | 8         | 13        | 11        | 12        | 1 (9.1%)                   |         |\n| No. of Welfare Teachers, Grade I | 3         | 5         | 8         | 9         | 1 (12.5%)                  |         |\nIn one year, therefore, there has been an increase of 40% in teachers holding First Class certificates and a decrease of 20% in unqualified teachers. It should be further pointed out that many of the \"unqualified\" teachers hold Third Class certificates, permits, etc., and have been employed for several years in our schools. During this time they have come to understand their Indian pupils well and have rendered valuable service.\n\nWhile statistics are not available for residential school teachers as they are hired by the churches concerned, there has also been a definite improvement in the calibre of these teachers.\n\nSecondary Education:\n\nThe increase in the number of pupils in Indian schools and the improvement in the calibre of teachers being hired has resulted in a steady trend towards higher education. In 1949 there were 661 pupils attending classes above Grade 8, this representing an increase of about 200 over the previous year. In September of 1950 there were 874 students attending secondary classes and we expect to pass the 1000 mark by next year. This splendid record indicates that Indian youth is taking a great interest in its own education. Many of these young people can go through for vocations which will be of assistance to their fellow people. They are being particularly encouraged to make their profession either teaching or nursing. In education, the Department has been pleased with the results of many of the day schools which are being taught by qualified Indian teachers. On the Six Nations Reserve, the Supervising Principal and the eighteen teachers in charge of day school classrooms are all Indians. The Department is proud of this achievement and hopes that other reserves will follow this pattern.\n\nIn conclusion it is emphasized that the Department realizes it is still far from its goal of providing educational facilities for every Indian child. Slowly, it is pushing into those isolated reserves and its teachers are blazing new frontiers in education and social progress. Many of them are classified as welfare teachers, living on the reserves for twelve months in the year and working with the assistance of qualified social workers toward the steady improvement of living conditions among the Indian people. The isolation and the loneliness of these northern posts hold no fear for these teachers and their contribution towards the steady progress of our Indian people can never be measured. This is a great public service and one of which we as Canadians can all be proud.\nJanuary 8, 1951\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThank you for your letter of January 5, file #1-1-1 (E). It is very kind of you to assist in enabling me to contact the right persons for the selection of girls from the north to go on Mr. Weston's tours. I wrote to Mr. Hulland last week with a copy of my letter to you so you probably know the status of these tours.\n\nI think it would be very nice if an Indian girl could go on this tour, but this year is a little complicated. It is something new to select these girls, and already we have had to make provision for four girls to be selected from private schools after we were under the impression that all fifty were to come from public schools. Ontario and Quebec are arbitrarily losing two places each to provide for these private schools. I think it would be inadvisable this year to reduce another place for an Indian high school girl.\n\nMr. Weston plans to have these tours again next year and I hope at that time to recommend to him that a place be made for an Indian high school girl.\n\nWith thanks for your help. I am looking forward to seeing you when you come to work in Toronto. Congratulations on your new appointment.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. K. Stewart.\n242 Dawlish Ave\nToronto 12, Ont.,\nJan. 7, 1950.\n\nDear Mrs. [illegible],\n\nWould you please send me a recent extract from the Department of Indian Affairs concerning health occupations reservations? Could you also send me maps of chief tribes and chief reservations. In school we are taking making a book on the Indians as a citizen of Canada today. I would be very grateful to you if you could supply this information.\n\nYours sincerely,\nCarolyn Kurlbut\nDear Miss [Name],\n\nI am in Gr. 6. We are studying Indians. I would very pleased if you could send me some information of Indians and their tribes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHelen M.

AS THE HEARINGS CONTINUED, IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE COMPLAINTS NOT ONLY FROM THE INDIAN PEOPLE BUT FROM THE CHURCHES CONCERNED AND ALSO FROM OTHER INTERESTED ORGANIZATIONS. ONE STRIKING FACT ESTABLISHED WAS THAT A LARGE GROUP OF INDIAN CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE WERE NOT RECEIVING ANY EDUCATION. THE NUMBER AT THAT TIME WAS ESTIMATED AT 11,000.\n\nREALIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY TOOK REMEDIAL STEPS BY PROVIDING GREATLY INCREASED SUMS OF MONEY FOR IMPROVEMENTS WHICH OBVIOUSLY WERE NECESSARY.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM\n\nA SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM WAS INAUGURATED AT ONCE AND CONSTRUCTION WAS COMMENCED ON VARIOUS INDIAN RESERVES. THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS BEING CONTINUED, IS REFLECTED IN A MARKED INCREASE IN DAY SCHOOLS, TEACHERS EMPLOYED, AND PUPILS ENROLLED. BY THE END OF 1950 THERE WERE 373 INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS, WITH 487 TEACHERS EMPLOYED, COMPARED TO 249 DAY SCHOOLS, WITH 352 TEACHERS EMPLOYED, AT THE END OF 1947. THERE HAS BEEN A TOTAL INCREASE IN DAY SCHOOL ENROLMENT OF 3,111 PUPILS SINCE 1947, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS NUMBER WILL HAVE RISEN TO OVER 4,500 BY THE END OF THE PRESENT ACADEMIC YEAR.\n\nTHE AIM OF THE INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH IS, OF COURSE, TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR EVERY INDIAN CHILD. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS EVERY RESERVE CAREFULLY AND DETERMINE THE TYPE OF SCHOOL WHICH CAN BEST SERVE THE CHILDREN. EDUCATIONAL SURVEY COMMITTEES ESTABLISHED TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS ARE ACTIVELY CARRYING ON THEIR WORK, AND AS A RESULT OF THEIR STUDIES DECISIONS ARE MADE WITH REGARD TO THE SIZE AND TYPE OF SCHOOL TO BE ERECTED AND ALSO ITS LOCATION.\n\nMANY OBSTACLES MUST BE OVERCOME IN THE PROVISION OF SCHOOLS\nIn the isolated sections of Canada in which many Indians live, transportation is the main difficulty, and day schools are erected in many and varied ways with buildings of log, metal, and prefabricated construction being found. For example, materials have been carried by tractor train to a reserve in the Norway House Agency of Manitoba; a prefabricated school has been transported to a fishing village on the coast of British Columbia, and logs have been hauled for the erection of a log school in the Yukon.\n\nWhere day schools are not feasible, because of the nomadic habits of the Indians concerned, residential schools are erected. Three such schools are now under construction, and will serve children in isolated Indian reserves.\n\nIn addition to this school building program, existing educational facilities in both day and residential schools have been thoroughly overhauled.\n\nEducation in Association with Other Children\n\nIn its report on June 28, 1946, the Parliamentary Committee made the following recommendation with regard to Indian education:\n\n\"The Operation of Indian Schools\n\nYour Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\nYour Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nAn entirely different problem from that of providing a basic elementary education for Indians in isolated areas is presented by the need for changes in the Indian school system on reserves located close to white communities. In carrying out the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has been negotiating with local school boards and provincial departments of education, and is appointing Regional School Inspectors who can deal locally with such problems by being in constant contact with provincial and municipal officials. There are now over 1,200 Indian children in elementary grades in such schools.

This is a growth of over 300 pupils\nIn one year, and similar increases are expected in future years.\n\nQualifications of Teachers\n\nIt has been fully realized that the building of schools alone will not improve the educational standards among Indians. The calibre of teachers in the schools must be improved in order that Indian schools may keep pace with provincial schools. Many of the Indian schools are on isolated reserves where living conditions are quite different from those in settled areas. Therefore, good salaries have to be paid and comfortably furnished living accommodation provided. To this end, the Department has introduced a salary schedule which now places teachers with First Class Certificates in a range of from $1680 a year to $3120; those with Second Class Certificates in a range from $1560 to $2040. In addition to these salaries, free teacherages are provided in practically all day schools. As an aid in retaining teachers, the benefits of the Federal Civil Service Superannuation Plan have been extended to them. Many teachers have taken advantage of this offer and are now permanent Civil Servants.\n\nThe efforts of the Department to improve the teaching standards in Indian schools may then be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The introduction of a salary schedule with regular increments as described above.\n2. The provision, free, of a better class of living accommodation for teachers and improved classroom facilities for the children.\n3. The extension of superannuation benefits to teachers.\n\nIn hiring new teachers, the policy of the Department has been clearly stated as follows:\n\n(1) The replacing of unqualified teachers;\n(2) A gradual reduction in the number of teachers holding Second Class certificates;\n(3) The employment, wherever possible, of teachers holding First Class certificates.\n\nThe results of this program in attracting better teachers has been most encouraging.

On the Six Nations Reserve, the Supervising Principal and all eighteen teachers in charge of day school classrooms are Indians. The Department is proud of this achievement and hopes that other reserves will follow this pattern.\n\nVocational Education\n\nA program of vocational training, adapted to the needs of Indian pupils, is being followed in the larger day and residential schools. Certain basic skills are taught, and at the end of each year of the program merit badges are awarded to foster interest on the part of the children. Such skills as trapping, poultry raising, sewing and knitting are covered in the courses.\n\nIn addition, regular courses are given, where sufficient older pupils are available, in wood-working, metal work, and electricity.\n\nSocial Workers\n\nAn important development in Indian administration is the recent addition of trained social workers. Five workers are already in the field and four more are to be appointed. These workers, operating on a provincial regional basis, are an integral part of the larger educational picture, and through their efforts a degree of adult education in the sphere of the home is expected to result. Of particular importance is the work accomplished by these social workers in assisting to organize and to encourage Indian women's organizations such as the Homemakers' Clubs. The improvement of home living conditions, juvenile delinquency problems, sanitation safeguards, development of child care and\nInstruction, and home economics are aspects of the social worker's responsibilities which, it is considered, will react favourably on the whole educational program on Indian reserves.\n\nThe Department realizes it is still far from its goal of providing educational facilities for every Indian child.

Many of them are classified as welfare teachers, living on the reserves for twelve months in the year and working with the assistance of the social workers toward the steady improvement of living conditions among the Indian people.

There has been a total increase in day school enrolment of 3,111 pupils since 1947, and it is expected that this number will have risen to over 4,500 by the end of the present academic year.\n\nThe aim of the Indian Affairs Branch is, of course, to provide educational facilities for every Indian child. To accomplish this it is necessary to assess every reserve carefully and determine the type of school which can best serve the children. Educational survey committees established to conduct the necessary investigations are actively carrying on their work, and as a result of their studies decisions are made with regard to the size and type of school to be erected and also its location.\n\nMany obstacles must be overcome in the provision of schools\nin the isolated sections of Canada in which many Indians live. Transportation is the main difficulty, and day schools are erected in many and varied ways with buildings of log, metal, and prefabricated construction being found.

In September of 1950 there were 834 students attending secondary classes, and it is expected that the 1,000-mark will be passed by next year. This splendid record indicates that Indian youth is taking a great interest in its own education. Many of these young people can go through for vocations which will be of assistance to their fellow people. They are being particularly encouraged to make their profession either teaching or nursing. The Department has been pleased with the results of many of the day schools which are being taught by qualified Indian teachers. On the Six Nations Reserve, the Supervising Principal and all eighteen teachers in charge of day school classrooms are Indians. The Department is proud of this achievement and hopes that other reserves will follow this pattern.\n\nVocational Education\n\nA program of vocational training, adapted to the needs of Indian pupils, is being followed in the larger day and residential schools. Certain basic skills are taught, and at the end of each year of the program merit badges are awarded to foster interest on the part of the children. Such skills as trapping, poultry raising, sewing and knitting are covered in the courses.\n\nIn addition, regular courses are given, where sufficient older pupils are available, in wood-working, metal work and electricity.\n\nSocial Workers\n\nAn important development in Indian administration is the recent addition of trained social workers. Five workers are already in the field and four more are to be appointed. These workers, operating on a provincial regional basis, are an integral part of the larger educational picture, and through their efforts a degree of adult education in the sphere of the home is expected to result. Of particular importance is the work accomplished by these social workers in assisting to organize and to encourage Indian women's organizations such as the Homemakers' Clubs. The improvement of home living conditions, juvenile delinquency problems, sanitation safeguards, development of child care and\ninstruction, and home economics are aspects of the social worker's responsibilities which, it is considered, will react favourably on the whole educational program on Indian reserves.\n\n------------------------\n\nThe Department realizes it is still far from its goal of providing educational facilities for every Indian child. Slowly, however, it is pushing into the isolated reserves and its teachers are blazing new frontiers in education and social progress. Many of them are classified as Welfare teachers, living on the reserves for twelve months in the year and working with the assistance of the social workers toward the steady improvement of living conditions among the Indian people. The loneliness of these posts holds no fear for these teachers and their contribution towards the steady progress of the Indian people can never be measured. This is a great public service and one of which all Canadians can be proud.\nMEMORANDUM TO: Colonel Neary\n\nRe: Article for Canadian Teachers' Federation\n\nI am forwarding for your file a copy of the article which was yesterday forwarded to Mrs. McLeod of the Canadian Teachers' Federation by the Minister.\n\nYou will note that certain slight alterations have been made, some at the specific request of the Minister.

Special luggage (for use during the tour) will also be provided, as will certain essential items of clothing\u2014a suit, a dress, a purse, and a hat.

Stewart,\nExecutive Secretary, CEA\nChairman, Steering Committee\n\nJanuary 9, 1951\n\nInformation copy - Directors\nMEMORANDUM TO DEPUTY MINISTERS OF EDUCATION\n\nregarding\n\nMR. GARFIELD WESTON'S TOURS FOR GIRLS\nADMINISTRATION AND SELECTION\n\n1. General\n\nPlease refer to the minutes of the CEA Executive for November 29 and 30, 1950, pages six and eight, and to my memo of December 15, 1950, on the above subject.\n\nWith the approval of our Executive I would respectfully request your co-operation in the selection of high school girls from your province to go on a tour of the United Kingdom, with all expenses paid, in the summer of 1951. It is hoped you will be able to co-operate with Mr. Weston and with the CEA in this project in your capacity as the senior educational official in your province.\n\nThe purpose of these tours is to promote a better knowledge of Canada and of the U.K. in the young people of each country. A very valuable by-product of the tours has been the promotion of Canadian unity through the knowledge gained by young people of different parts of Canada and of each other.\n\nWill you please advise me at your earliest convenience if we may count upon your co-operation in this project?\n\n2. Administration of the Tours\n\nAll arrangements for the tour will be made by Mr. Garfield Weston and his representatives in Canada and the U.K. In Canada the project is under the immediate direction of Public & Industrial Relations Limited, Toronto. Administrative details such as transportation, accommodation, passports, etc., will be looked after by specially appointed persons from these organizations. Heading the tour for Canadian girls will be Dr. Mariel Roscoe, Principal, Victoria College, McGill University. One of Mr. Weston's daughters will accompany the party in a supervisory capacity. Still to be selected are two additional supervisors, a graduate nurse and a woman competent in the field of guidance. A representative of Public & Industrial Relations Limited will be business manager for the English girls during their stay in Canada, and similar help will be provided to the Canadian girls while in the U.K.\n\nThe responsibility of the CEA is limited to selection of Canadian girls only, but its advice on other matters relative to the project would be welcomed.\n\n3. Time and Itinerary. The Canadian girls will sail from Montreal about July 13 and arrive back in Canada about August 20. The British girls will leave the U.K. July 30 and arrive again in England about September 10. No air travel is anticipated.\n\nObject of the tour is to see as much as possible of the history, culture, industry, and way of life of the people of the U.K. The rate of travel will be slower than that last year for boys and the intention is to\nremain in some central locality with suitable accommodation for a week at a time. This place will be used as a hub from which surrounding areas will be visited.\n\nThe proposed itinerary is shown in Appendix C hereto.\n\n4. Method of Selection\n\nIt is the opinion of the CEA Committee that the senior educational official in each province should select the girls. It is believed that conditions vary and that such organization as might be set up should be left entirely to the discretion of the authorities in each province. However, it was agreed that very specific qualifications for the selectees, as set down by the Steering Committee, should be adhered to by the selectors.\n\n5. Eligibility for Selection\n\n(a) Age - The girl's date of birth should be between June 1, 1933, and June 1, 1935. It is hoped that the majority of girls will have passed their sixteenth birthday, but not yet reached their seventeenth birthday, at the time of the tour.\n\n(b) Education - The girls should, unless under exceptional circumstances, be intending to take further educational training (academic, commercial, vocational, college, normal school, nursing, etc.) for at least one year. The majority of girls should have completed Grade XII in Ontario and British Columbia, and Grade XI in the other provinces in June, 1951. No girl may be selected who is not a competent student.\n\n(c) Health - The girls selected must be in good health. While the girls being considered need not have a medical examination, those selected must, as soon as possible after their selection has been announced, obtain a certificate from their local physician that their health is satisfactory for such a trip. This is to be forwarded to the CEA office. The Canadian government requires that all persons entering Canada from abroad, including Canadian citizens, must have proof of vaccination within the last three years. Those selected must provide proof of such vaccination as soon as possible after their selection is made. Forms for this purpose will be sent to the girls selected after their selection has been announced.\n\n(d) Consent - The consent of the parent or guardian of the selectee should be obtained on the form attached (App. F.). Forms for this purpose are being sent to you in sufficient quantities for the places available in your province.\n\n(e) Qualities of Personality - In considering the suitability of girls the following personal qualities are important:\n\n(i) Sense of responsibility - the importance of staying with the party, being on time for trains and boats, not mislaying personal effects, and appreciating the opportunities provided through such a tour at no personal expense give this factor unusual weight.\n\n(ii) Adaptability and ability to get on with a group.\n\n(iii) Intelligence - general alertness of mind, the ability to observe and to profit by experience.\n\n(iv) Appearance\n\n(v) Poise and deportment - the tour members will receive considerable public attention abroad and will meet many national and international figures.\n(vi) Ability to speak before school and adult groups\n\n(vii) Spirit of enthusiasm\n\n6. Responsibility for Selection and Number to be Selected\n\nThe Departments of Education of the different provinces, as the responsible authorities in education, are being asked to undertake the selection of a specified number of girls for the tour described above. The allocation of places to each province is shown in Appendix A. However, it is considered most politic from several angles for the CEA to assume responsibility for announcing those selected across Canada on the basis of recommendations from the Departments.\n\nIn the event that from the over-all point of view one or two candidates seem unsuitable, or in case illness or home problems prevent some girl from going on the tour after arrangements are otherwise complete, you are asked to recommend further names to the CEA as alternates, in addition to places allocated, on the basis of four each from Ontario and Quebec, one from P.E.I., and two from each of the other provinces. While it is considered appropriate that final approval of those selected to go on the tour be made by the Steering Committee, you may be assured that selections will be only from those names your Department supplies. Will you please list the names (and addresses) of those whom you recommend for the places allocated to your province. Alternates should be shown on a separate list, or in a separate column, and ranked as to first, second, etc. Consent forms (para. 5 (d) above) should not be completed for these alternates, nor should they be advised that their names have been submitted, to avoid disappointment on their part.\n\n7. Time of Selection\n\nSo that arrangements for the tour, such as clothing, transportation, vaccination, documentation, passports, etc., may be completed in good time, the sponsors of the tour are anxious that selections be completed by March 1, 1951. In order to make arrangements for these necessary administrative details, the names of those recommended together with the names of the alternates mentioned in para. 6 above must reach the CEA office by March 8, 1951.\n\n8. Announcement of Selections\n\nAlthough the tour is limited to fifty girls, the goodwill benefits and the understanding the tours promote are broadened by the public attention they receive through press and radio. It is, of course, important that no premature announcement be made before each selection is confirmed by us. For this reason, and to avoid scattered announcements, material will be prepared by this Committee and forwarded to you for release as of a certain date. You are, of course, welcome to amend it in any way you see fit.\n\nIt will obviously be necessary, before names are sent to the CEA office, for the recommended girls to be advised that they are among those being recommended, in order that the consent of their parents may be obtained. Public announcement on the part of those recommended can be avoided, however, by advising them that official approval of those selected must be forthcoming from the Steering Committee before the selection can be regarded as final and public.\n\n9. Private Schools\n\nFour of the fifty girls are to be selected from private schools. Two of these will be chosen from private girls' schools in Ontario and two from Quebec. Selection of the two from Ontario will be arranged directly\nwith the private schools by the CEA; the two from Quebec will be selected from private schools in the province of Quebec by such method as appears most suitable to the Department of Education of that province. To maintain provincial distribution these girls from the private schools should also normally reside in the province from which they are selected.\n\n10. Geographic Representation, now and in later years\n\nIt will perhaps be helpful for you to know, in case criticism or disappointment is evident, that Mr. Weston hopes, the international situation permitting, to offer similar tours to Canadian girls in the future. Some care should be taken to avoid selection from small local areas in which boys were chosen last year. It is desired that representation from each province be as wide-spread as possible. Rural and village areas should have representation as well as urban areas, preferably on an equal basis with urban areas.\n\n11. Expenses\n\nAll expenses in connection with the tour will be paid by Mr. Garfield Weston; it is desired that no girl should be prevented from going solely because of economic reasons. All transportation will be paid including transportation to and from the point of embarkation. A small amount of pocket money will be provided to each girl each week. Special luggage (for use during the tour) will also be provided, as will certain essential items of clothing\u2014a suit, a dress, a purse, and a hat. The CEA should be advised of any special expenses in connection with the tour to which a department may be put beyond its ordinary responsibilities.\n\n12.

Mr. Weston's representatives in Toronto in connection with this tour, Public and Industrial Relations Limited, have asked, with Mr. Weston's concurrence, the CEA to be responsible for the selection of the Canadian girls.

Of the 69 residential schools, some 46 are in this category. The remaining schools were built by the churches (18 Roman Catholic and 5 Anglican) and are referred to as \"Church-owned\" schools.\n\nOperation\n\nA per capita grant is paid to the school management for the education and care of each Indian child whose attendance is duly authorized by the Department.\n\nMaintenance\n\nIn addition the Department pays the following items:\n\n(I) Major repairs in accordance with our regulations. At a \"Government-owned\" school we can exceed where necessary, items listed in our Estimates. At a \"Church-owned\" school this cannot be done without approval of the Governor-in-Council. For example, if a repair job at a \"Church-owned\" school costs $1,005.00 and the Vote only allows $1,000.00, then we must arrange a transfer and secure an Order-in-Council for the additional $5.00 required.\n\n(II) Equipment such as desks, blackboards, laundry machinery, electrical generators, etc., in accordance with our regulations. As in (I) above, the \"Church-owned\" schools cannot exceed the sum specifically voted.\n\n(III) School supplies including texts, scribblers, manual training tools, etc.\n\n(IV) Grants towards salaries of night watchmen for winter months at certain schools.\n\n(V) Grants towards salaries of manual training instructors where their qualifications meet our requirements.\n\nI would also point out for the Minister's information the fact that the Department can request the dismissal of staff members or of the Principal. This has been done on several occasions in the last few years and we have always had the co-operation of the church concerned.\nWe agree that in Section 10(2) of the old Act the difference between \"A Roman Catholic (or Protestant) School\" and a \"School conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" lay in the point of ownership. In other words, it is believed that the meaning of a \"Roman Catholic (or Protestant) School\" was a school both owned and operated by the church concerned. A \"School conducted under Roman Catholic (or Protestant) auspices\" is believed to have referred to a school owned by the Government but operated on its behalf by the religious denomination concerned.\n\nNomination of Day School Teachers\n\nIn certain day schools the Department allowed the churches to nominate the teachers but retained the right of dismissal if such teachers proved unsatisfactory. This practice of nomination has been greatly reduced in the last three years and will probably disappear. The Department of course will have to make certain that teachers are appointed who are of the denomination of the majority of the Indians concerned as provided for in Section 121 of the new Act. This precludes the appointment of teachers by the Civil Service Commission, and leaves the matter in the hands of the Department as authorized by Order-in-Council.\n\n3. Provincial schools vary of course in the use of the term \"public\". In Quebec these are Roman Catholic schools; in other provinces they are \"non-denominational\". We pay tuition fees for Indian children who attend such schools.\n\nThe Minister is correct in his summary of the three types of schools to which Roman Catholic children might be sent but we might also add a fourth category of school,\n\n(a) a provincial school or private school in which religious instruction in the Roman Catholic faith is given by the teacher or by a priest.\n\nSection 118\n\nI agree with the Minister's summary concerning this section and feel that the adjective \"residential\" school should be eliminated throughout this section.\n\nOur practice at the present time where we have pupils of a religious minority, insufficient to establish a school, is to take one of the following actions:\n\n(a) send the children concerned to a residential school of the faith concerned;\n\n(b) send the children to a nearby provincial school or separate school if available.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRevolt Against \"Modern\" Schooling\n\nAlberta teachers start drilling pupils in grammar, adding and pronunciation as pendulum swings from modernism\n\nBy James H. Gray\n\nCALGARY \u2014 It took a long time, but the bloom is falling off one of the late William A. Aikinart's more successful local publications, promoting \"modernizing\" teaching methods. The educational pendulum is once again swinging over to the conservative side. All kinds of his own theories, dreamed up usually by the super-intellectual bureaucrats, are being quietly junked not only in Alberta but elsewhere on the Prairies.\n\nIn addition to being a prophetess, Biblical student, monetary reformer and politician, the late Mr. Abbott was also a schoolteacher. By all accounts he was one of the best. Because he was a superb teacher, he could use all kinds of unorthodox methods and still have his classes whom through departmental exams. Because he got such results with his methods, he assumed that universal adoption of the methods would produce similar results for all teachers.\n\nThe departmentalizers got the green light. The old-fashioned idea that the fundamentals\u2014reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, etc., could only be taught by thorough drilling was discarded. Pupils were encouraged to remember memorize arithmetic tables. They learned that 5 times 5 made 25 by indirection, not by memorizing the five-times table. The same applied to the alphabet and the sounds. Nothing was learned by rote.\n\nThe hours once spent in dismal drills were turned over to \"projects\" and ethical studies. Parents, who knew their experience in an effort to aid their young hopefuls in their studies, got snarky notes from principals.\n\nFor a decade everything was wonderful. But as the small fry of 1938 became high school students in 1948, the defects of the system became evident. High school teachers had to try to teach Latin and French to pupils who had never been fully exposed to the formal rules. Most pupils didn't even know a past participle from an irregular verb. Other teachers discovered that many of the rules of simple arithmetic learned by the indirect method, had been forgotten.\n\nGradually the teachers have been gathering doubts about the whole thing. A questioning of the soundness of it all is now being heard through the teachers' ranks. Those who were against the reforms but had perforce to accommodate themselves to the new system, have become vocal critics now of the teachings.\n\nEqually important in the growing reaction against the modernists has been the attitude of the business world. The plain fact is that the theories don't work when it comes to providing pupils with a working knowledge of arithmetic, spelling or grammar. At very least, the old system enables people to add small sums in their heads and make change accurately. A store clerk who cannot add $6.23 and $1 and get $7.10 is not too useful to an employer.\n\nYet the ability to add small sums mentally is so rare today that many employers have been forced to compel their employees to use a pencil and scratch pad before they touch the cash register. Why perhaps most of the stores in the prairie cities are today equipped with scribbling paper to enable employees to add six and five and be sure it is eleven.\n\nSecretarial schools, which once confined their efforts largely to stenographer courses in spelling, now find it necessary to give great blocks of time teaching spelling that was once taught in the primary grades.\n\nThe mispronunciation of simple words is a constant source of amusement. One radio station operator, who blew his top in an argument with some teachers, was told that the fault was his own. Instead of hiring people out of high school, he was told he should hire only university graduates because only they had really completed the course that began with him. His reply was that university graduates were worse than high school graduates. The former could neither be taught or trained while the latter, because they had done before university, could be convinced they did not know everything.\n\nAll this is regional, rather than something strictly Albertan. It is reflected by a rising tide of dissatisfaction with the educational system. It has nothing to do with the advancement of vocational and academic studies. It is simply that the educational tools that are essential to daily life in our society are being provided. As educational costs are continually rising, public griping is bound to be reflected in criticism of school expenditures. Not only are parents threatened or driven by impatient parental complaints, many teachers are voluntarily and quietly going back to the old methods. They are sneakily telling their number work, quietly encouraging parents to insist on some homework being done. That, to business men going mad enough to find secretaries who can spell and punctuate, should be really big news on the Prairies.\nE1\n\n[Signature]\n\nCousin: Let's not let the reactionaries kill \"enterprise.\"\n\nE/B also express my sentiments.\n\n[Signature]\n\nL\n\n9 AM - -\n33 Ossington Avenue,\nJanuary 26, 1951.\n\nShepard Engineering Company,\n912 North Market Street,\nSt. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI recently returned from a school inspection trip and found the slide which I had ordered in November.

ACLAND\nEXECUTIVE ASSISTANT\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant, Mr. Smith's letter is not very definite. His letter has been reviewed by Mr. Clark of this Division, who was in the same area about two years ago.\n\nIt is my understanding that there is no reserve at Lubicon Lake. As stated in Mr. Smith's letter, we have residential schools which the children could attend, but Mr. Smith states that the parents object on account of the distance of the residential schools from their homes. We have not received any request from the Alberta Department of Education to co-operate with them in erecting a Joint School.\n\nI do not understand what is meant by \"we are planning to building a dormitory\". Mr. Smith does not state to whom he refers, and in using the word \"dormitory\" it is presumed that he refers to a \"hostel\". We have no funds available for assistance in a project of this nature. While Mr. Smith may not realize it, the establishment and operation of a hostel presents all the same difficulties as occur in the establishment and operation of a residential school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\nReference attached letter to the Minister from Rolland C. Smith. Will you please forward to this office all available information respecting those sections having to do with your service in order that a letter may be prepared for the Minister's signature with as little delay as possible.\n\nExecutive Assistant.\nFebruary 7, 1951\n\nThe Honorable Walter Harris M.P.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are some things which I discovered on my recent trip through the Lubicon (Prairie) Lake area, northeast of town, which should be brought to your attention.\n\nThis area is quite isolated and except for treaty time is visited by very few white men. My purpose in making this 366 mile trip was to investigate the request for a school. The Indians thought your department should be responsible for a school, but I found only one-third of the 60 children concerned are treaty. You have already provided two excellent residential schools at Wabiskaw and Grouard, which were intended to be used by these Indians. Since visiting with them, it seems they are determined not to send their children out to these schools, because they are too far away for the parents to visit their children. (It would take them a week or more each way, traveling as they do by team.)\n\nThe Indians and Metis all want a school, even if they have to build one for themselves. Since two-thirds of the children are non-treaty, we are trying to work out a plan whereby the Alberta Department of Education will provide a day school and we are planning to build a dormitory. If this idea works out, will your department be willing for us to include the treaty children in this plan? How much do you pay toward their support?\n\nIn deciding the location for the school the question is again raised concerning the promised Indian Reserve at Lubicon Lake. Ten or twelve years ago these Indians were promised a Reserve comprising 22 sections of prairie land at the west end of Lubicon Lake. Do you have any record of such\nan agreement? Has the plan for a Reserve at Lubicon been abandoned? If there is to be a Reserve, the school should be located near it, but not necessarily on it, since two-thirds of the children are non-treaty.\n\nThere is considerable fuss being made relative to the children's allowance. The non-treaty Metis are receiving the allowance, when their children are not in school, but the treaty Indians are not. Could you use your influence to have a standard rule relative to the children's allowance? The Indians need this extra money as much or more than anyone else.\n\nOne other matter should be mentioned. The Lubicon Lake Indians have not been exrayed for T.B. The trader and some of the Indians expressed concern, because last year the treaty party did exrays everywhere except at Lubicon. I do not know why they were omitted, but will you please include the exray outfit with this year's treaty party at Lubicon? Treaty time is the only contact their people now have with medical care. We plan to have a nurse at the school when it opens.\n\nThanks for your patience in this lengthy letter. These are matters I knew you would be interested in and I know they will receive your careful consideration.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Rolland C.

I would like to apply for one of these positions.\n\nMy experience in the North has been fairly extensive as, for two years previous to entering university, I was an employee of the Abitibi Paper and Pulp Company in Northern Ontario and Manitoba. The last year of this period I was employed as a cruiser, in which capacity I naturally spent months cut off from all but occasional contact with the outside world. I know therefore that this aspect of the position will present no difficulties. I like the north and this fact contributes in no small way to my interest.\nin the post. Another consideration that prompts me to apply is the fact that I am financing my own education. It is thus imperative that I have a job that provides not only an adequate salary but also an opportunity to work.\n\nI am an Arts student at Mount Allison University and am 21 yrs of age. Because of my uncertain financial position I have been permitted to register as a special student. I am now taking the following courses: Freshman and Sophomore English, The Modern Novel, Economics, Sociology and Political Science.\n\nIt is Professor MacBeth who has drawn my attention to the possibility of employment with you and he has offered to write you on my behalf. I will be free to begin work on May 10.\n\nI hope that you will see fit to consider my application favourably.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nRichard Nielsen\nMarch 15th, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI am writing to Mr. B. Philip Belyea of Sackville, New Brunswick, asking him, to take one of our schools, next Summer.\n\nAs soon as I hear from you, in answer to my long letter, I will know how many we need.\n\nI have written to Mr. Thompson and told him of your plan, to replace him next Fall.\n\nI understand, he can remain there, until then.\n\nI should be very glad to hear from the man, whom you were going to send there, as the permanent teacher.\n\nI am anxious, if possible, to find a suitable person for Mistassini. There are enough people there, to justify a permanent appointment. The man would be happier, if he were married.\n\nDo you think, that if we can find the right man, his wife, could be appointed as a nurse, or as a Social Service Worker.\n\nThere is a real need there for someone to work among the women and children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison,\nBishop of Moosonee.\nTruman House,\nMount Allison University,\nSackville, N.B.\n15th of March, 1949\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am a Freshman Arts student at Mount Allison University, am twenty-four years of age and am seeking employment during the coming summer months as a teacher at one of the seasonal schools in the north.\n\nI served thirty-nine months in the Royal Canadian Air Force, doing administrative work in Canada and Intelligence Branch work in Germany during the first year of occupation. From the spring of 1947 until the spring of 1948 I was employed as an interpreter with the German Section of the British Foreign Office in Germany. In the fall of last year I took up my studies at this university and plan to make teaching my profession upon the successful completion of these studies.\n\nA close friend of mine at this university, Allison B. Connell, has also applied for a teaching position with your branch. In the event of our both being accepted for work, would it be at all possible for us to be sent to the same reserve together?\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nrespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n(John D. Allen)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Lands and National Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nMarch 15, 1949.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am attending Dalhousie University taking courses of instruction in third year Arts. I have been advised that your department offers employment for such students in the capacity of instructors in Indian schools. Since I have taught one year in a rural school and intend to enter that profession on graduation, such a position would be desirable.\n\nAny information on prospective positions would be appreciated. Qualifications or references will be furnished upon request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKenneth Morrison.\nMarch 16, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am glad to recommend to you Mr. Richard G. Nielsen as a suitable teacher for work with the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis young man is well and favourably known to me. He lives as a student in a men's residence of which I am Dean. During the six months he has lived here, I have acted as an adviser to him on almost every phase of his life, and because he is supporting himself through college and because of a separation of distance and circumstances from his father, I have to some extent acted in lieu of his parents.\n\nNielsen is twenty-one years of age, of excellent physical build and appearance, of agreeable and open disposition, of superior intellect, a capable public speaker of assured bearing, a practical man rather than a scholar. Mr. Parker, the Headmaster of Mount Allison Academy, Professor Crawford, the Head of our Mathematics Department, and Mr. Pratt, a lecturer in our Economics Department, concur in my opinion on Nielsen. I have read these three men my estimate and have their permission to use their names.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will find it possible to place this man for the Summer. I believe he will give you excellent satisfaction.\n\nTwo other Mount Allison men, Mr. John D. Allen and Mr. Allison B. Connell, have asked me to recommend them to you. I have known Mr. Allen for nine years. He was a pupil in the Saint John High School from 1940-1943 when I taught there. He served for 39 months in the R.C.A.F. and then for one year with the German Section of the British Foreign Office. He is working toward a B.A. degree with the object of teaching English. Allen is a mature and disciplined man. Mr. Connell has been known to me only since his registration in one of my classes in September, 1948. He is a quiet, scholarly man of pleasant personality.\n\n- over -\nMr. Bernard Neary - page two.\n\nI believe all three of these men to be of excellent moral character.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAllan MacBeth,\nDepartment of French.\nDean of Allison Lodge\n2459\n\n20 Winston Grove,\nToronto 18, Ont.,\n17 March 1949.\n\nMr. B.

I would be free to teach from May 17 to September 13.\n\nI am attending Mount Allison University and expect to receive my B.A. degree this May. I am majoring in History and minoring in English. I intend to enter the teaching profession and shall be taking my Bachelor of Education work at this University next year. I might mention that this year I am taking a course in Educational Psychology in which I obtained \"A\" standing at the Mid-Year examination.\n\nIn the line of handicrafts I have taken a course in Clay Modelling at the School of Applied Arts of this University. Also I have had considerable experience in making and operating Marionette puppets. In the last two years I have assisted in the presentation of Marionette shows to the children of the combined Public Schools of Truro, Amherst and Sackville under the sponsorship of the Home and School Clubs. I have had musical experience playing trumpet and cello in bands and orchestras in Regina and Sackville.\n\nI am enclosing a reference from my Professor of Education, Dr. Southam, Head of the Education Department.

Sloan, one of our students at Mount Allison, is applying to your Branch for a teaching position in an Indian School during the summer this year.\n\nMr. Sloan has been attending my class during the present Session in Educational Psychology in preparation for post-graduate work in Education next year leading to his B.Ed. degree. I am pleased to inform you that he is a serious, hard working student, keenly interested in his Senior Year courses, and doing work of a very satisfactory calibre. He impresses me as being a young man of more than average ability, with plenty of initiative, and possessed of sound purpose in undertaking a career of community service through the medium of teaching.\n\nIt it with satisfaction and without hesitation that I recommend him for serious consideration for appointments such as you have in mind. Mr. Sloan's qualities of personality, academic background, and previous work experience give promise of success in his chosen occupation. I trust his application will receive a favourable review.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nHarold D.

I am pleased to note that you feel Mr. Belves will be satisfactory for one of our seasonal schools in our diocese.\n\nI have already been in correspondence with Mr. Belvedere, and by now he should have received a cheque for his teaching duties during the month of October.

These are Rev. H. J. Best, Woodstock, N.B. and Mr. C.M.G. Arthurs, Woodstock, N.B. The latter is the principal of the high school which I attended.\n\nIf there is any possibility of two teachers being sent to the same location, I am very anxious to be placed with John D. Allen, who I believe has also applied.\n\nI should also like to state that it is my intention to pursue teaching as a life occupation.\n\nIf you do not feel that I am qualified for teaching this summer in one of your schools, may I be notified as soon as possible, please, so that I can make other arrangements for summer employment.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAllison B.

I note that Mr. Shaver will be available about the middle of May. Unfortunately, he is now 65 years of age and it would be rather difficult to add him to our payroll. As you are probably aware, our Retirement age is 65.

I have a number of applications on hand from university students who, I feel, would prove quite satisfactory. I will list some of their names and addresses for you and you will note that I have selected only the male students:\n\n1. G. H.

Neary, Supt. of Indian Education:\n\nDear sir:\n\nThis morning I receive your letter of March 21, inquiring of the teachers for season 1949.\n\nI have been in correspondence with the said teachers last year and I took some time before to have their answers, as few were working away from their little town or village.\n\nBut now, recently, I have in hands their answer of each six teachers for the three said missions. And their answer is that they will come again.\n\nSo here are again their names:\n\n1- For Weymontaching:\n   Miss Carmen Tr\u00e9panier, 1099 St Roch, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res\n   Miss Marie-Marthe Roberge, St Stanislas, P.Q.\n\n2- For Manawan:\n   Miss Ursule Boredeau, Broulxville, P.Q.\n   Miss Lucille Francoeur, \" \"\n\n3- For Obedjiwan:\n   Miss Antonine Boredeau, Proulxville, P.Q.\n   Miss Cl\u00e9mence Lafontaine, \" \"\n\nYour all devoted,\n\nM. Meilleur, o.m.i. Dir.\nSanmaur, P.Q.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor copy\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to obtain some information regarding Indian affairs. It has come to my attention that your department engages university undergraduates for summer employment in teaching Indians. I am at present taking my undergraduate courses at Queen's University in preparation for work in the field of education and would appreciate it if you could inform me if there would be any employment in this connection for the ensuing summers in the Western Provinces particularly British Columbia. I will have completed this year towards an honours B.A. this spring. If there is such work for the coming summer, you might inform me of the qualifications necessary and any other relevant details.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.G. McBeath\nMr. Bernard Neary,\nDirector of Indian Education,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short time ago I had the pleasure of attending a lecture given in Toronto by Mr. A. Walsh of your department. Mr. Walsh lectured in graphic detail the nature of the work which you and your staff are doing for the benefit of our Indian population.\n\nDuring the war I had the opportunity of living with primitive peoples in the Pacific and the Panama region. Last summer I spent four months in the Steep Rock area north of Port Arthur as a labourer teacher for Frontier College and while engaged in that capacity I had the opportunity of personal contact with the Indians of that region.\n\nDuring a dinner conversation after the lecture I mentioned the above facts and Mr. Walsh was kind enough to suggest that your department might find a use for my services for a few months in the summer.\nThe opportunity to work in the field with the Indian would give the practical knowledge necessary to understand the conditions and requisites of these people and would be invaluable in my later years as a lawyer.\n\nMr. Walsh said he would speak to you on my behalf but I decided to write to you to indicate my sincerity in this matter. Any information you can give me will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGordon W Thomson\nMarch 30, 1949.\n\nMr. A.G. McLeath,\nQueen's University,\nKingston, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McLeath:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 24 concerning the teaching positions open in our Indian seasonal schools.\n\nI am attaching one of our application forms which I would like to have you complete and return here.\n\nWe have had a large number of applicants this year for vacancies in these schools, and, at the present time, they are practically all filled. However, I will be glad to have your application on file in the event that a vacancy suddenly occurs.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend R.J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Toronto,\nBishopstoke, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nFurther to my letter of March 25, I wish to advise that I have received a large number of applicants for personal schools, some of which might be of interest to you. The following students have applied:\n\n1. C.H. Brown, age 38, C.E., 6 years' service, Royal Canadian Navy, second year student, University of Toronto.\n   Address - 27 Linden St., Toronto, Ont.\n\n2. J.J. Bond - age 31, Royal Navy Service, undergraduate student in anthropology, University of Toronto.\n   Address - 150 Keeewatin Ave., Toronto, Ont.\n\n3. John L. Howe - age 28, 4 years Canadian Armoured Corps, graduating in Arts this year, University of Toronto.\n   Address - 20 Winston Grove, Toronto 14, Ont.\n\n4. A.J.K. Arnold - age 27, C.E., 6 years Canadian Army, third year student Carleton College.\n   Address - 229 Frank St., Ottawa, Ont.\n5. A.B. Connell, age 18, C.W., first year student, Mount Allison, Sackville, N.B.\n   Address - Sackville, N.B.\n\n6. J.D. Allen, age 24, R.C.A.F. veteran, first year student, Mount Allison.\n   Address - Trusman House, Mount Allison University, Sackville, N.B.\n\n7. G.W. Thomson, (I am writing to him for further details. He has had experience as a labourer teacher for Frontier College and should be a good prospect.)\n\nYou will note that I have marked Mr. Arnold's name with an asterisk. I have personally interviewed him and feel that he would be a success in our work. He is presently working part time for C.A.R.S. and has a very good letter of reference from that organization. He is more than prepared to go to an isolated post. I have also had a letter from Mr. Stephenson indicating that he is quite prepared to teach again at Waswanipi. It is quite possible that he and Mr. Arnold would make a good team at Waswanipi.\n\nAnother good prospect would seem to be Mr. G.W. Thomson. During the war he was marooned in the South Pacific and spent some time living with the natives there. He has also had some experience in teaching for Frontier College.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Stephenson,\nTrinity College,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Stephenson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 29. I note your interest in a clerical position in Victoria, B.C., and would advise that we have no Indian Affairs office in that town now. The Commissioner's office is in Vancouver, and the nearest Indian Superintendent's office is at Duncan, B.C. As Superintendent of Education, I do not deal with clerical positions but only with teaching positions. If you are primarily interested in a clerical position, application would have to be made through the Civil Service Commission. I can not answer your question with regard to a clerical position and have referred, therefore, your letter to our General Executive assistant who will write you further.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. IRVINE\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter from Mr. R.J. Stephenson who taught last year as a university student at the Nasowani Indian Day School. He apparently is very interested in getting into the Indian Affairs Branch and has even indicated he is prepared to accept a clerical post. He is in his last year at the University of Toronto and, as his home is in British Columbia, wishes a position there. His father is Col. D.C. Stephenson of the B.C. Power Commission, Nanaimo, B.C., and he also gives Mr. Lariviere as a reference.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. G.W. Thomson,\n47 Ellerslie Ave.,\nWillowdale, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Thomson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 25, and I am pleased to forward you an application form for completion and return here.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the seasonal school positions are already filled, but after speaking to Mr. Walsh, I was persuaded of your keen interest in our work. Therefore, I would be glad to hear from you again with the attached application form completed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. Allison B. Connell,\nTrusman House,\nMt. Allison University,\nSackville, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. Connell:\n\nI have answered your letter of March 22 and wish to advise that your name has been sent to two of our superintendents, but so far we have had no response.\n\nUnfortunately for you, most of our university students who taught last year are now indicating their interest in teaching again this year. In fact, some who had previously advised they would not be returning have changed their mind and apparently intend to teach again.\n\nYou can also appreciate the fact that we are looking for students who are older than yourself and that we are giving the preference to overseas veterans. If you do not hear from me within the next week, it will mean that all positions have been filled.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. William J. Sloan,\nBox 718, Jackville, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. Sloan:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 19, and I have mentioned your name to two of our Indian Superintendents in the hope that a suitable vacancy would occur.\n\nUnfortunately for you, most of the teachers who were with us last year have again indicated their intention of teaching this summer. As a result, we simply do not have the vacancies that we had anticipated. Would you please, however, complete the attached application form and return it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. John L. Howe,\n20 Winston Grove,\nToronto 15, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Howe:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 17 and have mentioned your name to two of our Indian Superintendents in the hope that a suitable vacancy could occur.\n\nUnfortunately for you, most of the teachers who were with us last year have indicated their intention of teaching again this summer. As a result, we simply do not have the vacancies that we had anticipated. Would you please, however, complete the attached application form and return it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. Kenneth Morrison,\n114 Preston St.,\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. Morrison:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 15 and have mentioned your name to two of our Indian superintendents in the hope that a suitable vacancy would occur.\n\nUnfortunately for you, most of the teachers who were with us last year have indicated their intention of teaching again this summer. As a result, we simply do not have the vacancies that we had anticipated. Would you please, however, complete the attached application form and return it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. John D. Allen,\nTrueman House,\nMount Allison University,\nSackville, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. Allen:\n\nI have now answered your letter of March 15 and have placed your name with our list of applicants.\n\nAs an overseas veteran you will, naturally, have a priority over your friend Mr. Connell. Unfortunately, we have not had nearly the number of vacancies in our seasonal schools which we had anticipated. Most of the university students whom we had last year have again indicated their intention to return to their schools. As they are practically all overseas veterans or Air Force and Army and have already had one year of experience, you can appreciate the fact that we are anxious to employ them again. Would you please, however, complete the attached application form and return it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMr. Allan MacBeth,\nDepartment of French,\nMount Allison University,\nSackville, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. MacBeth:\n\nI have answered your letter of March 16 and have written to several of our superintendents mentioning the qualifications of the three students whom you recommend. To date, however, all indications are that most of the students whom we employed last year will be back with us again.\n\nAs most of these young men are overseas veterans and have already had one year of experience, you can appreciate the fact that we are anxious to secure their services again. However, I am sending an application form which I would like to have Mr. Nielsen complete and return here as soon as possible in the event that a vacancy should occur. I have also written to Mr. Allen and Mr. Connell. I feel that Mr. Connell is rather young to be sent into one of these rather isolated schools. We have always endeavored to obtain students at least 21 years of age or more.\n\nI appreciate the interest shown by you in forwarding to me your recommendations of these three students.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 5, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 16th.\n\nI have already forwarded an application form to be completed by you to Professor MacBeth.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. R. Nielsen,\nAllison Lodge,\nMount Allison,\nSackville, N.B.,\n\nBFN/IM\nApril 2nd, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI wish to thank you for the interest you have taken in the various Summer Missions, to which we hope to send teachers, this year.\n\nI will especially refer to your letter of March 25th.\n\nThere are seven missions in all. For two of them, you have authorized two teachers each. This makes nine men in all.\n\nFirst of all, as to the choice of men. It is difficult to bring back the same men every year. Students change their plans; some of them are more successful than others, and there is no doubt, that a man is more efficient, in his second year, at the same place.\n\nI have secured two men from St. John's College, Winnipeg, whom I would like to send to the Nakina District, for two reasons. It is only two or three hundred miles to Winnipeg, and Manitoba University closes about the first of May, which gives the men a longer period.\n\nI would have no objection to your dealing directly with the men, before they go into the field. The trouble is, that the Department so far has not paid any travelling expenses, and most of the men have to travel by plane, for at least part of the journey, therefore, the financing of the students has always been a worry, because the men expect to receive their whole travelling expenses besides their upkeep at the missions; in other words, they want take home pay.\nRT.

NEARY - 2.\n\nWe have to explain to the men, that their salary is supposed to cover their whole transaction. If it could be arranged, I would much prefer that they should be paid direct by the department. As a matter of fact, we always have to pay some balance, at the end of the Summer.\n\nMr. Higginson did a good job last Summer at Mistassini, but he did not understand our system, as he was paid directly by you, and we advanced his travelling expenses.\n\nI talked this matter over with Mr. Hoey, a couple of years ago, and he suggested, that the students should be paid from the time they left home, until they returned, to help cover their travelling expenses. I think that this is not an unfair arrangement.\n\nMr. B. P. Belyea, who lives in New Brunswick, would like to have one of the schools in the Sioux Lookout District, but this would mean travelling nearly a thousand miles more, than if he went to Mistassini, but I do think, that it would be an admirable thing, if each man received his instructions from the department, and if his school supplies were sent in, a long time before the school opened.\n\nWould you like me to order supplies for the various schools and send the list to the department, or is that done automatically, in Ottawa?\n\nThe following men will return this year:-\n\nMr. Ross\nMr. Bridle and Mr. Higginson, if you would like him to go, as one of the teachers for Mistassini.\nCol. B. F. Neary - 2.\n\nAt present, I have two volunteers from Winnipeg, two from Huron College and two from Trinity College, Toronto.\n\nThis letter is written in general terms, but I would like to have your ideas, before proceeding any further.\n\nI would be glad, if you would send me any particular names of men, who would be useful.\n\nI wish it were possible for the Ontario Government, to co-operate with the Indian Department, in the matter of a four-roomed Day School, which would serve the population on Moose Factory Island.\n\nI still think, it would be a good thing, if you could send one of your men with me this Summer, to see the picture of our Indian work.\n\nI hope to visit, between five and six thousand Indians, in five or six weeks.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J.

He is not only\nbrilliant academically but he is a young man of practical\nexperience as well, and one who can make equally good use\nof either academic or practical background.\n\nI do not wish to detract from my recommendations\nof the other three men; they are all good, stable natured\nmen who will do a good job.

I am an American thirty-four years old, single, and hold a Superior First Class Teacher's License in the Province of Nova Scotia and have had four years successful teaching experience in the schools of Nova Scotia and in Army Institutes both in Canada and overseas where I instructed in Mathematics and English at the Pro-C-O-T-A School.

Bernard F. Neary - 3.\n\nFrom the names that you have sent me, I have chosen two. Mr. Belyea seems a good man and very interested, but he wants to go to the West, where he has worked before, near Sioux Lookout. That is quite near Pickle, where we will need a new man this year. The student should give his whole time, to the school. Mr. Bridie can get him started. The only difficulty is, that it is a long way from New Brunswick, however, I am wiring him. The other man, Mr. J. K. Arnold or Ottawa, you have already seen. I would be very glad to have him join up with Stephenson, at Waswanipi.\n\nWould you be good enough to give me the information indicated in my questions?\n\nI am sorry to trouble you, but both the church and the department are interested in the Indians, and I am most anxious, that we should continue to work together, perhaps more efficiently, than in the past.\n\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will send you a complete list, and write to each man definitely.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRJR/L.\nCol. Bernard F. Neary - 2.\n\nWe have to send the students advance money, and make arrangements for their board and housing. All this requires some diplomacy and local knowledge. For that reason, in the past, we have had to consider where men lived, before appointing them to any mission.\n\nI have promised to take two men from Winnipeg, for work in the West. Two men from Huron; one of them Ross, who was at Fort Hope, last year.\n\nI am glad to know, that Stephenson wrote to you, about Waswanipi. I will be glad, to have him there, if he will go.\n\nI expect to be home, from Toronto, next Monday, after seeing several men down there.\n\nI would like you to give me the following information:\n\n1. How much will the Government pay each man for the Summer?\n\n2. Is there any payment for travelling expenses? Several of them have to fly.\n\n3. Does the salary include board and lodging?\n\n4. Am I to understand, that you wish to pay each man, individually, and relieve the Diocese of the responsibility of making arrangements for travelling expenses. The reason I mention this is, that in the past, we have had to finance each man through the Summer, and wait, until the Fall, and sometimes, until the end or the year, before being reimbursed. I simply mention this, so as to clear up possible difficulties.\nApril 19th, 1949.\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI have just returned from a long trip to the West.\n\nI have seen W. H. Thompson at Calstock, where he has done a good work. He is very active and devoted to the Indians, but I think his chief interest is in their religious and social welfare. I am going to ordain him Deacon on May 10th, and will probably place him, for awhile, at another place. He would have stayed, however, at Calstock, if you had not made other arrangements.\n\nBy the way, I would like sometime, to talk to you, about the situation, as between Pagwa and Calstock. You probably know something or its history. All the people, at both places, come from the Albany River on James Bay. What is happening is, that, most of the independent and young people are staying at Pagwa, while the old and dependent people have gone to Calstock, where they find it easier to get relief and Government Help. It seems a pity. I think I could help you, to unify the band. Perhaps, we can discuss it sometime.\n\nNow with regard to the Summer Students. As you know, in the past, the Government has taken no responsibility, for travelling expenses, and we have had to consider, the cost of travelling, and also, we have to tell the students, beforehand, how much \"take-home\" money, they will have at the end of the year.\nApril 22, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend R.J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 2. This will have crossed mine in which I mentioned the names of a few students who might be interested in these positions.\n\nWe will try to arrange the pay of these students as you suggest and hope that this will settle the matter of transportation. When I receive from you the various nominees for the schools, I will write immediately advising the salary which we can offer.\n\nRegarding supplies, most of these have already been sent in, and reserves are held by Mr. Swartman at Sioux Lookout and Mr. Lariviere at Amos.\n\nI have noted your comments concerning Moose Factory Island.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI have just returned from London and Toronto where I met some of the students who are going north. Scharfiter and Meikle met me in Toronto and I have arranged for them to go to Montreal to meet the manager of the Mistassini Hudson's Bay Co. store. I have heard that the old Hudson's Bay house is still habitable and will give them shelter. I have authorized them to purchase whatever is necessary for their trip. Any house equipment the mission will pay for. Other things like personal luxuries they can pay for themselves. I have advanced each of them $100 and have given them an order on the Mont Laurier Aviation Co. at Roberval for return plane fare. They are both keen and competent and will leave early next week. I have also written to Mr. C. H. Brown and Mr. G. W. Thomson who live near Toronto and instructed them to travel to Senneterre. I have given them an order for a plane fare to Waswanapi. So far these are the only men for whom I have advanced money and I am sure that there will be no difficulty. I will either send the bills to you or have them pay me. I would much rather not have to take their cheques myself so that there will be no money transaction between us. If I have made any mistake in assuming that Mr. Brown has accepted you can let me know. I expect to begin my air journey about June 1st at Central Patricia, going down the Albany River, visiting about 6 posts and then around James Bay from Amepioutou to Whale River and perhaps the Belcher Island then I will go overland to Mistassini and Waswanapi, ending the journey at Val D'Or. It will be nearly 4,000 miles. I wish you could have sent one of your men with me, or come yourself.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\n\nOver.\nP.S. With regard to the letter which you received from Mr. Hankinson or Nakina, I prefer that the nominations should stand as they are. Archdeacon Clarke, who met him in Winnipeg, should not have told him where he was going. I know that you liked Robert Ross last year and he particularly wanted to go to the same place and that is why I sent him there. So as far as I am concerned all the nominations stand as they are.\nMay 26, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend R. J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have received your letter of May 20 and appreciate the trouble you have gone to in listing all the teachers.\n\nI will arrange to send the first cheques for Messrs. Schaffter and Meikle in care of you, so that the necessary arrangements can be made concerning their salary cheques.\n\nI regret very much that I will not be able to have Major Clark accompany you on your projected trip. We are having an educational survey made of the Abitibi superintendency and Mr. Doucet, Major Clark and a provincial school inspector will be visiting the various reserves of the Abitibi district in July. As for accompanying you myself, there is nothing I would like better, especially when I look at the pile of unanswered letters on my desk. However, someone has to be here to answer the letters and I am afraid that I am doomed to such a fate this summer. In conclusion, may I again thank you for your assistance in filling these seasonal schools this summer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

Before that time I shall have completed the second year of my studies toward a Bachelor of Arts degree at Mount Allison University, and shall have attained the age of nineteen. May I add that it is my intention to pursue teaching as a life work. Already I have acquired a considerable knowledge of child psychology, not only through studies, but also as a result of two years of practical experience with the church.\n\nMy keenest desire is to practise this further during my university years, so I feel the experience thus gained would be invaluable in the future. Unfortunately, I am not a licensed teacher, and would seek your advice as to whether I ought to apply under this circumstance, and whether I should submit letters of reference from previous employers and my clergyman, etc.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAllison B.

Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope,\nPorcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nAs you are aware, I am always on the search for suitable students for our seasonal schools. Last year I had a series of letters from Mr. Allison B. Connell, Jr., attending Mt. Allison University at Sackville, New Brunswick.\n\nI felt he was a little too young (he was then 18 years of age) to try one of our schools but believe he might do at Mistassini or Waswanipi again this year.\n\nI have just had another letter from him and he seems to be very keen on trying one of these schools. He is now in his second year of an Arts degree and intends to go into teaching as a career. He is an Anglican, born at Sioux Lookout, Ontario, and his address is Post Office Box 241, Sackville, New Brunswick.\n\nI thought possibly you might be able to make local enquiries concerning his suitability and check on his personal attributes.\n\nI have also had applications from other students at Mount Allison, as follows:\n\n(a) Cecil Smith, Trusman House, Mt. Allison University, Sackville, N.B.; age 34; Army Veteran; First Class teaching certificate with 4 years of experience.\n(b) W. J. Sloan, Box 718, Sackville, New Brunswick, age 22.\n\n(c) Mr. R. Nielsen, Allison Lodge, Mount Allison, Sackville, New Brunswick.\n\n(d) Mr. John D. Allen, Trueman House, Mount Allison University, Sackville, N. B.\n\nMost of these applicants wrote in last year and apparently Mr. Allan Macbeth, one of their Professors, is keenly interested in placing them in seasonal schools.\n\nWith your connections, I thought you might be able to check on some of these students.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nOne of the lads whom I am proposing to recommend very strongly to you for a temporary teaching job this coming summer, asked me whether, by any chance, there might be a position available for husband and wife. Needless to say, I did not know, but I promised to pass the question on to you.\n\nI can recommend the young man whole-heartedly, and he wishes me to be perfectly clear that he was anxious for the position, quite irrespective of any possibility of his wife. In other words, this is not a case of an applicant wishing to raise difficulties, or asking for consideration.\n\nDunning, the man in question, tells me that his wife taught public school in New Zealand for several years, so she must hold whatever the legal teaching requirements may be in New Zealand. I have met Mrs. Dunning, but only in a very casual way. Curiously enough, she reminded me that I had met her when she first came to Canada a few years ago and was serving as a counsellor at Camp Tanamakoon, in Algonquin Park, where I happened to be a dinner guest. I know something of the standards of this camp, and feel perfectly sure they would not have counsellors who were not of good quality. My understanding is that the present Mrs. Dunning came from New Zealand to visit one or more Canadian camps, with, I assume, the intention of returning to New Zealand with the experience and knowledge gained in Canada. However, she got married instead.\n\nObviously, I have no knowledge of whether you have ever taken on a husband and wife on a summer job, but on the face of it, the Dunnings seem a perfectly possible combination.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

I am attending McMaster University on scholarship, and have maintained first class standing thus far. I have also had five years experience in Sunday school work, teaching boys and girls of from five to nine years.\n\nI was wondering if these qualifications are suitable to apply for the position of a teacher in a Seasonal School in Northern Ontario or Manitoba. I have spent some time in Northern Quebec.\nso have an idea of the conditions to be expected, but I would appreciate any further details you could give me, as well as some assurance that my qualifications are sufficient to apply. As I intend to enter the teaching profession when I graduate, I am very anxious to gain some experience along this line.\n\nYours very truly,\nKathryn Swift.\nFebruary 9, 1950.\n\nMiss Kathryn Swift,\n22 Water St. West,\nBurlington, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Swift:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 3 which was awaiting my return from a recent inspection trip to James Bay.\n\nPractically all the seasonal schools which are free this year are in isolated communities in which it would be almost impossible for a woman to obtain proper accommodation.\n\nThe more accessible schools are filled by teachers who have been in our service from Universities for previous summers.

Practically all these vacancies are in Northern Ontario and I doubt whether it would be to Mr. Shadd's advantage to accept a position so far from Fredericton. We do not pay travelling expenses to these positions and I have previously indicated to the Department of Labour that most of the vacancies are in Ontario and in the West.\n\nIf, however, you have anything else in mind for this teacher, please do not hesitate to write to me concerning his application as it is better for him to get a post with relatively small earnings than none at all.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

J. Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI would like to inquire about the teaching positions you have available in Ontario this coming summer. I am twenty-one years of age, a student at the Macdonald University, and although I have no teaching experience, would be interested in this branch of work among the Indians. I have a friend who has two year's teaching experience who would also be interested. We were wondering if you have any schools requiring two teachers to work together, or if the two schools are enough together that we could share living accommodations. Our examinations at Macdonald end at the beginning of May and we would be available after that time for the summer months.\n\nIn your reply would you kindly also answer the following questions concerning the position? Transportation to and from the place of employment provided? Are there living quarters attached to the schools? Will there be other white folk in the vicinity\u2014e.g., a minister and his family? Where are the schools located? What would the teaching hours be, and what sort of things are we expected to teach the children? These seem to be a lot of questions, but we understand the conditions will be rough, and as you will realize, we would like to have a fairly clear picture of the situation before we make our decision.\n\nThanking you for your attention in this matter, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGrace Willis (Mrs.)\nQUEEN'S UNIVERSITY\nKINGSTON, ONTARIO\n\nFebruary 4, 1930.\n\nColonel A.J.

I am interested in the teaching that you had to me at Queen's, and I would like to work together and do something that might make a very good job. I have found in this course under the guidance of Miss Helen E. Gates, who has been doing excellent work in the field of child development and child welfare.

While I understand that letters of application may be sent to you on or after March 31, I am taking the liberty of writing you now to secure more information about the work than was available at the Placement Office of the University. I hope to graduate in Honour English on May 15 of this year, and will be available for work from that date.

This is a copy of his letter from February 1949. He was one of the best men we had.\nyear, but his partner T. H. Meikle, B.A., is anxious to go back this summer. He is going to marry a girl who is also a graduate of Trinity College, and he would like to take her up with him as his partner. It seems to me it would make an admirable team. I know him; he served in the Air Force in India. There is a fine school there now, at Mistassini, also a fine teacher's residence. It would be an ideal honeymoon\u2014or they think so. It just happens that I have another offer from two highly qualified persons\u2014husband and wife\u2014who I think would fit in beautifully at Waswanipi, where there is also a teacher's residence and a school. If you don't mind I am going to send you a copy of their letters which please return to me. I understand there is no objection to the employment of a qualified woman who is properly chaperoned.\n\nI have the promise of four or five men from Huron College but I am not sure of their names at present.\n\nThe following is the list of places where we agreed there might be schools.\n\n1. Mistassini\n2. Waswanipi\n3. Hornepayne\n4. Fort Hope\n5. Lansdowne\n6. Ogoki\n7. Collins\n8. Pickle Crow\n9. Osbourne\n10. Namiska\n\nYou will notice that there are three new places. I spoke to you already about Ogoki. Osmand is a place where there has been no teacher, but we agree that it might sometime be the centre of the whole district. Namiska is a remote spot 100 miles inland from Rupert's House. They have never had anyone except a visit from the missionary and the bishop once a year. There is a tent there which could be used as a church and a school. I think it would be a nice gesture to that lonely spot. There are one hundred Indians living there during the summer. It is almost half way between Rupert's House and Waswanipi. They are all Anglican Indians. I would be very grateful to you if you could nominate some men so that our list may be complete. You will notice that I have five volunteers from Huron College. I hope that you can write to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\nFebruary 9th, 1950.\n\nColonel R. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI take it for granted that you went home by air. I heard from Archdeacon Clarke during your visit and I want to tell you that I am very glad to know that you have seen something of our problem on James Bay.\n\nArchdeacon Clarke will be here next Wednesday for the meeting of our Executive Committee and I will be able to learn then, something of your decisions.\n\nWith regard to the Indian Day Schools on the Bay I have already received the back payments for three of the missionaries. The only one remaining is the account of Louttit at Factory River. This morning I had a cheque for him for $108.00 and it was dated January 31st. I take it for granted that it is for his salary for the first month of this year. I am very anxious that each of these four men will stand on his own feet and feel responsible for his reports to the Department.\n\nYou have been very interested and helpful about the summer day-schools. I have written to Griess but I am afraid that he will not be available this year. He has other ideas. I am very anxious to have our men picked as soon as possible because I am probably going away at the end of this month to the United States to fulfill some engagements there. I do not want to make any conflicting arrangements with the Department, so if you don't mind I am going to tell you the material that I have available.\n\nMatassini. Last year Scharrter and Meikle two graduates of Trinity College, University of Toronto, held the fort there. Mr. Scharrter is not available this\nyear, but his partner T. H. Meikle, B.A., is anxious to go back this summer. He is going to marry a girl who is also a graduate of Trinity College, and he would like to take her up with him as his partner. It seems to me it would make an admirable team. I know him; he served in the Air Force in India. There is a fine school there now, at Mistassini, also a fine teacher's residence. It would be an ideal honeymoon - or they think so. It just happens that I have another offer from two highly qualified persons - husband and wife - who I think would fit in beautifully at Waswanipi, where there is also a teacher's residence and a school. If you don't mind I am going to send you a copy of their letters which please return to me. I understand there is no objection to the employment of a qualified woman who is properly chaperoned.\n\nI have the promise of four or five men from Huron College but I am not sure of their names at present.\n\nThe following is the list of places where we agreed there might be schools.\n\n1. Mistassini\n2. Waswanipi\n3. Hornepayne\n4. Fort Hope\n5. Lansdowne\n6. Ogoki\n7. Collins\n8. Pickle Crow\n9. Osabourgh\n10. Namiska\n\nYou will notice that there are three new places. I spoke to you already about Ogoki. Osabourgh is a place where there has been no teacher, but we agree that it might sometime be the centre of the whole district. Namiska is a remote spot 100 miles inland from Rupert's House. They have never had anyone except a visit from the missionary and the bishop once a year. There is a tent there which could be used as a church and a school. I think it could be a nice gesture to that lonely spot. There are one hundred Indians living there during the summer. It is almost half way between Rupert's House and Waswanipi. They are all Anglican Indians. I would be very grateful to you if you could nominate some men so that our list may be complete. You will notice that I have five volunteers from Huron College. I hope that you can write to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\nTNA4140 DL=CNT TIMMINS ONT 21 920A\n\nD F NEARY\n\nSUPT OF EDUCATION, INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH=\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT=\n\nCOULD YOU SEND A MEMO OF OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH\nTWELVE APPLICATION FORMS BY MAIL TO PARK PLAZA HOTEL TORONTO\nI WILL BE THERE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY THIS WEEK I CAN CONTACT\nAPPLICANTS AND INSTRUCT THEM TO WRITE TO YOU=\n\nROBERT MOOSONEE.\n\n11-63\n22 February, 1950.\n\nThe Right Reverend R.J.

As I told you, I have a number of lads anxious to carry on this type of work who are as well qualified as were Brown and Bond last year; if they were successful, I have every reason to expect these others would do a comparable job. However, students, naturally, have to know about the summer, and it would be very helpful if you could let me know how many openings there will be, and when you would like details of those who are eager for them.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

At the present time, I am certain of two definite vacancies other than that at Tekanekum previously filled by the Dunings.\n\nThese two vacant positions are as follows:\n\n(a) Bear Island School - Roman Catholic teacher required - 16 miles from Temagami on Ontario Northland Railway. There are only ten children with a good frame school but no teachersage. This is a well-known summer resort, and the school is reached by boat from Temagami. Former teachers have boarded near the school.\n\n(b) Bearskin School - Protestant teacher required - 300 miles from Sioux Lookout, Ont. (reached only by tractor train). The school has a teachersage attached, and the\nteacher last year spent a great part of his time building this log school. It is a good building, and the attached teacherage, while small, is warm and comfortable. This school can be reached only by air. There are forty-seven children practically all of whom are in Grade I.\n\nThere is also a possibility of a vacancy at the Deer Lake Seasonal School which is 195 miles from Lac du Bonnet, Manitoba. This school is situated in Ontario but is only reached through Winnipeg. Another possible vacancy is at Pays Platte in the Fort Arthur Agency, but I will write to you concerning these when definite information is available.\n\nI am sending you application forms for the teachers whom you will have in mind for the Bear Island and Bearskin Schools.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

He is one of our Third Year Honour students, whose work has improved consistently throughout, and of whom I think much more highly now than I did two years ago. Valentine is a quiet, unassuming lad, ex-Navy and a Roman Catholic. He is the one I would recommend for the Temagami school, and I do so with very real confidence. He is a thoroughly satisfactory kind of person.\n\nThe other man I am recommending is C. T. Pearson, also one of our Third Year Honour students. Pearson is a younger boy, straight from high-school, and I have sometimes to remind myself that our present generation of students is of post-war vintage, without the broadening effect of service in the armed forces. Pearson bubbles with enthusiasm, eagerness and energy, but he has not Valentine's steady judgment. I would not recommend Pearson unless I had great confidence in him, but he certainly belongs to the age grade that has grown up since the war.\n\nI am not at all sure that I have any other man whom I could recommend unreservedly. We have a couple of girls available, and if you find that you need another man, I will be more than delighted to try to see what I can do. We have been lucky in getting our people placed this summer, including three with the National Museum and one with the Geographical Board.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. F. McIlwraith\n\nTFM: DIM\nApril 14, 1950\n92 Balsam Ave., s.\nHamilton, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to apply for a position with you this summer as a teacher in one of the schools of Indian Education. I am completing the last year of my Master's Degree in History at the University of Toronto; I completed my Bachelor's Degree at McMaster in 1948.\n\nThis past year I gained teaching experience as a supply teacher with the Hamilton Board of Education. Although I am not a qualified teacher, this experience would assist me as a teacher in your Department. If you wish I can forward to you a letter of recommendation from the Principal of the school at which I taught.\n\nI have always been interested in the conditions of Canada's Indian population and I would be very pleased to work with them. I am familiar to a degree with the Indian people of Northern Ontario, and their conditions; I was employed in the area around Blind River, one summer, with the Bell Telephone Co., where I met many of them.\n\nI would be very pleased, sir, if you would consider my application.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert L.

I think we all feel that the visit of the Archbishop was one of the highlights of the Synod. Dr. Carrington's personal charm, originality and humour has left a pleasant memory. The first service was held on Wednesday morning, the following Deacons were ordained to the priesthood:\n\nReverend E. R. dePendleton, B.A., the Reverend E. C. Grey, Reverend Lloyd Howard, and the Reverend George Loosmore. Mr. W. H. Thompson of Calstock was ordained Deacon. The Archbishop preached the sermon. Everyone was delighted to see the Venetian Archdeacon Woodall, D.D., in the chancel. His presence brought its own benediction.\n\nIn the afternoon the Archbishop conducted a quiet hour for the clergy.\n\nThe Synod service was held at eight o'clock in the evening, the Archbishop again being the preacher. The Synod then adjourned for preliminary organization. There was a good number of new members. Among the clergy and the laity there were new faces and fresh voices. The debates were very keen; I have never seen such a lively Synod in Moosonee.\n\nOn Thursday evening there was a reception held at Bishop's house; there were nearly a hundred people present. Archbishop Carrington fascinated everyone with a most original and beautiful coloured film of the Lambeth Conference. On the last day of the Synod the main feature was the report on our Indian Missions in James Bay given by Archdeacon Clarke. His story of the building of the great hospital at Moose Factory was quite thrilling.\n\nWhen the Synod was over I felt that the only lack was the presence of our clergy from James Bay. Before next Synod I hope to arrange that every priest in the Diocese will be able to attend.\n\nIn spite of the fact that we are losing three men from the Diocese, our Missions and Parishes are almost completely filled. There is a spirit of optimism and happiness which will make this Synod a bright omen for the future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\nNorthward Ho\n\nBy the Archbishop of Quebec\n\nI came northward at the invitation of the Bishop of Moosonee to address the Synod of the Diocese and to take part in its fellowship. It is a Diocese of 350,000 square miles and runs out into James' Bay. I have long been interested in it because our own has a certain resemblance to it; we have 280,000 square miles, and run out into the Straits of Belle Isle. Somewhere there is a frontier between the two Dioceses; it is called the Height of Land. As you make your way north you find the rivers running south until you come into a high flat region about a thousand feet above sea-level, full of lakes and rocks and trees; this is no man's land; a few miles north of this the rivers are found to be flowing north. You have crossed the Height of Land, and passed into the Diocese of Moosonee. Just where you did it, you do not know.\n\nActually I struck northward from the Diocese of Algoma. From North Bay the Ontario Northland Railway runs along the Ottawa River through Haileybury and Swastika. Somewhere in that neighborhood in the Height of Land is its source. A few miles further are Porcupine and Schumacher and Timmins; and in this area the Athabasca river, and flows north into James' Bay.\n\nNear Schumacher on the Porcupine Highway is the See House of the Diocese, a charming open-air residence beautifully situated in the woods. It is written in the Scriptures that a bishop must be the husband of one wife, and given to hospitality; it is the first of these requirements which makes possible the execution of the latter. In \"Bishoplope\" as the See House is called, hospitality is unbounded.\n\nThe Synod Service was held in St. Matthew's Pro-Cathedral at Timmins under the direction of Dean Robinson. It is a new clean attractive church. Synod members had come from great distances. Some were too far to be able to come. Police have to be laid down for two kinds of work; one is the continuation of Bishop Hardwick among the Indians. The other is the provision of school and clergy for the mining and paper making towns which are coming into existence now. Great progress has been made in both respects under the imaginative and energetic leadership of the present Bishop. The \"Northland\" magazine, edited by Mrs. Reinson, carries the challenge of the Church's work in this country far and wide.\n\nThe Diocese is about a thousand miles long, five hundred wide and twenty-five hundred deep for the spiritual jurisdiction of the bishop is not confined to the surface. Far below Timmins and Porcupine and Schumacher are passageways in the rock which total hundreds of miles. Not far away are Kirkland Lake and other mining centres. We did not descend the whole seven thousand feet. Twenty-eight men with three horses and two dogs descended with passengers and saw the veins of quartz in the hard rock, from which the precious gold is extracted. In minealls and rubbers and tin hats equipped with lamps, we made our way round and asked all kinds of questions about this pioneer enterprise in our national records. If a hundred years ago such the first failure (of gold) occurred in California in 1849, men from all over the world arrived and staked out their claims. Fortunes were won and made. Time has moved since then. The methods of hundred years ago were primitive indeed compared with those we use today; and yet the principle of cracking and washing is the same.\n\nThat California 'Gold rush' with others of its kind in Australia, New Zealand, Klondike, and elsewhere, played its part in the great British and American expansion of the nineteenth century. The gold, passing into circulating promoted trade. Today it mostly finds its way under the roof of the KINSHIP Club via the modern up-to-date plant. I felt it was exhilarating the reactionary in the most interesting way. Our talks with the Manager and with the Chief Engineer gave us some idea of the type of man who operates these ventures, scientific knowledge, good judgment, and readiness to take a risk are necessary.\n\nThese northern communities are alike in many respects. They are new settlements of modern houses with scientific adventures under primitive conditions. They are often made up of persons who have chosen to come and settle here have an element of enterprise in their make-up; they are skilled persons, often with high educational qualifications; they see things in a big way and are not afraid to take action where action must be taken. Often there is an element of culture in these communities, although in many cases they feel that position. Some families settle down in their new surroundings, but more of them move on after a while. The communities constantly change.\n\nFor many temperaments, Canada turns her most attractive face towards the north. Certainly that is where she is now advancing and forging ahead; and the Church is going forward on this front too.\n\nThe forest-land is still the home of the bear and the moose. The rivers are still the highways of the Indians, though of course boats an outboard motor. What of the Indian, as the industrialist sweeps into his hunting grounds?\"\nWe have given him the gospel. It is over a century now since missionaries of our Church first began to preach Christ to the Indians, and the Indian accepts His grace. We have the motto, Christians in our Anglican Church that the Indians of this great Diocese. They treasure their prayer books and their hymn books; they hold their own services in the woods; they pass on the Christian tradition to their children. Some of the Mistassini Indians of the Moosonee Diocese, appear in summer in our Diocese of Quebec. I have held Confirmations and administered Communion for them, and though they do not know a word of our language, and we do not know a word of theirs, we can see how much it means to them in their reverence and in their eyes.\n\nWe have a great responsibility for these Indians as Industrialism strikes deeper and deeper into their hereditary woods.\n\nGood luck to the Diocese of Moosonee! It needs stout-hearted men in the north, and I thought from the look of their Synod that they seem to have them.\n\nP. Q.\n\nThe Bishop Visits His Flock\n\nBy Margaret E. Plant\n\nAfter the long winter months, a bright spot in the spring season is the annual visit of Rt. Rev. R. J. Renison, Lord Bishop of Moosonee.\n\nThis year the Bishop arrived at Hearst on the evening of Friday, April 8th. Of his many week-end engagements, one was to visit, on Sunday afternoon, Calstock Indian Reserve, Anglican Mission.\n\nMy husband and I were very kindly invited to go along. Due to the unavoidable absence (a great disappointment to us) of Mrs. Renison, it seemed fitting that I should pioneer with her.\n\nThe Calstock Reserve is situated on the shores of Lake Constance thirty miles west and north of Hearst. As we approached we noticed small dark skinned boys, posted as it were, at intervals along the road, appearing uninterested but we knew, quite excited over the arrival of the Bishop. We were guided by willing children to the teacher's house where we received a warm welcome from Mr. Thompson, missionary teacher in charge, and an even warmer welcome from his husky dog.\n\nAs I watched the preparations of the Bishop and Mr. Thompson, for the three o'clock service in the school house, and later saw the light in the faces of the Indians as the Bishop walked into the building, I realized as I never had before, the significance of this service in the lives of these Cree Indians.\n\nThere were about seventy-five souls present, of all ages down to babes in arms, or in their gaily decorated \"tagahnabgahn.\" Their baby dark eyes peeking out from among brightly coloured blankets and tartan wraps. Extra bottles and trinkets were brought along by their mothers, who themselves wore their brightest and best dresses and scarves.\n\nMy glance fell on the attractive improvised altar, which I later learned was built by the Indian boys under the direction of their teacher. It was set on small wheels, had shelves on the back for books, and on the front, an altar cloth of snow-white linen bearing the Cree characters meaning, Holy, Holy, Holy.\n\nI sat on a bench beside Chief Sutherland and looked on his Cree prayerbook, thinking what a clever man you must be, to be able to read that? I was amazed at the prompt and sincere responses of the Chief and his people. The hymns which were led by Mr. Thompson were sung in English, and appeared to be well known.\n\nThe Bishop, who misses nothing important, however small, had the Scripture read by David Soloman, a lay reader of many years, whose halting voice gave evidence of tired and failing eyes but whose willingness to take part was not diminished.\n\nThe service was conducted by the Bishop partly in Cree and partly in English, the English being translated into Cree by George Ferris. It was heart warming to see how every word was absorbed by these Indians. Even the little children appeared to be influenced and comforted in their small way.\n\nThere were twelve, seven girls and five boys, in the Confirmation class. The girls looking sweet and pretty in their dresses and veils of many colours, blue, red and bright yellow, so lovingly and carefully sewed and made by their mothers. The dark eyes shone, as they knelt before their Bishop for the Laying on of Hands.\n\nThe Communion Service now began, fifty-five communicants, in groups of twelve, first the men, then after an exchange of babies one for another, the women in turn, knelt before the altar in deep reverence, renewing their pledges of love and loyalty to their God.\n\nLast, but by no means least, the hearty clasp of hands and exchange of greetings, with their Bishop, enquiries of relatives and friends at James Bay and other reserves, problems aired and advice given. The fishermen of several ships came ashore, and were drawn up close. After posing for pictures, which these people love to do, we watched them wind their way back to their cabins, each one, I know, feeling strengthened, spiritually and morally, and with a stronger sense of security in this great northland.\n\nPersonally, I walked away from the school house as if I were on a different plane, and feeling very humble.\n\nAt the tea table, Mr. Thompson served excellent tea, which was much appreciated. After which he accompanied us on our return trip, to spend, in Hearst, the holiday which follows the visit of the Bishop.\n\nMy husband and I were left off at Hearst, while the Bishop continued on his way to Mattice, to conduct the third service of the day, and to return late that night to the delightful surprise of finding Mrs. Renison, who had arrived by train early in the evening, awaiting him. So ended a glorious Palm Sunday.\nRT. REV.

Fifty years ago the only habitation of a Synod was the snowshoe trail from the distant posts on the east and west side of Hudson Bay when the missionaries came down to get the winter packet with the news of the last six months. Before the postman arrived from Mattawa five or six lonely men met their Bishop at the old log residence on the Island. It was only after the First Great War that Bishop Anderson organized the first Synod.\"\n\nA few \"highlights\" seem to stand out, impressing this \"youngster\" as he looks back upon the Fifteenth Missionary Synod, held at St. Matthew's Pro-Cathedral, Timmins, May 11th, 12th and 13th, 1949.\n\nTHE SYNOD SERVICE, of course, is expected to \"set the pace\" for the whole session, and we were extremely fortunate in having as Synod Preacher the Most Rev. Philip Carrington, Archbishop of Canterbury, neighbouring diocese for the past. After drawing many illustrations from his work at the recent Lambeth Conference, and also referring to his own diocese, which is so similar to ours, he concluded by saying: \"You have a job to do in holding the line here in this strategic area, a job that no one else can do.\"\n\nIt seemed to this \"youngster\" that the whole aim of the meetings that followed was \"to get on with the job\".\n\nIN HIS CHARGE the Bishop reviewed the accomplishments of \"The First Five Years,\" and \"nailed the colours to the mast\" for the next voyage. His \"crew\" supported him. The next Synod will commemorate the centenary of the landing of the first bishop, John Horden, on James Bay in 1861. For nearly a century the diocese of Moose Factory has been fighting on two fronts. Now, with the erection by the government of a modern hospital at Moose Factory, the line has been joined.\n\nTHE INDIAN MISSIONS on James Bay still hold a great fascination for the Church. Archdeacon Clarke's report was received with enthusiasm and the clergy called for copies to read to their congregations. The heroic labours of the missionaries at the outposts came in for special mention.\n\nA diocese cannot operate without money, and this \"youngster\" thought that much of the Synod's work could have to do with cold facts and figures; but the TREASURER'S REPORT showed that the human element in financing had not been overlooked. Mr. Jamieson said he had been opposed to any centralization of church finances. He believed missionary diocese should keep their responsibility and give leadership to the whole Church. He was given a great ovation by the Synod.\n\nAs a \"youngster\", we were impressed by the idea of a SUMMER CAMP FOR THE TRAINING OF YOUTH LEADERS, a project introduced by Rev. G. R. Stanley of Kapuskasing. The Synod authorized a grant IF the money could be raised by the parishes. The laymen were particularly enthusiastic and pledged their support. We had FAITH, that was about all; but faith does work miracles.\n\nThis \"youngster\" believes he will be at that camp this summer!\n\nAt work and no play makes Synod a dull time. Bishop and Mrs. Renison kindly arranged a reception at \"Bishop'scope\" for the delegates and their hosts on the second evening of Synod. The feature attraction was a showing of the films taken by Archbishop Carrington at the Lambeth Conference, with His Grace's interesting commentary. We all enjoyed a very pleasant evening.\n\nBefore Synod closed, the Bishop delivered by Canon Walton \"AFFIRMING OUR LOYALTY, LOVE, AND ESTEEM, TO BISHOP RENISON IN THE GREAT WORK HE HAS UNDERTAKEN IN THIS DIOCESE.\"\n\nWhile all the delegates rose to express their approval, the Bishop, visibly touched by this demonstration could only say \"it's been great fun.\"\n\nThis \"youngster\" considered that youth is not so much a question of age, but a state of mind.\n\nThe Diocese a century old, the Synod only fifteen. What does a fifteen-year-old stripling look for but fun, the fun of adventure, of blazing trails toward unlimited horizons.\n\n\u2014D.N.M.\n\nEditor's Note.\n\nThe writer of this article, the Rev. David Mitchell was ordained in July 1944 at St. Thomas' Church, Moose Factory, leave immediately for his home for Rupert's House Mission Band where he worked for four years.\n\nNow Rector of St. Paul's, South Porcupine, this was the first Synod he has been able to attend.\n\nMr. Mitchell is now one of the associate Editors of The Northland.\n\nOUR SUMMER STAFF\n\nThe following is the list of University Students working in the Diocese for the summer months, with their appointments.\n\nEight are at Indian Mission Schools and the last two are doing Parochial Work.\n\n| Name          | Address                          | Post         |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Phillip Belyea| P.O.

A. Watton, B.A.\n\nIt is only a writer's privilege to coin words and phrases, yet I feel sure that such a privilege should be extended to include clergymen. There are no words available, either ecclesiastical or common, that can describe the event of Easter and Confirmation when they fall on the same day. Such an event happened to us at St. Peter's, Kirkland Lake, this year. For the confirmation words would fail to express the import of such a day\u2014the beautiful joyous Easter messages in lesson and song, culminating in the solemn, moving, hopeful rite of Confirmation in the evening.\n\nFor the Bishop and clergyman such an event is both mystical, joyous\u2014and confusing.\n\nAs the Easter sun rises out of the East it lays its fingers of light on the already moving celebrant. As it climbs higher and higher as the day progresses, so also there arises the crescendo of worship and service. Then as the softer glow of evening gives eerie light, the long line of \"brides and ordinands\" process before their Bishop to receive that ancient historical rite\u2014the laying on of hands.\n\nLong after the sun has gone to rest, still they stand as they receive and congratulate those who have so recently \"come of age\" in the Church of God.\n\nTwo days later, the world seems to have slowed down to a more or less normal pace and once again the Bishop and the Rector can look out with more or less normal vision. And they see (as they have felt in even the most confusing moments) that it was all infinitely worthwhile. That here again the hand of God has been stretched out to guide and strengthen and sustain all who will come to Him.\n\nTHE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICK\n\nIn the days of Victor Hugo the Church was living in a Golden Age. She enjoyed the greatest possible power and authority\u2014the world beat a pathway to her door. It was only natural that the visible head of that Church, the Bishop, should enjoy the greatest benediction of material possession.\n\nNothing was contained in his palace but material of the very best\u2014aptly personified by solid gold or silver candlesticks. 'Tis a far cry from those days to our present generation. Little could Victor Hugo visualize a Bishop skimming over the snow on clumsy instruments made from the internal organs of a cat. Nor could he possibly foresee the dawn of an elder dark as the modern version of the four poster.\n\nBut least of all could he have foretold the replacement of the golden candlesticks, by its counterpart in flesh and blood.\n\nOf all the prized possessions, I'm quite sure that ye olde Bishop held his candlestick as the most necessary, as it lighted his way in the dark, as it watched with him in his lonely vigils and drove away the shadows from a shadowy world.\n\nSo also today, while the vulgar display of wealth would be hard to locate in a Bishop's life, the candlestick is still there, lighting his way in the dark, giving light and hope and protection along a rough and ofttimes lonely trail. We have changed its name to suit its nature\u2014we call it a Bishop's Wife.\n\nJ. A.

Can you do something to make the joy of Easter real to them? We have a great Church and it is set in a great field of opportunity in this country\u2014the New North. We must pray for minds and hearts big enough and strength great enough to meet it. Do not let sectionalism narrow us, or littleness weaken us. Our vision must be large enough so that in a small way we can build the Kingdom of God. We have known enough of hatred which makes one man a foreigner but in Christ there is no East or West, North or South, so let us make a start of trying His way.\n\nOur late Primate, Archbishop Owen, used the following words while addressing the Synod at Niagara in 1927. \"We have a great work to do, and a great work can be done only in a great way, and by men who, in humility and faith, have seen a great vision.\" A vision is not enough unless we are prepared to live that vision.\n\nCome yourselves to the Easter Services of your Church and bring a New Canadian.\n\nYour friend and Rector,\n\nNorman D. Knox.\n\nThe Response\n\nThe words of this hymn provided the inspiration for our Easter Services. The local English language newspaper \"The Star\", published in Val d'Or, devoted a column to describe the theme of our Easter Pastoral Letter which appealed to the congregation to welcome the New Canadians. The response was wonderful and our churches were filled with people from every walk of life and every part of Europe.\n\nIn the churches we had Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, Germans, French, English, Irish and Scotch. The old European scarf wound over the head and the dainty flowered Easter bonnet both seemed to be quite natural. Even the quiet undertone of familiar prayers in the various Slavic tongues did not distract us from our central act of worship.\n\nChrist is Risen\u2014He is risen indeed.\n\nWe thought of the pilgrims in the streets of Jerusalem\u2014of that great congregation in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and churches in England and in England, and we prayed that the vision of a Fellowship of the Nations under Christ might be known to them.\n\nFor some of our foreign born people it was their first time to attend any Service in English. They were shy and a bit hesitant at first, but after awhile their faces began to reveal a sense of joy and tears wet the faces of some as they left the building.\n\nOne New Canadian (a D.P.) hesitated for a moment as though to say something before leaving. He struggled with limited English to express what it meant to him. There was an embarrassed silence and then I suggested \"Christ is risen.\"\n\nImmediately his face flooded with a radiant smile and the reply came,\n\n\"He is risen indeed.\"\nHOW THE NORTH GROWS\n\nThe Field Secretary On The Wing\n\nBy H. G. Watts, D.D.\n\nThirty-five years ago the Missionary Society published an attractive little twelve-page pamphlet entitled \"Moosonee,\" showing that although the Diocese had then been formed for more than forty years, the total population for the whole 600,000 square miles was 18,500 White, 6,000 Indians, and 1,000 Eskimos. Approximately two-thirds of the total population were members of the Church of England. Almost the entire pamphlet is taken up with the discussion of the work among Indian and Eskimo, with very little mention of White work.\n\nContinuous changes have been taking place since then, but the last five years have undoubtedly shown unusual development in the life of our Church in this area. No longer can we claim two-thirds of much expanded population as the advance which has taken place in our Church life as a whole is conspicuously inspiring. It is now six years since I visited the Diocese myself for the first time, but I found in my recent visit that in that brief interval every place where I went there was a real growth in all sides of Church activity. I was only able to spend fifteen days in the Diocese and that time was given entirely to visiting the ten parishes.\n\nThere are many things about which I might write which pleased me to see\u2014the splendid new St. Peter's Church at Kirkland Lake with its so suitable and striking reredos; the new Rectory at Rouyn; the changes that have been made in the Pre-Cathedral at Timmins; the new Church at Cochrane; the spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm which was typified by the decision to erect a new church at Noranda; the friendliness and hospitality of the younger clergy and older clergy alike; the extraordinary devotion to duty of some of the older clergy who have been giving so many years of service in isolation; the indefatigable energy of the lovable Bishop, and Mrs. Renouf, with all her enthusiasm for the way that she has adopted the work. Each or any one of these would have made an interesting article.\n\nBut it's difficult for me to write about what I found because on looking back over the recent copies of the \"Northland\" I find that already special articles have been written upon most of the developments. There was one phase of the work however, which was most interesting and engaging which I have not seen a great deal in the \"Northland.\" This is the Japanese-Canadian settlement at Opasatika. The settlement there has been organized by the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company which has generously provided a school for the children under the capable principalship of Miss Ide, a Japanese-Canadian, and has also thrown open the doors of one of W. A. missionaries Miss Foster, as her assistant. The Rev. G. R. Stanley of Kapuskasing kindly arranged for me to go there and made very careful plans. Early in the evening upon which we were to pay our visit, the Spruce Falls Movie Projector truck arrived at the Rectory with all the necessary equipment, including an electric generator as there is no electric power at the Japanese settlement. The night was quite cold enough, but not so cold as it had been just before, and the snow was still falling heavily and I found myself throughout most of the twenty-five miles of snow-covered roads with the visit that he had paid a week previously. How that at that time the truck had broken down in the course of the journey leaving them stranded some distance from any building and that how his fellow-passenger had suffered seven frost-bites to legs and feet as a result of the delay.\n\nThe settlement is on a little side road, one and one-half miles from the main road. We were able to get through with the truck as far as the end of the settlement. It was too dark to see faces, but cheerful voices welcomed us and busy hands quickly helped us unload as we picked our way round the accumulated snow. From there our equipment had to be pulled to the school house at the far end of the settlement on sledges.\n\nI have visited many places but never have I received a more enthusiastic welcome.\n\nThe little lamp-lighted school house was packed with about thirty-five children and their mothers. There were only two or three men as the others were away at work in the bush. The walls of the school had been decorated with thirty-five posters of welcome, each drawn by one of the school children. They knew Dr. Watts was coming and excitedly sought of them thought he could make me believe they had depicted him with a little black bag. Without exception everyone of the posters was quite cleverly done and they were given to me at the close of the evening. Several of the posters quite artistically portrayed the arrangement of the houses of the settlement and helped me to picture what it was impossible for me to see in the dark.\n\nUnfortunately, everything didn't work out just as we had hoped. The talkie, being the collecting equipment either on the truck or on one of the sledges, was the \"talkie\" part out of commissions. However, I was able to show one film and be the \"talkie\" myself. The children were intrigued to discover someone who could speak to them in the language which they hear in their homes, but while they understood Japanese, they were all well-acquainted with English. I am not sure that Mr. Stanley and our truck...\ndriver appreciated the latter part of the evening quite as much as I did. A delicious meal was served, but Japanese food is an acquired taste. Following the meal, I was presented with an envelope containing money which was to be sent as a gift to the M.S.C.C.'s Kindergarten Training School at Nagoya in Japan. It was one of the largest collections taken throughout the whole of my visit and a great surprise to me. The journey back to Kapuskasing, after reloading the stuff onto sleighs and then onto the truck, was quite a cold one, but as the three of us sat crowded in the cabin of the truck the enthusiasm of the meeting dispelled the chagrin which our driver and movie operator had felt on account of the first time that his projecting equipment had ever failed him.\n\nAnd so now in the Diocese of Moosonee there is another enterprise, that for the Japanese-Canadians. I am confident that it will not be long before the work will bring its reward in a number of baptisms both among the children and the adults, and will play a real part in forming the families into the life of our country of which they too are full citizens.\n\nIn the preface of \"The Canadian Japanese and World War II,\" recent book of Professor F. E. LaViolette of McGill University, it has been pointed out how important it is \"That those Canadians of other races who in years to come meet their fellow-citizens of Japanese race, should know what it has meant to be for five years a displaced person in your own land. And it is important that the Canadians to whom goes the word 'Democracy' may rise should determine what it means to them.\" It is equally important for us to know just what is happening to the Canadian-Japanese as they resettle in new areas to start all over again in their share in the life of our country.

We traversed the twelve miles to the mouth of the Moose River by midnight, circumvented the shoreline of Hannah Bay, having to stay within the tide mark, and reached the midway point between East Point and Connaught Point opposite Stag Island, the peninsula between Hannah Bay and Rupert's Bay at daylight. Here we made a pot of coffee and enjoyed a can of heated soup, refilled our gas tank with a spare ten-gallon drum of gasoline and set out across the channel to the leeward coast of Stag Island. This was quite an experience.\n\nYou may recall this stretch. There is, I believe, a very fast current here in open water, and during the great storms in the fall of the year, when the ice is first making, the sea runs between the currents, and storms pile the ice up into huge masses with the cakes tumbling whichever way. Some of these masses are as big as your house and all seas from that down to that of the snowmobile. Valleys anywhere from four to ten feet deep between the windrows, with sharp crests formed from cakes of ice four to six inches thick, lying at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal, make most treacherous travelling. We had to wind our way over a zig-zag course for about eight miles of this stuff, taking nearly two hours to make the crossing.\n\nWe arrived at the mouth of Bonswain Bay at the foot of Sherrick Mountain at about seven A.M. There we had breakfast of bacon, a can of spaghetti and bread soaked in the bacon fat, washed down with steaming mugs of coffee. Does this bring back recollections and make your mouth water?\n\nAfter breakfast, we had pretty good travelling from point to point and island to island up the East Coast to East Main, arriving there at twelve-twenty noon.\n\nMr. Iserhoff was quite ill and I found my diagnosis correct. He has an excellent heart and this has stood him in good stead. With large doses of penicillin administered then and again the following day and a preparation that requires three or twenty-four hours' action, he is much improved when we left to return on April 10th. The H. B. C. Manager at this Post was instructed in the use of giving further penicillin treatments and the most recent word received is that his condition is much improved. I have every hope for complete recovery now, although I never knew just what to expect in such serious conditions as this, in a man of his age. He is a very fine old gentleman and everyone in this area is concerned. He is loved and respected by all.\n\nWe made an uneventful return trip, leaving East Main about ten a.m. and arriving back to Moose Factory about nine-thirty p.m. We covered 287 miles on the round trip. This is a new mode of travel and certainly a great improvement on horseback. There is also an advantage over the aeroplane, in that we can travel at night, through ordinary storms and under a low ceiling, all of which make it impossible for plane travel.\n\nThe letter you enclosed from Mrs. Wallbridge of Belleville, concerning the surgical instruments, was certainly a most kind gesture on her part and I appreciate it very much. It was good of you also to have my case in mind when you knew of the loss I sustained in the fire which destroyed the offices and the hospital and Nursing Station. The instruments can be used to great advantage in treating the Indians under my care. I shall write to her immediately and explain things, requesting her to forward them to me. Thank you kindly for this.\n\nMiss Iona Andrew of Fort Harrison (still in her east) is now assisting me in the office here.\n\nWith very best personal regards to Mrs. Renison and yourself.\nA LETTER\nfrom\nDr. B. H. HARPER\nMoose Factory,\nOntario\n\nTHE SNOWMOBILE REPLACES THE HORSE AND BUGGY\n\nMy Dear Lord Bishop:\n\nThe notoriety suffered by yours truly relating to the kidnapping of Indian patients, so called \"Mercy Flights\" and other silly things, that are all in the day's work on this job, may have made me a \"Legendary Figure,\" as you remarked, but I'm afraid I have not earned many of the nicer things reported.\n\nI am very happy in my new work and at the risk of being inconsistent with reference to the last paragraph, I feel that I am doing a more worth-while job in my profession than I have ever done before.\n\nOn the evening of Friday, April 8th, having received word by radio, on the two days previous, that your Reverend Sam Iserhoff at East Main had all the symptoms of a post-influenza pneumonia, my man, Jimmie Gunner, and a clerk of the Post Company, started from this Post with our snowmobile in bright moonlight at ten P.M. (Of course I went along too.)\n\nThe going was pretty good on the frozen snow except where we had to cross the mouth of several creeks and run into bad slush. We traversed the twelve miles to the mouth of the Moose River by midnight, circumvented the shoreline of Hannah Bay, having to stay within the tide mark, and came to the midway point between East Point and Comfort Point opposite Stag Island on the peninsula between Hannah Bay and Rupert's Bay at daybreak. Here we made a pot of coffee and enjoyed a can of heated soup, refilled our gas tank with a spare ten-gallon drum of gasoline and set out across the channel to the leeward coast of Stag Island. This was quite an experience.\n\nYou may recall this stretch.

Thank you kindly for this.\n\nMiss Iona Andrew of Fort Harrison (still in her cast) is now assisting me in the office here.\n\nWith very best personal regards to Mrs. Renison and yourself.\n\nPage 12\nREPORT OF THE ARCHDEACON OF JAMES BAY\n\nMy Lord and Members of the Synod:\n\nIn presenting my first report as Archdeacon of James Bay, may I say I am deeply conscious of the great honour, and responsibility placed upon my shoulders, and ask for your prayers that I might measure up to the challenge presented.\n\nI think it is safe to say, without appearing to be boasting, that we are beginning to get on our feet.\n\nBy far the greatest item in this report is the new Government Hospital now being built on Moose Island.\n\nThe official capacity of the hospital is 250 beds. It will serve not only it its own immediate needs from all over James Bay and northern Quebec, and even reaching into the Diocese of Keewatin. What a fertile field. The hospital will also contain two chapels of equal size. Daily services will have to be said, letters written for the patients and staff, and many other services to be rendered. If we can't do these things we are not justified in doing so. An additional Priest for Moose Island is a \"must.\" This also brings up the question of living quarters, etc.\n\nIn the last year there has been some staff changes. Rev. David Mitchell left Rupert's House to become Rector of South Porcupine; Rev. M. Donaldson has been transferred from Albany Mission to Rupert's House. Mr. Cyril Elliott has been appointed missionary-in-charge at Albany. The Ojibway Missions were placed under the Rev. Mr. Vollrick who however, was released by the Bishop this spring for work in Huron Diocese. And the Rev. Eric DePendleton is to be in charge in the Ojibway Missions Area.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of men in these points I would like to stress a very important fact. In our diocese we need more and closer contact between the men in these sparsely settled areas and the clergy and laity in the denser populated areas. You may not think it, but these men can get lonely. A letter, a magazine would help to build a comrade-ship that we all need, so much. We are not a divided Church. This is a great opportunity for our Laymen's Associations and others, and I would be happy to discuss plans with anyone interested.\n\nAt this point I would like to mention a special job of work being done by Rev. E. Louttit of Old Factory and Rev. Sam Schurhoff of Eastmain. They are developing a Primer for the speaking of Cree based on a similar system used by the Government in teaching English to European Immigrants to Canada. This will be of great assistance to summer students and others in their work.\n\nOn the material side work has progressed satisfactorily. Rupert's House has a fine new church. I wish to thank Rev. David Mitchell for his fine work there. It made a grand finale to his ministrations on the Bay.\n\nRepairs are being made on a cottage at Collins to enable a summer student to conduct a day-school and take services at that very vital spot.\n\nThe church at Wabequa has now the needed doors and windows, thanks to the generosity of Mrs. Emmet, the wife of Archdeacon Emmet of Orillia, who asked that her Life Membership fee be placed there; and to the generosity of the W.A. of the Diocese of Rupert's Land, who at their annual meeting last February took up a collection for the suspended work of Green's Harbour Church, Rupert's Land, and the proceeds were donated to the same church. St. Matthew's W. A. Winnipeg, arising from this same meeting, have undertaken to equip our mission house at Lansdowne House on Lake Attawapiscat.\n\nWe cannot speak too highly of the good works of the W. A. both on a Dominion and Diocesan scale in their efforts and kindness to our missionaries, and their missions.\n\nThe Rectory at Moose Island has been improved considerably, and the old day school is being changed into a parish hall.\n\nOld Factory Church needs a tower and outside covering. This is a memorial church and though the interior completed last year is excellent, the exterior leaves much to be desired. There is surplus of lumber at Rupert's which will take care of the tower, and money will be needed to cover the outside with suitable material.\n\nAt Albany the mission house needs a general overhaul, windows reset, roof renewed, etc., and the church painted. This is a very important spot, as the Church of Rome have an excellent set-up with buildings in fine shape, and we have a perpetual comparison.\n\nAs you all know, the Bishop has started a fund in Toronto for construction of a new church at Moose Cree. There is no question of the need, as the present building, once the day school used by the Rev. Fred Mark, has seen better days.\n\nThe last portion of my report deals with Anniversaries. This year the Diocese of Rupert's Land celebrates its centenary. Something should be done by us to recognize this important event, as we are a child of Rupert's Land, and it was the seat of our first authority.\n\nSecondly in 1951 St. Thomas Moose Factory will be 100 years old. A fund is underway to restore the church, and make improvements. But something from the Diocese should be done to mark this occasion, both from the point of assisting the restoration, and a suitable celebration.\n\nWe have entered into the second phase of the plan, so well conceived and put into force by our Bishop. The initial thrill of success is now behind us. We have now the difficult yet perhaps less spectacular job of maintaining \"the pace set.\" There is no idea of slackening off by others, we have tacked our colours to the mast, we must go on in the words of St. Paul, \"Let us run with patience the race that is set before us.\"\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nNeville Clarke.\nMOOSONEE MAIL BAG\n\nSt. Andrew's Rectory,\nBoullanville, Quebec.\n\n\"I would also like to take this opportunity to tell you how much I enjoyed the last edition of the 'Northland.' The Irish scenes were all very familiar to me and made me feel very homesick. In my early days we lived in Dungladee and father still has property there\u2014the remainder of my years in Ireland were spent in Bangor, only six miles away. I attended the Portree Church, the last time being in 1839 before I returned to Canada after spending a year in London and the Continent.\n\nI had two very acceptable boxes of clothing and other useful articles from Mrs. McMaster of the Moosonee Group of Grace Church, Toronto.

It was that fearful cold day in February, 10 below zero and snowing. 'What ARE YOU doing in that freezing weather?' she said, 'Gardening.'\"\n\nI had put \"The Northland\" to bed, and saying joyfully, \"Well, that job is done for three months,\" took Chimo and Reggie and Judy out for a hike, and then fell by the wayside, and planned all the changes I wanted to make in our five acres.\n\nBishopstope kennels flourished; Reggie sired twelve. His family multiplied at the Hoyle Mine (since closed). We took him, Michael, the pick of the litter, and Judy, young and alluring, but showing the lesser breed of her mother.\n\nMichael was hit by no less a personage than the Provincial Police car as it sped along the Porcupine Highway. The law allows a speed of 59 miles an hour in front of Bishopstope's drive. So Michael followed his predecessor, Michael 1st, our Iris Setter.\n\nJudy had a comparatively brief reign. Chimo ignored her. Reggie was the adoring father and boy friend.\n\nOne day, the little five-year-old girl who delivers us eggs every week, from further along the highway, said gravely to the Bishop:\n\n\"Judy was naughty.\"\n\n\"What did Judy do?\" said my husband.\n\n\"She bit one of our chickens in the neck, and made it bleed.\"\n\n\"Did you punish Judy?\" said the Bishop.\n\n\"No, she ran away.\"\n\nThe Bishop then produced the egg money and said,\n\n\"There is ten cents extra; five cents for you and please give the HEN the other five.\"\n\nWithout a smile the child said:\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n(Enquiries revealed that the HEN was no worse.)\n\nThree weeks later, we returned from one of the Bishop's periodical trips. Judy, Chimo and Reggie welcomed us joyfully, and also three other friends of Judy's.\n\nThen Judy, spring fever and a love of snow proving too much for her, paid another visit to the HEN house, disposed of the egg, and carried it to our house and deposited it at our door. Having paid for this in full, and requested that THEIR dog, a collie, be kept from our grounds, if possible, and THEIR wire fence fixed, where it was sprung, we kept Judy at home.\n\nThree days later Judy leapt our enclosure. Her collie friend was sitting outside making insulting remarks about helpless females\u2014the two raced down the highway to the HEN house, and the door having been left open for a few minutes, Judy revenged herself for her confinement, to the tune of ten.\n\nJudy is now banished to the counterpart of Siberia, and Reggie is disconsolate. The collie stays at home.\n\nPre-Easter Confirmations\u2014where we were touched by a strong sense of the need caused by the growth in these places\u2014Trinity College School, Port Hope; Hearst; Calabogie; Mattice and Kapuskasing.\n\nA 260-mile drive to Kirkland Lake\u2014Easter Day there. The Bishop celebrated at one of the early Services, while Canon W. J. went to another Mission.\n\nThe 11 a.m. Service at St. Paul's, Virginiatown, (the first in its history), when the little church was packed to the doors and many stood all through the Service. The Bishop's wife acted as solo singer in a copy of psalm while the parents of the occupants stood up to make their Communion. Many new Canadians attended this Service. We shared a Prayer Book with one but when it came to the hymns we each sang our own version and it was equally pleasing to our Father.\n\nConfirmation in the evening at St. Peter's when a class of 31 were presented. Three of these came from Swastika.\n\nThis Service was memorable, as this was the first Easter in the new St. Peter's. \"We are compassed around by so great a cloud of witnesses,\" said the Bishop,\u2014let us run the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith.\"\n\nAfterwards downstairs in the Parish Hall, when the Confirmation certificates were presented, I heard someone say, \"Mrs. Renison is wearing a veil.\"\n\n\"She has to. Her hair is terrific.\"\n\nSatan whispered to me in Holy Week. \"Why not be beautiful for Easter?\"\n\nI went to the newest beautician. I dozed, and emerged, shorn, bleached and curled, looking like Amelia Earhart with her curly wind-blown mop, but Amelia was in her twenties!\n\nAnd Then Came Easter.\nCONGRATULATIONS TO\n\nThe Hon.

Watton\n\nJust one short year ago it was the duty and privilege of \"The Northland\" to introduce to its readers the \"five smooth stones\" as they were ordained into the deaconate of the Church of God; missiles from the hand of God. Today they have received their full direction, for today they have entered upon the priesthood of the Church.\n\nThere they stand\u2014four now\u2014one having been redirected physically as well as spiritually\u2014and before their father-in-God make these heart-searchings promises, that to hear alone is a form of consecration for the hearer. As they kneel, one feels that the many hands of the priests laid upon their heads, are but the symbol of the manifold gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out in consecration. Here is one hand, calloused and gnarled by the effort of honest physical toil\u2014and the fruit of the Spirit is love and joy. This hand is lined and not too firm and upon the head of the candidate is laid\u2014and the fruit of the Spirit is long-suffering and gentleness.\n\nThere is a hand\u2014a perfect poem in symmetry, with long fingers, finely tapered\u2014and the fruit of the Spirit is goodness. The dark firm hand of the native Canadian is there, and the fruit of the Spirit is faith.\n\nThen the hand that is the functional hand\u2014there are many of these\u2014so may they have in abundance the fruit of the Spirit which is meekness and temperance.\n\nAnd over and above them all through the lips of the Archbishop of Quebec comes the loving command of God\u2014\"Watch and pray\", \"watch and pray\".\n\nThere is only one thing lacking\u2014and one lack that never can be filled\u2014it is that all people should witness the deep religious depths of this Service. That they might see the laymen take their first step in the coming of ordination, that they might see a few moments later the final step of self-consecration as four are made priests\u2014that they might see in the hands laid upon their heads the fulfillment of that self-consecration in the lives of others and hear the challenge of love\u2014\"Watch and pray\".\n\nLeft to right: Rev.

Hogan,\nTottenham, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hogan:\n\nWe have received your letter of May 9 applying for a position as teacher in one of our seasonal schools during the summer of 1950.\n\nIt is noted that you hold a First Class Teaching Certificate and have had two years of teaching experience. We have only one vacancy left, and it is at the Hanaskin Indian Day School in the Sioux Lookout area. This is in Northern Ontario and has to be reached by plane.\n\nIf you are interested in this position, please complete the attached standard application form and return it to this office. We might add that this position has been offered to other university students also.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel Neary:\n\nSeasonal School Teachers\n\n1. Miss Bell phoned regarding the appointing of teachers to our Indian Seasonal Schools.\n\n2. She has decided to place the names of the teachers on the salary list effective the date we mention in our memorandum and remove all names effective September 1, 1950. This will avoid overpayment of salary.\n\n3. If any teacher continues in a seasonal school after September 1, 1950, she would like us to send another memo advising of the closing date.\n\n4. I presume this could be done when we receive the notification from each teacher.\n\n5. Do you approve the plan she has in mind?\n\nMiss Bell\n\n29-5-50\n\nC.M.\n31 Kerdale Avenue,\nToronto, Ontario,\nJuly 24th, 1950.\n\nMr. B. Neary,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am writing this letter to inquire into the possibilities and qualifications required to teach Indians during the summer months for the summer of 1951.\n\nI am a student at Queen's University, Kingston, in third year honour economics and politics. My course is such that in my fourth year I could graduate with a general honours degree. Several of my friends have been employed by your department in the above mentioned capacity and they have enjoyed it very much, and they have also appreciated the experience in teaching.\n\nI am interested in education and would welcome such an opportunity if it were feasible. I would appreciate any information you could send me along with an estimate of the possibility for employment next summer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Miss) Myrtle Morrison.\nJuly 27, 1950.\n\nMiss Myrtle Morrison,\n31 Kersdale Avenue,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Morrison:\n\nI have answered your letter of July 24 and sincerely appreciate your interest in one of our Indian summer schools.\n\nHowever, I feel that I must be fair in explaining to you now that we only appoint married women who accompany their husbands to such schools.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, these seasonal schools are in very isolated parts of Northern Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba and we would be most reluctant to send in a single woman. If you have a friend of similar interest, it is possible there might be a vacancy for the two of you. However, the married couples who have been appointed to these two-room schools this summer have indicated that they wish to return next summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 5th, 1951.\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have been hoping that there might be some reason to take me up to Ottawa, but the excuse has not appeared. I hope our panel will reconvene, although I suppose everyone is so busy that it is difficult to find time for anything that is not immediately vital.\n\nAlthough this may be too early, I am writing to ask about temporary summer teaching jobs. Among those who would be interested this year is a particularly able and well-balanced young woman whose ambition is to go into Ethnology and who wishes accordingly to get in touch with people in process of adjustment as soon as possible. The girl in question, Miss Joan Presant, was second in a class of over a hundred in her first year last year, and has gone into Anthropology which is entered at the second year level. Miss Presant had intended to go into Anthropology from her high school days and succeeded in working her way into a number of archaeological expeditions while she was still in high school. I took her on two and have found her an extremely co-operative, able and level-headed person. Year before last she was accepted for work on a joint expedition of the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington, where she was, I think, both the only girl and the only non-graduate student. She made good, although she was not even an undergraduate at the time.\n\nFrankly, I have a great deal of confidence in Miss Presant both as a student and, which is much more important, as a level-headed young woman able to get along with people under diverse conditions. If it were ever possible to take a woman on to your temporary jobs you would never have a better bet than Miss Presant.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. F. McIlwraith.\n\nTFM/EML.\nJanuary 10, 1951\n\nDr. T.F. McIlwraith,\nDepartment of Anthropology,\nUniversity of Toronto,\nToronto 5, Ont.,\n\nDear Dr. McIlwraith:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 5th concerning some teaching jobs.\n\nI regret to advise you that I will be leaving the Department at the end of this month. I have received a most attractive offer to become Managing Director of Thomas Nelson and Sons Limited - and could not refuse in fairness to my wife and family.\n\nHowever, I am pleased to forward to you several application forms which can be used by Miss Presant and others of your students who might be interested in teaching in Indian seasonal schools during the coming summer.\n\nI am sorry to leave this work as there remains so much to be done but I have no doubt that many of our activities will continue under capable management.\n\nWith kind regards for all your help in the past.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nDIOCESE OF MOOSONEE\n\nRT. REV. ROBERT J. RENISON, M.A., D.D.\nBISHOP\nTELEPHONE-TIMMINS 783 W\nTELEGRAFS - RENISON, TIMMINS\n\nJan. 22, 1951\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI was very sorry to have missed you when I went to Ottawa at Christmas time. I could not choose the date for they wanted me to broadcast for C.B.C. on Christmas Eve. As a matter of fact, I spoke about our Northern district.\n\nThe work that we have been able to do through you in the last few years has evidently made an impression, and I notice that you have been writing some of the men whom we employed last year. I would be very glad indeed to know the men in whom you are interested, especially those who are available. I have several applications from men already, but there is no doubt that a man can be very much more valuable when he has been on the spot before.\n\nI was just now thinking or writing to some men next summer, but somehow I wondered whether the shadow of war would have anything to do with your plans for next summer. I hope not. However, before I write to anyone, I would like to have your opinion or the chances for continuing or expanding our work this year.\n\nI am going to Toronto for a couple of weeks about Feb. 7th, and I thought that I might be able to telephone you while I am there, or if you thought it was worth while I might be able to come down to Ottawa.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison\nBishop of Moosonee\nJanuary 25, 1951.\n\nThe Right Reverend R.J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosejaw,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have received acknowledgment your letter of January 22 and I was among those who listened to your CBC broadcast on Christmas Eve. In fact my wife and I were both very impressed and I wish to congratulate you on the fine presentation.\n\nI would be pleased to have you contact the men who were in the field with us last summer and hope particularly that Mr. Neikle and his wife can return to Mistassini. If not, then I have a young man who taught at Pekangakum two years ago and I am going to have him write you about Mistassini. I feel that Mr. and Mrs. Law did good work also at Wawaseipi and believe they might be interested again this year. I have not heard anything derogatory about the teachers for Collins, Lansdowne House, Camburgh and Fort Hope. We had good reports on Mr. Martinson at Lac Seul and on Belyea at Lansdowne House.\n\nAs you are aware by now, I will not be with the Department after the first of February and regret sincerely that I will be unable to meet you when you come through Ottawa. However, I do hope you will drop in to see me at my new headquarters, Thomas Nelson & Sons, 91 Wellington St. West, Toronto (3 or 4 minutes from the Union Station).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 27, 1951.\n\nThe Right Reverend R.J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Mooseme,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 24. It is quite true that I will be leaving the Indian Service on January 31 next.\n\nWith regard to summer school teachers, I wrote to you yesterday concerning this matter and I now attach a letter which I have received from Jamason Bond who, I believe, would fit in at either Waswanipi or Mistassini. Would you please reply to Mr. Phelan, returning Bond's letter with your answer.\n\nI am writing Mr. Bond, telling him that he can expect to hear from you. I do hope that I will see you in Toronto as we are close to the Union Station and very easy of access. The address is:\n\nThomas Nelson & Sons,\n91 Wellington Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Bernard Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI had a telephone message last night from Mr. H.T. Jamieson, a great friend of mine who happens to be in Ottawa. He told me that he had called upon you, which I had asked him to do. I was sorry that my trip to Ottawa during the Christmas holidays was so short that I could not get in touch with you.\n\nMr. Jamieson told me one thing which I may have misunderstood; it sounded rather alarming. He said that you were coming to Toronto. If that should be true, it will be a great blow to the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have been anxious about next year in connection with our Indian Schools, and I was very much relieved to hear that the plans which we have been able to carry out during the last few years can continue next summer. Your co-operation with the plan of hiring qualified teachers has borne fruit. I have several requests from students and University graduates for next year, but I have kept my list from last year and I am now going to write to these young men and find out how many will be able to come back next summer. There is no doubt that most of them are much more useful the second year than the first. If you do not mind, I will make a survey and send you a list as soon as possible for your consideration.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert Renison\nBishop of Moosonee\n### 1950 - Teachers and Supplies for Seasonal Schools\n\n| Schools by Agencies | 1949 Teacher | 1949 Salary | Supplies | 1950 Teacher | 1950 Salary |\n|---------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Abitibi Agency**  |              |             |          |              |             |\n| Manouan             | Ursule Cordelain | $155       | Lucille Francoeur | $130       | Miss U.

They have volunteered to return to Wesmenip for the summer. There is a residence there as well as a school, and I am sure they will be welcomed by the 300 Indians at this post. They may be a little late in reaching their post but they will be worth waiting for.\n\n7. Mr. Frank Jackman Bishop's University, Lennoxville, P.Q. Mr. Jackman was a great success in opening the new school at Naskapi in hundreds of miles of wilderness in the highlands of Quebec. He has offered to return this year, where I hope he will not only be a successful teacher but will begin to build a permanent school. The mission work has been carried on in a tent for several years but with a small grant I think the Indians would be willing to build a school.\nList of Prospects 1951 - contd.\n\n8. Mr. Thomas H. Masson, is a graduate of an American university who is now studying in Huron College, London. He seems a very capable and attractive personality. He served in the last war and is about 29 years of age. He is married to a girl who is a graduate in Physiotherapy and I believe has all-round nursing experience. I would suggest sending him to Colline for the summer as he would rather be on the railroad line where he could be in touch with his wife. As an alternative, unless we can find someone better qualified, I thought that this young man and his wife might make an admirable team for the big school in Mississini. I consider that Mississini is the most important of all our summer missions.\n\n9. Mrs. Thomas Masson? Address - Huron College, London, Ont.\n\n10. Malcolm Bruce Black Box 955, Lennoxville, P.E.

Both are interested in taking Social Work studies, in the Fall of 1952. Previous to this they would like to spend a year teaching in some remote Eskimo or Indian Reservation. Actually, they do not care where they teach provided the remuneration would be adequate to enable them to resume their College studies in 1952.\n\nThese boys have worked their way along the hard path and we feel that they would do a good job. Any further references necessary may be obtained from Rev. Dr. J.P.E.O'Henley, St. Dunstan's University, Charlottetown.\n\nNo doubt Father John MacDonald, Director of Catholic Family Service in Ottawa, has brought this matter to your attention, if not you might contact him for any help as regards the wants of the above mention students.\n\nWe thank you for your kind interest and any assistance you can give in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\n1-1-72\nPhilip Phelan Esq\nSuperintendent of Education (Indian Affairs)\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI wish to thank you for the copies you have sent me or the letters to university students in the diocese of Moosonee, to whom you have offered the appointment as teacher this summer. As Col. Neary knew many of these men before, I asked him to be so kind as to recommend them to you.\n\nI am enclosing a list of appointments. There are eleven names. Besides these when I was in Toronto last week two young married students from Trinity College, Toronto asked me for an opportunity to teach. One of them has a wife who is a graduate Nurse and I suggest that they communicate with you as to the possibility of sending the man to Moose Factory to act as teacher for the summer and his wife to the new hospital, where nurses I know are badly needed.\n\nOnly yesterday I received copies of three letters which you have written to Stewart Aldgate, Huron College; William Baldwin, Wickliffe College; and Malcombe Bruce Black, at Lennoxville. These were men whom I recommended generally, but you have recommended them to Trout Lake, Lac Seul and Deer Lake.\n\nThese three schools are in the Diocese of Keewatin.\nunder the jurisdiction of Bishop Lofthouse. I have therefore sent him these three names and asking him to communicate with you. I wish to thank you for your courtesy and cooperation.

R.J.Renison, Bishop Of Moosonee, whose name I submit as reference, to write to you concerning Summer Employment in the Moosonee District.\n\nI am twenty-eight years of age. I received my elementary and secondary education in Aurora, Ontario. I served with the Canadian Army in Canada from November 1943 to May 1946. Upon discharge I entered the Rehabilitation School in Toronto where I completed my Senior Matriculation. I attended the University of Toronto and received my Bachelor of Arts degree in June, 1949. After graduation, I enrolled in the Trinity College Divinity School, where I am now completing my second year. During this time I have taught Sunday School and have had two courses in Christian educational methods at Trinity College.\n\nConcerning other work, I have always been in an office. This includes about two years with the T.Eaton Company, and the past three summers with the Provincial Government of Ontario. While with the latter I worked one summer for the Mothers' Allowance Commission and two summers with the Ontario Public Trustee.\n\nI shall be available for work from May 1st.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n(Russell A.Sayer)\nApril 17, 1951.\n\nMr. Hugh Stiff,\nTrinity College,\nToronto, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your application form dated April 12th and presume that you are willing to accept the position at Moose Factory Indian Bay School for the summer of 1951. Would you please confirm this fact immediately?\n\nPlease find attached T.-1 Income Tax forms which you should complete in duplicate and return in the near future. Also attached is reporting on non-school school opening and closing date form. You will note that Letter I must be received before your first salary cheque is issued and Letter 2 must be received before you are sent your final pay cheque.\n\nAs indicated in our letter of April 10, your salary would be at the rate of $175.00 teaching month commencing on the date you report for duty.\n\nIf you have not already done so we recommend that you write immediately to Mr. J.E.

I wonder if he could be transferred to Namiska to take Mr. Jackman's place. By the way, I sent your letters about the students or that district to Bishop Lotthouse at Kenora, as it is in his jurisdiction. I have one further favour to ask you. Mr. Donald McLeod whom you appointed to Fort Hope would like to remain near Moose Factory this summer. He is doing strictly clerical work there, and he should remain. Have you anybody on your list who could take his place or would you like me to nominate someone else.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Since writing the above, I have found a letter and a telegram from Mr. Francis Howard Rose, of the University of Bishop's College, Lennoxville, who would like to go to Fort Hope in place of Donald McLeod, and also a letter from Malcolm Bruce Black, who will definitely accept the appointment to Namiska, if you agree. I think that this would complete our program.\n\nI am enclosing these two letters.\nApril 18, 1951.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have had letters from some of the students whom you have appointed to the Indian Missions for next summer. As you know, the problem of finance is very important to these young men, most of whom are working their way through college and in the Christian Ministry; they will never be rich. I have had an understanding for the last few years with Col. Neary and Mr. Hoey with regard to the travelling expenses, which the Government does not officially pay. The young men are instructed that their salary may be dated from the time that they leave home until they get home in September. With care, this just about pays for their railroad fare. The Church on the other hand, has undertaken to pay for air-travel from the railroad line to the Post. In this way, we have made it possible for the students to make ends meet.\n\nIn some of your letters to the students, I think they have misunderstood your perfectly correct statement but everything can be arranged if the understanding, which I have just mentioned, is still valid. I consider that the contribution which the Indian Department has made in the last few years in the new field of education is the most hopeful sign I have seen in all my years in the North Country.\n\nWith regard to some special students with whom you have been in contact, I have just heard from Mr. Frank Jackman of Lennoxville, that he will not be able to go to Namiska this year, as he has just been accepted for a government appointment; and I have a letter also from Mr. Malcolm Bruce Black of Lennoxville, who feels\nSend the following message subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes:\n\n1-1-1 (27)\n\nOttawa, April 23, 1951.\n\nMr. Rev.

Most of them are held in dist-\nant places, where the Indians gather for\nthe Summer Months, after living in the\nwoods, all winter. In nearly every place\nthere is a little church.\n\n(2) On my nomination you have been\nappointed as Teacher, by the Indian Depart-\nment for the Summer, on the understanding\nthat you will take a real interest in the\nreligious life of the Indians. The native\ncatechist will probably be holding a\nservice every evening. They have their\nown Indian Books, but you should be there\nand help, if possible, for some of the\npeople understand English.\n\n(3) You will be paid by the Indian Dept.\nwho will provide School Equipment, and\nyou will send your reports, carefully,\nregularly, to the Superintendent of Educat-\nion, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nAt the end of the Summer, I would\nlike you to send me a general report of\nyour work and experiences.\n\n(4) Sometime during the Summer, The\nBishop will be visiting the Indians at\nyour post, and spend a day or two with\nyou. You might help the Indian Catechist\nto teach the boys and girls and prepare\nthem for Confirmation.\n\n(5) Instead of Travelling expenses your\nsalary will be paid from the date you\nleave for your post till you return home.\nPhilip Phelan Esq\nSpt. of Education (Indian Affairs)\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI received a letter from Mr. Hugh Stiff of Trinity College, Toronto whom you were good enough to appoint as teacher at Moose Factory. He withdraws his offer to go and I hope he has notified you. I have no one else to suggest, if you should still need a man there, except Mr. Russell Sayer B.A., or Trinity College, Toronto.\n\nHe and Mr. Stiff came to see me some months ago. He is the only remaining candidate on my list.\n\nI had a letter from Principal O'Neil of Huron College, London, Ontario about Mr. Aldgate, whom you appointed, I think, on my recommendation to Trout Lake which is not in my district, but in Keewatin. I cannot instruct him about that post and I do not know whether the Bishop of Keewatin wants him. I must keep out of his territory. As a last suggestion, I wonder if you would like to send Aldgate to Moose Factory instead of Stiff.\n\nFinally I want to thank you for sending Miss Allingham to Moose. She is just the kind of person to do well there. I am sending you a copy of my instructions to the men whom you have appointed to the summer schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert J. Renison\nDear Mr. Thelton,\n\nI had a letter this morning about your choice of students for the various summer missions. Since then I have a letter from Miss Belli Allen who has a qualified lady student from Parma who wrote to me. She says you referred her to me.\n\nIt seems to me that two months is rather a short period and also the only place where a woman would be comfortable and protected might be Moose Factory. They have a Summer School there. I wonder if Mrs. Mallett would like to send her there. This is just a suggestion.\n\nI want little to express my pleasure in the news that you are taking over the Office of Superintendent. It is a great opportunity of keeping the Indians.\n\nYours faithfully,\nRobert Moore\nApril 18, 1951.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that your department requires University Students to teach in Indian Seasonal Schools during the summer months. I wish to obtain such a position if there are any still available.\n\nI will be graduating from Saint Francis Xavier University this spring with distinction and with a major in English. I intend to return to University next year for my M.A., hence such a position would help me not only financially but academically. I hope to obtain a position teaching on the staff next term.\n\nI can supply recommendations from the University staff and Executive if necessary.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration and hoping to hear from you in the near future. I remain,\n\nYours truly\n\nWilliam M. MacEachern\nTrinity College,\nToronto, Ontario.\nMarch 21, 1937.\n\nMajors Clarke,\nEducational Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Hon. Secretary of the Indian School Administration of the Church of England has asked me to write to you regarding any needs there may be for teachers among the Indians. He suggested that the Moose Factory School may run a summer school or that perhaps there may be summer appointments elsewhere in a day school district.\n\nI am 22 and am graduating from an honours course - English and General Subjects, from the University of Toronto. Any information you may have regarding summer teaching appointments would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMaurice R. Porter\nTrinity College Rd.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
