As a young and modern teacher high grade is requested.\n\nI wish to state that Miss Murphy fulfils all these. I refer you to my letter of last year.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. W. M. Donahoe,\nNorth Devon,\nN.B.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter informing me that an appointment has been made to the Indian School on the reservation under my spiritual direction I wish to state that the absurdity of the appointment has made a profound impression upon all (with the exception of the few who have heard of it). The lady appointed attended Normal School thirty-eight years ago and has not taught in New Brunswick or elsewhere for more than twenty-five years.\n\nShe was recommended by Mr. Macdonald, the Chief Superintendent of Education for N.B., a man whom I doubt went to school at the same time as she, but who can run very well. She qualifies for a teacher according to modern systems. Miss Hughes was dismissed on account of her inability to use modern methods, although she has been in active service for many years. Your correspondence last year informs me that a young and up-to-date teacher is needed. Someone must be engaged. All the foregoing is which Fr. Ryan and the Sisters in charge believe.\nSpiritual welfare, which includes education, have been trying to build up for many years have been ignored for political favoritism. I wish to state that you have made a very unpopular appointment. I make no reference unfavorable to the lady appointed, but I am writing regarding to the disregard of the principles advocated last year in your correspondence regarding the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Doucette\n\nJuly 15th 1934\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 6th ultimo, duly received. I thank you for the cheque for $150 as a token of gratuity.\n\nAs to your statement that there is no pension for teachers of Indian Day, which I am not only surprised, but very much distressed by the announcement.\n\nI have given the best part of my life and energy to the teaching of Indian children, and I firmly assert that my school has always been equal to the best, and second to none of the Indian schools in the province, during my 23 years in your service, and I was still willing to continue in your service.\n\nI not only acted in the capacity of teacher, but have been as well a missionary to the Indian children, teaching them...\nthis prayers, catechism, Bible history, as well as preparing them to make their \"First Holy Communion.\" In fact my whole life for the last 23 years had been devoted entirely to the Indian children, not only in schools but also any evenings and Saturdays was given to this interest.\n\nNow, that I have been thrown out of my work in times of great depression, I am placed in a very grave position, since I feel it would be practically impossible for me to obtain another position. Therefore, I think that you should feel it your duty to grant me a suitable yearly allowance of at least $600 for my support.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary T. Hughes.\nFredericton Aug 24th 1934\n\nSir\n\nI beg to ask the Department if Miss Mary T Hughes returned the School Register of 1933 and 1934 to the Department if so could it be returned to me Mrs Mc Elligott who is going to teach in the St Marys Indian School would like to have it she would then be in a position to place the scholars in their proper places that is the grades they belong.\n\nYour obedient Servent\n\nB J Griffiths\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. F. C. RYAN,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR NEW BRUNSWICK, ON THE ST. MARY'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\n-- DATE OF INSPECTION SEPT. 24, 1934 --\n\nTEACHER - MRS. REGINA McELLIGOTT.\n\nMrs. McElligott has just taken charge of this school. She replaced Miss Hughes, being appointed to the said school by the Ind. Dept. I, as the Inspector of Ind. Schools for N.B., had no say in this appointment whatever. I desired a 1st class teacher and have tried in the good interest of this school for years to get such a teacher but failed. I had no other aim in view than that which I hold for every Ind. School in N.B., namely, the advancement of our Indians.\n\nI found the pupils did not forget much of last year's work. They are bright, and with a good teacher should do well. About all grades were at review work.\n\nIn all truthfulness, I never saw or experienced such disorder in a school. I could not carry on the examination without calling the school to order on three or four occasions. I finally had to stop, and explained to the whole school that unless better order was maintained the school might as well be closed. The teacher claimed that they were much better now than when she opened school, some 4 weeks ago. Then I spoke strongly to the pupils, explaining that never in all the years that I had visited this school did I ever see anything disorderly, and was at a loss to know why such conduct was shown. All pupils were freely talking, no class would stand in line. One little boy hit another and tumbled him to the floor. Such a schoolroom! Considering all this, where, in the past, I ever found the best of order, my heart was broken. I can do nothing under such conditions, nor can the school advance until order is maintained, and a proper teacher installed.\nI found the pupils, as a whole, very untidy compared with the past record of this school.\n\nMrs. McElligott informed me that she sent for the required material and when it arrived all will begin to knit and sew. The next four or five months will better explain just what progress will be made in this branch of our important work by our new teacher.\n\nHad the choice of a teacher been left to me, as has been done in the past, I can assure the Dept. I could never have considered for one moment this appointment. Time will tell who is right or wrong. I have had vast experience for nearly 20 years in dealing with teachers and can say that I never allowed any favour nor condition to swerve me from the path of justice in giving to our Indians of N.B. the best. I have not a teacher outside of Mrs. McElligott but well knows if their school work is not well done they must be prepared to take another school, and it is only in this light that one can expect a teacher to advance her pupils, but when a teacher holds her position through \"politics\", quite independent to the Inspector of Schools, little progress can be expected. There I am speaking of our Indians Schools. They are so different in all respects of government to our white schools. Our white schools are carefully watched over by the ratepayers, trustees - who are near the school and constantly in touch with all working conditions of their school and teacher - competent persons to judge, and all this has a deep bearing on the teacher. It is not thus, however, in our Ind. Schools. Unless, therefore, there exists a medium between the Ind. Dept. and the Ind. School, competent in every respect to bridge over this gap, it is most evident our Indian Schools must retrograde, and in less than five years Indian Education in N.B. would only be in name.\n\nI am most sorry, not for myself but for this school, that the Indian Dept. for some reason of its own has appointed the said teacher to St. Mary's Indian School.\n\n(Sgd.) F. O. Ryan.\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs I have received no reply to my letter of Aug. 15th, concerning the request which I made to you, of granting me a yearly allowance of at least $600. for my support, in recognition of my twenty-three years' good and faithful work in your service, therefore I feel the urgent necessity of repeating my request.\n\nIf I had spent those years of service in the Public Schools of the province, I would now, like other teachers of New Brunswick, be eligible for a pension, and so would have a means of livelihood, in these times of such great depression. But this is now lost to me, as I have already asserted to you, my school was equal to the best and\nsecond to none of the Indian schools of New Brunswick, and moreover, it always compared favorably with the Public Schools of the province, which was the assertion made by visitors at my school.\n\nI also wish to remind you that I was not only teacher and missionary to the Indian children, but also a Domestic Science teacher\u2014doing equally as much work in that capacity, as the teachers who received an extra remuneration for this work. I also did to a certain extent, the work of a nurse\u2014looking after the milk, Cod Liver Oil, the cleaning of their teeth and Toothbrush Drills, seeing that their faces, hand and nails were clean, as also that their hair was combed and clean.\n\nNow that you have deprived me of my means of livelihood in times of such great depression, I trust, therefore, that you will take into consideration my petition, and will remedy the great wrong done me, and grant me the request which I earnestly implore.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary T. Hughes.\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1934.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, I beg to say that, as you were informed in official letter of July 6th, last, there is no superannuation provided for teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nUnder present regulations, the only payment this Department can make to you is two months' retiring gratuity. A cheque for $150., as gratuity, has already been forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Mary T. Hughes,\nNorth Devon, N.

Hughes, North Devon, N. B., requesting that she be granted a yearly pension for her lengthy services as teacher in an Indian day school, I would say that no provision is made for superannuation or pension to teachers of Indian day schools. They do not contribute to the superannuation fund. These employees are not considered permanent civil servants and therefore do not come under the Superannuation Act.\n\nIn the case of teachers like Miss Hughes, who have taught many years in Indian schools, it is a matter of regret that a pension cannot be allowed. All that could be done in her case was the granting of two months' retiring gratuity, which was paid.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable R. B.

It will be necessary to make new drawings, but not new specifications. This will take some little time.\n\nMr. Chene suggests that while we follow the architectural design of the old building we should make it at least three feet longer and have an entrance direct from the class-room to the basement, which is not provided in the Oromocto school plan. This is necessary on account of the lavatories being in the basement. There are also some minor changes which will effect improvements and at the same time reduce the cost. If you approve Mr. Chene will take up this work at his earliest convenience. With the exception of the lavatories and the septic tank this building should not cost over $200.00 more than the one previously prepared for St. Mary's.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I notice that the plans call for construction of a septic tank in connection with latrines from the water closet, and I am of the opinion that if the plans were changed so as to allow for a sewer to open a pipe into the river in place of septic tank, it would be better than the latter, and there would be no danger of any offensive smell floating about the river. It may not be any more costly, if so costly.\n\nIn addition, it would materially benefit the river in general as it would carry off all the waste that might lodge in same in the spring time.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

G/I.\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nMr. Clarence Brown of Gibson, for whose appointment as inspector on the new school house at the St. Mary's Indian Reserve I asked, showed me a letter this morning which he had received from the Secretary of the Department offering him $50.00 to inspect this work upon the understanding that he should be required to visit the job only occasionally and to make weekly reports upon the progress of the work.\n\nMy understanding was that an inspector was to be appointed to inspect this work in the same way as inspectors who had been appointed by the Public Works and other Departments of the Government, to watch the work constantly and at a weekly wage and I recommended Mr. Brown with this expectation.\n\nI think if the work is to be properly inspected it requires a competent man to be on the job constantly not only for the protection of the Department but in fairness to the contractor, and I would advise that Mr. Brown be given a regular appointment as inspector with instructions to watch the progress of the work from the beginning to the end in the usual way.\n\nMr. Brown is a practical carpenter who depends on his living of a daily\nOttawa, July 16, 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the inspection of the St. Mary's School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive attention and you will be further advised at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nOswald Crocket, Esq., M.P.,\nFredericton, N.B.\nOttawa, July 16, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nOn July 3rd the Department wrote Clarence W. Brown of Gibson, N.B., appointing him inspector of the new school building to be erected on the St. Mary's Indian Reserve near Fredericton and offering him the sum of $50.00 for this work. A letter has come to hand from Mr. O. S. Crocket, M.P., in which he states that his understanding was that an inspector was to be appointed to inspect this work in the same way as inspectors who had been appointed by the Public Works and other Departments of the Government, to watch the work constantly at a daily wage and that he recommended Mr. Brown with this expectation. The Schools Branch has no knowledge of this understanding, if any, and the sum of $50.00 was arrived at by computing at 1/4 on the cost of the building. It is not the practice of the Department on these small works to have an inspector constantly on the job, as, by so doing, the cost of inspection would be altogether out of proportion to the value of the work.\n\nIt is usual to allow $5.00 a day with actual expenses.\npenses, but it is understood that Mr. Brown lives very close to the reserve and each visit would not necessarily, therefore, take up a whole day. For this reason a lump sum was offered. I think in this instance the total sum for the inspection might be increased to $75.00, which would be a fair amount for the services.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The usual rate allowed professional men for inspection is 1\u00bd per cent of the cost. This was the basis upon which the offer to Mr. Brown was computed. It is considered that one visit a week, or at most two, would be quite sufficient, if the inspection is thorough. Under the circumstances, however, the Department is prepared to increase the grant previously offered by $25.00 and give Mr. Brown $75.00 for his services.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to Mr. Brown,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nOswald S.

Would the department kindly advise us at once what they think about it.\n\nThe cellar wall is built to the top of the ground and Mr. Barker wants to back fill as there is no superintendent looking after the building.

The first item in the estimate provides for this drain we want to connect with that drain and run 116 feet to a gulch that runs across the school lot at the very lower or the river end next to the river. The second item provides for draining the cellar the pipe to run 130 feet into the same gulch. The depth of the drain would be about four feet for a distance of about one hundred feet the other thirty feet would not average more than two feet.\n\nWe recommend the double drain because we think in the spring when the water is high the drain that runs under the floor would be likely to be full. If we could tap it to connect the cellar drain it might tend to fill the cellar. If we put a trap in the large drain and it was running full of water the trap could not open to let the\nSir,\n\nWater from the cellar drain enters it. For those reasons we recommend the double drain.\n\nEnclosed please find estimate of cost from Mr. Hudson Barker Contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.J. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 4, 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo reporting on the drainage necessary at the St. Mary's School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the recommendation made by you and you may have the drainage carried out as specified in your letter and in Mr. Barker's offer at a cost of $155.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Smith\nIndian Agent\nFredericton\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nReferring to your letter of September 11th, 1912.\n\nI say to say Mr. Miller and I talked about drain when he was surveying the school lot and he said he would report about it when he sent his survey to the Department. This open drain is just as reported by Mr. Miller. I agree with him about the top culvert covered with earth. If there was a stone culvert built down this open drain with stone side walls and no bottom, planked on top with 3 in Hemlock plank covered with earth, the water would soak through the stone walls and drain the land on both sides. We are running our drains from the School House cellar to this open drain. If there was a culvert running down this drain our drain pipes from the cellar would enter it and everything would be clean and dry.\n\nI asked Mr. Barker, the contractor for the School House, for an estimate of the probable cost of a stone drain 2 ft. inside, walls to be one foot thick and 2 ft high without any bottom and a 3 in Hemlock covering, all to be covered with earth. The drain would be about 250 feet long. He says he could build a drain like this for about $275. Or he would build one of Hemlock Plank 3 in thick without any bottom for about $225. Mr. Clarence Brown offers to put in a stone sewer for about $275.\nOttawa, Oct. 10, 1912.\nFile 118,345/5.\n\nMemorandum for Mr. Benson:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Agent Smith's letter hereunder of the 2nd instant, I beg to state that a culvert planked with hemlock and then covered with earth would have a life of about twelve years. That is to say the covering would have to be renewed in about twelve years or less. I think a tile drain would be very much more durable and considerably less expensive. I think the agent might be asked his view in this matter and as to whether a tile drain consisting of two nine inch pipes laid side by side or one fifteen inch pipe would not answer the purpose and what would be the price of the work in either the case of the two nine inch pipes or the one fifteen inch pipe; I think in either case the cost should be about $200.00 and would have the advantage of being of a permanent nature.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, October 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the unsanitary condition of the open drain crossing the St. Mary's School property.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that a tile drain would be much better and less expensive than the style of drain you suggest, as a culvert planked with hemlock and then covered with earth would not be nearly so durable. The Department would like you to state whether you consider a tile drain consisting of two nine inch pipes laid side by side or one fifteen inch pipe would not answer the purpose and what would be the price of the work in either case. The Chief Surveyor of the Department thinks that a pipe drain of either dimensions could be laid down for about $200.00. The Department would like to know whether it would be possible to have this work done for this amount this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. J.

Usually the Rev. Father Ryan recommends this work be done, and the Department authorize's me to get the work done. The roof of the St. Mary's Indian School is leaking. I would recommend this roof be repaired, the cost will be small.\n\nI would also recommend the walls and woodwork of the Woodstock, Oromocto, and St. Mary's Indian Schools be washed and the floors oiled, the desks be washed and if necessary, varnished. There would also be a very small amount of repairs, which can be done at a very small cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, August 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the cleaning of the walls and woodwork, the oiling of the floors, etc., at the St. Mary's, Woodstock and Oromocto Indian Day Schools and regarding the repairing of the roof of the St. Mary's School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the floors at each of these schools thoroughly scrubbed and the woodwork washed. We will have no funds to oil the floors or to varnish desks. You may have the roof of the St. Mary's School repaired. It is noted that the cost of having this done is small. Any minor repairs required at the other schools can also be carried out. You should see that all this work is completed before the schools re-open.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred at each of the schools, separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The fire pot is cracked in several places, the air grate at the top of the inside is burned out, and the grates are also gone. I had a plumber look this furnace over, and I also examined it. The pipes are of galvanized iron and are in good condition, but I cannot see how it is possible to repair the furnace.\n\nA new wood furnace would cost approximately one hundred and twenty dollars. I would recommend a wood furnace if the Department decide to purchase one.\n\nAlso the vent pipes attached to the two toilets in the cellar are rusted and leaking. The total cost to repair these would be five dollars. I would recommend this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, August 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, reporting on the condition of the furnace at present in use at the St. Mary's Indian Day School and recommending, as it is beyond repair, that a new wood burning furnace be installed, at a cost of approximately $120.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of a wood furnace, of the type and capacity considered necessary for the heating of the building. The purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list. It is noted that the pipes, which are of galvanized iron, are in good condition and can be utilized in connection with the new furnace. You may arrange, also, to have the necessary repairs made to the vent pipes attached to the two toilets in the basement, at a cost of approximately $5.00.\n\nI enclose encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure required in the purchase and installation of the furnace. It is considered that this should include sufficient funds to repair the toilets. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for the purchase of the furnace and its installation and also for the repairs to the toilets. You should state on each copy of your vouchers that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 850.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure\n\nB. J.

The next day, however, he ordered another 2 M shingles, amounting to $1.80, and asked us to make out a new set of invoices covering both charges. Evidently he forwarded the first set of invoices instead of destroying them, and also forwarded the invoices covering both charges.

Father Ryan.\n\nReferring to that portion of the letter regarding the vestibule of the school and the pillars being out of place, there is very little that can be done with this save taking it completely down and putting in a new foundation. The pillars are slightly out of position due to the heat. I will have it repaired at a reasonable cost, but to do a permanent job it would necessitate an expenditure of over $100 which I certainly do not feel is necessary.\n\nI would recommend, however, that the interior of the school, that is walls, woodwork and ceilings, be painted.

B.\n\nIt is noted you have been informed that she is doing good work, but the reports received by the Department are quite different and, therefore, I feel it advisable to give you full information regarding Mrs. McElligott's services at the school mentioned.\n\nMiss Mary T. Hughes was, for several years, in charge of the St. Mary's Indian Day School but, owing to unsatisfactory service, the Department found it necessary to dismiss her at the end of June, 1934. When it was suggested that Mrs. McElligott might be engaged, the Department communicated with the Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, Rev. F. C. Ryan, and he replied as follows in a letter dated May 3rd, 1934:\n\n\"Mrs. McElligott is only a second class teacher. Again, she graduated in 1896 or 1896; some thirty-eight years ago, and, in this respect, would be little or no improvement on Miss Hughes. She must be nearly sixty-five. Her age is against her. Our idea is to place a good first class teacher, one with five or six years' experience. We want some life infused into this school. This is the very reason why we feel Miss Hughes is no longer required.\"\n\nLater, the Department was directed to appoint Mrs. McElligott and she began duties on September 1st, 1934.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of letter received from Rev. W. M. Donahoe, also copy of Inspector Ryan's report regarding his visit to the school on September 24th, 1934, and a copy of his report in connection with his inspection of the school on September 24th, 1935.\n\nReverend Father Ryan has been Inspector of Indian Schools in New Brunswick for many years and, as a result of his efforts, the work done in our schools in that province has shown considerable progress. After carefully considering Father Ryan's two reports, copies of which are attached, the Department believes it would be in the best interests of this school to dispense with Mrs. McElligott's services at the end of the present academic year, viz., June 30th, next, and engage a younger qualified teacher, who can be secured for the same salary as is being paid Mrs. McElligott.\n\nHAROLD W. MCGILL\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRegarding the representations made to the Minister on behalf of Mrs. R. McElligott, teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School at North Devon, York Co., N.B., I attach hereto copy of a memorandum to the Honourable the Superintendent General dated December 13th, last, which sets forth the facts regarding Mrs. McElligott's teaching services.\n\nRev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Schools for New Brunswick, in a report on his inspection of this school on the 15th instant, states as follows regarding Mrs. McElligott's teaching services:\n\n\"I am far from being satisfied with this school. The Indian Department should understand as well as I, that a teacher who gives her age to me as fifty-five years is too old to bring about that realized success that the teachers of today's training may better give. It is not fair to the Indians to load a case of charity on them at such a terrible price of sacrifice. I have suggested in the past that this school be supplied with a First Class Superior teacher, younger in years, with the latest training. Some pupils did fair work. I found about all bright and most anxious to study, showing if they had a competent teacher what might be expected.\"\n\nFather Ryan has nominated the teachers for the schools in New Brunswick during the past number of years and is anxious that all teachers engaged in the Province have First Class Certificates.\n\nFather Ryan recommends the appointment of Miss Ruth E.

After the singing of \"O Canada\", Christmas carols, hymns and other songs were given. The blackboard drawings and other decorations were very attractive. I addressed the pupils and parents and presented prizes to Gabriel Dedham with a perfect record in attendance and academic subjects, grade eight. I trust that it will be possible to assist this boy in entering the Fredericton High School next year. Other winners were Joseph Paul with a perfect attendance, Grade 5; Joyce Sappier, Grade 4 with perfect attendance and high standing; Grade 3 Lena Meuse and grade 2 Roger Paul and Grade 1 Howard Paul.\n\nA Christmas tree was much enjoyed feature of the closing.

MacCutcheon,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn regard to our telephone conversation re pasteurized milk for Indian Day School, St. Mary's Reserve, Devon, N.B., will say that there has never been any question of pasteurizing milk for this School. For one reason there is no law in New Brunswick to compel anyone to sell pasteurized milk and another is that up to the present year there hasn't been a pasteurizing plant here in Devon.\n\nAs a fully qualified graduate nurse, I realise more than most people the danger of contaminated milk, and for this reason condemned the cans in use and wished bottles substituted. The can was rusty and could not be properly sterilized.\n\nWe have a herd of pure-bred Jerseys, which was started when our first child arrived, so that we should have the best quality milk available for our children. It is this same high quality that we have supplied to the Indian School. This same quality milk in Ontario, then sold under the Jersey Trade Mark bring a higher price than any grade of pasteurized milk, and would be called Certified Milk. It also has a much higher food value than pasteurized milk.\n\nHoping that this is a satisfactory reason and explanation why the milk is not pasteurized, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. Leo F. Hayes\n\"JERSEY CATTLE IN CANADA\"\n\nA COMPLIMENT TO THE JERSEY COW\n\nOne of the most common sights in the dairy world today is the presence of a few Jersey cows in many herds of other breeds. They bring up the average of the herd, and on the shoulders of these quality builders rests the reputation of the whole herd.\n\nFOOD VALUE OF MILK\n\nFood values are measured in terms of calories and in comparing milk this term is used.\n\n| Percent of Fat in Milk | Calories in Fat per 1 Quart | Calories in Solids Not Fat | Total Calories |\n|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| 3.0                    | 329.4                      | 371.0                      | 700.1         |\n| 3.5                    | 383.9                      | 383.0                      | 766.9         |\n| 4.0                    | 437.8                      | 418.8                      | 856.6         |\n| 4.5                    | 492.3                      | 450.5                      | 942.8         |\n| 5.0                    | 547.8                      | 485.8                      | 1033.6        |\n| 5.5                    | 602.3                      | 415.2                      | 1017.5        |\n| 6.0                    | 657.2                      | 420.6                      | 1077.8        |\n\nFrom this table it will be seen that Jersey milk tested at 4% fat contains 241.6 more calories than 3.5% milk or 23.7% more food value. That is what sells Jersey milk today.\n\n[10]\nOttawa, Ontario,\nNovember 23, 1940.\n\nDear Dr. MacMillan:\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has been supplying milk to children in the Indian Day School, St. Mary's Reserve, Devon, N.B.\n\nIt recently received a request from the Indian Agent for milk bottles and, on investigation, found that a dairy had been supplying unpasteurized milk in cans. The name of the dairy is \"Hayes Devon Jerseys\".\n\nIn a letter to the Indian Agent, Mrs. Hayes stated: \"there has never been any question of pasteurizing milk for this School. For one reason there is no Law in New Brunswick to compel anyone to sell pasteurized milk and another is that up to the present year there hasn't been a pasteurizing plant here in Devon\". She states of her product: \"It is this same high quality that we have supplied to the Indian School. This same quality milk in Ontario, when sold under the Jersey Trade Mark brings a higher price than any grade of pasteurized milk, and would be called Certified Milk. It also has a much higher food value than pasteurized milk\".\n\nIf all the claims made by this good lady for her good product have no more basis in fact than this last statement, I believe this Branch would be justified in demanding pasteurized milk.\n\nI would be glad to hear your views on the subject, and also to know what the general practice is in that locality.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Hayes, Devon, has already made to the Department that his milk is of the best quality.\n\nThat fact, however, would not prevent it from being the medium which would convey tuberculosis, undulant fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, or any other pathogenic bacteria which might either be in the milk itself, or carried by persons handling the milk.\n\nIt is considered that the only safe treatment for milk is to pasteurize it, which means raising the temperature of the milk to 146\u00b0 F. and keeping it at that temperature for thirty minutes. It has been found that this procedure will kill all pathogenic bacteria ordinarily found in milk.\n\nIt is true that the province of New Brunswick does not enforce compulsory pasteurization, but the Department of the Federal Government responsible for the health of its Indian wards should set a lead in this matter and insist upon pasteurized milk wherever it is available.\n\nThe following letter, which the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services received from the Chief Medical Officer for the Province of New Brunswick, supports this view:\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would not be wise to repair this porch on the same foundation, for if done this way, it would have to be done yearly.\n\nA hole should be dug in the ground and a cement foundation in one large piece at the bottom, and tapering towards the top which would serve as the bottom step of the porch, would be the proper and permanent way to make these repairs.\n\nMr. Tom Nash, a half-breed who lives on the St. Mary's Reserve said he could make the required repairs for about $20.00; that would include the material required as well as the work.\n\nMr. Nash has followed this line of work for a number of years and has the name of being a good workman by the people of Devon.\n\nI would request that authority be given to have this porch repaired by Mr. Nash at a cost not exceeding $20.00\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nEdward Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, you may expend an amount of $20.00 for material and labour for repairing the porch at the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E.J.

It is the Department's wish that all bills for the year be presented by the end of March, as that is the end of the Fiscal year, and if there is any money left over from the years accounts, it is handed back to the treasurer. In this way old bills have to be paid from the next years appropriation.\n\nI have been Indian Agent since the first of October, 1941 and have not received a bill from the Devon Water Department since that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdward J.

He was busy for some time arresting a drunk and when he returned the Indians had gone but he felt sure they were the ones that damaged the school property.\n\nI made enquiries around the Old Reserve and was told by Tom Nash that Mark Brooks, as one of a party that had knocked down a piece of his garden fence and he came nearly getting hold of Brooks but when he started to follow the mob, they put the rocks to him, as he expressed it, and he had to return to shelter.\n\nMiss Sharkey, a woman who lives adjacent to the school property on the south side of the road says she heard the swings at the school full so she got up and looked out of her bedroom window and saw a number of boys running towards the river on the Old Reserve. (She did not know if they were Indians or not.)\n\nI felt sure the Indians were guilty of this crime, so on Monday I went to Isaac Paul, the Assistant Chief, who is Acting Chief, and told him what had happened and said I knew some of the boys and asked him to talk to them when they returned from work that night.\n\nI told him I had hired Tom Nash to fix the property again and if the boys who were all or nearly all, working, would pay for those repairs, I would treat the matter as a Halloween prank and let it drop, otherwise I would hand it over the R. C. M. P.\n\nMr. Paul was unwilling at first and said it was not the Indians, then said if it was, it would not cost them much and he would talk to them and get a settlement.\n\nDuring the early evening, I went to the reserve but was told by Mr. Paul that the boys or young men of the reserve were not guilty and would not pay for the damages.\nI turned the matter over to the R.C.M.P., but they could not seem to get any information which would be of value in finding the guilty party or parties.\n\nThe damage done was as follows:\n\n1. Tore steps away from side door.\n2. Tore down one of the posts holding up Porch.\n3. Tore down swings which were put up at the expense of the Department.\n4. Broke two panes of glass in cellar windows.\n\nCost of new glass, putty, nails and repairing damage $5.00.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nFrom interviews it is evident that no information would be obtained from any of the Indians. They are either very clannish or are afraid to inform on each other. Contacts were made at the reserve and should any information come to light this Det. will be notified and further investigation will be made.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION\n\nCar Code # 8210 miles 20.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nFredericton Sub-Division,\n\nForwarded for your information:\nThis matter was reported to me on the 4th inst. by the Indian Agent, H.J. Whalen. The Agent Mr. Whalen carried out an investigation before handing the matter over to us. His investigation consisted mostly of telling the persons mentioned in this report, that if they all got together and paid the amount of the damage, no action would be taken. When it appeared this would have no effect he handed the matter over to us. It would appear that this space of time gave the Indians considered ample time to discuss the matter and plan their denial. From that it has been my experience that it is practically impossible to induce one Indian to inform on another. This investigation will be continued and every effort made to get something definite that would assist us in bringing the case to a successful conclusion.\n\n\"STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION\"\n\nD.D. 15.11.42\n\nThe O.C. \"J\" Div.\n\n(Sgd) E.H.

WHALEN, Devon, N.B.\n\n(Fredericton Detachment Case)\n\n5-11-42\n\n1. On this date a complaint was received from Edward J. WHALEN, Indian Agent, to the effect that the steps on the school-house, on St. Mary's Indian Reserve, in Devon, N.B., were damaged during the night of October 31st, and November 1st (Halloween night). The extent of the damage was to the amount of $8.00.\n\n2. On instructions from the H.S.O., I/C Fredericton detachment and accompanied by Sgt. Trapp, a patrol was made to Devon, N.B., where the Devon Town Constable, Leo HAYES, was interviewed. From him was learned that between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. on that night several Indian boys were around town and on Bridge Street. In this crowd were Mark BROOKS, Teddy BROOKS, Charles PAUL, Harold RAPINER and William BROOKS. Mr. HAYES did not see the boys around the school.\n\n3. Tom HAM, who lives near the school was interviewed. He stated that after mid-night of October he heard some in his yard. He went out and saw several boys in the yard. He gave chase and he recognized Mark BROOKS and Charles PAUL. At this time the two boys mentioned ran through an alley towards Bridge Street.\n\n4. Teddy BROOKS, who lives right by the school was interviewed and questioned at length. He admitted being with the boys during the early part of the evening and claimed that they went to the New Reserve with William BROOKS at about midnight, after that he came right home and went to bed. He denied any knowledge of who damaged the school-house steps.\n\n5. William BROOKS was interviewed and his story did not differ from that of Teddy BROOKS.\n\n6. Mark BROOKS, Charles PAUL and Harold RAPINER were all interviewed and questioned at length. They all admitted of being around town during the period until about 1 p.m. of November 1st, but they denied being at Tom HAM's place and of having anything to do with the school. From questioning the boys it is quite obvious that they had discussed the matter, their stories are all the same and it would appear that they are going to stick to it.\n\n5-11-42\n\n7. Information was received that Peter ROBERTS, who has a shack near the school was around his shack during the night in question and that he may be able to supply some information. On being interviewed he said that he went to his place during the night, but saw no one around. He said that he saw the boys in question in Fredericton during the night. It would not be easy that he saw the boys on the old reserve. It was learned from Tom HAM that Peter told him he saw the boys near Tom's place, but Peter ROBERTS denied this.\n\n(Continued page 2)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Steve Nash who lives on the Old Reserve and who is reliable was interviewed and nothing could be gained from him.\n\n2. The above damage was done on the night of October 31st, 1942 and enquiries were made by the Indian Agent, Mr. J. Whalen immediately. Not being able to get any information he asked this Detachment to investigate. During the investigation Mark Brooks, Teddy Brooks, Charles Pauls, Harold Smith and others were questioned and all were interviewed, but with negative results. All of the men mentioned were in and around the old Reserve during the night but no one was found who saw them near the school house. The main suspects are Mark Brooks, Charles Pauls and Harold Smith. From interviews and after being questioned they all denied being near the school or having any knowledge of who did the damage.\n\n3. It is evident that between the time the damage was done and the time the investigation was carried on, the men in question had time to agree on definite story about their whereabouts and they all stick to it. From experience it has been found that one Indian will not inform on another. There does not appear to be any way of getting any information on this case and the fact that the suspected parties have decided to stick to one story I would request that this case be closed as Further Investigation Unwarranted.\n\nThe O.C. \"J\" Div.

Whalen\nAgent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe: Saint Mary's School.\n\nA board fence which is about 6 feet high and built across the back of the school yard is in need of repair. Part of it blew down during the spring, and although I tried to have it fixed up temporarily, I could not locate any dry lumber for the purpose. I considered it would only be wasting money to use green lumber, as it would twist and check when exposed to the sun.\n\nAt the present time, a number of mills are sawing lumber in this vicinity. The lumber required could be purchased and dried in a short time for this work.\n\nIn order to do a good job, posts will have to be reset, and a quantity (about 200 running feet) of 2 by 4 will be required to repair the fence, also a quantity of nails and spikes. To do a finished job, the fence should be painted.\n\nThe total cost including labour will be in the vicinity of $75.00.\n\nCould authority be granted to do this work during the summer holidays?\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1944.\n\nMr. E.J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $75 to cover the cost of material and labour in repairing the fence at the St. Mary's Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nJune 16, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe: Saint Mary's School.\n\nThere is no flagstaff at Saint Mary's Indian School. The teacher, Mrs. McElligott, told me a pole had been obtained previous to my appointment as Indian Agent, but before being erected, it disappeared. The teacher would like to have a flagstaff as she has a flag.\n\nI could not get an exact estimate on this work, but Tom Nash, a half-breed living on the Indian Reserve, says he thinks he can get a pole, peel, paint, and erect it for about $35.00. He does not say he can do it for this amount however.\n\nMay I have authority to get a pole and have the same erected?\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1944.\n\nMr. E.J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may arrange for a flag pole for the St. Mary's School. The cost mentioned in your letter seems high and it would be appreciated if you could have a flag pole erected for a smaller amount.\n\nR.A.

Phalen,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phalen:\n\nAs you know we are now well established in our school, to which has been added the Domestic Science room, and already we feel we that we have accomplished much. It is now painted and in order, and the work of the pupils is very satisfactory to date.\n\nIf you could only visit it, we are sure you would agree with us in our reporting that being a basement room, the lighting is not sufficient, so knowing from the past your understanding and kindly sympathy, I feel no hesitation in approaching you with a request to have the building wired and suitable lighting installed.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Whalen about it, and though he realizes it is necessary, as he was criticized for putting the lights in the Woodstock school does not wish to make any move in the matter, until he receives word to do so.\n\nHe has already exceeded his quota, due to high price of labor at the present time, and much was needed to put the department into proper condition. We did our best to keep expenses down, by doing the painting and practically all of the cleaning ourselves.\n\nWord has just come that our requisitions will be arriving soon\u2014another cause for rejoicing.\nI almost forgot another fact. Our sewing machine is not, and cannot be put into working order, and we really need one badly. At present, I have been able to borrow one for a few weeks, but of course I am anxious to have one for ourselves. For awhile, when we were painting etc., we thought we might even fix the machine, but it was impossible. Even the experienced machinist we had look at it could do nothing, so that is our second request, a sewing machine. The loom, we hope, soon to be ready also.\n\nWe may surprise you too, by telling you that we are building up a nice little Library for the school, through the generosity of friends.\n\nPerhaps sometime, when peace is again restored we may have the pleasure of welcoming you to our little school.\n\nWith thanks for all past favors, and anticipating a favorable reply.\n\nI am,\n\nyours most sincerely\n\nSister Marietta\nOttawa, March 2, 1945.\n\nDear Sister Marietta:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo and am pleased to know that matters are proceeding satisfactorily at the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nIt has not been our general practice to install electricity in Indian day schools. However, I will discuss your request with the Acting Director, and if it is felt advisable to make any change from our previous policy you will be advised.\n\nI look forward to having the pleasure of visiting your school at some time in the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The present double ones are most inconvenient, as many of them are too small for the pupils. If only we could get single ones of various heights, that is, small, medium, and large, it would certainly be a great advantage, and also a benefit to the health of the children.\n\nI know you and also all the members of the Department are always most solicitous for the advantage of the children and for the betterment of the school, so this I feel will prove to be. Trusting that you may feel disposed to petition the Department for this requisition.\n\nI am,\nYour most sincerely,\n\nSister Jean Marie.\nFredericton, N.B.\nMarch 30, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed you will find a letter which I received from Sister Jean Marie, Teacher at the Saint Mary's Indian School.\n\nThe desks referred to by the Sister are old double ones and much too small for the larger pupils, who have to bend over and consequently crowd their lungs.\n\nI am submitting this letter for your comments and will not forward a requisition for new seats until instructed to as I know much has been spent on this school during the past year.\n\nEdward G. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 3, 1945.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.

A sample desk was made and Indian Agent Brisebois, Caughnawaga, was directed to visit the penitentiary and inspect the desk made there. Following his visit he reported as follows:\n\n\"This desk is of first class construction, being made of seamless pipe and the wooden parts of birch. It is of Duco finish. This desk is of superior quality and more solid than the ones we have been purchasing. The cost of them may be slightly higher, but they would be worth the difference. The shape of the desk has been slightly improved by the Engineer at the Penitentiary who designed the desk and this change will, no doubt, benefit the pupils who use them.

However, if the room is in the condition mentioned by the Sister, it is possible that an exception should be made in this case. Please let me know what it would cost to install electric lighting in the basement room.\n\nI have marked a paragraph on the second page of this letter. If the articles mentioned were essential - and I presume they were - there is no reason why application should not have been made to this office for permission to purchase them. It is not necessary for the Superior of the Order to supply equipment for an Indian day school.\n\nWhen replying to this letter, I would like your comments about the Sister's request for a new heater. Her information regarding this matter will be found at the top of the second page of the letter.\n\nYou should advise Sister Marietta that her letter has been received and has been referred to you for a report.

Power Co. is located directly opposite the school.\n\nThe heating of the Domestic Science room is problem number 11. When the furnace room was converted into a class room, it was necessary, in order to stand erect, to remove many of the hot air pipes, and this in turn reduced the heating of the room to a very great extent. Our only means of heating this room now is a very small stove, and in winter this is not at all sufficient.\n\nI wonder, Mr. Hoey if you remember the type of heater that was sent to the Domestic Science room at Tobique a few years ago, and if it is possible procure another similar for Saint Mary's. I am sure Mr. MacPhail, The Indian Agent of Tobique Reserve would be glad to give you any information you might require re. type and size of this heater. When it was installed our heating difficulties were over. We also found it to be a great fuel saving. Now that Army Camps are closing it should be an easy matter to obtain an item of this kind.\n\nWhen we came to this school last January we found it very poorly supplied with books and other teaching essentials. We were obliged to requisition books and supplies for immediate use in order to make a beginning.\n\nNow at the end of six months we have a better knowledge of the whole situation, and we find we still need books and materials if we are to get our classes off to a good start in Sept. The pupils are very bright, and are applying themselves to their studies, and located as they are so near our great Educational centers it would be too bad to keep them back.\n\nThe Reverend Superior of our convent here has been most generous and has done everything in her power to help equip the school, and stimulate the interest of the pupils. She has purchased for our use, an organ, sewing machine, and a set of tables and chairs for the Domestic Science room.\n\nOn Easter Monday we held a sale work, a great deal of which was done by the children. The proceeds have been used to improve the class room. We purchased covering for the floor, and paid to have it laid. We also paid two men for two days labor in and around the building. Not knowing the conditions at the beginning you would hardly realize the extensive repairs that were necessary.\n\nSister Electa was in the city for the closing exercises of U.N.F. and while here she visited our school, and was very much pleased. Her interest in the welfare of the Indians is just as keen today as when she labored among them.\n\nRecently we have had many visiting officials from the schools in the city and elsewhere, and all have expressed great surprise at the high standards of this school.\nRosary Hall\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nIt is quite evident Mr. Hoey that I have many problems but knowing as I do your kindly interest in the welfare and training of Indians I have no hesitation in presenting these problems to you and I feel sure they will all get a favourable solution.\n\nTrusting in the near future you may have occasion to visit the reservations of New Brunswick, and that we may be favored with a visit.\n\nThanking you for many favors in the past and hoping to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours truly\n\nSister Marietta\nRosary Hall\nFredericton, N.B.\nJune 11th, 1945.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFor the past six months I have been teaching the Indians at Saint Mary's School, Devon. My duties here are along the same lines as at Tobique, handicrafts, and general instruction in all forms of Home-making.\n\nWhen our Indian Agent took us to visit the school for the first time and when he pointed out to me a corner of a much dilapidated furnace room as my future class room, I must say, I viewed the whole situation with utter discouragement.\n\nHowever, thanks to the assistance given by the Dept. and the extreme generosity of our Community, much has been done since that day in early January to make the little school a bright and cheery place to work in, and it is only under such conditions that we may hope to bring out the best that is in the pupils.\n\nI may say that much the same problems are apparent here as in other Indian Schools. Our greatest difficulty right now is the lack of any lighting system whatever. I feel it is unnecessary for me to go into detail about the necessity of lights in a basement classroom which is two thirds underground.\n\nAnd it is in this room that Grade 1 and II work for four or five hours every day. And here also the other Grades are at different periods, taught, weaving, sewing, knitting and other fine arts. It is hardly fair to the pupils to be obliged to work under such difficulties, and terrific eye-strain will in a very short time be the dire result.\n\nThe light in the class room upstairs too, is not adequate for dark days in early winter, even now on rainy days, and this spring, by far the greater number of days have been dull and rainy, consequently the pupils are working under a strain almost constantly. I am sure such conditions existing in a class room where about forty children spend the school year would be totally condemned by any medical authority.\n\nNow from an educational view-point. We have at our disposal a very fine moving picture machine, and it is possible to procure at all times an excellent line of both educational and entertainment films free of charge. I have found motion pictures a great advantage in the class room. They seem to wean the children from the habit of frequenting theatres, where very often, the type of picture shown has a demoralizing effect on the young and impressionable mind. I know, Mr. Hoey, that this consideration alone will induce you to have lights installed in St. Mary's this summer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However I have asked for a tender on this work and will submit one as soon as it is received.\n\nWith reference to the paragraph which you marked, regarding the materials supplied by the Reverend Superior, I felt quite sure the branch would not consider an organ necessary. At any rate I was not asked for one and it was not until Sister Marietta asked me to have it moved over to the school that I knew one was purchased.\n\nThe table and chairs also were purchased and delivered before I even knew they were being considered. A carpenter had made a long table and two benches which were used until the small tables and chairs were purchased and I thought this arrangement was satisfactory, and serving the purpose although the small tables and chairs are much handier as the Sister can get around through her class easier.\n\nThe machine was needed of course but, no new ones were available and I thought as so much had been spent on repairs and equipment of the Domestic Science Branch this year we would wait until next year to requisition for it.\n\nWith reference to the heating, Sister Marietta is a bit wrong in saying that the removal of a few of the heater pipes lessened the heat of the basement as it really helped it although not enough to make the room comfortable on cold winter days. The basement was never heated sufficient for a class room as it was never meant to be for that purpose when the heating system was installed.\nA heater is necessary to make this Domestic Science room comfortable during the winter months. Could one be procured from some of the army stock?\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6, 1945.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the St. Mary's Indian Day School.

At any rate the educational films which are being used in the different schools could be borrowed for use in the Indian school and Sister Marietta has a moving picture camera at her command and could use these pictures to good advantage.\n\nI have a tender from Gerald LaPlante, a man who lives very near the school and he said he could wire the building any time I gave him the instructions to. He is a good man I am told and is at the present time wiring a new addition to the C.P.R. station. Fredericton, N.B.\n\nYou will notice that his tender is $68.00 for the wiring less the lamps. As this was without a plug outlet to the school room I called him and asked what the extra would be and he said $3.00. Thus satisfactory wiring less the lamps would be $71.00. I asked Staples, Electricians, what they would charge for wiring the school as required and they said in the vicinity of $100.00 therefore I did not get a tender from them.\n\nI will await your further instructions.\n\nEdward J.

Day celebration has spread this section of the porch and it will be necessary to make the required repairs before winter and in fact, before school starts, if possible.\n\nI would estimate the cost would be in the vicinity of $60.00 but until such time as the floor is taken up and the steps removed, it will be impossible to know how much new material will be required.

The difference of $1.65 was to be paid in cash but through an oversight the envelope containing the money remained in the office until today.

They have been considerably delayed in making these desks, but I understand they are now nearly finished. Would it be possible for you to visit St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiaries during the next week and inspect these desks which, it is hoped, will be shipped before the end of this month. Following your visit, I would like a report from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

The desks are of very sturdy construction and very well finished. There is no doubt that they will be satisfactory.\n\nThey will be shipped to Indian Agent Whalen on Monday next, April 22nd.\n\n(Frs.

Undoubtedly he has reported to you in this respect. It was pointed out to him by the penitentiary officials that in view of this being an initial order, they would be glad to receive suggestions as to improvement after the desks have been in use for some time in order that these could be incorporated in later orders.\n\nThe delay in completing this first order is a source of regret both to the penitentiary and to this office, but you will doubtless appreciate that difficulties would be encountered which would not be present when dealing with future orders. Therefore, I bespeak your cooperation in the allotment of future orders for this article. Preferably, plans should be made well in advance in the event that materials are still in short supply due to the steel situation in the United States.\n\nI wish to thank you for the opportunity and cooperation displayed by your office in enabling the penitentiary to develop this new article of manufacture for the Government Service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.L.

This includes a 200 gallon tank and complete installing. The oil costs 11\u00bd\u00a2 a gallon.\n\nThe basement at the present time has a number of hot and cold pipes running through it and if the school room is to be enlarged with satisfactory results, these pipes would have to be removed. This could be done by changing over to a pipeless furnace.\n\nMay I hear from you regarding this change.\n\nEdward Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 10, 1946.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick,\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to installing an oil burner in the furnace at the St. Mary's Indian Day School. Please let me have more definite information regarding the type, size and, if possible, the catalogue number of the burner on which you have received a quotation from the Irving Oil Company.\n\nInstead of using oil, would you favour using coal? It might be possible to change the grates in the present furnace and coal would take up less space than wood.

B.\nAugust 3, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of June 3, regarding the converting of the furnace at the St. Mary's Indian School into a pipeless furnace.\n\nMr. Frank Flannagan, who is an expert in that line of work, promised to check the furnace and tell me if this could be done.\n\nIt was not until yesterday, however, that he did this, and informed me the furnace could be converted into a pipeless furnace at a cost of approximately $50.00. If this work is done, and the pipes removed in the basement, Sister Marietta wishes to have a Domestic Science room, which is also used for the grade 1, enlarged. In fact, her ambition is to build another room in the basement for grade 1 and have the present room used entirely for Domestic Science work.\n\nIt would cost approximately $300.00 for the labour and materials to complete the room.\n\nSister Marietta informed me that she would rather have the room complete and burn wood for the coming winter in the furnace, than to have the old burner installed and not have the additional room, but if finances were available, she thought it much better to install the oil burner as well. As the wood would have to be left out of doors and only two or three days supply put in at a time.\n\nIf this work is to be done, it should be commenced at once.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 12, 1946.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $50.00 for converting the furnace at the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nYou may also arrange for completing the room in the basement. If necessary, an expenditure of $300.00 for material and labour is approved, but this amount appears high.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEX'D.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| July 31    | Electricity supplied to the Saint Mary's Indian Day School during the month of August, as per account attached.

As mentioned to you previously, the materials from which these desks are manufactured are in extremely short supply and deliveries which might in normal cases be made within two or three weeks would now take as many months.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you on this point as it is desired to give you the best possible delivery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.L.

The delay was occasioned by non-delivery of angle iron needed for manufacture.\n\nIn the matter of desk orders, I wish to draw to your attention our letter of April 30, 1946, in which your cooperation was solicited in anticipating future orders. The present policy of the Government will not allow this Branch to proceed to manufacture in advance a line of articles unless the receiving department can give an assurance that the article will be taken after completion. If this Branch had had this assurance, we could have proceeded to purchase materials last April and had the desks ready for delivery when required at the beginning of the school year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.L.

School Districts. Some duties have been given to twice a year on a tour of inspection of schools in the territory where our Indian schools are situated. Some emphasis is placed on a close supervision to first examine the manner of instructions, discipline, methods taught, teaching in our schools. From the time fully reported to Department Office Park School, it becomes evident that the Indian children have been educated between the ages of six and usually about fourteen years. Consideration for these reasons, and the necessity to the Indians to secure all to the facilities and also the teachers by the best of men from an experienced teacher, in education of Affairs. Besides, right choice in selecting to send both of whom.\n\nI am Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

All the local Governments with the exception of New Brunswick fell in with this proposition and we are now receiving semi-annual reports from these inspectors and paying for such visits.\n\nThe attention of the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick was from time to time called to the omission of the Public School Inspectors of that Province to make the reports called for by this Department, but, up to 1891, we had not succeeded in obtaining any reports and after that date the matter was dropped.\n\nIn view of the failure on the part of the Provincial Government of New Brunswick to take any notice of the request made by this Department to secure the services of its inspectors, I do not know whether you would feel inclined to re-open negotiations to this end.\n\nThe outlay attendant upon the services rendered by the Public School Inspectors comes to about $1000.00 a year and little, if any, good is derived from the inspectors' visits. However, it may be considered that this money is well\nwell spent in the public interest, as it indicates the desire of the Department to have its schools conducted along the lines of the provincial public schools.\n\nI prepared a memorandum on this subject in June, 1895, which was submitted by the then Deputy Superintendent General to the Minister, setting forth the expense incurred and what I considered the poor return obtained for the expenditure. The Minister, however, did not feel disposed to disturb the existing arrangement without consulting Council in the matter. I am unable to obtain the original memorandum at present but a copy is placed herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have had charge here for two years, and during that period his attendance was not absent from school one half day.\n\nI think this is worthy of consideration on the part of the government, and that they should take some interest in the matter and thus encourage such attendance on the part of the Indian children here.

In this resignation, I am satisfied it will be difficult to replace her with a good teacher.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department\n\n[Signature]\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Farrell has forwarded the resignation of Miss Annetta Bradley, teacher of the Tobique Indian school.\n\nMiss Bradley's reasons for resigning are due to the conditions of the school accommodation and smallness of the salary. Miss Bradley is one of the best teachers the Department has had in its employ for some time. She has conducted the school with marked success, says the Public School Inspector, and the order and attendance are excellent, the pupils being greatly interested in their work. The Inspector concluded by stating her withdrawal would be a serious loss to the Indian school at Tobique, and recommended that her salary be raised. She was given an increase of $50 making her salary $350.00 per annum, and if you will refer to my memorandum of November 13 and to the Accountant's note thereof you will see that he recommended that she be paid at the rate of $400 from April 1, last. I think that if this recommendation had been carried out Miss Bradley would not likely have remained on, as the Department has under consideration the improvement of the school premises and is now awaiting Superintendent.\nBoyd's report as to what is best to be done in this direction.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Agent Farrell be informed that the Department will pay Miss Bradley $400 a year and provide better school accommodation and that he should ask her to reconsider her resignation, as it would be a great pity to lose her valuable services.\n\nMartin Benson\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFunds available for increase in salary.

Miss Sims called today and said she would take the position for the year and as she has had previous experience in the St. Regis school for two years, is a Roman Catholic and was well liked, being of a cheerful disposition, I think the Department could not do better than engage her. It would be difficult to fill the place temporarily, as teachers would not care to take it for this limited time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should proceed to Tobique so as to be able to open the school not later than the 31st of this month.

J. C. Ryan, Tobique Reserve N.B., a few days ago, in which he informs me that Miss Bradley has been ill recently, but she is now recovering. He also mentions that she intends looking up a school for teaching, but not at this time. Of course, I cannot be sure of this, but I believe that she was more favorable to her return to the Tobique School than the continuation of the present teacher. However, in looking through your letter of the 3rd July last No. 118387/1, I find therein stated that Miss Ethel Sims was employed as teacher of the Tobique Indian School for two years from above date. Therefore, in consequence of this statement, I prefer to make no recommendation in this matter whatever, but leave it entirely with the Department.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nJames Macmillan,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was not thought that Miss Bradley would wish to return till then, by which time suitable school accommodation would be provided.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJames Farrell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Annette A.

E. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N.B.\nEx'd\n\nOttawa, November 5th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the Regulations for the Education of Indian children clauses 1 to 7 provide for the compulsory attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fifteen, except under certain conditions clearly set forth.\n\nThe Indians on the Tobique Reserve have now a fine school house, well equipped, and a teacher of more than ordinary qualifications and ability. The Department is also providing means to teach sewing in the school.\n\nIn view of these conditions all the Indian children should be sent regularly to school, but it would appear that some of the parents are indifferent and do not take advantage of the excellent facilities provided to educate their children. The Department has, therefore, under consideration the question of putting the regulations in force on this Reserve. The first step will be the appointment of a Truant Officer and it has been suggested that the Constable combine these with his other duties.\n\nYou will be good enough to discuss this matter with the Indian Council and ascertain upon what terms the Constable would be willing to undertake this work.\n\nI am sending you under separate cover four copies of the regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. E. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N.B.\n\nSecretary.\nSchool I believe this term closes on the 15th Dec. or on the 15th if the teacher attends the County Institute.\n\nWe purpose closing school this year as usual, with a little entertainment and a nice tree.\n\nLast year I believe the Dept was kind enough to send the teacher a check for $20.00 to expend for this purpose.\n\nI would kindly ask the Dept. if they would extend their kindness to this this year as before.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nAnnette A. Bradley Teacher\nSt. Ignace Pt. School No. 3.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the department will make you a grant of the sum of $10.00 towards the purchase of prizes for a Christmas tree in connection with the Tobique school. Your account should show in detail the articles purchased with prices and should be forwarded to the Department through the Indian Agent.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that schools ordinarily do not close till a date one week from the time mentioned by you, or the 22nd instant. It will be impossible to teach the required number of days if the school is closed so early in the term. The Department will, however, be pleased to grant you the necessary number of days in order that you may attend the meeting of the County Teachers' Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss A. Bradley,\nTeacher,\nAndover, N.B.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Tobique Indian Day school for the month of September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks with reference to the teaching of domestic science, etc., by the teacher on this reserve have been noted, and the Department will be glad to hear from you at a later date should it be found necessary to fit up the hall for the purpose of conducting the classes.\n\nI presume that the note from Miss Bradley to which you refer was that in which she asked for a grant towards a Christmas tree. I beg to say that the expenditure of the sum of $10.00 has been authorized.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have your views at an early date in reference to the enforcement of the regulations for compulsory attendance at the schools on this reserve, which was dealt with in official letter of the 5th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. E. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N.B.\nTo the Indian Affairs,\n\nReceived your letter & Dec. 31st 1910.\n\nIn which you authorized the grant of $10,000 for the prizes and a Christmas tree.\n\nEnclosed find the itemized bill which you asked for & articles purchased. Your check for the amount had not arrived to pay for articles purchased, but I found I could buy cheaper by buying money down, so need not worry about whether the said check will be forwarded.\n\nIn this same letter you gave me permission to attend the County Institute which I did as you will see by certificate enclosed with return. You also called my attention to the fact that schools generally don't close until 2nd inst.\n\nAs our Provincial Regulations state school opens on the Monday after New Year's Day this year 1910. Jan 3rd therefore to have the required two weeks vacation our schools closed on Dec 7th. The teacher attends the Institute three days early and two days late Institute.\n\nAs there is nothing to guide me as to holidays or vacations I supposed she expected me to follow other provincial regulations in these matters. In this satisfactory to Indian Dept.\n\nAnd I mentioned above attended the County Institute which was a very educative one for teachers and trust the time was very profitably spent. I will enclose one of the programmes to you.\nWhile there I had an interesting conversation with Mr. B. Kidner our Provincial Director of Manual Training in the Province's Provincial Normal School. He asked me what manual training would be very profitable education for the Indian boys. He said he would send me in his return home, and through account with the school, I could get material needed to take the native work with the boys in my school.\n\nIn your letter Nov 24th No. 183771 you asked for a recommendation from me on the necessity of providing work for the boys while the girls were sent out. When I get word from Mr. Kidner about the native work I will forward same to you for your consideration.\n\nIn the same letter you inquired me the sale price which the material purchased for sewing in school was, stating you would send me the $10.00 check as proposed and I was to forward an itemized account of each piece and purchased amount and at end current quarter. This I am unable to do as the check for $10.00 has never reached me. And the Bill at Mr. Beville and Mr. Evans remain unpaid.\n\nI thank the idea of sewing in school is welcome and the children seem very much interested. They so far have made handkerchiefs and little purses which are very useful for them to use.\n\nAs I received your letter in which you authorized the formation of the Native Domestic Science Association just a week before closing I thought it better to not begin the work until...\nthe beginning a work in January in case their enthusiasm might die out in the work during the vacation. So after the opening of school in January this work will be taken up at the salary mentioned in your letter of Nov. 24th. If you also stand by me to send bill or cards given as rewards. Enclosed I find bill for same.\n\nTrusting these matters relating to Indian matters and Indian Education are being carried out by me to your entire satisfaction. And assuring you of my devoted interest in the same.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nAnnette A. Bradley, Teacher\n\n[Signature]\n\nVia Co.

Your accounts for the goods bought, as well as all accounts, should be forwarded through the Indian Agent, and the Department would be glad if you would bear this in mind. The Department will await your report on the teaching of manual training to the boys.\n\nThe Department trusts that the Society for the purpose of teaching domestic science will prove successful, and will await your reports.\n\nThe following of the provincial regulations with reference to holidays is satisfactory to the Department, provided the school is kept open the required number of days.\n\nThe Department is pleased to know that the meeting of\n\nMiss Annette A.

Also try to show them the value of regular attendance, and get parents interested.\n\nI generally offer a prize for attendance.\n\nIn my experience in this Indian school I find that I can accomplish more by offering a reward and holding out an incentive in the way of a prize, than in any other way. No matter how trifling the reward they will work for it. If it were not for the expense I should like to be able to give a reward for those pupils who attend every day each month without any absent or tardy marks. Tardiness is a great fault in this school. I tried keeping and having them write tardy. But this term I am trying the giving of a half of a half-holiday to those present and not tardy for two weeks. I find this way is much better.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your Annual Report on the Tobique School, in which you state that you would like to be able to give a reward to those pupils who attend every day each month, the Department would like to know the nature of the reward you propose to give and also to have an estimate of the cost monthly of carrying out your suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Annette A. Bradley,\nTeacher,\nTobique Point,\nVia Andover, N.B.\nIn reply to your letter No. 18387/1 of March 25th, in which you referred to my annual report on the Tobique School, in which I recommended a reward for attendance, and in which you asked for nature of award & cost. Would say that I should like to give something in the form of a book, booklet or picture (to little ones) to those who had perfect attendance & punctuality. I should judge it would cost perhaps from $1.50 to $2.00 according to perfection of attendance, for they'd find resort to anything much quicker when a reward is offered.\n\nRegarding the money and pending answers when I can get little books etc., much cheaper than I can here. That is the way I do with getting the cards. Send to firms which deal in them. How they do enjoy getting that credit. Good merit card although it means only one twentieth part of a picture card, and in this way we have all given short care & out-houses carefully attended to promptly without cost.\n\nI hope you will note in my return the good attendance of the boys at my school.\n\nThe two book which you sent me for prizes which reached me too late for making the People of the Plains. Were given as awards at the end of the March Quarter.\nThe two pupils whom I considered as the most deserving of them were:\n\nPeter Tremblay aged 14 yrs Grade II\nGabriel Perley aged 11\n\nThese two pupils were never tardy, missed nothing of their own fault\u2014only being the two boys who serve assist the parish priest in the services of the church hall to be absent from school. Peter Tremblay two mornings and Gabriel Perley three mornings but as soon as they were free came at once to school. In school they are very diligent and take great interest in their work and their conduct is above reproach.\n\nAnother boy John Devore aged 14 yrs Grade III having never missed a day in the three years I have taught\u2014here I feel I deserved a reward, but the books sold were rather deep for him. So I gave him a Bible History which I had.\n\nI sincerely hope the Dept will take an active interest in these three young boys and encourage them in their education. For they are very, very good boys and I feel they would make something good.\n\nI wish it were possible for the Dept to pave their way clear to place them in some decent boarding school and educate them so that evil company or some other companions might not spoil them. Then when they grow...\nAs they I feel would exert a great influence for good in the rest of their race. I should like very much to see the experiment tried.\n\nI should like to call the attention of the Dept. to the matter of school material ordered.\n\nWhen here before all things asked how my requisitions were sent and in the best manner. This year something is omitted each time and the material seems of a very inferior quality not what I ask for at all. Why so this?\n\nI was much surprised to find that the Dept. refused to send me the water-colors and Cabinet of Weights & Measures. If they knew the difficulty in teaching Indian children a thing which could not be demonstrated to them while teaching it. I am sure they should never have refused to send it. As these weights & measures are very necessary part of a practical education.\n\nI also asked Dept. to kindly send me a picture of our modern King Queen. But I think they must have overlooked the matter, as never heard if you were willing to do so or not.\n\nYours Res. respectfully,\n\nAnnette L. Bradley, teacher\n\nTo Superintendent R.S.\n\nP.S. Now that spring is at hand I trust the Dept. will not neglect the laying off & putting up of our playground and make arrangements for the setting out of trees around the outside limits of grounds.\nOttawa, April 18, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 11th instant in reference to school matters on the Tobique Reserve.\n\nWith regard to the distribution of prizes I may say that the Department is prepared to allow an expenditure of $1.50 a month for the ten school months of the year, on the understanding that no call will be made for any special occasion in addition to this. The nature of the prizes to be purchased will be left to your own discretion.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the three boys who have been very regular in attendance for some years have been read with much interest and it is the wish of the Department to encourage boys of this kind, who show diligence and special aptitude in the day schools, to obtain a higher education, if they so desire. It is thought, however, that they should complete the course in the day school and pass at least the Entrance Examination to the High School. Then, should they wish to continue, special and individual consideration will be given each application for aid.\n\nThe Department is very sorry to learn that the school material that has been supplied you is of an inferior nature. The fault in this case rests with the Stationery Office and I have to ask you to be good enough to state\n\nMiss Annetta A. Bradley,\nTeacher,\nTobique Point, N.B.\nspecifically the articles you received that were not up to the standard, so that the matter can be taken up with that office.\n\nThe cabinet of Weights and Measures will be ordered and on the last requisition six complete boxes of water colours were asked to be sent from the Art Metropole, Toronto, and a further supply of brushes will also be ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nIn reply to your letter of April 17th No. 118377, in reference to school supplies for months, I wish to express my appreciation of your interest in the Tobique Pt. School, and thank you for the grant of $1.50 per month for six months in the year. You also state that this is understood that no call be made for any special occasion. By this do you mean that you wish the $1.50 per month to cover the absence of $1.50 per quarter which I have previously spent for cards?\n\nIn reference to the inferior materials sent, I state as follows: Lead pencils are the cheap kind with the lead in pieces or as brittle as breaks with sharpening, causing them to wear out very quickly and the little eraser in end is next to nothing. The crayons ordered were not as ordered, as we wanted the large lead pencil erasers. The rulers sent were the little one cent rulers. The blank scribble ordered sometime ago were of very inferior paper. Making bookends, the also hot as good as those formerly sent.\n\nThe most water colors were never sent!\n\nAnnette A. Bradley\n\nTobique Pt., N.B.\nOttawa, May 7, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 2nd, and in reply I beg to say that by a special grant for prizes was meant an allowance at the end of the June quarter or at Christmas time. The Department had no intention of withdrawing the grant of $1.00 per quarter for the merit cards which you are at present using.\n\nThe part of your communication in reference to school material will be dealt with in another letter.\n\nI may add that it would be a great convenience to the Department for the purpose of filing if you would refer to only one subject in each communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Annetta A.

Redley Esq.,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Redley,\n\nEnclosed you will please find a letter from Miss Bradley which speaks for itself. I believe she is entitled more than what you paid her. Will you please look into the matter and forward to her the balance she still claims and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPius Michaud\nOttawa, December 23, 1910.\n\nDear Mr. Michaud,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing a letter addressed to you by Miss Bradley, late teacher of the Tobique Indian School, in reference to the amount of salary paid her for her services during the current school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary appropriated for this school is $400.00 per annum. The school year commences after the summer holidays and ends on June 30th of each year. Miss Bradley completed a year on June 30th last, and received her full salary of $400.00. During the current year she taught 59 days.\n\nIn computing salaries for broken periods this Department makes payment in the proportion that the number of days taught bears to the total number of teaching days in the year, which is 216. This is manifestly an equitable method of computation in such cases. Miss Bradley was, therefore, paid 59/216 of $400.00 or $109.36.\n\nThis leaves the proper proportion of the year's\n\nP. Michaud, Esq., M.P.,\nCarrister, etc.,\nEdmundston, N.B.\nappropriation available in instances of this kind for the payment of a successor.\n\nMiss Bradley wishes to take only one quarter of the year into consideration. This would give her $100.00 for the 24 days taught in September, which would be at the rate of $900.00 per annum, and a proportionate amount of the salary for the next quarter, which would be according to her calculation $59.32, or a total of $159.32.\n\nHad Miss Bradley's claim been paid and had a new teacher taken charge immediately upon her leaving, the balance available for the new appointee would be only $240.68 and she would for this amount have to teach some 157 days. You will readily see that this would be an injustice.\n\nI may say in conclusion that the Auditor General's Department is aware of the system used by this Department in making these computations and in auditing the payments makes use of the same method.\n\nWith these explanations I think you will recognize\nthat Miss Bradley has been fairly dealt with.\n\nMiss Bradley's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nMiss McLeod wishes to know if the allowance of $1.00 per month for cards and $1.50 per month for prizes, which was allowed Miss Bradley, is to be continued.

This treaty grants France all her demands; it concedes to her a predominant influence in the whole of Morocco. All that Germany gets for her interference is a vast armament worth tens of millions of Lads Chaim and a naval stronghold on the Congo, to give her a port on that river. She will retire from Agadir, the Moroccan port which she seized in order to force France to divide up. The French Premier, Caillier, in a recent statement declares that the time has come when Africa can no longer be closed to civilization by barbarism. The idea of \"Morocco for the Moroccans\" will no longer do, he says, for Morocco is so near Europe that peace and order must be maintained there. Traders of other nations will be protected, but France will hereafter have a free hand among the Moors.\n\nLuckily the wars in Tripoli and China cropped up to occupy attention, else the humiliating bargain which Germany made with France over securing the Morocco road would have caused much more trouble than it has. Even now it has made lots of bad feeling in Germany, for it is felt that the government backed down before English threats. A bit of a row was going on in the Reichstag (German Parliament) over the matter. Herr Bebel the Socialist leader demanded that this and all treaties should be submitted for approval. The rejection to the right hon. Conservative Leader Heydebrand, known as the \"Uncrowned King of Prussia,\" was very bitter toward England; German would be found ready, said he, to make sacrifices of fortune and life in order to fight this enemy. \"The German people will give a German answer to this English question,\" he asserted. Crown Prince Frederick William was present during the discussion and gave encouragement to the critics of his father's government. It is reported that Emperor William was very angry when he heard of this and rebuked the future emperor-to-be with unmistakable severity.\n\nTHE ITALO-TURKISH WAR.\n\nReliable news of the Italo-Turkish war is meager, the diplomats doing everything that it is obvious that most of them are made up out of whole cloth in the newspaper offices. Correspondents who have told the situation too graphically have been expelled from Tripoli by the Italian authorities. The Turks and the Italians are incensed at the criticisms that have been made against their government for seizing Tripoli and they deny the charges of cruelty made against the Turks. Military operations seem to be going on around Tripoli and the neighboring ports, but nothing decisive. The Italians are said to use a fleet of balloons for scout purposes in locating the enemy. The Arabs, however, believe that the Turks are crafty, where they regard with superstitions fear. There is small chance that any of the powers will mix in the war, in spite of the great sentimental sympathy. The practice is not to intervene in such cases unless both sides ask for a peacemaker. Turkey has called for intervention, but Italy would spurn it.\n\nTHE MAINE LIQUOR LAW.\n\nFor over forty years the State of Maine had a prohibitory liquor law. The liquor interests brought on a contest to repeal the law. For a long time the results were in doubt. Alternately Maine was said to be dry and said to be then wet. Finally the government made a recount and the state is officially proclaimed dry by a majority of 758.\n\nHE WHO LAUGHS LAST LAUGHS BEST\n\nOur cartoonist has put the situation very graphically. The liquor interests figured as a beer barrel with a grip full of bottles in his hand is leaving Maine (see the map under his feet) on the jump, holding the proclamation \"Maine Stays Dry\" in his other hand.\n\nACROSS THE CONTINENT IN AN AIR SHIP.\n\nThe wonderful tales in the \"Arabian Nights\" are being outdone every day by the marvelous achievements of modern science. The aeroplane flight of Gullbreth P Rodgers across the continent from New York City to Pasadena in California is the latest of these modern miracles. Our grandfathers, even our fathers, twenty years ago would have laughed the prediction of such an achievement out of the realm of remote possibilities.\n\nStarting from Sheepshead Bay race-track, Long Island, New York, on September 17, Mr. Rodgers reached Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles, on November 5, having traveled a distance of 3,290 miles in forty-nine days. The best previous record was set by Mr. Hubert H. Aldred's flight of 1,265 miles from St. Louis to New York. (See Canadian Teacher, page 154.) Rodger's success was wrested by courage and perseverance from a long series of failures. At the beginning of his second day's flight his Wright machine crashed into a tree, and four days later it broke two propeller-blades in a collision with a horse-drawn ferry. A string of troubles followed and mishaps worried him across half a dozen States. But he came through his adventures practically uninjured, although, according to a Pasadena correspondent, \"His airplane has been eaten and repaired so many times that only the vertical rudder and the dripping-pan remain of the original outfit with which he started.\"\n\nFive years ago the Wright Brothers were the only men in the world who could fly heavier-than-air machines. In the fall of 1906 they pointed with pride to the fact that they had been up in the air 160 times and had covered altogether exactly 1,000 miles, or an average of a mile each flight; but they had one wonderful record of being up for over four hours and covering twenty-four miles.\n\nAnd now we have just been aviator Rodgers complete his journey of over 3,100 miles from New York to Los Angeles, in less than six weeks, and a total flying-time of about three days.\nCOMPOSITION\n\nHILDA'S CHRISTMAS.\n\nStanding apart from the childish throng,\nLittle Hilda was silent and sad;\nShe could not join in the happy song,\nShe could not echo the voices glad.\n\n\"What can I do on Christmas day?\nI am so little and we are so poor.\"\nShe sat alone here in the corner.\n\"I wish there never was a Christmas more.\"\n\n\"Mother is sick, and father can't know\nHow children talk of their gifts and joy,\nOr he'd surely try, he loves me so,\nTo get me just one single toy.\"\n\n\"But Christmas is not for you to get,\"\nShe said, with a voice tender and low.\n\"It's for what you give,\" said wee Janet,\nAnd the words made Hilda's heart rejoice.\n\n\"It isn't our birthday,\" went on the mite,\n\"It is Christ's, you know; and I think He'd say\nIf He were to talk to us to-night,\nThat He'd wish us to keep it His own way.\"\n\nA plan came into Hilda's head;\nIt seemed to her she could hardly wait;\n\"I can't give nice things,\" she bravely said,\n\"But I'll do what I can to celebrate.\n\n\"I can give the baby a day of fun;\nI can take my plant to the poor, lame boy;\nI can do something for the old folks' home;\nAnd the old kite I can mend for Roy.\n\n\"I can read to father and save his eyes;\nI can feed the birds in the locust grove;\nI can give the squirrels a fine surprise,\nAnd grandma shall have a letter of love.\"\n\nNow when the work was done and done,\nAnd Hilda cried to bed\u2014\nShe forgot that she had no gift of her own\u2014\n\"What a lovely Christmas it was!\" she said.\n\n1. Tell the story of this poem in your own words.\n\n2. By whom?\n\n3. Where Hilda was and what she was doing.\n\n4. What she thought about Christmas.\n\n5. What Janet said about Christmas.\n\n6.

At the first of these lessons the teacher should explain the work of the class. These drawings may be used in the manner shown on this page. Sprays of grass and leaves, with pencil marks in color, make simple landscapes, offer suitable material for calendars. The teacher may have mounting board cut to the desired size at any print shop. A pupil's sketch may be drawn and trimmed and mounted upon the card, and below the drawing may be pasted a small calendar pad. In this way the children are able to construct this most useful article in an acceptable manner. Calendars are specially interesting at this time of the year, and may afterwards be utilized as Christmas or New Year's gifts by their makers.\n\nNATURE STUDY\n\nANIMALS IN WINTER.\n\n1.

Straight in the middle of the room, cramped in the freedom of its growth by no encircling walls or moon-reached ceiling, a shadowy tree arises; and looking up into the dreamy brightness of its top I lose myself in visions of Christmas recollections. \"That bark! The Watts are playing, and they break my childish sleep! What images do I associate with the Christmas music, as I see them set forth on the Christmas Tree? Known before all the others, keeping far apart from all the others, they\ngather round my little bed.\" An angel speaking to a group of shepherds in a field; some travelers, with eyes uplifted, following a star; a baby in a manger. Child sleeping among sheep; a child with grave features, a solemn Figure, with a mild and beautiful face, raising a dead girl by the hand; again, near a city gate, calling back the son of a widow, on his bier, to life; a cross, with a locket hanging from an open ring of a chamber where He sits, and letting down a sick person on a bed, with ropes; the same, in a tempest, walking on the water to a ship; again, on a sea shore, standing in great multitudes; again, with a child upon His knees, and other children round; again, resting sight to the blind, speech to the dumb, hearing to the deaf, health to the sick, strength to the weak, and help to the ignorant; again, dying upon a cross, watched by armed soldiers, a thick darkness coming on, the earth beginning to shake, and only voices heard, crying out for them, for they do not what they do there. A moment's pause, O vanishing tree, of which the lower boughs are dark to me as yet, and let me look once more! I know them, and although I have no mother whereupon I have loved have love and smiled; from which they are departed. But far above, I see the Raiser of the dead girl and the widow's son; and God is good! Oh, may I, with a gray head, turn a child's heart to that Figure yet, and a child's trustfulness and confidence.\n\nDickens.\n\nQUESTIONS.\n\n1.

The antecedent may be either a noun or a pronoun; as\n\nThese boys who were late may remain.\n\nThose who came early may be excused.\n\n(a) The antecedent, as the word indicates, is generally placed before the pronoun; but it may be placed after the pronoun, as in the sentence:\n\n1. John, saw these things.\n\n2. Who went with you?\n\nThe antecedent of \"they\" in 1 is known to the speaker and perhaps to the hearer, but it is not expressed.\n\nThe antecedent of \"who\" in 2 is found only in the answer.\n\n(a) Sometimes the antecedent consists of two or more words connected by a conjunction, as in the following sentences:\n\n1. John and James took their sister with them.\n\n2. It was Mary or her sister Jane who was ill.\n\nThe subject \"John and James\" is the antecedent of \"their\" in 1, and the complement \"Mary or her sister Jane\" is the antecedent of \"who\" in 2. In what number is each of these antecedents?\n\nNote carefully the antecedents of personal pronouns, especially when they are separated from their pronouns by several words, as in the sentences:\n\n1. One of the men who were sent lost his way.\n\n2. Let each of the girls take her own book.\n\n3. A man's manners frequently show his bringing up.\n\nThe antecedent of \"his\" in 1 is \"one\"; of \"her\" in 2 is \"each\"; of \"him\" in 3 is \"man's.\"\n\nEXERCISE XII.\n\nPoint out the conjunctive or relative and personal pronouns and their antecedents in the following sentences:\n\n1. I do not know my lesson.\n\n2. It was James or Paul who lost his pencil.\n\n3. This is one of the boys that ran away from their homes.\n\n4. Will either of you lend me his pencil?\n\n5. Neither of the men means what he says.\n\n6. The boy brought the book for which he was sent.\n\n7. Every one of us took off his hat.\n\n8. All the boys and girls who came had a pleasant time.\n\n9. Robert had a knife and two pennies in his pocket which he lost.\n\n10. Mary had a little lamb; its fleece was white as snow. It followed her to school one day, which was against the rule.\n\nPERSON OF PRONOUNS.\n\nMake a list of personal and demonstrative pronouns, dividing them into three groups, namely: (1) those that refer to the speaker; (2) those that represent the person spoken to; (3) those that represent the person or thing spoken of. Pronouns of group 1 are in the first person; those of group 2 are in the second person; and those of group 3 are in the third person.\n\nThe relative and interrogative pronouns may be in any one of the three persons, depending upon their use, as shown in the following sentences:\n\n1. It was I who spoke first.\n\n2. It was you who did the best.\n\n3. It was he who won the prize.\n\n4. They who will come shall do these things.\n\n5. Which of us shall go? I will go.\n\nWho in 1 is in the first person, because its antecedent is in the first person.\n\nWhy is who in 2 in the second person?\n\nIn what person is who in 3, and why?\n\nIn what person is who in 4, and why?\n\nWho in 5 is in the third person, and why?\n\nUse the relative that in a sentence in the first person.\n\nFrom these examples we see that\n\nPronouns must agree with their antecedents in person.\n\nEXERCISE XIII.\n\nPick out the pronouns in the following sentences and tell in what person each pronoun is:\n\n1. It was I who found the money.\n\n2. Were you at his house last evening?\n\n3. Are these the books which you asked me to get?\n4. Whose knife is that? That is my knife.\n\n5. Was it you who put out the light?\n\n6. They that are whole have no need of a physician.\n\n7. Ye crags and peaks, I'm with you once again.\n\n8. I, John, your brother, ... was in the isle that is called Patmos.\n\n9. I that speak unto thee am he.\n\n**Gender of Pronouns**\n\n(a) The gender of pronouns, like that of nouns, is determined both by their form and by their use. Thus the gender of \"he,\" \"his,\" \"him,\" \"she,\" \"her,\" and \"it\" is unchangeable; but the gender of other pronouns can be known only by their use in sentences; as, for example,\n\n1. The man whose horse has returned.\n\n2. I answered the letter which came yesterday.\n\n3. These are the girls that did so well.\n\n4. The ladies who were present removed their hats.\n\nWho in 1 is masculine, because it refers to boy. Which in 2 is in what gender, and why? Give the gender of the italicized pronouns in 3 and 4. If you change the meaning of any of these nouns, shall we be obliged to change the pronouns?\n\n(c) When the gender of the antecedent is not known the pronoun relating to it is masculine. For example, in the sentence \"The owner of this cat could not find his cat,\" the pronoun \"his\" is represented by the masculine pronoun \"his.\"\n\nBut some words like \"baby,\" \"animal,\" \"fish,\" etc., which include both males and females are represented by the neuter pronoun \"it\" or \"its,\" etc.\n\nThe baby is crying for its food.\n\nThey chained the dog because it was cross.\n\n(d) When the antecedent consists of nouns of different gender, corresponding pronouns should be used, as:\n\nEvery boy and every girl must sign his or her name.\n\nSee an awkward use of the pronouns may be avoided by changing the sentence to:\n\nAll the boys and girls must sign their names.\n\n**Exercise XIV**\n\nMake a choice of pronouns in filling blanks and give reasons for your choice.\n\n1. The sun has run (his, its) daily course.\n\n2. The ship moves majestically on (her, its) way.\n\n3. If any one wants this (he, she) may have it.\n\n4. When the child fell (he, it) cried loudly.\n\n5. If you are kind to an animal (he, it) will be kind to you.\n\n6. There were ten candidates (who, which) presented themselves.\n\n7. He caught a fish and then cooked (him, it) for supper.\n\n8. The cat mews when (he, she, it) wants something to eat.\n\n9. These are the girls (that, which) did so well.\n\n**Number of Pronouns**\n\nShow by examples that number in pronouns like number in nouns is denoted by their form or use.\n\n**Exercise XV**\n\n1. Define number as applied to nouns and pronouns; singular number; plural number.\n\n2. Make a list of nine personal pronouns.\n\nMark with the letter \"S\" those that are used in the singular number only; with the letter \"P\" those that are used in the plural number only; and with the letters \"S, P,\" those that are used in both numbers.\n\nTo the Teacher\u2014No answers have been given to these questions. They are simple.\n\nYou is the only personal pronoun whose form alone does not indicate its number. How is the number of this pronoun shown? Give examples\n\n1. The following notes may assist you in the use of the demonstrative and indefinite pronouns.\n\n(a) \"This,\" \"that,\" \"these,\" \"those,\" \"every,\" and \"each\" refer to the singular number.\n\n(b) \"Either\" and \"neither\" refer to one of two persons or things, and are therefore singular. Thus in speaking of two persons we say,\n\nNeither of the two brothers earned his own living.\n\n(c) \"None\" may be used in both numbers, as:\n\nThere is none (no one) that doth good, no, not one.\n\nNone (not any) of these things move me.\n\n(d) \"Few,\" \"many,\" \"these,\" \"those,\" and \"several\" are used only in the plural number.\n\n(e) \"Some\" when it refers to quantity is singular; but when it refers to number it is plural. Thus we should say, \"Some of the flour was wasted,\" and \"Some of the books were torn.\"\n\nThe pronouns \"all\" and \"any\" are also used in this way.\n\nAll of the boys were found.\n\nNot any of the boys were found.\n\nAll of the money was found.\n\nNot any of the money was found.\n\n(f) \"Former,\" \"latter,\" \"first,\" \"last,\" and \"same\" may refer to singular or plural substantives and therefore may be in either number, as\n\nI was the first to arrive.\n\nWe were the first to arrive.\n\nThe first settlers of New England were Pilgrims and Puritans; the former were Separatists, the latter were not.\n\nMr. Smith and his brother were pupils of mine; the former was always good in his studies, but the latter was somewhat slow.\n\nIt was they that I saw before.\n\nThey were the same that I saw before.\n\n2. We cannot tell from the form of a relative or interrogative pronoun whether one object or more than one object is referred to in its antecedent; so, in number, pronouns agree with their antecedents; that is, the number of a pronoun is always the same as that of the word for which it stands. For this reason, if we do not know the number of a noun in its form, we have only to ascertain the number of its pronoun. What is the number of \"who\" in each of the following sentences?\n\nThat is the boy who was injured.\n\nThose are the boys who were injured.\n\nIn the sentence \"He is one of the greatest actors that have ever been here,\" \"that\" is plural to agree with its antecedent, \"actors.\"\n\nNote: In the statement \"The minister made a frequent mistake of regarding 'one' as the antecedent of 'that,' \" and of saying, therefore, \"He is one of the greatest actors that has ever been here.\"\n\n3. Great care should be taken in using pronouns the antecedents of which are compound in form. In the sentence \"It is the governor who is to be voted for\" and \"It is the President or the governor who is to be voted for,\" what is the antecedent of \"who\" in each sentence? What is the number of \"who\" in the first sentence? in the second sentence?\n\nIn the sentence \"The secretary and treasurer resigned his position\" and \"The secretary and treasurer resigned their positions,\" why is \"his\" used in the first sentence and \"their\" in the second?\n\nIn the sentence \"Miss Rose may bring her competition here to be corrected,\" why is \"her\" and not \"their\" used?\n\n4. Mistakes are frequently made in the use of pronouns whose antecedents are collective nouns or indefinite pronouns, especially when the pronouns are used without nouns closely connected. For example, in the sentence \"Neither of my brothers brought his books,\" the indefinite pronoun \"neither\" is singular and therefore requires \"has\" and not \"have\" to agree with it.\n\nIn the sentence \"The Board of Aldermen adjourned its session at ten o'clock,\" the collective noun \"Board\" is used in the singular and therefore requires the pronoun \"its\" to be used.\n\nBut in the sentence \"The Board of Aldermen were divided in their opinion,\" \"its\" and not \"its\" is used, because the antecedent, \"Board\" is used in the plural.\n\nA pronoun agrees with its antecedent in person, number, and gender.\n\n**Exercise XVI**\n\nExamine carefully the use of the pronouns in the following sentences:\n\n1. Each of the girls gives what she can.\n\n2. One of the boys brought his camera with him.\n\n3. Let every one do what he pleases.\n\n4. Neither of the ladies did what she planned to do.\n\n5. That is one of the men who were injured.\n\n6. He sold each of the farms for what it was worth.\n\n7. Some of the money which he lost was found.\n\n8. It is John or William who has forgotten to ring the bell.\n\n9. Every one may have a ticket if he is willing to pay for it.\n\n10. Will either of you lend me his knife for a few minutes?\n\n11. Every man and every boy present did as he was told.\n\n12. Everybody went into the woods and amused himself as best he could.\nEXERCISE XVII.\n\nGive the person, number, and gender of each pronoun in the following sentences and give the reason for its use:\n\n1. John said that his sisters could not come because they were ill.\n2. He is one of the best men that work here.\n3. There is one of the books which are not allowed in the library.\n4. Some who were here last year brought their golf sticks with them.\n5. Each of the pupils is expected to do his best.\n6. The one who threw the stone will please raise his hand.\n\nEXERCISE XVIII.\n\nFill each blank with a suitable pronoun and give a reason for your choice.\n\n1.

Let each of you do \u2014\u2014\u2014 best.\n10. As officer and private \u2014\u2014\u2014 always did duty.\n11. The club will hold \u2014\u2014\u2014 meeting next Saturday evening.\n12.

At an early period in the history of Holland, a boy was born in Haarlem, a town remarkable for its variety of fortune.

When placed together, as shown, they serve as a frame for the sketch. Since they can be moved back and forth, the size and position of the frame can be varied until the best arrangement within the enclosure is determined. When work is to be arranged within an enclosure, or when it is to be trimmed and used on calendars or booklets, as in Figs. 2 and 3, this little device will be found very helpful. If the sketch is trimmed and the arrangement afterwards found to be undesirable, it cannot be changed. By the aid of the finder, the greatest number of arrangements can be made and one decided upon as best, before any trimming is done. After you have chosen the arrangement you like best and with the finder still on the sketch, as shown in the illustration, mark inside the finder, thus making an enclosure to which the drawing may be trimmed. In this way make several compositions from sketches that you already have, or from others which you may make.\nYour little sister has never seen this picture. Perhaps you would like to tell her about it when you go home.\n\nHow many living things are in the picture? How many persons do you see? How old are the children?

The blind man was big and strong, but he did not know the way.\n\nThe blind man came to the lame man and said: \"We must both go to the feast. You know the way there; I do not know the way. I will carry you. You must be the head and eyes, and I will be the body and legs.\"\n\n\"Very good!\" said the lame man. \"I want to go very much. You are very kind to carry me. If you will be the body and legs, I will be the head and eyes, and we can both go.\"\n\nThe blind man took the lame man upon his back, and in this way they both went to the feast, and had a fine time.\n\n1.

Name all the animals you have seen that have long tails.\n2. What use is a cow's tail?\n3. What use is a dog's tail? A hen's tail?\n4. What use is a horse's tail? A fish's tail?\n\nTHINGS TO DRAW\nThere is nothing better to keep Teacher, Parent, Pupil, in touch with one another than the use of monthly report cards. We have them for each class in the Public School; also for Separate Schools.\n\nPrice 25 cents per dozen. Envelopes for same, if desired. 10 cents per dozen.\n\n**Promotion Card**\n\nEvery pupil passing an examination should receive recognition of his or her promotion. There is no better way to do this than by using our **CERTIFICATE OF STANDING**\n\nAt the close of each school term, when promotions take place, nothing gives GREATER INTEREST to the event than the awarding of these cards. Price 25c. per dozen.\n\n**The Canadian Teacher**\n\n| Quantity | Price   |\n|----------|---------|\n| 3 issues | $0.25   |\n| 5 \"      | $0.40   |\n| 10 \"     | $0.75   |\n| 15 \"     | $1.00   |\n| 10 \" (1 year) | $1.25 |\n| United States | $1.50 |\n| Foreign (1 year) | 6 shillings |\n\nSubscriptions are payable in advance.\nCurrent Events\n\nMOROCCAN TREATY SIGNED.\n\nThe Moroccan war cloud was dispelled finally when the long-discussed treaty between France and Germany on the subject was adopted. This treaty grants France all her demands; it concedes to her a predominant influence in the whole of Morocco. All the German claims for interference is a very small wedge of territory north of Lake Chad and a small frontage on the Congo, to give her a port on that river. She will remain from Agadz\u00e9 to Nouadibou, which she sought in order to force France to divide her share. French Premier Caillaux in a public statement declares that the time has come when Africa can no longer be closed to civilization by barbarism. The idea of \"Moors for the Moors\" will not do, he says, for Morocco is so near Europe that peace and order must be maintained there. Traders of other nations will be protected, but France will hereafter have a free hand among the Moors.\n\nLuckily the wars in Tripoli and China cropped up to occupy attention, else the humiliating bargain which Germany made with France over cutting off Morocco from war would have caused much more trouble than it has. Even now it has lots of bad feeling in Germany, for it is felt that the government backed down before English threats. A big rumpus was raised in the reichstag (German parliament) by Socialists like Herr Bebel the Socialist leader demanded that this and all treaties should be submitted for approval or rejection to the reichstag. Conservative Leader Heydebrand, known as the \"Unrowned King of Prussia,\" was very bitter toward England; Germans would be found ready, said he, to make sacrifices of fortune and life in order to fight this enemy. \"The German will give a German answer to this English question,\" he asserted. Crown Prince Frederick William was present during the stormy session and that evening wrote to the critics of his father's government. It is reported that Emperor William was very angry when he heard of this and rebuked the future emperor-to-be with unmistakable severity.\n\nTHE ITALO-TURKISH WAR.\n\nReliable news of the Italo-Turkish war is meager. The dispatches are so conflicting that it is obvious that most of them are made up out of whole cloth, in foreign telegraph offices. Correspondents who have told the situation too graphically have been expelled from Tripoli by the Italian authorities. The Italians in Italy and abroad are very hot at the criticisms that have been made against their government for failing in Tripoli; they deny the charges of cruelty made against their soldiers. More or less fighting seems to be going on around Tripoli and the neighboring places, but nothing extensive. The Italians are said to be effect of balloons for reconnoitering, locating the enemy, and the Arabs are much exercised over these craft, which they regard with superstitious fear. There is small chance that any intervention will mix the matter, in spite of the international peace treaty. The practice is not to intervene in such cases unless both sides ask for a peacemaker. Turkey has called for intervention, but Italy would spurn it.\n\nTHE MAINE LIQUOR LAW.\n\nFor over forty years the State of Maine has had a prohibitory liquor law. The liquor interests brought on a contest to repeal the law. For a long time the results were in doubt. Alternately Maine was said to be dry and said to be then wet. Finally the government made a re-count and the state is officially proclaimed dry by a majority of 738.\n\nStarting from Sheepshead Bay race-track, Long Island, New York, on September 17, Mr. Rodgers reached Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles, on November 5, having traveled a distance of 3,220 miles in forty-nine days. The best previous record for this record was Henry A. Ford's flight of 1,261 miles from St. Louis to New York. (See Canadian Teacher, page 154.) Rodger's success was wrested by courage and perseverance from a long series of mishaps. At the beginning of his second flight his flight machine crashed into a tree, and four days later it broke two propeller-blades in a collision with a barbed-wire fence. A string of minor accidents and mishaps worried him across half a dozen states, but he emerged from adventure practically uninjured, although, according to a Pasadena dispatch, \"his machine has been broken and repaired so many times that only the vertical rudder and the dripping condenser of the original outfit were when he started.\"\n\nFive years ago the Wright Brothers were the only men in the world who could fly in heavier-than-air machines. In the fall of 1906 they pointed with pride to the fact that they had been up in the air more than twenty minutes, together exactly nine miles, or an average of a mile each flight, but there was one wonderful record of being up for over half an hour, and covering twenty-four miles.\n\nAnd now we have just seen aviator Rodgers complete his journey of over 3,100 miles, from New York to Los Angeles, in less than six weeks, and a total flying-time of about three days.\n\nACROSS THE CONTINENT IN AN AIR SHIP.\n\nThe wonderful tales in the \"Arabian Nights\" are being outdone every day by the marvellous achievements of modern science. Transatlantic flight of Capt. F. Rodgers across the continent from New York City to Pasadena in California is the latest of these modern miracles. Our grandfathers, even our fathers, twenty years ago would have laughed the prediction of such an achievement out of the realm of remote possibilities.\n\nRodgers and his route.\nCOMPOSITION\n\nHILDA'S CHRISTMAS.\n\nStanding apart from the childish throng,\nLittle Hilda was silent and sad;\nShe could not join in the happy song,\nShe could not echo the voices glad.\n\n\"What can I do on Christmas day?\nI am so little and yet so poor!\nShe sat alone here in a dreary way:\n\"I wish there never was a Christmas more.\"\n\n\"Mother is sick, and father can't know\nHow children talk of their gifts and joy,\nOr he'd surely try, he loves me so,\nTo get me just one single toy.\"\n\n\"But Christmas is not for what you get,\"\nShe heard a small, soft, tender voice,\n\"It's for what you give,\" said wee Janet,\nAnd the words made Hilda's heart rejoice.\n\n\"It isn't our birthday,\" went on the mite,\n\"It is Christ's, you know; and I think He'd say\nIf He were to talk to us to-night,\nThat He'd wish us to keep it His own way.\"\n\nDRAWING\n\nMAKING CALENDARS.\n\nIllustrations on this page show calendars that can readily be made by small or older children. At the first of these lessons you were asked to save all the work of the class. These may now be used in the manner shown on this page. Sprays of grass and leaves, with pencil or in color, autumn flowers, simple landscapes, offer suitable material for calendars. The temple may be mounting board cut to the desired size at any print shop. A pupil's sketch may then be trimmed and mounted upon the board, and below the drawing may be pasted a small calendar pad. In this way the children are able to construct this very useful article in an acceptable form. Calendars are naturally interesting at this time of the year, and may afterwards be utilized as Christmas or New Year's gifts by their makers.\n\nNATURE STUDY\n\nANIMALS IN WINTER.\n\n1.

What birds come to us only for winter?\n10. How are the birds kept warm?\n\nREPRODUCTION STORY\n\nA REMEDY THAT FAILED.\n\nRead this story carefully:\n\n\"I don't see why Charlie cries so much,\" said Aunt Emma. \"Do,\" said Uncle Ned; \"it's because of his curls. He looks so much like a girl that he thinks he must act like a girl.\" And Charlie listened!\n\nSoon you might have heard patter, patter, as a little boy mounted the stairs one step at a time, and two feet on each step.\n\nThen you would have heard a scrape, scrape, as somebody felt through Mammy's big workbasket.\n\nThen a big chair was pulled up before the mirror, and somebody with short legs puffed and blew and struggled to mount it.\n\nThen came a click, click, and snip went the shears, and the tight curls dropped one by one to the floor, leaving the funniest little cropped head you ever saw.\n\n\"Now,\" said Charlie, in a satisfied tone, \"this little boy will never cry again.\"\n\nBut he did. Can you tell why?\n\nLANGUAGE\n\nLESSON XXXIV.\n\nA STORY TO BE GUESSED.\n\nDozing, and dozing, and dozing!\nPleasant enough,\nDreaming of sweet cream and mouse-meat\u2014\nDelicate stuff!\n\nWaked by a somersault, whirling\nFrom cushion to floor;\nWaked to a wild rush for safety\nFrom window to door.\n\n\u2014Lucy Larcom.\n\nI. Copy these two stanzas. Decide what they are about; who wanted the chair; and who came bounding in with his mouth open and with dreadfully fierce eyes.\n\nII. Put the whole into a story, and make up an ending by telling what finally happened.\nLESSON XXXV.\nNINE PLURALS WITHOUT S.\n\nNine common nouns make their plurals without s:\n\n1. They are:\n   - man\n   - woman\n   - child\n   - goose\n\n2. Most nouns ending in o are made plural by adding s; some common ones, however, add es to form the plural.\n\nLearn to spell the following plurals. Then use each in a sentence.\n\n- curtains\n- calicoes\n- echoes\n- heroes\n- mosquitoes\n- motteos\n- negros\n- potatoes\n- tomatoes\n- volcanoes\n- grattos\n- pianos\n- solos\n- zeros\n\nLESSON XXXVI.\nPOSSESSIVES.\n\n1. How do most plurals end?\n2. How do most plurals make the possessive?\n3. What are the nine names that form their plural without s?\n4. Give their plurals.\n\nThe \"nine plurals without s\" are made to show possession by adding 's', just as in the singular.\n\nWhich of these objects are spoken of as having more than one owner?\n\n- a man's book\n- men's hats\n- a woman's shoes\n- a child's coat\n\nRemember that:\n\nIn making names possessive we add only the apostrophe to plural names ending in s; but to all other names we add 's'.\n\nI. About each of these words ask yourself, first, \"IS IT PLURAL?\" second, \"DOES IT END IN S?\" and then write its possessive.\n\n- girls\n- Charles\n- women\n- ladies\n- banjos\n- children\n\nII. In one column write the singular of these words, and in another write their plural, then change all the words in both columns into possessives:\n\n- Gentleman; lady; boys; girls; women; child; fairy; negro; calf; hero; church; donkey; lily; German; enemy; Englishman; sheep; ostrich.\n\nABOUT A PICTURE.\n\nLESSON XXXVII.\n\nI. In a conversation about parrots, learn what their habits are, where they are native, and what power they have of imitating speech. Tell about any particular parrot you can.\n\nII. Make up a story from \"Morning Call,\" as you imagine it from the picture.\n\nFirst describe Poll, her early home, who brought her, who owned her, how and where she was kept, what she liked to eat, how much freedom she had. Then narrate the morning call, giving the conversation between Poll and little Peter.\n\nIII. When you write the story, be careful to use quotation marks without a mistake.\n\nHOUSE-BUILDING.\n\nLESSON XXXVIII.\n\nObserve the houses that you pass on your way to school; ask and talk about all that is used in building them; then write upon the subject.

McGrand, teacher of the Tobique Indian School, has applied for an increase of $50.00 in her salary. She is now in receipt of $450.00 a year, which is the highest salary paid to any Indian school teacher in New Brunswick. She has a good school and is a competent teacher. There are 31 children on the roll, with an average attendance of 22.\n\nMiss McGrand, in addition to teaching the school, has interested herself in the women on the reserve, and conducts night classes, for which she receives extra pay.\n\nShe claims that the provincial teachers have pleasanter surroundings and are able to live at home, while she is obliged to put up with the discomforts of living on an Indian reserve and she considers that this, as well as the high cost of living, should entitle her to a salary of $500.00 per annum. If the Department accedes to her request it will in all fairness have to increase the salaries of the other teachers, all of whom are at present\napparently satisfied with what they are receiving. It is for the Department to say what reply shall be made to Miss McGrand.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N.B.\nWhile at the Reservation we visited the school, and found that Miss McGrand is doing good work and deserves a lot of credit. She brought up the matter of an increase in her salary, which I understand now is $450.00 a year, and if the Department could see their way clear to give her an increase of $50.00 a year. I certainly think that she is worthy of it, as she has a large school, the register now shows thirty-eight pupils, and they are making good progress under her tuition. In fact she intimated that unless she could be given an increase in salary that she felt that she might not be able to remain, and if she does leave it would mean several years before a new teacher could handle the situation nearly as well as she is doing at the present time, and I sincerely trust that you will take this matter into consideration, and advise at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Wootten applies for an increase in salary for Miss Ethel McGrand, teacher of the Tobique Indian School. She is now in receipt of $450.00 a year and has been in charge of this school since the first of January, 1911. The last returns shows that she has an enrolment of 37 pupils, with an average of 30.\n\nRev. Father Ryan in his report on this school states as follows, \"Miss McGrand holds a second class Provincial license and is a very capable teacher and a good disciplinarian, a quality much to be desired in all teachers, but more especially in Indian educational work. She is greatly liked by children and parents and devoted to the work. The Rev. clergyman in charge of the spiritual welfare of the Indians here speaks very highly of her work and influence among the tribe.\"\n\nMr. Wootten says that Miss McGrand gave him to understand that unless she could be given an increase of $50.00\n$50.00 in salary she felt that she might not be able to remain on and if she leaves it would mean several years before a new teacher could handle the situation as well as she is doing at present and he sincerely trusts that the Department will take the application into consideration.\n\nIn view of the excellent work being done by Miss McGrand I would recommend that her salary be increased to $500.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nI beg to advise you that Miss McGrady, the teacher at the Tobique Reserve, has asked me if I would take the matter up with the Department re Easter Holidays. She states that the pupils have asked her if instead of taking Easter Holidays if they could not arrange to have them a little later on, some time in June, and if this will be satisfactory to the Department will thank you to advise me.\n\nAnother matter that I would like to take up with the Department is a flag for the School at the Tobique Reserve. I thought that if you would purchase a flag so that it could be hoisted on the school at the point on holidays the same as all other schools do, that it would be a good idea, and would be educating to the Indian children along the proper lines. I think a flag pole could be gotten and put up on the school at a very reasonable price, and if you would either purchase a flag and send it to me for the school or authorize me to purchase one not to exceed a certain amount, and also authorize me to have a flag pole put up not to exceed the cost of $3.00 or $4.00 it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

I thank you for this authority and will give the matter prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

White was in today to see me Re. writing the Department to ascertain if they would furnish transports for 3 Indian Children who live at Tobique Narrows to be taken to school each morning at the Tobique Reserve and brought home at night. It would be a distance of about one and one half miles each way and to my mind would be quite an expense. I do not think you could get transportation for them less than $1.50 a day. There is a school at Tobique Narrows and I think it would be much more satisfactory if it could be arranged to have the children attend that school and I will take the matter up with the Trustees of that school with the view of having these 3 Indian Children attend, if it meets with your views, and hope to hear from you Re. same at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH.

Solis have not been attending school, and he gives, as the cause for this, that the children have not suitable footwear to enable them to attend school. I have investigated into the matter and find that to be the case. This man Solis is quite a hard working man but he has five children, aged 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years respectively, and the three oldest children cannot possibly go to school unless they are supplied with boots and mittens. I have therefore taken the liberty today of giving them an order amounting to $12.15, to enable them to attend school and will thank you to authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

The voucher should be submitted separately, and should show clearly that the purchase was made to enable the children to go to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nI beg to advise you that truant officer Frank Lockwood of the Tobique Reserve has complained to me that several of the children on the reserve have not been attending school regularly of late, one of them being the daughter of Mrs. Maggie Francis, who is 14 years old. I saw Mrs. Francis today and talked with her regarding the matter and she stated the reason she has been keeping her daughter home is, that she has a little girl four years old and she has to keep the older girl home to look after the younger one, so she can go out and work, as she claims she cannot possibly keep herself and two children on $2.00 a month. I do not know whether or not it is my duty to look after the children's attendance at school, to see that they attend regularly. It seems to me that is up to the school inspector, but I do think that if these young children are not attending school regularly, that there should be some way of compelling them to do so. I told Mrs. Francis today, that unless she would make a determined effort to see that her daughter was sent to school, that I would recommend to the Department that her relief be stopped and that her daughter be placed in an institution where she would be educated. The truant officer has informed me that he has made every effort to get these children to go to school, but it appears his efforts have had very little effect. I will be pleased to hear from you with any suggestions that the Department would care to make re. matters of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agt.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

She claims that everything costs so much more now than in previous years, and as it was the custom to allow $5.00, she feels that $7.50 be given this year. I quite agree with her that it will take $7.50 to buy the same goods as $5.00 would have purchased four or five years ago.\n\nMr. Allison, the teacher of the Tobique reserve has also applied for an allowance for a Christmas tree for the school. He feels that he should be allowed $15.00 instead of $10.00 as has been previously allowed.\n\nIn view of the high cost of the goods, I recommend that $7.50 be allowed the Edmundston School and $15.00 for the Tobique, and it will be obliging if you will authorize this expenditure at your earliest possible convenience, as the school teachers wish to make arrangements for having the tree.\n\nI enclose herewith Returns of the Edmundston day school for the month of November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

Consider at only justice and the duty of the government to undergo my expenses of any other teacher who should meet with the same conditions.\n\nI do not understand why a teacher should be requested to take such accommodations on any occasion what so ever. I fully believe that if rooms are not furnished in a proper situation or a bungalow erected that within a short period you will be unable to secure a teacher for the Tobique reservation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarie Feeny.\nMaliseet Vict. Co. N.B.\n\nSept. 13th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nMiss Feeney only remained about five days. She is to write you. Boarding conditions in an Indian house did not suit. As I said before, I realise more than ever, the imperative need of \"TEACHER'S RESIDENCE\" on the Reserve, before we can expect to keep a good teacher.\n\nMiss Bridget Crain has arrived. She will open school tomorrow the 14th. The children will only loose a half-day. She is not a licensed teacher but has covered school to the ninth grade. Her application was approved by the Dept. a few weeks ago, but Miss Murdoch, a licensed teacher, sent in an application two days later, she was also accepted by the Dept., but refused to come at the last moment. Miss Feeney was next called but only remained a few days. Then came Miss Bridget Crain. Time will tell how many yet may follow. All this trouble arises over the want of a proper place for the teacher to board.\n\nI trust the Dept. will do all in their power to rectify these disorders. I understand Miss Isaacs had considerable trouble to get a boarding place at Kingsclear. She was determined to leave; at last, she got in a kind of a place for a while.\n\nI know, if houses of some kind are not provided for teachers at once, that even before the term expires there may be vacant Ind. Schools. I feel sure that next year will certainly find some closed.\n\nFaithfully submitted to your consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Ind.

The action taken by you in securing Miss Crain is satisfactory and her appointment is approved. It is hoped that she will be able to arrange for suitable boarding accommodation and that she will remain as teacher.\n\nThe necessity of providing a small cottage as a teacher's residence at this school is recognized, but it is now too late in the season to take any action this fall and besides there are no funds available to put up a building. This is being noted when the estimates are being prepared to be submitted to parliament for the next fiscal year. It would be well for you to draw the attention of the Department to the need for the erection of suitable quarters for a teacher, giving your suggestions as to the kind and size of the building that should be provided for the purpose, in order that, if funds are provided by parliament, there will be no delay in erecting the building next spring.\n\nMr. Agent Wootton will be informed of the appointment of Miss Crain.

It would appear that he secured the services of Miss Marie Feeney, but she only remained about five days, as she was unable to obtain boarding accommodation. He then secured the services of Miss Bridget Crain and she arrived and began duties on the 14th instant.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of the 31st of August last, the Department would approve of the appointment of Miss Crain, with salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. It is now hoped that there will be no further trouble and that Miss Crain has obtained a place on board and will remain for the balance of the school year.\n\nIt is recognized that, in order to retain a teacher, it will be necessary to provide a cottage as a teacher's residence. It is too late in the season to go on with this at present, but this has been noted for the estimate submitted to parliament next year, and, if an appropriation for the purpose is provided, the work can be carried out in summer.\n\nMiss Feeney should prepare and forward a statement showing the number of days she taught this quarter, and the amount due her for her services will be paid. It is requested that the Department pay her expenses incurred from her home to the school and return, but her request will be entertained.\n\nN. J.

The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum - the same as was paid Miss Crain, the former teacher, who is being transferred to the Kingsclear Indian Day School - and she will also receive bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year.\n\nWhen Miss Dugan arrives, you will be good enough to grant her every assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Father Hugolin, of the Tobique Reserve, N. B., visited the Department today and was exceedingly pleased to learn that we were providing for a teacher's residence for the Indian day school. In the Supplementary Estimates for the current year there is an item of $1500 for this purpose.\n\nThe Rev. Father strongly urges the appointment of two Sisters, one to act as teacher and the other as field matron; and this fact should be kept in mind when the plans for the bungalow are being drawn. I have intimated that we will correspond with the Rev. Father Ryan in this connection and that the salary allowed the Sisters will be at the rate of $550 plus bonus, each. It may be necessary, to save advertising the position through the Civil Service Commission, to engage both Sisters as school teachers.\n\nThese Sisters will quite likely be available by September first, 1923.\n\nFather Hugolin has intimated that the present incumbent - Miss Nellie Dugan - is about to resign, and I have asked him to correspond with Rev. Father Ryan regarding a successor.\n\nSept. of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, June 5, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReverend Father Hugolin, of the Tobique Reserve, visited the Department a few days ago and strongly urged the appointment of two Sisters, one to act as teacher and the other as field matron on that Reserve. He stated that it was quite likely that the services of these Sisters would be available by September 1, 1923. If the services of the Sisters are secured, it will be necessary to provide proper accommodation for them.\n\nWe have this year an item in our Supplementary Estimates for the purpose of providing a small bungalow for a teacher in connection with this school, but, if the Sisters are engaged, more extensive living accommodation will have to be provided than is contained in a bungalow. Father Hugolin also stated that it was the intention of the church authorities to ask for the removal of the school to another site, as the church desired to obtain from the Indians the land on which the school now stands for church purposes. Father Hugolin stated that he would let the Department know in the course of the present summer the definite arrangements that are being made regarding the securing of the teachers and the moving of the school, and when this information is received we will then be in a position to go on with the work of putting up a residence for the Sisters. We intimated to Father Hugolin that we would inform you regarding the above mentioned matters. I might say that if the Sisters are engaged, we would be prepared to allow them a salary at the rate of $550 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nFather Hugolin intimated that the present teacher, Miss Nellie Dugan, intends to resign at the end of June. It will, therefore, be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher to succeed her until such time as the services of the Sisters can be obtained. If Miss Dugan resigns, you should endeavour to secure the services of another teacher, and the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher selected by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is too tiring for her, it is too difficult to maintain discipline, and the teaching is consequently not up to standard.

The Rev. Father Augolin has lately requested that two teachers be appointed, in addition to a field matron. I have examined the returns and I have noted an enrolment of 51 and an average attendance, for the December quarter, of 36 pupils.\n\nBefore making a decision, the Department would be pleased to have your recommendation as to the advisability of having two teachers appointed at the Tobique Indian Day School.

Father Ryan, Inspector of Schools for New Brunswick, called at the Department today and discussed the question of the employment of the Sisters as teachers at Tobique. He strongly recommended that only English speaking sisters be appointed, and that the English language be taught exclusively in the classrooms. We informed him that any teacher appointed would have to meet with his approval as regards ability, qualifications and the language of instruction in the classroom.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn my late visit to Ottawa, in conversation with Mr. Ferrier, I rather understood him to state that the sisters that should come to Tobique would be required to teach both French & English. If this be the case, I feel in this new departure, that our schools will be so burdened that they will fall away below the standard. At present the VIII & IX Grades did take French. At this period they could successfully do so, but it would be nothing short of a crime to burden those poor little ones with an extra language before they reached the above standards. It is not like in Quebec, the schools are surrounded with French and this is the language there, while here all our Ind. Schools are surrounded by English speaking people and this is the language the poor Indians must use.\n\nI may have misunderstood Mr. Ferrier, yet I would like to have a good understanding in this matter, so when the Tobique sisters come, that I might know just where we stand in this matter.

Gen.,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn my late visit to Ottawa, in conversation with Mr. Ferrier, I rather understood him to state that the sisters that should come to Tobique would be required to teach both French & English. If this be the case, I feel in this new departure, that our schools will be so burdened that they will fall away below the standard. At present the VIII & IX Grades did teach French. At this period they could successfully do so, but it would be nothing short of a crime to burden those poor little ones with an extra language before they reached the above standards. It is not like in Quebec, the schools are surrounded with French and this is the language there, while here all our Ind. Schools are surrounded by English speaking people and this is the language the poor Indians must use.\n\nI may have misunderstood Mr. Ferrier, yet I would like to have a good understanding, so when the Tobique sisters come, that I might know just were we stand in this matter. I also wish the Fathers to know our school conditions in this Province, and if Quebec has its regulations, we should have the privilege likewise in having our system respected.

The Rev. Father Hugolin, who is to secure the services of the Sisters, has intimated that the incumbents will come from Quebec and he has been instructed that they must be bilingual, as English only is to be the language of instruction.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education did not state that both English and French were to be taught. He informed you that, if the Sisters were French, they must be English speaking as well, so that they would be properly qualified to teach in that language. Father Hugolin understands the Department's wishes in this connection.\n\nShortly after the Sisters have arrived at the school, you should make an inspection and submit a special report concerning their language qualifications. And in the meantime rest assured that English is the only language of instruction authorized for the Tobique school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The average enrolment for the fiscal year 1923-24 was 47 and the average attendance for the same period was $1.25. The teacher and field matron which are to be appointed in the near future - both with the classification of teachers - will, no doubt, soon work up a better cause than heretofore and I am convinced the average attendance will be higher than in the past. Before a third teacher is appointed, a second classroom would have to be provided.\n\nFather Hugolin will invite the Sisters to correspond with Father Ryan, our Inspector, with reference to the details and with special reference to the salary that will be allowed.\n\nA nurse is needed for the hospital ward & we will have to appoint 3 teachers at the outset say at $1550 each.

Silvester, O.F.M.\n\nNOTE: The Bishop of Chatham has approved of the appointment of Rev. Father Silvester to succeed Rev.

A teacher's residence has been erected and in it there is accommodation for at least six hospital beds. Three workers, who will all be classified as teachers and who will be paid from School Vote, are to be engaged. One will be for the classroom proper; the second will devote the morning to domestic instruction among the older pupils and to the preparation of the noonday lunch; in the afternoons this worker will do field matron's duties; the third worker will be a nurse for the hospital ward. I have arranged with Father Hugolin, with the Deputy's approval, to pay each of the 3 workers a salary of $550, plus any bonus that will be provided.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell Ferrier\nMotherhouse,\nBay Saint Paul, May 12th, 1924.\n\nTo the Honorable Minister of the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nDuring the course of last year, the Reverend Franciscan Fathers demanded our Institution to take charge of the school and the adjacent hospital of the Indian Reserve at Maliseet, N.B. This affair had already been treated with your department.\n\nLately, we were informed by Father Hugolin, former Superior of the Mission, that the Department would engage a graduate nurse. We have several Sisters with a long experience in pharmacy, but none are certified, so if the diploma is obligatory we cannot meet that requirement.\n\nWishing to settle this affair definitely, we hope that you will kindly consider the request, as soon as convenient, and give a reply as to whether or not you count upon our services for that region.\n\nKindly accept, Honorable Sir, the religious salutations of\n\nYour humble servant in Christ.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has arranged with Rev. Father Hugelin for the incumbency of three Sisters. One will have charge of the classroom; another will teach domestic work in school and will perform field matron's duties on the Indian reserve; and the third will be the nurse in charge of the hospital. The rooms devoted to hospital purposes will allow six or more beds for patients. When the Sister who will act as Superior of the little community has visited Maliseet she should requisition to the Department for the furnishings which she considers necessary for the satisfactory conduct of the hospital and Sisters' residence.\n\nWith reference to the question you raise in your letter, I am pleased to inform you that it will be satisfactory to this Department if you arrange for the appointment as nurse of a Sister who has had experience in nursing and in pharmacy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

They would be paid a fixed salary, and therefore would incur no risk on the properties of which they have been given the management.\n\n5\u00b0 A hired man, paid by the Department will have charge of the hardest labor, serve as assistant in the hospital and do the traveling necessary for the purchase of provisions, etc.\nMatherhouse,\nBay St-Paul, May 23rd 1924.\n\nHonorable Sir:-\n\nHaving not yet received a reply to our letter of the 12th inst., concerning the Indian Reserve at Tobique, and the time being already limited, we take the liberty of renewing our demand.\n\nWe shall be awaiting your decision upon the following questions, and you would greatly favor us in doing so without delay:\n\n1\u00b0 - Does the Indian Department still count upon our services as school teachers and nurse?\n\n2\u00b0 - Will a non graduate nurse be accepted? (Said nurse is competent, as specified in ours of the 12th inst.)\n\n3\u00b0 - Would you agree to the conditions of the engagement contract, a brief outline of which we are enclosing?\n\nWhether or not you accept, kindly notify us before the 10th of June. Until then, we need know if we have to reserve the number of Sisters needed for that institution. Several demands for Sisters have been made by other teaching communities, and we await your reply to answer. As we have to submit these questions to our Right Reverend Bishop, we would like to take advantage of his visit in the early days of June to confer upon the matter.\nAfter June 10th, your silence concerning the affair will be taken as a refusal.\n\nHoping that you will please promptly consider the request and grant a favorable reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The furnishing of the combined school and hospital and teacher's residence will be undertaken by the Department and all repairs and replacements that are found necessary to the satisfactory conduct of the institution will be made. Current expenses for lighting and heating will also be met by parliamentary appropriation.\n\nI have noted you recommend that a hired man be appointed to assist the teachers.

Well Father, as you remember, when you came to Maliseet, it was decided that a second class would be opened on account of the pupils being too numerous to be all under the supervision of only one teacher. So, Sr. M. Rita of the S.H. has been employed every day since from nine to eleven and from one to three o'clock, teaching the youngest children. This takes most all her time and there is not much left for Domestic Work, as you can see. But as I wanted to do all I could to help the Department and the poor Indians, a third Sister (not salaried) was named to substitute Sr.W.Rita, as much as possible. She visits people at their home; gives two hours per week, at the convent, for teaching sewing, cooking, etc.\n\nFather, the situation becomes embarrassing now that two Srs. are teaching school. In a letter dated May 23, 1924, Mr.J.D.McLean, says that when a fourth Sister would be found necessary, a salary would be paid to her. Don't you think Father that the time has come to get another Sister that could take fully charge of the Domestic Science Work. Would be very thankful to have your advice on this matter.\n\nTeachers have received the Dominion of Canada Map, also one dozen of Geographies by the Christian Brothers. Many thanks.\n\nVery respectfully yours in Christ\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 284-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 24th, 1924.\n\nRev.

An extra classroom will be opened in the teachers' residence and hospital building after the new year. The three salaries allowed are for the two teaching Sisters and for the Sister Superior. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of August 18th, last. We are not prepared at the present time to provide a salary for an extra Sister to teach domestic science. Later if the results achieved by the Reverend Sisters at this school and in the hospital warrant the payment of salary for another Sister, consideration will be given to providing the same. We note that up to the present time very little domestic science work has been done. This is no doubt due to the fact that the Reverend Sisters have not got quite settled in the work at this school. You may inform the Reverend Sister Superior that, should the results achieved as shown by future reports warrant the payment of salary for another Sister, consideration will be given to providing same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is thought that this instruction could be given by one of the teachers during the regular classroom period. She could arrange the hours at which this would be convenient without interfering unduly with the other classroom work.\n\nIf the Sisters have time, and can make arrangements, it may be possible to give the women of the Reserve instruction in sewing and making garments. The Department is, however, not prepared to make any extra arrangement for the teaching of domestic science. If there is any likelihood of the work being of benefit to the Indian women, and if you are sure that they would avail themselves of the opportunity to acquire knowledge of domestic science, the Department might be favourably disposed next year to authorize the enlarging of the work along these lines.\n\nAny materials required for the purpose of teaching sewing, etc., to the pupils, and, to a limited extent, to the Indian women of the Reserve, during the present school year, will be supplied upon a requisition prepared by you and handed to Mr. Agent Roberts for transmission to the Department.\n\nRegarding the preparation of a report showing the work done, it will be satisfactory if the teachers prepare a list of the garments made and a general statement regarding the number who received instruction and any facts of interest, and hand the same to the local Indian Agent together with the quarterly return of attendance.

Normal School. I am told that they have such teachers, but the Mother Superior informed me that it was the fault of the Department of Indian Affairs, who she claimed said they did not require such certificates. I wish the Department would understand conditions on this Reserve or on any Reserve in this Province good and efficient teachers are required it is certainly on this Reserve. This Reserve has excellent, bright children, and at one time this school led the Province. It would or should do so yet if proper teachers would be secured to carry on the work. If the Mother House has our Prov. trained teachers, then why should we not have them? Why should the Department say a N.B. Normal School License is not required.\nOttawa, November 26, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 14th ultimo which relates to the qualifications of the teachers at the Tobique Indian Day School. There is evidently a misunderstanding in connection with the Department's wishes. We require professionally qualified teachers, and, if the present incumbents are not satisfactory, steps will be taken upon receipt of a further report from you to arrange for other Sisters. Indian schools are managed, as you know, solely by this Department and therefore do not come under the Provincial Departments of Education. We do not stipulate New Brunswick professional certificates for teachers at New Brunswick Indian schools, but we expect teachers with suitable training and professional qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

DEPARTMENTS\" (this word used in the plural takes in myself). Will the Department please point out were I or our Prov. Dept. desired to devest the \"DEPT.\" of its \"PRIVILEGES\". If the Dept. will not explain, I will take this letter with me in the near future to Ottawa and ask through a representative body just what the Minister of the Interior understands by this letter. I consider that I have done my very best for the advancement of our Indians in this Province and I feel the one who dictated this letter dictated a \"SLUR\". It would seem that such a person would do well to spare his time & talents in a deeper study of methods that would better advance the cause of our INDIANS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have reviewed my letter and I cannot see that it is either ambiguous or indefinite. Therefore, I am wholly at a loss to understand the tone of your answer.\n\nI should be grateful if you would re-examine my letter of the 26th ultimo. You have evidently taken umbrage at the second last sentence, which reads as follows: \"Indian schools are managed, as you know, solely by this Department and therefore do not come under Provincial Departments of Education.\" The words \"This Department\" undoubtedly refer to Indian Affairs and to our officers in the field, including yourself. I cannot understand why you consider the words \"Provincial Departments of Education\" include yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C.

The extra Sister that is required is a qualified nurse - see official letter No. 51-66, November 6th, last. I consider that the request of the Superior General, i.e., the appointment of an extra Sister, is not a question for the Schools' Branch, and, if one is appointed, I cannot recommend that her salary be paid from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMotherhouse,\nBay St. Paul, February 10, 1926.\n\nReverend F. C. Ryan,\nInsp. of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nThe Superior of our Convent in Maliseet tells me you are not satisfied with the results of your examinations in the school of that Reserve. I regret it and I hope the situation may still be remedied; we are disposed to do the best we can to meet your views.\n\nWe would be very thankful if you could kindly tell us what you think reprovable in our Sisters' method of teaching and would also appreciate any suggestion towards its improvement.\n\nAt the time of our engagement for the school at Maliseet, we were informed that the New Brunswick certificate was not required for the teachers, so we concluded that we would not be asked to follow the program of studies of that province. We should have had an understanding with you on that subject. I hope you will forgive us for not having asked your instructions at the very first, but we were under the impression that the school was directly dependent on the Department at Ottawa.\n\nI beg you to believe, Reverend Father, in our sincere desire to give satisfaction in the task undertaken for the welfare of the children on the Reserve.\n\nPray accept the homage of my respect and bless,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

It will explain itself, except that part \"We were under the impression that the school was directly dependent on the dept. at Ottawa\". Why the Superior Gen. or any of the other sisters could think otherwise is more than I can explain. I never gave them to understand that the Ind. schools at any time depended on me. They well know that I am but the Inspector, and that the Dept. can if they wish put any old thing in any of their schools, and do as they desire with said schools. I am not that important, but what they could get along without me, for I know I could get along without the Dept. ---Now the point is this -- judging by this letter, that an agreement was entered into between the Dept. and the Mother House, that the Program of studies of this Prov. would not have to be followed, therefore teachers were sent accordingly; I am powerless in the situation.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S Please return the Mother's letter.

The Rev. Sisters entrusted with the management of this school have not been given to understand otherwise. If you have not already instructed them in this regard, please do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. J. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank,\nNorth. Co., N.B.\nRev. and Dear Mother:\n\nYour letter received re. Tobique Ind. day School, & & & , asking reasons why your sisters have not made better in said School,\n\nI feel Rev. Mother, that you have overlooked the fact that you sent Sisters to said school, who have not the required papers to \"TEACH\", from our Provincial Normal School, or one of equal standing. I feel, if your order will so provide such teachers, that the said school in question will soon reach the standard of our other schools.\n\nOur schools call for at least 2nd, Class teachers. Our Rev. sisters at Woodstock, Ind. day School have their 2nd, class Normal School License, as well as all our other teachers in our Ind. schools, in fact a number are first class teachers.\n\nWe certainly must have the goods, in order to have proper results. The Dept. is paying a good salary and we want -\" first class schools!\"\n\nI trust, Rev.

Ryan, P.P.,\nRed Bank, N.B.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI have the honor of acknowledging your letter of the 9th ult. and am grateful for the information given.\n\nIt is regrettable that we have not been advised from the first that teachers licensed from New Brunswick would be asked for the school on the Maliseet Reserve. We required information on this particular point and, I still have the copy of a letter I addressed you on June 21, 1924, begging for instruction regarding formalities to be fulfilled re engagement of the teachers.\n\nHad we been aware of the necessity of the New Brunswick Normal school license, I own, Reverend Father, that we would have refused the Mission of Tobique. Our Motherhouse being here, you easily understand that we have few teachers from your province, and, we cannot count on vocations from Tobique for future needs. But since God has permitted things to turn out thus there remains but to do our duty the best we can.\n\nWe have no first class teachers from your province, but as the New Brunswick licenses are exchanged in Alberta we suppose that the certificates of both provinces are of equal standing. So I beg you to advise us, Reverend Father, if you would accept a teacher with a first class Normal school certificate from Alberta, said teaching having taught successfully a number of years in the city of Edmonton. I said \"a teacher\" for I hope that Sister M-Rita -of-the-Sacred Heart may be tried for another year?\n\nI renew the assurance of our good will and beg you to receive the homage of my respect.

Pieti from Alberta, as principal\nof said Sunday School and\nRev. M. Rita in the Primary\nDept.\n\nAfter reading said letter, please\nreturn, and if you think this would\nbe a good move, please let me know.\nWe require a change, now is\nthe time, when we have this offer.\n\nI trust all are well,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nF. C. Ryan\nOttawa, April 12th, 1926.\n\nDear Father Ryan:\n\nI have your personal letter of the 7th instant to Mr. Sutherland and myself, enclosing a communication which you received from the Superior General of the Franciscan Order of Sisters at Tobique regarding the supplying of qualified teachers.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that they have no teachers having New Brunswick qualifications, but that they can supply a teacher with a First Class Normal School Certificate from Alberta. The appointment of this teacher as principal of the Tobique school will be satisfactory, and, in order not to inconvenience the Reverend Sisters by making a change at the present time, it is considered that it would be quite satisfactory if the new teacher begins duties on or about September 1st, next. The present teacher could continue for the balance of the school year to June 30th, next. You may make the necessary arrangements with the Superior General to have the teacher referred to by her take charge of Principal at the beginning of the next school year. I say and pray that the Superior General is prepared to make the change in the Principal at any time before the end of the present school year, she may do so, but we will leave this matter in your hands to make the change at any time before September 1st convenient to the Reverend Sisters. When this change takes place and the new teacher having the Alberta qualifications assumes duties, I shall be pleased to hear from you giving the date upon which the change is made.\n\nThe services of the present assistant teacher, Sister M. Rita, will be satisfactory, and she may continue in the work.\n\nThe letter which you received is returned herewith as requested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. F. C.

Sister Victory could take the primary department and have the Mother House send at once a Second or First Class Teacher to take the advanced department.\n\nThe pupils in the primary department did fairly well under present conditions, but what can the Department expect from a teacher who has a most pronounced French accent. If any department in Indian schools should have a successful teacher, surely it must be the primary department. I feel this Order has the teachers and we should have them. We must have a \"Show-down\" at once. Promises to remove the Rev. Sister by the Mother House will not be taken and we should insist that qualified teachers be secured. This is the only Indian school in New Brunswick that has unqualified teachers. There is a first class normal school trained Sister at Woodstock and all our other teachers are second class normal school teachers. The Indians at Tobique are more advanced, brighter and more capable of rapid progress than on any other reserve in New Brunswick.\nRe Tobique Indian day school, I am very sorry that the Department in the beginning invited these Rev. Sisters to take charge, when we had such able teachers in our own province - the Rev. Sisters of Charity at St. John - all holding their Normal school licenses. I feel we will now have some difficulty in getting from the Rev. Franciscan Sisters proper qualified teachers for our N.B. Indian schools.\n\nIt may be well to leave the Rev. Franciscan Sisters at Tobique until June and then take some action.\nChatham, Nov. 19, 1927.\n\nDear Rev. Father:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, re \"The Tobique School and The Little Franciscans of Mary.\"\n\nIt is undeniable that teachers must be qualified in order to conduct a school; but it is true also that a teacher's license and especially of such or such a province is not always and is not the only qualification of the teacher's ability. For our Province of N. B. Public Schools a teacher's license is a necessary condition; but, as far as I know, the Indian Dept. at Ottawa does not make it a necessary condition to teach in the Indian schools of N. B. and so persons not holding such N. B. teachers licenses, but teachers' licenses of other provinces or of some of the United States or even with no license at all but otherwise qualified both as to instruction and as to successful experience in teaching may, in my humble opinion, be very good and efficient teachers.\n\nNow, with respect to The Little Franciscans of Mary, I have no personal knowledge of their teaching ability and after having visited the school at Tobique, you will better able to pass judgment on this point. The only thing I know about it is from the Superior General's letters to you and to me, stating that the Sister (Marie Doloris, I think,) has a ten years' experience in successful teaching. For myself, I would accept this as a sufficient qualification. If found on inspection to be correct.\n\nI have no objection to the Sisters of Charity of St. John taking charge of the Tobique School, providing they would at the same time take charge of the hospital there, but I fear they would not get along as well perhaps with the Franciscan Fathers. The Little Franciscans of Mary are a regular tertiary order of St. Francis, and they are more or less under the spiritual guidance of the Fathers. I fear it would not be the same with the Sisters of Charity. There are so many things to consider when it comes to do God's own good work. To speak frankly I would much sooner see things remain as they are at present, providing of course, the work of the school is satisfactory. As for placing a lady teacher at the head of the Advanced Dept., I do not think it would be feasible; the Sisters would hardly accept this arrangement.\n\nI shall await your decision and your answer before writing the Superior General of the Little Franciscans of Mary.\n\nI am very sincerely and respectfully\n\nYours in Our Lord,\n\nP. A. Chiasson,\nBishop of Chatham.\nRed Bank, North. Co., N. B.,\nNovember 23, 1927.\n\nRt. Rev. P. A.

We have to get certain information before answering to your inquiry concerning the matter of your departure.\n\nYour precedent letter (dated January 16th) was assuring us that the Department did not insist on teachers possessing certificates for New Brunswick.

The Rev. Father Ryan never had the instructions on which he is basing his action to have us leave the reserve. However, as we do not wish to remain here for other purposes than to exercise our mission, and as there is no lack of field for elsewhere, we would abandon this one willingly after we have made light on this present question.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) Mr. Claire d'Assier\nSup.

PARKER,\n\nI should be grateful if you would visit the Tobique Indian Day School upon the occasion of your coming trip to the Maritimes. Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, is not satisfied with the Little Franciscan Sisters, who are at present in charge. Under cover of the 20th ultimo, he wrote in part as follows: \"The said school has shown no least progress of any Indian school under my charge - yet, it contains the brightest Indian pupils of our province. The way, method and foundation in training of the Rev. Sisters, etc., do not successfully measure up to the efficiency demanded by our Indian schools in this province.\"\n\nFather Ryan's report, following his inspection on October 19th last, reads in part as follows: \"The pupils did fairly well under conditions. What can the Department expect from a teacher in the Primary department (Sister Mary Delores) who has a most pronounced French accent?\" Under cover of November 23rd last, Father Ryan writes: \"I am informed that this Order only admits French subjects - if this be so, we can never expect to get results from this school.\"\n\nWhen Father Ryan wrote on the 20th ultimo that \"the Rev. Mother General assures me she is unable to supply the required teachers\" the Department asked the Superior General at Baie St. Paul, Que., if June 30th would be a convenient date to terminate their services. Representations have been made that our Inspector is unfairly trying to get rid of the Little Franciscan Sisters at Tobique.\n\nPlease make a careful inspection of this school and pay particular attention to the English of those Sisters who teach in the classrooms. You might ascertain definitely just what academic and professional training each has had.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nLittle Franciscan Sisters of Mary,\nBaie Saint-Paul, March 10th, 1928.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent general\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of February 18th has been left unanswered by the fact that we were waiting for more references concerning the present situation of our School in Tobique. But, owing to the Reverend Father Hugolin's late visit in Ottawa we are now provided with the required informations.\n\nThe visit of a school inspector will be greatly appreciated.\n\nAccording to our opinion, the Government does not claim teachers holding New Brunswick certificate only; but teachers having sufficient training. Now, Reverend Father Ryan has always used a contrary argument to provoke difficulties: he is, by the fact, interpreting this part of the law according to his own point of view.\n\nAfter having attended the whole course of study in the Province of Alberta, as well as in the United States, and having successfully conducted school work for many years, it is strange to hear that these same teachers are now unfit to instruct young Indians in Tobique. To us, it is evident that the main cause of these difficulties is due to a national rivalry more than anything else; thus we can not pretend to hold a secure position on the Reserve, as long as Reverend Father Ryan will hold the Office of School Superintendent. According to his personal disposition towards the Order, his relations sooner or later would become unfavorable. So, in order, to prevent further disquietment on the part of the Government as well as for the Institution itself, we are advising you, dear Sir, by the present, of our resignation as teachers of the Tobique Mission by this next June 30th 1928. Circumstances make it impossible to continue the work.\n\nThe courtesy with which the Members of the Department have been dealing with our Sisters is greatly appreciated. Wishing to thank you, Sir, for all past favors, I remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSr. M. Claire d'Assise, Sup. a.g\u00e9 le\n\nIndian Affairs.

The address of the Sisters who will take charge at Tobique is St. Vincent's Convent, St. John, N.B.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. Roberts, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRed Rapids, N.B.\nOttawa, March 22, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my recent visit to Tobique Indian Reserve, N.B.\n\nWhile at Tobique I visited the day school and watched the work of the teachers. The senior teacher, Sister Marie Victory, I found to be quite efficient for a school of this nature and the work of the pupils quite commendable. I was disappointed, however, to find that the junior teacher, Sister Dolores spoke with a distinct French accent. This would seem to be most unfortunate as pupils in this class get their first groundwork in the English language.\n\nWith a little more efficiency in teaching methods the school should have excellent results.\n\nThe attendance is good and any absentees were accounted for satisfactorily.\n\nI was surprised to learn from the Reverend Fathers that Latin was being taught in the senior classroom. The teacher has to go to the Fathers for instruction before she can teach her class. This seems not only a useless subject for a school of this nature but an actual absurdity. I only learned this at the last minute and did not have an opportunity to look into it further.\n\nC. C. Parker.\nInspector.\nRed Bank, Northumberland Co., N.B.\nMay 7th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed, you will please find the application for the Tobique Ind. day school & Hospital. At a glance, you can see you have well qualified teachers & nurses. At last this reserve will be well equipped. As the children are bright and progressive, we should expect great results from this Reserve in the next 3 or 4 years.\n\nI am much pleased over the choice of sisters being sent, and there is another point with this large order; if the Rev. sisters who are the incumbents are not successful, we have an almost inexhaustible source to draw from, as this order was instituted solely for teaching & nursing, and all the teaching sisters must have their Normal School license, so also must their NURSES have their diploma.\n\nThe Rev. Nurse and another Rev. Sister will take charge, July 1st, as you will see by the enclosed.\n\nWould it not be well for the Ind. Agent to have an inventory, of the most minute detail, of all the Gov. articles contained in the said Hospital &c., school &c. &c. &c. --as all linens, dishes, towels, cutlery, &c. clothes, furniture, beds, &c. &c. Hospital equipment &c. FOUR copies could be drawn out, one for the Dept., one for the Agent, one for the Rev. Sisters new about to take charge, sent to them in St. John, and I would like to get ONE. I think the Agent should examine all to see their condition &c. &c.\n\nI trust you are enjoying good health as this leaves me at present.\n\nYour friend,\n\nF.C. Ryan,\nInspector of Ind. schools for N.B.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 284-1, part 2)\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing the applications of the Rev. Sisters for the school and hospital work on the Tobique Indian Reserve. The qualifications which the Rev. Sisters possess are noted, and the Department will approve of their appointment. We note that the nurse and another Rev. Sister will take charge on July 1st, next. The Department confidently looks forward to an improvement in the work on this Reserve under the charge of the new Sisters. I might add that the salaries allowed will be the same as were paid to the Rev. Franciscan Sisters.\n\nIt is noted that Sister M. Praxades will be the principal in charge; Sister M. Quentin, the assistant; and Sister M. Clare, R.N., will be in charge of the hospital work. Please inform the Rev. Sisters of the approval of the Department of their appointment.\n\nWe are requesting the local Indian Agent to have the Sisters at present in charge prepare an inventory of all Government property on hand in the hospital and school, and to forward you two copies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. P. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the new staff appointed at the Tobique school and hospital will take charge on July 1st, next. Sister M. Praxades will take charge as principal, Sister M. Quentin, as assistant, and Sister M. Clare, R.N., will be in charge of the hospital work.\n\nI have to request that you will have the Rev. Sisters at present in charge prepare, in detail, an inventory of all Government property on hand in the hospital and school. This list should show all linens, dishes, towels, cutlery, furniture, hospital and school equipment. Four copies of this inventory should be prepared. Please forward two copies to Rev. Father Ryan, Red Bank, N.B., and one copy to the Department. The other copy should be retained on file in your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.T. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. Roberts, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRed Rapids, N.B.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. F. C. RYAN, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR NEW BRUNSWICK, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE TOBIQUE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON OCTOBER 10, 1928.\n\nI find that both the Rev. Sisters are working overtime in the classroom and when all pupils return a very hard year lies before them. The Rev. Nurse has now more than she can do under the most trying circumstances and the deplorable conditions in so many of the Indian homes. I can see no other hope for the progress of the work than a field matron. The Department realizes that it is a strict rule of this Order that no Sister goes alone to visit homes. If a field matron or a domestic science teacher was appointed, the Nurse could accompany her on certain days and much good could be done. As it is at present, the teaching of domestic science must suffer, and this would be most disastrous, as we cannot drop this most important branch of our work without detriment to all the other work on the Reserve.\n\nI feel with the Department that already for the size of this Reserve three paid Sisters is considerable. Yet the work must be done. Why not appoint another paid Sister as field matron and domestic science teacher, who, in conjunction with the Nurse, could clean up conditions on the Reserve. This arrangement might be given a trial for three or four years, after which period, no doubt, three Sisters could do the work.\nOctober 27, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nWhen the combined hospital and teachers' residence was erected on the Tobique Reserve, three Sisters were appointed for the day school and hospital work. These Sisters are all paid from School Vote and are classed as teachers. Father Ryan and the Sister Superior are now urging the appointment of a fourth Sister as field matron. If a position is to be established, I would suggest that it be that of \"Nurse\" because of the presence of the hospital. School funds would then be responsible for the two teachers and the field matron, but we would class the last named worker with the teachers. These Sisters are in receipt of $700 for the 10 teaching months. If a position is established and paid from Medical Vote, I would suggest a stipend of $720 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 11, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, with reference to the payment of the salary of the hospital nurse on the Tobique Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the position of hospital nurse has not been established, and it was necessary, in order to provide a salary for this service, to place the nurse in the same category as the teachers and make payment of her salary on the same conditions. The Department has given careful consideration to an increase in the establishment on this Reserve, but it is regretted that no further increase can be made at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Bridgid,\nTobique Indian Reserve,\nMaliseet, N.B.\nThe following is an extract from Nurse Murdoch's report of her recent visit to Tobique Reserve:\n\n\"The school children of this Reserve seem brighter and better cared for than those of the other Reserves.\"\nMay 12th, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nINSPECTION OF TOBIQUE AGENCY\n\nSchool on Tobique Reserve.\n\nThe day school on the Tobique Reserve is conducted by the Sisters in a commodious modern building, fully equipped for all purposes, the two large class rooms being bright and roomy and the whole building kept in a clean, first class condition.\n\nThirty-two children (19 boys and 13 girls) comprise the pupils in the lower grades 1-4, whilst 15 children (8 boys and 7 girls) form the upper class (grades 5-9).\n\nThe actual attendance is fairly satisfactory, although there is a tendency on the part of some of the Indian parents to keep their children at home on occasion, for somewhat trivial reasons, a frequent excuse being that the children have insufficient clothing and shoes, but the Indians were told at a general meeting that the children must attend school regularly except in case of sickness, and that where clothing was really needed, the Indian agent would see that such was provided.\n\nTwo boys, Felix Francis & Sam Davis, and five girls, Mary J. Sappier, Madeline Alexander, Susie Paul, Eva Nicholas and Pauline Moulton were found to be often absent, and the truant officer, George Bernard, was instructed to visit the parents and impress on them the necessity of seeing that their children regularly attended school in future.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of this fact we feel the Department should be willing to give us a donation to help provide the rest of the necessaries.\n\nWe have about fifteen pupils who are anxious to study music and later we expect to include some of the older children which we feel would be a great help to the morale of the place.\n\nI have spoken of this matter to Mr. MacPhail who is very interested but of course can do very little without the consent of the Department.\n\nAnticipating a favourable reply at your earliest convenience, I wish to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSister Honora\nTeacher\nOttawa, 7th November, 1945.\n\nDear Sister Honora:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3lst ultimo, we are prepared to purchase a reasonable quantity of music and music books for use of the Tobique Indian Day School.

A cheque for the amount of $70 has been forwarded for the quarter ended September 30th, last, and at the end of June, 1929, which will complete the 10 months in the year, the full salary at the above rate will have been paid.

Stewart, Perth, N.B. for No.416 McClary furnace installed in the Tobique Indian school.\n\nI beg to inform you that the $20.00 credit for old pipe and registers was all that Mr. Stewart could allow as they were in very bad condition, the registers were all more or less broken not worth repairing, and the pipe had rusted so it was not worth very much, $20.00 being a fair value for the old pipe and registers.\n\nMr. Stewart has done a first class job installing the new furnace, and no doubt it will give perfect satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.J. Roberts\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Ferris,\n\nYou will note in Agent Robert's letter of November 3rd that he states that the foreman, Mr. A. G. Fields, who was in charge of the erection of the Tobique School apparently was absent at weekends, going home on Saturday afternoon, not returning on the job until Monday noon and sometimes Tuesday and Wednesday. When drafting your reply of November 12th to Agent Roberts I should be pleased to know whether you took this into consideration. Certified labour returns have been received from Agent Roberts up to October 29th they show that Mr. Fields has been paid in full each week, except for the week ending June 11th when he was only paid for the first three days and the week ending June 18th when Mr. Fields was not paid for Monday and Tuesday.\n\nPossibly it might be well to inquire from Mr. Roberts what time Mr. Fields lost through going home on week-ends, and if he paid him for same. I understand this man was employed by the day, and the Agent should only have paid him for the time he was actually on the job.\n\nChief Accountant.\n**Record of Labour on the Addition to Schoolhouse @ Indian Point**\n\nFor week ended December 14, 1927\n\nAll payments to be made in presence of person signing as witness.\n\n| NAMES          | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thur | Fri | Sat | No. days worked | Price per day | Amount of wages | RECEIVED PAYMENT |\n|----------------|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| A.G.

Kindly forward cheque to cover balance.\n\nThe two class rooms are completed, and they look fine, and the teaching Sisters are well pleased with everything, the desks are installed, and the blackboards are all arranged also two cupboards, one in each class room, the domestic science room requires a sewing table to be made also a cupboard to complete this room, there was not sufficient lumber left to build this with, and I did not want to keep Mr. Fields for this small job.\n\nI recommend for your approval and authority to purchase four hundred feet of finished lumber at $30. per thousand and a carpenter to build the table and cupboard required for the domestic science room, it should not require a carpenter over two days.\n\nThe new school house is a big improvement for educational purposes, and to the Indian Point Village, the Indians should benefit by the establishment now arranged for their children, the Reverend Principal Teacher informed me that the number of pupils to attend school are thirty or more for each school room, the statistics show a substantial increased population at the Tobique Point.\n\nTest.

You should consult the Rev. Sister in charge as to the supplies required, and arrange for the purchase of same.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, which you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.

Fields' account, I believe it advisable to let you have a report and to ask for your direction.\n\nMr. A. G. Fields, who was appointed foreman for the construction of the addition to the Tobique Indian Day School, has been paid at the rate of $8 per day. He has had steady employment since June 20th and time sheets have been forwarded, showing that he has received $8 per day for every working day from that time until the 17th instant. Mr. Indian Agent Roberts, on the 3rd instant, reported that Mr. Fields left the job on Saturdays in the afternoon, in time to reach his home in Woodstock, a distance of 60 miles, to spend the weekend, and that he did not return on the job until Monday noon and sometimes Tuesday and Wednesday. As Mr. Fields has been paid for all the time lost at week ends, I do not consider that he is entitled to mileage for the use of his car. On the 13th instant the Department instructed the Indian Agent to inform Mr. Fields that we regretted favourable consideration to the account could not be given.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 284-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRed Rapids, N.B. November 30, 1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant, No.66-2-5 with reference to Mr. Fields labour returns for Tobique School addition, I beg to inform you that it will be necessary to allow Mr. Fields full time whether he was at the job or not, owing to the fact that he was authorized to purchase all materials for the building, therefore Mr. Fields claimed when not engaged at the job that he was away making arrangements for the purchase of materials, and of course this took considerable amount of his time away from the work, and perhaps more time than it should, but this was his argument when questioned why he was not on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.J.

I would state further in connection with my memorandum of November 30th, that a recent letter from the Agent has left a sort of doubt in my mind as to whether Mr. Fields would not have a claim for some reasonable allowance for the use of his motor car. The account is made out most extravagantly, and I think if he were allowed $75.00 or $80.00, it would be all that should be paid. You will note by the account that these trips to Perth and Andover seem to have been taken without any proper consideration for the administration of the work. You will notice that on consecutive days he was going to Perth for different articles, when if he had proper control he would have made one trip suffice. I would offer not more than $80.00 as a final settlement.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSTATEMENT OF ACCOUNT\n\nFROM\nFRASER COMPANIES LIMITED\n\nPILSON ROCK, N.

January 9th, 1926.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRelative to your letter of November 25th, No. 66-2-5 regarding the time required for building cupboard in the Domestic Science Room in the basement at the Tobique Indian School house, after going over just what is required more thoroughly I find that the time required for a carpenter will be four or five days labour instead of two as I had informed you in letter dated November 21st last, therefore it will be necessary for you to authorize the required time, which should not be more than four or five days, and also the required hinges, fastenings, and locks, and also some paint if there is not enough that was left over from the painting of the school house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.J. Roberts,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

I note that it will require the time of a carpenter for four or five days to complete this work instead of two days as stated in your letter of the 21st of November, last.\n\nYou should arrange to have this work completed as soon as possible, but the services of a carpenter should not be retained any longer than is absolutely necessary. You may also purchase the hinges, fastenings, locks and paint required for the cupboard, together with the quantity of finished lumber which you were authorized to purchase in official letter of November 25th, last. It would be well to consult the Rev. Sister Superior regarding the type of cupboard and table required.\n\nIt is hoped that this work will be completed at an early date, and, when finished, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the materials and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Foster, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith further reference to the installing of suitable cupboards in the domestic science room in the basement of the school house at the Tobique Reserve, I beg to inform you that I have not been able to secure a carpenter to do this work, owing to the fact that there was no chance for to board him at the Reserve, and the rivers have not been frozen over to make it possible for a man to board elsewhere at this time of the year.\n\nThe lumber purchased form Fraser Companies is considered not suitable for the making of the doors for the cupboard, and I therefore recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of 400 feet of B.C. Fir to make doors and 200 feet of 2 by 2 for cleats and frame work.\n\nThe Reverend Sister Superior in charge at the hospital has requested for a small cupboard to be installed in each bath room in the hospital, and with the above mentioned lumber there should be enough to complete the Sisters needs for a cupboard in the hospital, which should not take a carpenter more than two days to build, I recommend this for your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should obtain this material as cheaply as possible. You may also arrange to have a small cupboard installed in each bathroom in the hospital. It is noted that, with the purchase of the above material, there will be enough lumber on hand to build all these cupboards. You should arrange with a competent carpenter to do the work, and it is expected that you will see that no unnecessary time is taken in the building of these cupboards, and that you will be able to arrange to have all this work completed at an early date.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If these accounts have been paid, therefore, there is nothing due them.\n\nKindly inform Dupuis Freres that we did not receive or give order for any goods to be shipped from them in December 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.J.

Franciscan Sisters, Maliseet, N.B. In this connection I have to say we are informed that no order was placed with you for any goods for the Rev. Sisters in December, 1926. Accounts were, however, forwarded covering supplies purchased by them in December, 1925, and two accounts were submitted by you at that time. One account, to the amount of $10.89, was paid by cheque No. 6090, February 19th, 1926, and the other, amounting to $23.10, was paid by cheque No. 6122, February 22, 1926. The items in the accounts paid cover the same supplies as in the account which you recently forwarded, which is returned herewith. It does not appear from our books that there is any further balance due for supplies forwarded to Maliseet, N.B.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The basement under the new addition is to be arranged for a domestic science classroom. It is about 36' x 26' but in the construction of the addition, due to improper planning, several pillars have been placed down the centre of the floor thus spoiling the appearance and usefulness of an otherwise large room.\n\nI note also that there is a common drinking cup at both the boys' and girls' basins. The basin has outlets for two taps, hot and cold. The hot water side is, of course, not used. I would suggest that a drinking fountain be placed on each of these basins so that cups will not be needed.\n\nC. C. Parker.\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nAn officer of this Department, who visited the Tobique Indian Day School in March, last, states that he noted there was a common drinking cup at both the boys' and girls' basins and at each basin there is an outlet for two taps - hot and cold water. The hot water taps are, of course, not used, and it is suggested that these taps could also be made available for cold water use, to which could be attached drinking fountains of the bubbling type, so that individual cups would not be required.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report as to whether fountains of the type suggested could be attached to the taps provided for hot water purposes, and, if so, the approximate cost of having same installed in both the boys' and girls' basins. A local plumber would, no doubt, be able to state whether it would be advisable to install the fountains as suggested and to give you an estimate of the cost. I should be pleased to have your early reply regarding the providing of drinking fountains for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J.

Sisters at present in charge prepare, in detail, an inventory of all Government property on hand in the hospital and school. This list should show all linens, dishes, towels, cutlery, furniture, hospital and school equipment. Four copies of this inventory should be prepared. Please forward two copies to Rev.

MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. F. C. RYAN, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR THE PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK, ON HIS VISIT TO THE TOBIQUE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe exterior of the combined teachers' residence and hospital requires painting very badly. It is too late this fall, but early next spring this should be done. The exterior is certainly in bad shape. There is nothing but knots, knots everywhere. Let the sun and rain get at same, you will certainly then have a proposition on your hands.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tobique Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the domestic science room in the basement of the day school building. He states that this room is filled up with old desks, rubbish, etc., and has requested that instructions be given that this room be at once cleared out and put in good order, as he states that the teaching of domestic science forms the most important work for the benefit of the Indian children.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have this room thoroughly cleared out. If the old desks are of no further use, they should be broken up. All rubbish should be removed and destroyed. The Department will expect to hear at an early date that this room has been placed in proper order and meets with the approval of the Sister in charge of the teaching of domestic science.\n\nThe Inspector has also drawn attention to the number of permits granted to Indian children of school age to remain at home. He recommends that, in future, before a permit is issued, the Rev. Sister Superior be consulted. I may add, it is expected that all children of school age and in good health will attend school regularly.\n\nIt is presumed that you have arranged for the purchase of the various articles as mentioned in official letter of September 8th, last. If so, the accounts covering the cost should be forwarded in duplicate, properly certified, in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

They tell me that although several letters have been sent to your department no steps have been made towards a settlement of their claim.\n\nI will be very much obliged to you if you will send me a cheque for this amount by return mail.

It is not apparent that this account has been rendered. If it is for material supplied for schools at Caughnawaga, it should reach the Department through Mr. L. Letourneau, Indian Agent, St. Constant.\n\nI may remark in this connection that in November last an account of $95.34 was paid to the above mentioned firm by the Department, and in February an account of $24.50 was paid. It is not understood, therefore, why there should be an outstanding account such as that referred to by you.\n\nI may say further that funds appropriated for expenditure in 1926 have long since lapsed, and the only money now at the Department's disposal is that voted for expenditure during the current fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

One account to the amount of $10.89 was paid by cheque No. 6090, on February 19, 1926, and the other amounting to $23.10 was paid by cheque No. 6122, on February 22nd, 1926. Both these cheques have been returned to the Finance Department here, endorsed by Dupuis Freres. Our agent at Maliseet reports that the above firm was in error in stating that the above supplies were furnished in December, 1926, as the only goods obtained were procured in December, 1925, which, as stated, included the exact items mentioned in the statement which you forwarded. Therefore, it does not appear from our books that there is any further balance due Messrs. Dupuis Freres for supplies forwarded by them to Maliseet, N. B. Messrs.

Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tobique Indian Day School, makes the following recommendations:\n\n1. That the exterior of the hospital and teachers' residence be painted.\n\n2. That the interior of the school building (both rooms) be thoroughly cleaned and all woodwork well washed, and the floors thoroughly scrubbed and, when dry, given two coats of hot oil, and that this work be done by a competent man.\n\n3. That the ceiling of the domestic science room be covered with beaver board, and the concrete floor given two good coats of paint, as it is very dusty.\n\n4. That the walls of the domestic science room be given a coat of alabastine.\n\n5. That 12 chairs be supplied for the domestic science room.\n\n6. That 2 drinking cups, attached to chains, be supplied.\n\nIn connection with the above recommendations of the Inspector, I have to request that you will furnish a report as to whether you would approve of any of this work being undertaken. If so, you should give an approximate estimate of the cost in each case, and you should also state if you can arrange to have the work carried out by day labour. You should give the above matters your early attention and furnish the information asked for, as, if it is decided to carry out any of the work, it should be completed before the schools reopen after the summer holidays.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the Rev. Sister Superior drew his attention to the use by the janitor of an outside door leading out of the domestic science room. She states that he opens this door and in the winter it makes the floors of the school very cold. The Rev. Sister considers that this door should be closed up in winter and the janitor enter by the furnace room or through the back entrance to the school. The Inspector states that the Rev. Sister could explain this matter to you, and you might take it up with her and arrange that the difficulty mentioned be satisfactorily adjusted next winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

July 19-1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter #66-2-5 dated June 26th, 1929, I beg to report that I consider all the repairs and supplies as recommended by Rev. Father Ryan and outlined in your letter to be necessary and quote the following estimates of approximate cost:\n\n1. $175 to $200, for labor and material.\n2. I would estimate that this item would cost $10.00 and would ask the Department for authority to purchase a half barrel of Imperial floor dressing, same to be applied when necessary by the Caretaker of the school.\n3. I would ask that the ceiling be covered with Gyproc as Gyproc is a better insulating board than Beaver Board and this would tend to make the floor of the room above warmer. The cost of the Gyproc would be $40.00, area to be covered being 36x21, this does not include the labor.\n4. Material and labor for floor of domestic science room approximately $20.00.\n5. Alabastine and labor for the walls and ceiling would be approximately $20.00.\n6. Chairs and drinking cups approximately $10.00.\n\nRe the last paragraph of your letter, it is my opinion that a storm door or small porch on the Domestic science room door and a storm porch on the verandah over the main entrance of the school would help to keep the floors of the school warmer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada\nOttawa, July 24th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to the painting, repairs, etc., required to the teachers' residence, hospital and domestic science room in the day school building on the Tobique reserve. Relative to the painting of the exterior of the hospital and teachers' residences, I have to say that the Department has no funds to pay the cost of having this work done during the present year and this matter will have to stand over until next spring.\n\nRelative to the cleaning of the interior of the school building (both rooms), I have to say that you may arrange to have the woodwork well washed and the floors thoroughly scrubbed and, when dry, given two coats of hot oil. You may purchase a half barrel of Imperial floor dressing, the same to be applied, when necessary, by the caretaker of the school.\n\nYou may arrange to have the ceiling of the domestic science room covered with Gyproc and the floor given two coats of a suitable type of paint for the purpose. You may, also, have the walls and ceiling given a coat of alabastine.\n\nYou are authorized to arrange for the purchase of 12 chairs suitable for use in the domestic science room. They should be of a substantial make and as inexpensive as possible. You may, also, supply two drinking cups, attached to chains.\n\nYou may, also, arrange to have a small porch erected and a storm door placed on the outside door leading out of the domestic science room. It is not intended that any unnecessary expense be incurred for this purpose.\n\nYou should purchase all the materials required for the above-authorized work and see that it is carried out by competent labour, all expenses being kept within the estimate given by you. All of this work should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays and you should, therefore, give the matter your prompt attention and have the work started at an early date. When these improvements are completed, you should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the supplying of materials, also, for the labour employed.\n\nThe Department does not consider it necessary, at the present time, to have a storm porch erected on the verandah over the main entrance to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.

The Department notes that you can have this work done at small expense while the scrapers used on the excavation of the council hall are available.\n\nThe Department will approve of your arranging to have the ground levelled, with a view to carrying off the water from the cellar of the school building. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that the ground is properly graded. This work should receive your prompt attention, and after it is completed you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They are forced to go two or three times per week to different places to buy things, and they can never depend on the Indians as they are generally away when they (the Rev. Sisters) require them.\nOttawa, November 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a list of supplies required for the use of the hospital and teachers' residence on the Tobique Reserve.\n\nI am returning this list in order that you can mark opposite each item whether the supplies are for hospital use or for the use of the teachers of the Indian school and who reside in the hospital. It is necessary to differentiate between the supplies required for hospital purposes and for the teachers' use, as the expenditure for hospital purposes is paid from an entirely different vote than that for school purposes. You should give the information asked for regarding each item on the list and return same to the Department, when consideration will then be given to authorizing the purchase. In future, I would request that you have the Sister Superior prepare separate lists for articles which she requires which are strictly for hospital use from the articles required for the teachers' use in the hospital building.\n\nWe are forwarding the envelopes and blank forms asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This floor should be cut down as I am unable to get all the wood in and am obliged to store some in Mrs Ellis' yard making additional expense in transferring.\n\nThe only way the dirt could be removed is by wheelbarrow taking it out through the Domestic Science room, this I think could be done quite economically.\n\nI would like the advice of the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, recommending that the rear section of the basement of the Tobique Indian Day School be deepened in order to provide proper storage facilities for the fuel.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are limited and unless this work could be carried out at little expense the Department would not be prepared to authorize having same done. If possible, you should forward an estimate of the cost, when further consideration will be given the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. H.

Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, in a report on his inspection in June, last, of the Tobique Indian Day School, recommends that the interior woodwork of the classrooms be washed and the walls and ceiling brushed down, also that the floors be thoroughly scrubbed and allowed to dry, after which they should be given a coat of hot oil. He also states that a number of window shades are required for the school. You should arrange, during the present summer holidays, to see that the classrooms are thoroughly cleaned, the floors given a coat of hot oil and this school placed in a cleanly condition before it re-opens. If any window blinds are required, you may arrange for their purchase and installation.\n\nFather Ryan also requests that a sand table be supplied for use in the primary department. You may arrange to have a sand table, of the size and type required, built locally and installed in the classroom, where desired by the Rev. Sister in charge. It might be well for you to consult the Rev. Sister as to the type of table that would be satisfactory and you could then have same built by a local carpenter.\n\nPlease keep all costs in connection with the above work, authorized for this school, as low as possible. When the cleaning has been carried out and the table supplied, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in further reference to installing electric lighting in the Tobique Indian Day School building.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has not, except in a few instances, provided electric lighting for a day school. It is thought that all classes, also the work of cleaning the classrooms, could be carried out during the hours of daylight, even in the late Fall. However, before finally deciding this matter, I have to request that you will give further particulars as to the cost of the electric equipment required, such as wire, globes, brackets, meter, also to the cost of the labour in having the lights installed. As it would be necessary to have a separate meter, the cost of installing same should be included in your estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nPerth, New Brunswick,\nJuly 31-1930.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Departmental letter #68-2-5 dated May 31st, during Mr Parker's visit to this Agency I discussed with him the question of removing earth from the rear section of schoolbasement and I understood he was to submit recommendation that this work be done. The cost should not be in excess of $25.00.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise whether or not the work is to be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPerth, New Brunswick,\nJuly 31-1930.\n\nSir:\n\nAnswering Departmental letter #66-2-5 dated July 23rd,\n\nI would estimate the total cost of wiring school at $65. or $75., including meter, labour etc. I have a tender of $75.00 for the complete job including materials.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware there are windows on only one side of the school building and the Principal maintains that on dark winter afternoons it is very difficult to work so I would ask that the Department consider this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPerth, New Brunswick,\nJuly 31-1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been requested by the Principal of Tobique school to supply a sewing machine for the Domestic Science room.\n\nWould the Department please advise if this could be supplied and whether or not I should submit price from a local firm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 5, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to supply, from your nearest branch office, for the use of the Indian day school on the Tobique Reserve, near Perth, N.B., the following:\n\n1 No. 2 - 5 Drawer Machine, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nYour Agent should notify Mr. N. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B., when this machine is available, and he will then furnish the necessary shipping instructions.\n\nPlease also forward your account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the machine to Mr. MacPhail, who is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the machine, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment. This account should show the retail price and discount of 50% allowed off the 90 day list price \"on which terms purchase is made\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nSinger Sewing Machine Co.,\nBank St.,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Tobique Indian Day School to be supplied with a sewing machine for use in the domestic science room, I have to inform you that we are today placing an order with the Singer Sewing Machine Company here to supply, from their nearest branch office, the following:\n\n1 No. 2 - 5 Drawer Machine, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nYou will be advised when the machine is ready for delivery, and you should then furnish them with the necessary shipping directions.\n\nThe account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the machine will also be sent you. This account should show the retail price and discount of 50% allowed off the 90 day list price \"on which terms purchase is made\". When this machine is received, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nWhen this machine arrives, it is hoped that it will prove satisfactory for the use of the Reverend Sisters in their work in the teaching of domestic science.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nOttawa, August 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 31st ultimo, relative to the removing of earth from the rear section of the basement of the Tobique Indian Day School in order to provide storage facilities for the fuel and also giving an estimate of the cost of wiring the school building for electric lighting purposes.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the earth in the rear section of the basement removed. It is noted that you estimate the cost of deepening the basement sufficiently to provide the extra space required for fuel should not exceed the sum of $25, and, if possible, this amount should not be exceeded. Please arrange to have this work completed before the school reopens. You should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the labour in removing the earth.\n\nRelative to the wiring of the school, I have to say that we have no funds available for this purpose this present fiscal year, and it is regretted, therefore, that this work will have to stand over until next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This milk could be heated on the stove in the Domestic science room and some sort of a nourishing biscuit could be purchased in bulk quite economically, the cost of the milk would be about forty cents per gallon and could be delivered each morning.\n\nPlease advise if the Department would consider this project for the balance of the winter or until April thirtieth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H.

If the nurse and yourself recommend that milk be supplied next winter, the matter may be drawn to the attention of the Department next fall, when, if there are funds, consideration would then be given to authorizing the expenditure required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Will he let me work painting the church? I am a painter by trade. I found out late by the letters you sent to the Indians that only Public work was compulsory, and I would like to get my wages for the work I did in church. I ruined my clothes on the job and instead of giving me something so I could get some clothes which I need badly, he goes and cuts my relief from $5 to $4 dollars. Myself and wife and baby $3 dollars. My brother he put to board with me was getting here now he gets only $1 a week. Can't board a man for that he is starving as well. I've asked for\nmore for him but McPhail refused to give it. Then I told him he would have to get another place for him. He said if I put him out he would cut my relief. I was good enough to work my trade in relief but I do wish you could arrange it so I could get some clothes. I need them and I can't buy them out of my relief. I worked at the church painted the church inside work it took 3 coats of paint and wood work. If it was contracted it would cost them around a hundred dollars. I worked 15 days there it came to from $4 to $6 dollar a day.\n\nIn regards to the convent here on the reserve I hear they are going to paint it - if so I would like to get the job of painting it - I would work for $8 per day 9 hours and let the gov't furnish the paints and stuff needed. It would be a lot cheaper and just as good a work done.\n\nHoping to get an answer direct to me if you answer through McPhail I get no satisfaction.\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 284-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 28, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe question has arisen as to what primary allotment in this year's Appropriation should be used for a water tank at the Topique hospital and teachers' residence\u2014a combined building. I believe it is now timely for the Medical portion of the Vote to undertake somewhat more of the expenditure than in the past.\n\nUpon reviewing the costs at this school, I find that for the five years ended March 31, 1925, the average yearly expenditure for all purposes for the two-classroom Indian day school was $991.00. During the fiscal years 1923-24 and 1924-25 the hospital and teachers' residence was erected at a cost to Indian Education of $22,670. I believe at this time some of the furnishing, which was additional, was charged to the Medical portion of the New Brunswick Vote. This charge on Indian Education was at least $15,000 more than if we had built a teachers' residence only.\n\nWith reference to the current expenses since that time, I believe that they have averaged $3,464 for the past six years. This was at least $1,500 more per year than if a day school only was being operated. Half of this extra expense, of course, is the salary of the third teacher. One of the Sisters is so classified, but, as a matter of fact, her duties are those of nurse and field matron.\n\nI propose to discuss this with Dr. Stone, with a view to a more fair apportioning of the costs in future. In view of the difficulties of changing the classification of the third worker, I suggest that $600 or $700 of the miscellaneous expenses be paid from Medical primary allotment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 284-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSIR:\n\nI recommend that the school children of Tobique Reserve be supplied with two dozen tooth brushes.\n\nMy reason for making this recommendation is that twenty-four of the children are neglecting daily brushing of their teeth because they have no tooth brushes.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH NURSE\nOffice of the Northern Division, N. Indian Agency,\n\nPerth, N. B. May 20/32.\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 804, amounting to $36.42 in favour of The Geo. T. Baird Co., Ltd., Perth, N. B., for Blinds-Map Rollers etc. Tobique School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental 30-66 Apl. 30/31 Letter No. 52-5-4 dated May 1/32.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, June 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of voucher dated the 20th ultimo in favour of Geo. T. Baird Co. Ltd., Perth, N.B., to the amount of $35.42 for supplies for the use of the domestic science class and for window shades and rollers for maps for the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department does not understand why there was such delay in forwarding the account in payment for these supplies. You quote as your authority for the purchase official letters dated April 30, 1931, and May 1, 1931. In letter of May 1, 1931, authority was given to purchase 6 window curtains. We have been unable, however, to find any authority to purchase 6 rollers for maps; at a total cost of $17.10. The Department does not furnish equipment of this kind for Indian day schools. All maps supplied are mounted on wooden rollers, which is considered sufficient. You should explain the reason for the delay in forwarding the accounts, also state on whose authority the rollers for the maps were obtained.\n\nOur funds this year are extremely limited, and, before any purchase is made, the Principal of the school should make requisition through your office and you should receive the necessary authority, also all accounts covering purchases for the school should be forwarded by you, properly certified, not later than one month after the purchase has been made. By withholding accounts as in this instance, the Department is misled as to the amount of funds that will be required for the current expenses of the school during the year.\n\nPayment of the account will be withheld until your explanation is received regarding the purchase of the rollers for the maps and as to the delay in forwarding the account, it being over a year since authority for the purchase of some of the supplies was granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.

This is most convenient and saves wasting a considerable amount of space.\n\nThe \"Commercial\" Map Case is made to order only, in plain oak or birch mahogany, at the following prices:\n\n| No.   | Size   | Length of Roller Accommodated | Price |\n|-------|--------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| 2-134 | 4-Slat | 54 inches                     | $42.00|\n| 2-136 | 6-Slat | 54 inches                     | 45.00 |\n| 2-138 | 8-Slat | 54 inches                     | 49.00 |\n| 2-144 | 4-Slat | 78 inches                     | 45.00 |\n| 2-146 | 6-Slat | 78 inches                     | 49.00 |\n| 2-148 | 8-Slat | 78 inches                     | 52.00 |\n| 2-154 | 4-Slat | 86 inches                     | 49.00 |\n| 2-156 | 6-Slat | 86 inches                     | 52.00 |\n| 2-158 | 8-Slat | 86 inches                     | 56.00 |\n\nQuartered cut oak can be furnished if necessary at an additional cost of 10%.\n\nPrices are for the Cases only, and do not include any maps, spring rollers, or other fittings.\n\nMAP MOUNTING\n\nAs we are in a position to handle in a thoroughly satisfactory manner all forms of map mounting, we solicit your business for any special work you may require in connection with your present maps.\n\nKindly communicate with us, giving full particulars of your requirements.\n\nPrices do not include Forwarding Charges and are Subject to Change without Notice.\nJOHNSTON'S SCHOOL GLOBE\n\nThe importance and necessity of the globe for demonstrating the spherical shape of the earth has become fully recognized. It alone shows the correct relative sizes of the various countries, thus eliminating the possibility of misconception created by maps of the hemispheres and on flat projection.\n\nThe maps have been revised to show all political changes, etc., brought about by the wars of 1870 and other treaties. An exhaustive amount of legible detail is given, particularly in the large globes. Mountains, rivers, lakes, trade winds, ocean currents, chief towns, railways, submarine cables, etc., receive full attention, while the boundaries and interdivision of countries are included.\n\nThe maps are perfectly mounted on strong and substantial globe balls, which are correct in shape, true revolving and well balanced. After being moulded, each globe receives five coats of special varnish to protect the surface from dust. Any accumulation of the latter may be removed in an instant by means of a duster.\n\nThe Bases are attractively designed in heavy metal, electro-copper-plated, non-tarnishing and highly polished.\n\nA handbook entitled \"Globe Manual\" is sent free of charge with each globe.\n\nNOTE\u2014In purchasing globes, we strongly recommend the 12- and 18-inch sizes, on account of the clear manner in which the various details are shown.\n\n| Plain Stand | Stationary Meridian |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| No.         | Diameter of Ball    | Price       | No.         | Diameter of Ball    | Price       |\n| 3-210       | 8 inches            | $7.00       | 3-212       | 8 inches            | $9.00       |\n| 3-220       | 12                  | $12.00      | 3-222       | 12                  | $14.25      |\n| 3-240       | 18                  | $35.75      | 3-242       | 18                  | $40.75      |\n\nPrices do not include Forwarding Charges and are Subject to Change without Notice.\nPerth, N.

Please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nTo: Dept. Of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada:\n\nAug 6th 1936\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFew days ago, I was looking over the Tobique Indian day school, and discovered that it really needs painting very bad, another year would be worse. As an Indian agent being away, I cannot draw his attention to it. So I thought that I would bring this matter with the Department so, I can invite work, for some of the Indians.\n\nI am a sign painter, and am able to mix any kind of paint required for building purpose. Many of the members are out of work, and besides it would be best to paint now before school opens up.\n\nJust say the word, and I'll measure the building and send you the actual measurements, total cost of material etc. At present I'm out of work. I have been painting buildings at Perth and Andover, besides signs, trucks etc. My references will be furnished on request. I am cordially waiting for immediate reply.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nCharles Paulie,\nOjibwe.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nI enclose account covering the cost of paint and equipment used in painting the Tobique Indian Day School. This work was done by Indians working under the supervision of the Indian Agent. Please issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to painting the Tobique School. The Department finds it necessary to return the following accounts:\n\n1. **Voucher No. 137**\n\nThis voucher should show the dates on which Chas. Saulis was employed, also the number of hours and the rate per hour. It is noted that in return for his labour Saulis was supplied with lumber by F.D. Sadler Co. You should attach to the voucher a receipt from Saulis acknowledging receipt of the lumber.\n\n2. **Voucher No. 138**\n\nAs this covers the cost of clothing and groceries supplied to Indians for painting the Tobique School you should attach to the voucher receipts from the Indians mentioned acknowledging receipt of the supplies and clothing which they secured.\n\n3. **Voucher No. 136**\n\nSimilar information should be given on this voucher as has been requested on voucher 137 and 138.\n\nArrangements are being made to pay voucher 196.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nI regret that the expenditure exceeded the amount authorized. You can realize that it is impossible for this Branch to properly administer the funds if Indian Agents assume authority for greater expenditures than that for which approval is granted.\n\nIt is noted that you state that the blocks, rope and hooks will be available for future work. Please let me know where you have these stored.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nExtract from report of Rev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian schools for the Province of New Brunswick, regarding his inspection of the Tobique Indian day school on September 27, 1938.\n\nThe exterior of this school was well painted during vacation however the interior is in sad need of being painted. I trust the Indian Dept. will kindly consider this next July or August.\n\n(Sgd.) F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Schools.\nPerth, N. B. December 5th, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nWould the Department please authorize the expenditure of $12.00 for school children, Tobique Reserve for Christmas treat. This has been the amount expended the past few years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa,\nDecember 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $12.00 in providing a Christmas treat for the children of the Tobique Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.

Some days are so dark that we really need lights the greater part of the day, and Dr. McIntosh says it is an urgent need as the lights would eliminate so much eye strain.

August 8th, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nPainting interior Tobique School\n\nIn reply to letter #55-2-11 dated July 6th, I beg to submit the following estimate given me by a local paint contractor:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Price   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|---------|\n| 10 Gals. Interior Gloss Paint |          | $47.50  |\n| 75 Lbs.

My estimate for materials was only 7 Gals. and I think I could get the job done for around $100.00. However there are two classrooms 21x35' with 15' ceiling, sheathed up 3ft. with 4 large connecting doors and 6 large windows (double) in each room. In addition there are two entrance halls and two toilets in basement.\n\nAny washing or preparatory work can be done by Indian women but I would not care to have the painting done by Indian labour. I doubt if any of them would be available in any case.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to authorize this work I would ask that they use the painters' estimate and I will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1942.\n\nE.A.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, you may arrange for the painting of the interior of the Tobique Indian Day School. It is noted from your letter that you have received a quotation of $210.00 for material and labour but that you consider you can have the work done at a lower cost. The Department will look forward, with interest, to seeing how much you can reduce this expenditure.\n\nIt is also noted that Indian labour will not be available, but if you can secure Indians you should use them. With regard to white labour, you should employ those on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. N.H.

I was unable to get the services of a competent electrician at the time.\n\nIn the meantime, I was instructed in letter 66-2-5-dated May 25/48, to make a thorough check of all wiring in both the Teachers' Residence and school and make any necessary repairs.\n\nThis work was started, and when the lights authorized, were to be installed, the electrician advised they would be no improvement over the old ones. He recommended that fluorescent lights be installed. While Mr. Bright, the electrician was available, this work was done, without further authority from the Department.\n\nI trust this expenditure may be approved.\n\nFor your information, repair work in the Teachers' Residence is not yet completed. That will consist mainly of new wiring; no fixtures are required.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Supt.,\nNorthern N. B.

Janitorial work: school room scrubbed once each year.\n\nC.H.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\nTobique Indian Day School.\n\nThere are two rooms in operation at Tobique. Nineteen pupils were present in the Senior room and twenty-six in the Junior. The reading of the pupils was fairly fluent but the teaching of the subject is very traditional. As in many of the schools no definite training of the physical aspects of reading have been undertaken. The Indian child has certain muscular deficiencies which prevents the pronunciation of sounds. This can be overcome only by muscular exercise in order to train and produce these sounds.\n\nThe weaving and sewing are quite satisfactory. The pupils enjoy this work, and a demonstration was made of the methods of interpreting this work with the academic. I feel that by this means many of the lessons in the classroom will become meaningful.\n\nGood work is being done at this school and while I did not check all the academic subjects, I am satisfied that progress is being made.\n\nThe exterior of the residence is badly in need of paint. This should be done if at all possible this season as deterioration is liable to take place. This residence is part hospital and part residence. In fact, the complete main floor and part of the basement is used for hospital charges. Whether the Medical Branch will assume any obligation for the up-keep of this building or not, I can not say. I feel that they have a definite responsibility there.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Vocational Training.\n\nJune 7, 1949.\nJune 8, 1949.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nPerth, N.B.,\n\nFollowing his inspection of the Tobique Day School, Mr. Doucet has reported to this office that he considers the exterior of the residence is in need of paint.\n\nWe are aware that the building mentioned is used partly as a teacher's residence and partly for a hospital.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us know the approximate cost of the material and labour to paint the exterior of the building. You might obtain quotations for the painting on the basis of day labour with the Department supplying the paint which we can secure at a reasonable cost.\n\nWhen we have this information, we will discuss the matter with the Indian Health Services with a view to determining if they will assist with the expenditure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRP/HM\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: May 20, 1949\n\nFor: Tobique Indian Day School\nNorthern NB Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES          | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Print             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Yarn              |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Bread             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Tatting Shuttle   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Tape Binding      |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Sugar             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Sugar             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Flour             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Butter            |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Milk              |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Cocoa             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Mixing Bowl       |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Mixing Spoon      |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Pie Plates        |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Sister Honora\nSchool: Tobique Indian Day\nPost Office (nearest): Matiscet NB\nExpress Office (nearest): Bath NB\nProvince: New Brunswick\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 413\n\nIndian Affairs.

You quote as authority official letter of January 24, 1949.\n\nThe last paragraph of that letter read in part as follows: \"If the work has already proceeded we will honour accounts to $221.31, the amount previously authorized.\" Apparently the work had not proceeded at that time, as the account from G.W. Wright is dated May 11th, 1949, and consequently, we feel that you should have written to us again before incurring the expenditure. You will also note that the amount of the Voucher is $86.89 more than the amount mentioned in official letter of January 24th, 1949.\n\nPlease let us have an explanation of the reasons for your action in this particular matter. Did you receive a tender from Mr. Wright for the materials and labour? If so, you should forward it to us.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nOctober 3, 1949.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nPerth, N.B.,\n\nTobique Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached in duplicate a pupil enrolment form which I would like to have completed and returned here in due course.\n\nYou will recall that I mentioned this pre-school age, grade sex form to you when I recently visited Tobique. With this information, we will be able to more intelligently decide on whether a three or four classroom is required for the Tobique School.\n\nI have already ordered the blackboard for the proposed basement classroom and would appreciate hearing from you as to whether any progress has been made in securing the services of a third teacher. If so, we should requisition for the classroom tables and chairs which will be needed.\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Victoire with a Second Class Certificate, five years of Provincial and five years of Indian experience. Sister M. Honora with a First Class Certificate, ten years of Indian and eleven years of Provincial experience.\n\nSchool Building -\n\nThis is a two-room school with folding doors between the classrooms. The two rooms are bright and attractive with fair space for the number of children enrolled now. However, when the children return from Maine, it is obvious that an extra classroom will be required.\n\nClassroom Activities -\n\n(a) Senior Room - Sister Honora is doing a first rate job of teaching. The pupils tested well and I spent some time indicating how the vocabulary and language work could be improved. Her discipline is good and the pupils are interested in their work. She has a large number of boys attending and they are working hard.\n\n(b) Junior Room - Sister Victoire is also a capable teacher and handles her class well. The high grades one and two speaking out more loudly and more clearly than many classrooms I have inspected. They read well - and in phrases and sentences. There is no word calling and she stresses this from the beginner classes up.\n\nThis is one of the better schools we have in our system and the credit is largely due to the calibre of teachers employed.\n\nRecommendations -\n\n1. That a third classroom be opened this Fall in the basement. There is a domestic science classroom, and heating is adequate. As electricity is available, a primary room could be operated here for the winter.\n\n2. Mr. Doucet should visit this school and decide how a third and possibly a fourth classroom could be added.\n\n3. Send census form to Mr. MacPhail so that the potential pupilage can be determined.\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Tobique Indian Day School\n\nIn reply to letter dated September 9th., re voucher No. 261, in favour of George W. Wright.\n\nMy original instructions in connection with electrical repairs on Tobique school and Hospital were that all necessary repairs be made to eliminate fire risk.\n\nWhen Mr. Wright started to work in May, there was nothing I could do except let him proceed with the work as he saw fit.\n\nThe account has been held up for sometime, as I felt there should be some salvaged material. Mr. Wright finally showed me the old wiring, etc., that he had removed and as it was not fit to be used anywhere, I forwarded the account as submitted.\n\nIt was my intention to go over this work thoroughly with Mr. Neary during his recent visit but I forgot to take up the question of Mr. Wright's work.\n\nI trust this account may be approved.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Supt.,\nNorthern N. B. Agency.\nOctober 6th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $308.70 covering the cost of repairs to the wiring in the Teacher's residence and day school on the Tobique Reserve. When forwarding this account, Superintendent MacPhail writes as follows:\n\n\"My original instructions in connection with electrical repairs on Tobique School and Hospital were that all necessary repairs be made to eliminate fire risk.\n\nWhen Mr. Wright started to work in May, there was nothing I could do except let him proceed with the work as he saw fit.\n\nThe account has been held up for sometime, as I felt there should be some salvaged material. Mr. Wright finally showed me the old wiring, etc., that he had removed and as it was not fit to be used anywhere, I forwarded the account as submitted.\"\n\nWe agree with Mr. MacPhail that the work was extremely necessary, and when the electrician was working it was necessary to complete what was required. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.\n\nBernard F.

One difficulty in heating the rooms is the excessive height of the ceilings. This of course could be fairly easily remedied. Some repair will be necessary to the plaster. This should not be expensive for I believe that the present plaster is sufficiently good to justify repairing.\n\nAppended to this report is the number of pupils from the age of 6 to 16 years. The present enrolment is 80 and there appears to be no great change in this enrolment for at least five years. From the figures given in this appended summary it appears that the addition of one classroom would adequately satisfy the educational needs of this reserve for the next ten years. The present plan lends itself readily to the addition of a third classroom giving it the shape of an L. The third classroom windows would be facing south which would give adequate lighting. Below this classroom a well organized Manual Training shop could be devised.\n\nI would then suggest that an architect proceed at the earliest convenience to Tobique and make the plans so that this construction may be undertaken as\nsoon as weather permits. The rough lumber could be obtained from the reserve at the approximate cost of $32.00 per thousand. The heating system could readily be changed into a forced air heating system. Our mode of construction should be decided as soon as possible so that Superintendent MacPhail may be given an advance to have the lumber prepared.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources & Development,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nTobique Indian Day School\nRestigouche Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nThe Tobique Indian Day School is situated near Perth, N.B., and the Restigouche Indian Day School is situated near Campbellton, N.B.\n\nTobique School - The Tobique Indian Day School is a two-room school with a third class presently being conducted in the basement. We are anxious to make a one-room addition to this building and would appreciate a visit from one of your architects so that the necessary plans and specifications can be prepared. The present plan lends itself readily to the addition of a third classroom which would give the building the shape of an L. The windows of this third classroom would be facing the south which would ensure adequate lighting. Below this classroom a well organized Manual Training shop could be installed in the basement. Mr. Indian Superintendent MacPhail lives at Perth and will be able to take the architect out to the school so that the necessary plans can be prepared.\n\nRestigouche School - This is a five-room building and we are conducting a sixth class in the nearby provincial school. Two of the classrooms provided are...\nvery small having been devised when the building was modified.\n\nWe wish to extend this building in the form of an H thereby adding two classrooms and enlarging the two small ones. Mr. Indian Superintendent Nadeau lives at Restigouche and arrangements could be made to meet the architect when he arrives at Campbellton which is two miles away.\n\nBoth of these projects are readily accessible and are not too far apart. It would be appreciated if you could have an architect proceed to these schools to draft plans and specifications for these required additions. If further details are needed they can be obtained from the Education Division of this Branch.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To exchange service - Teachers' Residence |        |\n|      | Tobique Reserve - month of January | 3.16   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Mr. Doucet was of the opinion that one class-room 30' x 30' should be added to the present building.\n\nIf this expenditure is to be approved, I would request the authority to cut and saw rough lumber required, within the next few weeks.\n\nI do not know the exact specifications of the proposed wing but estimate approximately 15 m.b.ft. would be required. This will cost $20.00 per thousand for cutting, yarding and trucking. I would not be able to have the lumber sawed however until I have the exact specifications of floor and ceiling beams, rafters, etc.\n\nIf this expenditure meets with the approval of the Department, please forward advance cheque for $300.00 to pay above mentioned costs. Account for the sawing at $11.00 per thousand will be submitted by voucher.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Supt.,\nTobique Indian Superintendency.\n1 March, 1950.\n\nMr. N. H.

This money will not become available until April 1, 1950.\n\nI presume from your letter that you would recommend erection by day labour rather than by contract. In this way you can be certain that more Indians will be employed in the construction of the building.\n\nIf you have a foreman-carpenter in mind, please give me his name, address and recommended rate of pay per hour. We can then obtain Ministerial approval for his appointment during the construction of the building.\n\nI wrote to the Department of Resources and Development requesting that they have an engineer visit the school and prepare the necessary plans and specifications. They will try to have an engineer down in the near future.\n\nIf you intend to use day labour as suggested above, then we agree that the cheapest way would be to buy lumber from the Indian mill. Please write again outlining your plans and we can forward the accountable advance after April 1, 1950.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n22 February, 1950.\n\nMr. H. H.

Jones,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI was called to the Tobique Reservation yesterday by the Chief and Father Sam who had several complaints to make.\n\nI understand that the building of two welfare houses was started. The basements are in but they have not had any further word to go ahead.\n\nAt the school. The engineer and inspector were there taking measurements for a 30 foot wing to be built on the school and said the work would start right away, but nothing has been heard since. I do not agree with the engineer's plan to build this wing as it is on the wrong side of the building. They have three teachers now with two classrooms. I understand one of these teachers is only temporary. There will be 90 children starting this fall and 50 more next fall so they are quite crowded.\n\nThey told me that an educational representative from Ottawa was there this spring and told them to get 8 boys and girls ready to go to vocation school or a higher grade school and everything would be arranged. Nothing more has been heard about this and they have the boys and girls all ready.\n\nThe foundation of the pump house needs to be looked after at once, otherwise it is apt to undermine the house which will slide into the river. Although there is ledge at this point they did not dig down to it and there is about 5 feet of loose gravel between the concrete bottom of the pump house and the ledge. The side next to the river has been washed away and it should be wharfed up at once to save further damage.\n\nI was asked to bring these matters to your attention with the hopes that you might give them prompt attention.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) H.H. Hatfield\nVictoria-Carleton.\n\n17/7/50.\n\nColonel Neary -\n\nFor your comments, please.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS WALTON\n\nTobique Indian Day School\n\nI cannot answer the queries with regard to the school as there has been no report from Mr. Goedike yet. He visited this school on May 28 but we have yet to receive his report.\n\nThe boys and girls who graduated from grade 8 are being left at Tobique for grade 9 studies.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 1st, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. BUCK,\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\n\nSome time ago Mr. Goedike prepared a report on his inspection of the Tobique Indian Day School and water supply system. This report was sent to your office some time ago.\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. H. H. Hatfield, M.P., from which I quote, -\n\n\"Re the school. The engineer and inspector were there taking measurements for a 30' wing to be built on the school and said the work would start right away, but nothing has been heard since. I do not agree with the engineer's plan to build this wing as it is on the wrong side of the building. They have three teachers now with two classrooms. I understand one of these teachers is only temporary.

Nothing more has been heard about this and they have the boys and girls all ready.\"\n\nYou will note that Mr. Hatfield does not agree with Mr. Goedike's recommendations. Please let me have sufficient information to enable me to reply to Mr. Hatfield's letter.\n\nIn Mr. Hatfield's letter he also refers to the foundation of the pump house. We have written to the Indian Superintendent for a report on this matter, as Mr. Ross, the only engineer familiar with this installation and pump house, is out of town and will be away for a month or so.\n\nMW/D\nAugust 1, 1950.\n\nCol. Jones,\nSuperintendent of Welfare,\n\nNo - Letter dated July 14 from Mr. R. H. Hartfield, M. P.,\nof Hartland, N.

With reference to the school it is true that an engineer and an official of the Indian Education Division visited the existing school to gather data to enable the Department to decide what should be done to provide further accommodation for pupils. Their recommendations have not as yet been studied by the Chief Engineer and other interested officers of the branch. Therefore no decision has yet been reached as to the location of the addition in relation to the existing building.\n\nWhen a decision is reached as to what steps will be taken to provide additional accommodation at the school we will write to you further.\n\nWith regard to the pump house we have asked our Indian Superintendent for a report as the engineer who had charge of this work is presently out of town and we have been unable to secure any information from him. If the foundation of the pump house requires attention you may be sure that no time will be lost in making the necessary repairs.\n\nEngineering and Construction Service\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nI am writing to place before the Department the need of a dwelling on this Reserve for the teacher.\n\nFrom Sept. 1913 till Sept. 1914, I had rooms in an Indian home, rented and furnished by the Dept., at the end of the first quarter of this Indian Year, would not longer rent his rooms unless the rent was raised from $2 per month to $5 per month. In other words, $60 per year. Paying such rent seemed absurd. The cost of a small dwelling was be paid out in the course of ten or twelve years, and at the end of that time the teacher's quarters would still be uncertain. The money paid in rent seemed lost. Nothing permanent in the way of living quarters for the teacher was got out of it, and living in part of an Indian home was a form more or less satisfactory as a dwelling would be.\n\nI again attempted to board at the home of the missionary on the Reserve, as I had before. In Sept. 1913, the hope was put under repair, and this, with the fact that there was no housekeeper, excepting the part I had to take,\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is only a make-shift and inconvenient in many ways. Crossing in a canoe in pleasant weather might be agreeable but is quite different in December and January. There was no ice for crossing at all. The river began rising in October and that evening during a cold driving snowstorm I had to walk around the schoolhouse to find a bridge\u2014a distance of four miles. Luckily the next day we could not have been able to have school the following day.\n\nThe only alternative to living off the Reserve is to get work again at an Indian home. From experience this also is nothing better than a make-shift and I need hardly say that living in a one-roomed rent in the Indian home cannot be satisfactory. But this is what must be under present conditions if the teacher tries to live on the Reserve and this I contemplate doing before the breaking up of the ice.\n\nI will not again consider trying to board at the home of the mission lady. This household is uncertain and as far as I know is not one where the teacher can get necessary rest. During the year, excepting for my efforts, it was several times without a housekeeper.\n\nI do not expect anything in the way\nof a dwelling just now. But work to consider conditions, and if possible take steps that one may be provided during the same or previous.\n\nI well understand that, with the extensive repairs on the missionary house much is taken from the Indian Fund. But in these not another way could but lumber be got off the Reserve and would not enough be had above the actual material required to pay for labor, etc.\n\nAt the end of the Sept quarter, 1917 I do justice from the fact that the sum of $25 was the rent they were paying would be an to my salary but that I should compel find apartments. I would gladly give up this sum of $25 per year if the Indians would decide on providing a dwelling a small three-roomed dwelling will be sufficient.\n\nThe Indians know and understand that something is needed for the Indians and feel would do what they can. The inconvenience of living either on Reserve or on a one-roomment seems much less if a satisfactory was in view.\n\nPraying you will consider this as earnestly and have sincerely\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher, Indians.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Penson,\n\nA residence 14 x 21\u00bd feet, attached to the rear of Tobique School, containing two rooms on ground floor and two bedrooms over, will cost approximately $734.06.\n\nThe accommodation suggested will be ample for single teacher and should be provided if funds are available.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, January 21, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in which you ask the Department to erect a teacher's residence in connection with the Tobique Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable, at the present time, to comply with your request, as the money available for school purposes is limited.

I can assure you that she or any other teacher on the Zollique Reserve is badly situated for some place to live in.

Original on 160370-25F.\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK\n\nNo residence for teacher provided. One is much needed and has been asked for.\n\nNo blinds or shutters except what maps do.\n\nEthel F. McGrand,\nTeacher.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour reply to my letter of Jan. 26th in which I asked for the erection of a dwelling for the teacher in connection with the Tobique Indian school, was received several weeks since and I waited with much hope, your asking the Agent, Mr. W. written for an estimate of the cost. Your reply to this came to definitely set it aside. I have here forwarded the Department with suggestions and hope now that you will hear with a few remarks. I only feel the need of this building, and consequently may be more urgent than any who may recommend it.\n\nMcLaughlin and Luff's estimate was high and destroys all hope of having any in this way before another winter. As to the building, a second story is not necessary. Rather a dwelling consisting of a bungalow is more desirable and could be erected, I understand for less cost.\n\nAt present I am living in one room of\nan Indian house. This room 18\u00bd ft x 10\u00bd ft x 7 ft must furnish living and sleeping apartments. The house built some thirty years ago is not very comfortable and it will require considerable courage to undertake an entire winter in it should it be as severe as our winters usually are. This was exceptionally mild.\n\nIt took much time and labor to make the room, in some small measure, fit to live in. The owner is a person of whom and in the course of a year may feel that she cannot longer rent. I have had this sad experience here. It has few comforts, and the uncertainty after so much labor, does not add any. The need of a teacher's residence has always been in evidence, but work experience, conditions have reached a limit.\n\nI noted in your reply to my letter that my salary would be slightly increased. This is some recognition of my difficulty, but I would prefer that which would ensure rent in my house outside of the schoolroom, to increase of salary.\n\nTrusting that I may not seem unreasonable, I can only ask again that this\nis sincerely considered and some hope given that something will be done in this direction, at your earliest possible convenience, which I trust will not be in a too distant future.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would also strongly advise that the building be plastered instead of sheathed, as it would help to make the house a great deal warmer. I do not think the expense would be very much greater than if sheathed. And by putting in a concrete foundation, I do not believe it would exceed $200.00 more than it would cost for the cedar foundation.\n\nI also note that specifications do not call for hardwood floors, and as it is going to be the home of the teacher, whoever it may be, I am of the opinion it would be much more comfortable and would last better if they were made of hardwood.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you regarding same as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have just received quotations on material from the Woodstock Wood-Working Co. Ltd., and as the bill you sent did not state whether the outside doors were to have glass or not, they have quoted on one door with glass and the other two without. Their quotation is $708.62.\n\nI have not received quotations as yet from the other Wood-Working Co. that I have asked to quote prices.\n\nThe following have quoted prices on cement and brick:\n\nJ. T. Niles, Andover, cement $3.85 per barrel and brick $3.00 per hundred.\n\nGeo. T. Baird Co. Ltd. have quoted the same exactly on both the brick and cement.\n\nTherefore the brick and cement would cost $115.00 at Perth or Andover which are practically the same place and it would cost about $7.00 to have it hauled from either place to the Tobique Reserve. The truckage of the lumber from the Tobique narrows I estimate would cost $10.00.\n\nThis as you will see, will make the material cost in the vicinity of $850.00. If it is very urgent that a teacher's residence be erected this fall and if it has to be completed, no time should be lost in having a start made so as to have it completed before the cold weather sets in.\n\nAwaiting your further advices re the matter, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nN.J.W./M.F.G.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #16387-5 of the 30th ult. and beg to advise you I have taken the matter up with Mr. Ellis regarding his ability to erect the teacher's residence at Malineet.\n\nMr. Ellis has stated to me definitely that he would not undertake the job but would be willing to work with someone who was a capable builder. He said he would not take charge of the erection of the building as he did not think he was qualified to do the work.\n\nThat was my own impression before interviewing Mr. Ellis, and from what information I have received from him, I would not possibly recommend him as being capable of building the residence in question.\n\nI also wish to advise you that I have heard from D.J. Collins and Burgess & Davis, parties whom I asked to quote on material required for the erection of the teacher's residence. Both of these firms are not in a position to quote on the material at present, therefore, the only quotation comes from the Woodstock Wood-working Co., which I have already forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBerth, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Father Ryan called me up by phone yesterday, regarding some place for the teacher of the Tobique Reserve to live.\n\nHe states it will not be convenient for him to keep him in his house all winter. Unless the teacher's residence is going to be built, other arrangements for his rooms will have to be made.\n\nKindly advise me re same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNJW/MFG.\nOttawa, September 17, 1919.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the obtaining of accommodation for the teacher of the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were advised by official letter of the 9th instant, it is not the intention of the Department to proceed with the erection of a teacher's residence at the present time. It is thought that the teacher and yourself should be able to make suitable arrangements for living quarters and board, and you will be good enough to give the teacher every assistance you can in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nN. J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth,\nN. B.\nSir,\n\nRe the School Teacher, Roy Alliston of the Tobique Reserve, I think he will be able to secure rooms with Mrs. William Ellis of the Tobique Reserve.\n\nWill you agree to allowing him $25.00 yearly towards paying for his rooms, the same as Miss McGrand was receiving?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNJW/MFG.\nOttawa, October 2, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the teacher of the Tobique Indian School will be able to secure accommodation on the reserve.\n\nThe Department cannot allow him any grant towards payment for his rooms. While Miss McGrady, the former teacher, was allowed $25.00 a year from September, 1913, to September, 1917, this allowance was discontinued from that date, she being granted an increase in her salary in lieu of payment of rent for living quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. J. Scotten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Roy Allison, School Teacher at the Reserve has applied to me for a few things that he requires for his living quarters. He finds on looking over his household goods that some things are missing.\n\nHe wants 1 salt and pepper shaker; 1 knife and fork; 2 teaspoons; 1 teapot; 1 broom; 1 pitcher; sugar bowl and sufficient oilcloth to cover two rooms - one bedroom about 8x12 feet and the other a living room and kitchen size about 12x12 feet.\n\nIt is very necessary that he have these things at once to make him comfortable and I trust that you will authorize expenditure for same by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDeputy Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nNJW/EMW.\nOttawa, October 7, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you request that certain articles mentioned by you be supplied to furnish living quarters for the teacher of the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the quarters in which the teacher is living are not the property of the Department, it is considered that the owner or the teacher himself should provide the necessary utensils required. The Department is not responsible for the furnishing of private rooms for its teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #118387-5 dated the 2nd inst., advising me that the Department will not allow any grant to Roy Alliston towards paying for his rooms. You state that while Miss McGrady was allowed $25.00 from 1913 to 1917, it was then discontinued, she being granted an increase in salary in lieu of payment for rental of rooms.\n\nWill you please advise me whether Mr. Alliston is getting the same salary now that Miss McGrady was getting when allowance for rental was discontinued. If he is not getting the same pay, or even a little more, the allowance for rooms should be given him, as it always costs more for a man to live than a lady teacher. I understood from Father Ryan that when he asked Mr. Alliston to come to the Tobique to teach, he gave him to understand that his rooms would be furnished for him in addition to his salary.\n\nI will be pleased to hear further from you regarding this matter before notifying the teacher regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

In your case the Department was informed that you would be able to secure wood with Mrs. William Ellis, and, if this is so it is considered that she should provide you with the wood you require.\n\nRegarding the bonus I beg to say that a cheque for the amount due you for the December quarter last, has been sent you care of Mr. Agent Wooten.

Original on 118387/6.\n\nA teacher's house should be built during vacation. The population of this point is a sufficient guarantee for this expenditure. There will always be need of the school and house.\n\nIt is very hard to get a teacher to take up this work, when there is no place for her to board, and rooms are so very hard to get, and always some distance from the school. A neat teacher's house is the only solution of this ever growing problem. I do trust this trouble will soon be settled.\nOttawa, July 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of inspection of the Tobique Indian Day School, in which you recommend that a teacher's house be built during the present vacation, I beg to say that last year tenders were called for the building of a residence for the teacher. The prices received were considered excessive. It is not the intention of the Department to take any action at the present time, owing to the cost of all building material. At a later date, when the price of building material is lower than at present, the building of a residence, which the Department agrees with you is needed, will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nMaliseet, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 66-2-5, of the 19th inst., regarding repairs to the school house on the Tobique Reserve, and also repairs of the out houses. I beg to advise you that I was at the Reserve last night with a man who has agreed to give an estimate on doing the work, and he expects to be able to furnish me with the estimate by the early part of next week. As soon as I receive same I will forward it to you.\n\nFr. Ryan has informed me that he has again taken up the matter of a residence for the school teacher on the Tobique Reserve. It seems that he has been informed that the Department is desirous of getting a residence for the teacher if one could be secured at a reasonable price.\n\nJoseph Ellis has a good property on the Reserve that he has offered to sell to the Department for a teacher's residence, at what I call a remarkably low price. The amount he asks is only $700.00. Of course it would require some repairs to put it in the proper condition for a school teacher to live in. The size of the house 18x22 feet, one story and a half high, with three rooms downstairs, and a kitchen 14x16 feet, with a pantry 14x10 feet. The main house downstairs is finished, and the upstairs is lathed and ready for plaster. There is a building in connection which could be moved up near to the house, and made into a good woodshed. The frontage of the lot is 36 feet and the depth is 160 feet. There is a splendid chance for a good garden, especially so as there is no garden in connection with the school on the Tobique Reserve.\nSir,\n\nThe house is only 35 rods from the school house, and fronting on the St. John River, right next to Father Ryan's house. There is good water right near and I consider it on the best locality on the Reserve.\n\nIf the Department would decide to purchase this at the price at which it has been offered, and would allow me $700.00 to make the necessary repairs, I think that the teacher would have a splendid residence.\n\nThe ceiling, and some of the walls, require to be replastered. The chimneys need repairing; the doors and windows require a little fixing up; a new piazza built; the clapboards on the outside of the house need repairing, and the whole building needs to be painted.\n\nThe purchase price of $700.00, and with an expenditure of $500.00, would mean that the property would be costing only $120.00, and after it is repaired in the manner that I have in mind, I do not think that the building could be replaced for less than $2,000.00. It could not possibly be in a better location for a teacher's residence.\n\nIf the Department decides that they wish to make the purchase it will have to be done without delay, and also the repairs put on as soon as possible. I trust that you will give me a definite decision regarding this matter without any delay. I think it is a splendid opportunity, and without hesitation strongly recommend the purchase of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. Father Ryan and the Indian Agent have several times brought to the attention of the Department the necessity for a teacher's residence at the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIn the Spring of 1919 the Department advertised for tenders for the erection of a teacher's residence at this point and the lowest tender received was for $1,350.00. As the Department's architect estimated the cost of erecting a suitable building at $800.00, the work was not proceeded with last year. Mr. Agent Wooten, under cover of a letter dated July 30th, 1920, states that Joseph Ellis has a good property on the reserve which he offers to sell to the Department for $700.00, which the agent states is a remarkably low price. The size of this house is 16 ft. x 22 ft., one story and a half high with three rooms downstairs and a kitchen 14 ft. x 16 ft. The size of the lot on which this house is situated is 36 ft. x 160 ft. Mr. Agent Wooten states that this building would require some repairs, the cost of which he estimated at $500.00. A total expenditure of $1,200.00 would, therefore, be involved.\n\nThe Tobique Indians have at their credit about $30,000.00. When the erection of a teacher's residence was first considered last year an Order-in-Council was passed providing for the expenditure of $800.00 from the Capital Funds of the band but this amount was, of course, not used.\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding a property which you could purchase for a teacher's residence on the Tobique Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided not to take any further action in this matter at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. Wooten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth,\nN. B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss Bridget Crain, the School Teacher, on the Tobique Reserve, has applied for two pieces of Oil Cloth, for her two rooms. It will take, for one room 12'x12' and the other 12'x12' and the cost for both rooms will be between \u00a332.00, and \u00a335.00.

Father Hugolin, of the Tobique Reserve, N.B., visited the Department today and was exceedingly pleased to learn that we were providing for a teacher's residence for the Indian day school. In the Supplementary Estimates for the current year there is an item of $1500 for this purpose.\n\nThe Rev. Father strongly urges the appointment of two Sisters, one to act as teacher and the other as field matron; and this fact should be kept in mind when the plans for the bungalow are being drawn. I have intimated that we will correspond with the Rev. Father Ryan in this connection and that the salary allowed the Sisters will be at the rate of $550 plus bonus, each. It may be necessary, to save advertising the position through the Civil Service Commission, to engage both Sisters as school teachers.\n\nThese Sisters will quite likely be available by September first, 1923.\n\nFather Hugolin has intimated that the present incumbent - Miss Nellie Dugan - is about to resign, and I have asked him to correspond with Rev. Father Ryan regarding a successor.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, June 5, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReverend Father Hugolin, of the Tobique Reserve, visited the Department a few days ago and strongly urged the appointment of two Sisters, one to act as teacher and the other as field matron on that Reserve. He stated that it was quite likely that the services of these Sisters would be available by September 1, 1923. If the services of the Sisters are secured, it will be necessary to provide proper accommodation for them.\n\nWe have this year an item in our Supplementary Estimates for the purpose of providing a small bungalow for a teacher in connection with this school, but, if the Sisters are engaged, more extensive living accommodation will have to be provided than is contained in a bungalow. Father Hugolin also stated that it was the intention of the church authorities to ask for the removal of the school to another site, as the church desired to obtain from the Indians the land on which the school now stands for church purposes. Father Hugolin stated that he would let the Department know in the course of the present summer the definite arrangements that are being made regarding the securing of the teachers and the moving of the school, and when this information is received we will then be in position to go on with the work of putting up a residence for the Sisters. We intimated to Father Hugolin that we would inform you regarding the above mentioned matters. I might say that if the Sisters are engaged, we would be prepared to allow them a salary at the rate of $550 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nFather Hugolin intimated that the present teacher, Miss Nellie Dugan, intends to resign at the end of June. It will, therefore, be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher to succeed her until such time as the services of the Sisters can be obtained. If Miss Dugan resigns, you should endeavour to secure the services of another teacher, and the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher selected by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is perhaps time to establish the Sisters' arrival two classes with two mistresses, besides the field matron.\n\nI take the liberty of suggesting that you might notify the Agent, Mr. Ch. Roberts, to busy himself without delay in these matters; and to refer to the Department, in order that all may be in readiness to begin building in the spring.\nAs regards the lighting system, in a conversation I had last November with the head Architect of the Department, I suggested that it might be the proper time now to establish the use of electricity at Tobique. If the Department were willing to accept part of the outlay, the Electrical Co. might consent to lay its wires to and on the Reserve, certain as it would be to recover its expenses in due time; for not only the Sisters, but myself, for my house and the Church, and several Indians would also take our supply from such a company. The Department might, if it judged fit, place some lamps in the School, in the Hall, and also in the public thoroughfares. This would mean an assured revenue for the Electric Company.\nJanuary 17th 1923\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Before plans can be prepared for this building, it will be necessary to ascertain the source of water supply for the building and also the mode of lighting.\n\nWhen Reverend Father Hugolin visited the Department last fall, he suggested that it might be possible to obtain electric current from an outside source, and have same carried to the reserve for the use of the proposed residence and other buildings.

I have already presented a proposal to the council, outlining the benefits and costs associated with such an installation.\n\nThe initial cost would be approximately $15,000, which includes the purchase of the necessary equipment and materials. The council has agreed to provide a grant of $5,000 towards this cost, leaving us with a balance of $10,000 to be paid over a period of five years.\n\nAdditionally, the town has agreed to provide a subsidy of $1,000 per year for the first three years, reducing our overall expenditure.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe this project will benefit the town significantly, improving safety and convenience for all residents.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe Mr. Bowlin understands his work as a contractor and will do his best to have the work, and the material furnished in the building to the best satisfaction.\n\nI want to make a suggestion in regards to the plans and specifications of the basement wall, in this part of the Globe we have to contend with very intense frost and it has always been the practice here in this part of country when building a concrete wall, to have it built with a batter on the outside, about a quarter of an inch to the foot, according to the plans this is a straight 15 inch wall. I would suggest that the wall be 15 inches thick at the bottom, and taper from the outside to a thickness of say 10 or 12 inches at the top of the wall, by doing this the frost when drawing out of clay ground, would naturally draw away from a tapered wall and could not do any damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I would recommend this source of water supply, from a drilled well, and forced through the building with a good up-to-date air pressure system. This would cost approximately $600.00 to drill the well and install the water system. I would recommend the well being drilled immediately, and have all underground water pipes ready to connect to the basement when the basement walls are completed, in order to test the plumber's work. The water system should be installed before his work is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe I should of started my communications with the Department regarding the well about a week sooner, then I would of had plenty of time to look letters over more carefully. I want to inform the Department that all this kind of extra work and material in connection with this new building has to be carried on in connection with other work, so has not to allow any delays with the contractor Mr. Bowlin, or his subcontractors.

The well was drilled down a depth of 64 feet with about 60 feet of 6 inch steel casing, and water was located and we got a flow of 15 feet up from the bottom of the well, which was considered a good and sufficient supply of water, and about one month from the time the well was drilled I had the Canadian Fair-Banks Morse, Co., to install their pump and pneumatic tank water system, and at that time we discovered after installing the pump and had it working, and about two strokes of the pump the well was practically dry no water, it was discovered that quick-sand had entered by way of the water vain, and reached a height of six feet in the bottom of the well, thereby shutting off the water flow.\n\nThe only remedy was to do at the time was to leave it for the time being, as the cold weather would not permit any further drilling of the well, as the drilling machine would not work satisfactory in cold weather.\n\nThe well driller claims the only thing to do is to drill this well down further, he thinks from experience it will be necessary to go between 20 or 30 feet this depth should get clear of the quick-sand and get a good flow of water, he will not be allowed to charge anything for moving his machine, as this is an understood agreement in a case of this kind, when sufficient water is not secured, although he will have to be paid for the number of feet he continues to drill, and the number feet of casing he drives.\n\nI would recommend to the Department to have this done as soon as the weather permits.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.
