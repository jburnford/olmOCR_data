G. JACKSON'S LETTER.\n\nOur attention has been directed to a letter in the weekly Globe issue of the 11th inst., dated from Prince Albert, on the 16th, and signed by T. G. Jackson, whose efforts have been so manifestly aimed at the suppression of opinions intended as an expression of the writer's feelings angry towards our editor. Discarding as we do the unprofitable attempt that he before composing his epistle the writer had been more than a Tea getting Jackson, we can only say that when an old gentleman, who has been detected publicly declaring himself an unrestrained lover of nothing exhibiting any more strongly marked characteristic than that of an amiable stupidity, suddenly takes a fresh departure and rushing into print sets up as a full blown opponent of all calls of duty from him by such name naughty names as liar, his mental condition is clearly such as to afford ground for the gravest apprehensions as to his friendly attitude towards the best interests of the community, but we are well aware that the truth utterances of superannuated cranks and loud-mouthed ranters run the risk of sympathy from those who lack the power to help us, and who are doing so fast as can be expected under the circumstances. A few such letters as this of Mr. Jackson's would serve to bring Mr. Rich into possible further discredit than anything we can write.\n\nTHE EXHIBITION.\n\nIn our columns we have noticed the advertisements of an agricultural show to be held next month by the Local Agricultural Society in this town. This show will have one peculiarity which is not common with such shows as it will be the first of its kind ever held in this district, and we earnestly call upon the members of the community that it deserves to be held for the purpose of affording a beginning, in some respects, the annual weather during the spring and summer season at the exhibition of such splendid specimens of the productions of the soil as we can generally produce hereabouts, also showing means the best the country can do the samples will compare favorably with any in regions less generally favored. As a result of a postal ballot petition the arrangements have been entrusted to able and experienced men who have included in the prize list everything for competition which serves to be indicative of the prosperity of the agricultural development of the country. It is peculiarly necessary in the present condition of the country that the improvement of stock, both sheep and cattle, should be a subject of much attention, and the introduction of improvements beyond the power of any but a few individual efforts, and we trust that this society will make every reasonable effort possible to bring forward the best specimens of both from every part of the district, but will soon be in a position to claim substantial and from the Government.\n\nThe Prince Albert Times, a weekly paper, will be published every Thursday at Prince Albert, N.W.T. The Times will be edited by Mr. J. W. Jackson, and will contain news, views, and opinions on various subjects. The Times will also publish advertisements and classifieds.

Davis' new advertisement on this page.\n\nA party arrived yesterday for the Rev. Mr. McMillan.\n\nNovember 6th has been appointed a Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThis fall, the trees begin to feel it approaching winter.\n\nMr. Tom Taylor and family have gone on a visit to Duck Lake.\n\nMr. A. J. Davis, who only day arrived back from Butteville last week.\n\nA train of carts arrive at goods for T. O. Davis yesterday morning.\n\nMr. Wm. Brown left here Tuesday with six passengers for Toronto.\n\nBusiness is a little dull in town just now, the farmers being all busy at their harvest.\n\nMr. J. L. Johnson returned from his trip to the East, by mail on Monday evening.\n\nMr. Jac. Macintosh, accompanied by Mr. J. L. Davis, left for Saskatoon on Monday last.\n\nSportsmen ought to have a thrilling experience, but the prairie sodden is unusually so plentiful as they might be.\n\nMrs. Swanson, with some lady friends, has gone across the river to gather berries which we hear are very plentiful there.\n\nThe Sunday School, the first organiza-\n\ntion of the Western Industrial Soci-\n\nety, was formally opened by His Hon-\n\nour the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.\n\nOn Saturday evening Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Way returned from their trip with her two children, and we are pleased to learn that the visit to the East has proved of much benefit to them both.\n\nMr. Thos. Stanhope accompanied by Messrs. Barker and Pratt, have gone out on a hunting excursion, and we pre-\n\nsume from their letters that they must expect to stay away some time and to bring back a lot of game.\n\nAs will be seen by the advertisement to this issue, the Winnipeg weekly Free Press offers special inducements to sub-\n\nscribers to keep up their subscription.\n\nEvery reader is asked to show appear-\n\nance, and the liberal offer of the publishers will no doubt be fully appreciated by the satisfied old Free Press readers.\n\nOur town is to build up to the propor-\n\ntions which it is to be urged in some cir-\n\ncumstances, must be directed in all directions by those who direct it.\n\nIt is always remembered that every effort made by the town council to beautify and make attractive this town is not going far to make the town attractive to set-\n\ntlers, as a great deal is to be done there.\n\nIn the meantime, however, while it must be remembered that only the election of the ablest men to overlook the operations of the town council can be met by promptly paid up taxes can ensure success, and that every citizen interested in the welfare of the town is most profitably invested.\n\nThe money in a house should be saved before it is spent, and the citizens should be taught to save money, and not to waste it.\n\nIt may be remembered that we have more than once expressed the hope that by the erection of parks and buildings of some kind, the citizens would be able to meet the wants of the community in a manner that would be most profitable.\n\nThe money in a house should be saved before it is spent, and the citizens should be taught to save money, and not to waste it.\n\nIn anticipation of the tax which has been promised us by the enterprising citizens, Mr. Thomas Stanhope has built a house for being the first to put a practical example to our settlers in this direction.\n\nNow, as we have said before, in the case, that tax would prove a good tax, and we fail to see how our motorists can re-\n\ntain their benefits to themselves and the public by buying a tax which cannot be imported, which they can buy and sell at far greater reasonable prices.\n\nThe ad-\n\nvantages to the town would be immense, if circulation here is strong, and Mr. Stanhope, who only came back names to work, will be able to make a good crop of all that goes to form the produce of pigs will enable farmers here and elsewhere to charge a higher price for them, but when the market is thus, that, in fact, pigs so cheaply as to defy outside competition.\n\nLOST IN THE BUSH.\n\nBillie Shingles' Troubles.\n\nAs our reporter was taking a stroll on Monday evening, he noticed a gentleman walking along the road toward the town.\n\nHe called him to himself. On a nearer approach, he found it was Billie Shingles.\n\n\"I beg to notify my customers and the public generally that I have REMOVED my stock to \"TRESTON HOUSE,\" and have now on hand a full line of Hardware, Stoves, and Stovepipes, at greatly reduced prices.
