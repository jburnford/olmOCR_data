If you do not want to settle this invoice, I can hold you paid it in with the price of material delivered at the reserve. If there had been a ferry there at that time, we could have taken it across from this side, so it was this material had to be hauled from Tobique down to Perth bridge up to the Tobique bridge & back down to reserve about 10 miles one way. There was two trips carried in bill of goods weight 6,000 including pumping out fit which you paid also there was three here in Mr. Stewart's bill for installing.\npumping all fit. Now you paid first two bills which are for the same kind of service as the 750's which you have not paid. Now gentlemen this is a fair bill & please consider this & let me have this amount at the earliest possible date.\n\nI gave Mr. Roberts a rough estimate of installing three meters at Ludlow where now I find that a 10 amps meter will not be sufficient to carry the load at Hospital for pumping. This will take a larger meter which will cost considerably more, the 10 amps costs some what about $2.00. I don't know just how much a heavier meter will cost at present. I am going to install them upon arrival. I just thought I would inform you of this matter. Trusting to hear from you at an early date.

I may state that their trunks, and their own personal effects are in the basement unpacked, and this is not a very fit place for their clothes, as they are liable to dampness and mould. I may state that the trunk room is very small, and would only serve room for a couple of trunks, and I may say that they have at least six, and they are all quite large.\n\nWhat they want in this trunk room is a cupboard with shelves, at top, and drawers at bottom properly arranged with doors, etc., so that they may unpack their trunks and arrange their clothes in the proper place and condition.\n\nI would recommend the Department to authorize the purchase of the necessary spruce and pine lumber for the above arrangements, also the nails, hinges, etc., and paint amount of lumber is estimated at 300 ft spruce costing $9.00 and 100 ft pine costing $5.00 and I will arrange to have the labour done by the caretaker Noel Francis,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAsst.

These may be enumerated briefly as follows:\n\n1. To have small closets in bathrooms for brooms, dust pans, etc.\n2. One bookcase for teachers' books.\n3. In the laundry - to exchange an elbow for a \"T\" pipe with faucet.\n4. To have an inexpensive partition (beaver board or wood) built, dividing the cellar into two rooms - one to be used for a domestic science workroom. In this case a wooden floor, a few inches above the cement base, would be sufficient to prevent the water floods in during the thawing season and heavy rains.\n5.

To have a woodshed, a barn, a poultry house, etc., so we can keep a cow, hens, swine, which would be a great economy for the Hospital.\n8. To enlarge the school house so the two classes can be in the same building.\n\nWith reference to the fitting up of a room in the basement of the residence and hospital building for domestic science work, I shall be pleased if you will give your opinion as to the necessity for having this done. The Department is anxious that the teachers conduct classes in domestic science for the older girls and women of the reserve; and if the cost in fitting up a room as suggested by the Sisters would not be too expensive, favourable consideration might be given to have the work done during the coming summer holidays. Please state what it would cost to have a beaver board partition and a wooden floor put in and the room fitted up and made serviceable for conducting classes. You should also state the expense in building any cupboards required and also a work table. When we have full information as to the cost involved and whether you would recommend that the work be done, consideration would then be given to carrying out the Reverend Sisters' request.\n\nPlease report on the need of items Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and give an estimate of the cost.\n\nWe have definitely informed Father Sylvester that there are no funds available to enlarge the school house during the present fiscal year and that it is hoped the Sisters can make other arrange-\n\nC.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters of the 13th instant, with reference to the various requests for repairs, equipment, etc., made by the Reverend Sisters in charge of the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the caretaker build a small closet in each bathroom for the purpose of storing brooms, dustpans, etc. A bookcase for the teachers' books of the dimensions suitable to meet the requirements may also be built. We note that the present caretaker is a handy man at this kind of work and that he is competent to perform the necessary carpenter work. You may expend an amount not exceeding $55 in the purchase of the necessary carpenter tools for the use of the caretaker in the making of equipment and repairs from time to time. These tools should be kept at the residence and hospital and under no circumstances loaned to outside parties. You may also purchase to an amount not exceeding $20 the different kinds of finished lumber, nails, etc., required in the building of the closets and bookcase. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the tools and for the material. It is to be understood that any carpenter work performed by the caretaker is part of his regular duties and that no extra remuneration can be allowed therefor.\n\nWe note that it will not be possible to provide a room for domestic science work in the basement of the combined teachers' residence and hospital as this is required for the storing of fuel and other supplies. I may say that we have no funds available to erect a woodshed, and the question of providing same and fitting up a room for domestic science will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I might say regarding the transformer loss to Indians Reserve, there is a loss in every transformer. This loss is divided into shell losses, primary copper loss, secondary copper loss, or core loss. It is quite difficult to figure the exact loss in each transformer on account of the different load.\n\nNow we figure this loss on an average of 2%. That means that 2% of the capacity is lost. For instance, on your 6 K.W. transformer has a capacity of 5,000 watts. 2% of this is 100 or 100 watts lost every hour that the transformer is connected on the line. Now then, 100 watts every hour means...\n2400 watts or 2.04 $18.00 lost in 24 hrs which at\n6\u00a2 is 12.24\u00a2 per day x 30 days = $37.20 now this\nloss goes in with the commercial lighting the\nCo. Meter in town here records everything\nthat goes on that line & you are charged with\nthe consumption from this meter which is\ncorrect, the Co has about 15 transformers of\nlarge capacity to stand the loss in, from which\namounts to a large sum in a year making\nyou understand the situation now. I am.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nThe Andover-Perth Electric Light Commissioners\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. The 2% loss is approximately but it is about\nright according to the difference in meters of 127-\nfor the 4 months.\n\nQ.W.W.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Paget.\n\nWith reference to the account hereunder, amounting to $31.95 for electric current supplied by the Andover and Perth Electric Lighting Co., to the hospital, church and assembly hall on the Tobique Indian Reserve, I beg to say that the charge of $17.55 mentioned therein for transformer loss is not usually made by other companies. The charge of six cents per watt should cover any loss due to the use of a special transformer. I would suggest that the Indian Agent be requested to inquire whether similar charges are made to the consumers in the City of Perth or Andover, and also the regular rate.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nJanuary 26th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with which you forwarded voucher No. 523 amounting to $31.95 in favour of the Andover and Perth Electric Light Commissioners for electric light furnished from the 1st October to the 31st December, 1925 for the hospital, church and hall at the Tobique Reserve and in reply I beg to point out that there is a charge of $17.55 made for \"transformer loss\" and charges of this nature are not usually made by other electric light companies.\n\nThe charge of six cents per watt should cover any loss due to the loss of a special transformer. Kindly therefore inquire whether similar charges to those mentioned are made to the consumers in the city of Perth, or at Andover. You should make inquiry also regarding the regular rate. When you have obtained full information bearing on this matter you should make report to the Department.\n\nPending receipt of your letter the Department will hold the Company's account, so that you should deal with the matter without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.J. Roberts, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRed Rapids, N.B.\nJune 29/26\n\nMr. Chas Roberts\nRed Rapids\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th inst., I might say the difference between our meter and the others at the Indians reserve is more than quarter because you add them the first of the month & I read ours about the 17. This would make a vast difference.\n\nNow regarding transformer loss, as I explained before our meter registers all the current that goes over that line just the same as our meter in the substation registers all the current that the town use transformers loss included & the Town have to charge a rate high enough to cover this loss which amount...\nTo about 30% supporting we made $6,000.00 in the year we might have made 30% more if we had not been forced to pay losses & charging the same rate, which is 9\u00a2 per 18 W.H.\n\nThe Department is getting current at an reasonable rate we pay 4\u00a2 well to them for 6\u00a2, every light Co has to set the rate high enough to overcome this loss & make a little profit besides but in this case the rate is down & the department pays its own loss, I do not know the rate that the department is charging the other consumers here but to my mind they should pay enough to help pay this loss say 8\u00a2 figuring 2\u00a2 loss on your transformers means for water lost every he multiply this by 24 gives us 2.4\u00a2 per 18.W multiply this by 30 gives us $72.000 18.W. at 6\u00a2 4.8\u00a2 a month.\nThis is approximately the amount it cannot be figured exact on account of different loads.\n\nTrusting you will understand this I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. Wright & Co., Inc., Secretary\nAddress: 12th Light Corner.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding electric light account of $31.95 with voucher No. 523 in favour of the Andover & Perth Electric Light Commissioners, and for your information concerning this account, I inclose you a letter I received from Mr. Geo W. Wright electrician in charge of the Andover & Perth Light Comm., and you will note what he has to say regarding the information you request.\n\nAs first stated in Mr. Wright's letter that the meter in Andover where the Reserve line is connected was not read until about January 11th, and the account was charged from that date, whereas I read the meters of the four different consumers at the Indian Village, namely, the Mission, Hospital, Church, and Hall, on January 1st, and these 10 days difference in their meter reading at Andover, and the meters read at the Indian Village made a vast difference, and I had to charge the difference to transformer loss, as Mr. Wright should of read the Andover meter at the end of the last quarter December 31st, 1925. However the current charge for quarter ending March 31st, 1926, will be short ten days, and this will make up the difference for the transformer loss charged to December quarter.\n\nI beg to inform you that when submitting the quarterly account of the meter for the Mission Fathers I charge them one quarter of the total transformer loss, by doing this they pay equally the loss of the four meters on the Reserve, for instance their current charge for last quarter was for $8.34 and the total transformer loss was $23.40 and one quarter of $23.40 equals $5.85 making the Mission Fathers Bill a total of $14.19 which was paid to the Andover Perth, Light, Commissioners, for quarter ending December 31st, 1925.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nRed Rapids, Feb. 1st, 1926.\n\nStatement of current account for the Tobique Reserve\nfor quarter ending December 31st, 1925.\n\n| Description                                      | Cr.   | Dr.   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Dr. To Andover Perth, Comm., acct.               |       | $46.14|\n| Gr.

The Sisters want an eight day clock with strike, this will cost about $12.00. This amount was authorized about two years ago for the purchase of a clock, Mr Roberts got one for the school at that time but for some reason the one ordered for the hospital did not arrive.\n\nThe other articles listed hereon will be supplied as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H.

In this connection I have to inform you that a cheque in payment of this account has been sent.\n\nIt is noted, from the list of articles which you have not yet supplied, that the rubber tracking will cost approximately $24, also that the Sisters request an eight day clock, at a cost of approximately $12. The Department will approve of your incurring the above expenditure in the purchase of the rubber tracking and eight day clock.

In 1828 they were joined by a priest of that persuasion who has since resided with them at Squamish Bay.\"\n\nFrom the report of the Commissioners, Pennefather, Telford and Worthington, of 1857, we learn that the village of Wikwemikong consisted then of 76 buildings, viz.: 73 Indian houses, one for the missionary and another for the school master, a church, a school house and a saw mill, and it had a population of 94 families (376 individuals). The cleared land of this settlement covered 300 acres and the quantity of live stock far exceeded that of Manitouining; but the commissioners stated that they had no detailed information on some points connected with the settlement.\n\nAll the official records of the Department, previous to confederation, have been transferred to the Dominion archives and there is nothing here now to show how the Jesuit mission became possessed of their land at Wikwemikong. Our files show, however, that they were in possession and had established day schools previous to\n| Date | Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Dec 26 | only Steamer | 1 | .90 | .90 |\n| | 4 gal Stone Crock | 1 | 1.50 | 1.50 |\n| | 5 \" | 1 | 2.00 | 2.00 |\n| | Covers for Crocks | 2 | .75 | 1.50 |\n| | Radiator Brush | 1 | 2.00 | 2.00 |\n| | Pyrene | 2 qts | 4.00 | 8.00 |\n| | Sheeting 9/4 unbleached | 4 yds | 1.40 | 5.60 |\n| | Sheeting Bleached | 42 | 27.30 | 114.00 |\n| | Blankets All woc172x84 | 3 prs | 36.25 | 108.75 |\n| | Blankets Flannellette | 6 \" | 18.00 | 108.00 |\n| | Surprise Soap | 1 box | 6.50 | 6.50 |\n| | Naptha | 1 \" | 6.00 | 6.00 |\n| | Pillow Ticking 32\" | 12 yds | .43 | 5.16 |\n| | Cups & Saucers Gift Band | doz | 1.75 | 21.00 |\n| | Breakfast Plates | \" | 1.75 | 21.00 |\n| | Breadbutter | \" | 1.20 | 14.40 |\n| | Bowls 1/2 pint | \" | 1.50 | 15.00 |\n| | 3 \" | \" | 1.25 | 3.75 |\n| | Bath Mats | only | 1.50 | 3.00 |\n| | Cocoa Mats 20x33x1\u00bd | 3 \" | 1.50 | 4.50 |\n\nTotal: $150.46\n\nHandwritten note: Window Brush 2.00\n\nHandwritten note: 152.46\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1929 Dec | To Supplies account Teacher's Residence      | $152.46|\n\nAuthority: Letter #68-2-8 dated Dec 9-1929\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52.\n\nAgent:\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you were informed in official letter of November 25, 1929, it is necessary to differentiate between the supplies required for hospital purposes and for the teachers' use, as the expenditure for hospital purposes is paid from an entirely different vote than that for school purposes. I am, therefore, returning your letter, and have to request that you will state opposite each item the service for which it is required or have a separate list prepared showing the articles required for the teachers' use and for the use of the hospital. The department previously furnished a number of these supplies, such as mops, brushes, linoleum, dishes, etc., and the Reverend Sisters should understand that it is expected they will only requisition for the supplies absolutely necessary.\n\nYou might state the purposes for which the extension ladder is required, also whether you would recommend that ash barrels and garbage cans be supplied, and whether all the cleaning supplies are necessary. I may say that our funds this year are limited, and it is necessary to keep all expenditure for school purposes as low as possible.\n\nWhen we have full information as asked for, consideration will then be given to authorizing you to make the purchase. Please return the enclosed communication with your reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and S\n\nN. H.

These lists show the supplies which are strictly for the use of the residence and separate from those which are for hospital use. After the purchase has been made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. These accounts should show the cost of the supplies for the use of the residence, which are chargeable to Vote for Indian Education, and also the cost of the supplies which are for the use of the hospital and are chargeable to Medical Vote. It might be advisable for you to consult the Reverend Sisters as to the type of supplies they require before purchase is made.\n\nIt is noted that the extension ladder asked for is required for the removal of the windows, making of minor repairs and for fire protection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Apr. 4th. 1932.\n\nEnclosed find Voucher #862 in favour Andover and Perth Electric Light Commissioners for electric service to Mar. 31/32. Voucher #776 was for service to Oct. 1st. instead of 31st. as stated. I have had broken meter repaired and replaced in Hospital.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMay 28, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe question has arisen as to what primary allotment in this year's Appropriation should be used for a water tank at the Tobique hospital and teachers' residence - a combined building. I believe it is now timely for the Medical portion of the Vote to undertake somewhat more of the expenditure than in the past.\n\nUpon reviewing the costs at this school, I find that for the five years ended March 31, 1927, the average yearly expenditure for all purposes for the two-classroom Indian day school was $991.00. During the fiscal years 1923-24 and 1924-25 the hospital and teachers' residence was erected at a cost to Indian Education of $22,670. I believe at this time some of the furnishing, which was additional, was charged to the Medical portion of the New Brunswick Vote. This charge on Indian Education was at least $18,000 more than if we had built a teachers' residence only.\n\nWith reference to the current expenses since that time, I believe that they have averaged $3,464 for the past six years. This was at least $1,300 more per year than if a day school only was being operated. Half of this extra expense, of course, is the salary of the third teacher. One of the Sisters is so classified, but, as a matter of fact, her duties are those of nurse and field matron.\n\nI propose to discuss this with Dr. Stone, with a view to a more fair apportioning of the costs in future. In view of the difficulties of changing the classification of the third worker, I suggest that $600 or $700 of the miscellaneous expenses be paid from Medical primary allotment.\nPerth, N.B., May 23rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI am obliged to report that storage tank of Tobique Reserve Hospital has rusted through at one end and is beyond repair. The rusting or corrosion came from the inside and was caused by the hard well water. I had this tank welded three times last week and Mr Armstrong tells me it is useless to try and patch it.\n\nThe present tank is 700 gal. capacity, I believe 500 gal would be sufficient.\n\nWould the Department authorize purchase of or supply direct a tank of this capacity, it should have over three feet in diameter anything wider would not go through door-way leading to basement, the length does not matter.\n\nWould it be possible to get a filter or chemical solution for this water to pass through before reaching tank thereby removing the corrosion producing element, please advise,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nJune 7, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the storage tank at the Tobique Reserve Hospital, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a new tank. The tank should be standard welded storage tank, black, and it is thought that a 400 or 600 gallon capacity should be ample as the pump is automatic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of New Brunswick, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tobique Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the cook stove used by the Reverend Sisters for their domestic science work in the basement of the school. He states that this stove has been repaired on several occasions and recommends that a new stove be supplied.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make enquiry regarding the condition of this stove and inform the Department whether you would recommend that a new stove be supplied, and, if so, the approximate cost. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nN. H.

Oct. 28th. 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter #66-2-8 dated Oct. 21/32 re stove in Tobique School used for Domestic Science work.\n\nThis stove is worn out, I put new linings in fire box some time ago but the oven is burned through in the top and is practically useless.\n\nA new range would cost from $60.00 to $75.00. A stove such as the Star or Perfect would be about $35.00. If there are funds available I would recommend that a new range be supplied as the Sister is unable to give much useful instruction with the present one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H.

MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, April 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing a requisition for various supplies for the use of the teachers' residence on the Tobique reserve, I have to inform you that funds are now available in our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1933-34 to cover the expense. You may therefore arrange for the purchase of the supplies as authorized in the list enclosed, this being all the articles we can allow from the list as submitted in the requisition.\n\nIt is noted, from the estimate of these supplies, as given by you, that the total cost will be $28.53. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nMaliseet, N.B.\nApril 18, 1933\n\nRev. Father F.C. Ryan,\nRedbank, N.B.\n\nReverend dear Father,\n\nWould it be possible to have the walls of the toilets whitened before the warm weather begins? It is customary to have this done during the summer vacation but as it was not done at all last year would you please recommend Father that this be done the first or the second Saturday in May?\n\nI remain,\nYour respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Agnes\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, May 1st, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nReverend Father Ryan has forwarded your letter of the 18th ultimo, addressed to him, regarding the whitening of the walls of the toilets. It is presumed you refer to toilets at the teachers' residence and also, it is possible, to the ones at the school building.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, as our Appropriation for the present fiscal year was so greatly reduced, no funds have been provided for renovating purposes. Therefore, I regret that we will be unable to authorize the expenditure required for the purpose of whitening the walls of the toilets.\n\nIn future, I would request that you forward all requests for repairs, equipment and supplies through the office of your local Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Agnes,\nSuperior,\nTobique Indian Day School,\nMaliseet, N.

The cost of this building was paid wholly from the Appropriation for Indian Education, and, in addition, any repairs made since the building was erected have been paid from the same source.\n\nPart of the building has always been devoted to hospital purposes. Three Reverend Sisters are employed, one of whom devotes all her time to the work of the hospital. Her salary has also been paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Dr. Stone, and I would appreciate your concurrence in the following:\n\n1. From April 1, 1934, any disbursements in connection with the repairs or upkeep of the part of the building devoted to hospital purposes should be paid from Medical Vote.\n\n2. The salary of the Rev. Sister engaged in hospital work should be provided in the Medical Vote for the fiscal year 1935-36 (from April 1, 1935). I understand that there is no provision for her in the Medical Vote for 1934-35, and we have provided for her salary during that fiscal year.\n\nApproved by\n\nDr. McGill.\n\n*See File 51-66.*\n\nIndian Affairs.

May 1st. 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the Department is aware there is a tubercular patient, namely Fred Nash now in Tobique Hospital. This boy is in a very weak condition and I do not believe it will be possible to carry out our original plan of placing him in a small cabin and arranging for his meals through some Indian family.\n\nSister Electa has suggested the following plan to take care of this and any subsequent cases.\n\nThat the roof of the verandah on the right side of Teachers Residence be raised to the level of the main roof making an upstairs verandah or sleeping porch for use of the Sisters. This would leave the present porch for the use of the patients, which could be partially enclosed.\n\nI would estimate the cost in the vicinity of $60.00 which would be little more than cost of building and equipping a small cabin for our present patient and would be permanent.\n\nTrusting this expenditure meets with the Department's approval, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDr. Stone,\nChief Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nThe sister at the hospital\nreceived through Mr. McPheil the following\norder from applied to the department for\nthe removals belonging to the hospital, and\nto give accommodation to the tuberculosis\npatients who have been turned out twice.\nThis has been ordered and I would\nlike you to see your influence to have this\nwork done at once. The house was done\npreviously, patient who has to be kept in the\nward and if we were to have other\ncases would be with other orders\nnot only a place for him.\n\nSo please kindly get this\nimmediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.F.

B., for Electric service Tobique Res., Nov-Dec-Jan-Feb-Mar.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 66-2-8 dated Oct. 30/24.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, April 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of labour return for $25.00 which you forwarded in connection with work done by Wm. Ennis. You state in your letter that the medical officer considers that George Bernard should be assisted. You should have reported this matter to the Department at once, as it is not possible, owing to present regulations, to pay from the relief appropriation the amount of $25.00 which you state Wm. Ennis earned. This amount will have to be paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, and it is likely that the Auditor General will take exception to the payment, as we are also paying Bernard at the rate of $200 a year for the same service. The account of Andover & Perth Farmers Co-operative Company, Ltd., is being paid at $293.00.\n\nPlease let me have a full statement regarding Ennis' employment and why you approved of this without first receiving our authority. It is going to be extremely difficult to straighten out the matter, and all the trouble could have been avoided if we had been informed before any action was taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nPerth, N.B., Apr. 25th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter #66-2-8 dated Apr. 22nd, re Wm. Ennis.\n\nWhen I was asked if Bernard could have a man to assist him for a few days during the cold weather and I asked Ennis to help him I thought his relief would cover it, which is the reason it was not reported. Bernard's condition did not improve and Ennis was kept on.\n\nI have been under the impression that an Indian could be asked to work one or two days a week in payment of relief orders he might be receiving. Ennis receives $2.50 per week.\n\nIf this expenditure does not meet with the approval of the Department and has to be deducted from Bernard's salary I think the amount should be only $18.00.\n\nBernard on the other hand does all sort of work outside of his official duties for which he receives no pay, and I thought it only fair that he have some assistance when he required it.\n\nI regret not reporting this matter and trust it can be settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, it is noted that you now consider that Ennis should only be allowed $18.00. Please prepare a new voucher, on which you should state that Ennis was employed as labourer at the Tobique Indian Day School for a period of eighteen (18) days during the month of February at $1.00 a day. To this you should attach the enclosed account of $13.00, also the account of $5.00 mentioned in your previous letter. Both of these accounts should be signed by Ennis, acknowledging receipt of the supplies from the firm from whom purchase was made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. H.

In addition you will note that gas was supplied for the first time on August 21. Was this the first occasion on which the car was used and if so why the charge for welding on June 6, about six weeks previous? I think we should have full particulars as to the necessity for the inspection of the power line and the qualification of James Deveau and Chief Saulis to perform such a service and why it was necessary to use a car.

The Department has the power line in Andover confused with the boundary line of the Reserve.\n\nThe reason for this expenditure was a report to Chief Saulis that lumber was being cut on the Reserve in this district. He did not consult me at the time but came to Perth later and asked for this allowance for Deveau and I reported the matter in my letter dated Aug 29th and when in Ottawa advised Mr Caldwell concerning this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa.

Sister Electa concerning some work on basement of Teachers Residence, Tobique Reserve. I would recommend that this work be done by Indians to whom it may be necessary to supply relief. The cost of the material would be approximately $20.00. Trusting this expenditure meets with the Department's approval, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may arrange for the work that is required in the basement of the teachers' residence at the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the material will be, approximately, $20.00, and that you will have the work done by Indians who are on relief.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nPerth, N.B., Feb. 3rd, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nWould the Department please give consideration to the purchase of an electric refrigerator for Tobique Indian Hospital and Teachers Residence.\n\nIf authority should be granted it need not be purchased before April but I would ask the Department to advise me as soon as possible as it is necessary to procure ice now if an electric machine cannot be supplied.\n\nI would estimate that a suitable size for this institution would cost $250.00 or $270.00 I am enclosing circular showing size of machines quoted.\n\nTrusting this expenditure meets with the Department's approval, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.E. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 12th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter Feb. 3rd\nElectric refrigerator, Tobique Hospital and\nTeachers' residence.\n\nHow much will it cost to put up ice?\nWill the wages be earned by Indians or white men?\nIs there a good ice house, and how long will the\nice house probably remain in good condition?\n\nIt will indeed be very difficult for\nthe Department to find funds to purchase this\nelectric refrigerator. Doctor McIntosh wanted some\nadditional surgical equipment for the hospital and\nit has been found impossible to find funds for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nN. H. MacPhail Esq.\nIndian Agent\nPerth, N. B.\n\nMP\nPerth, N. B. Feb. 16th. 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nRe Letter #66-2-8 dated Feb. 12th.\n\nElectric Refrigerator, Tobique Hospital.\n\n1. Cost of ice will be about $8.00 for 100 cakes, this is not sufficient for the entire year but is all the ice house will hold.\n2. Ice can generally be procured with Indian labour but this year it may be necessary to purchase from white men as the river ice is not good.\n3. Present ice house is part of Hospital wood shed and perfectly satisfactory except for size.\n\nAs stated in my previous letter the refrigerator need not be purchased until April or May but if the Department is unable to authorize this expenditure, please advise as soon as possible, and oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.

These vouchers probably arise out of the Department's letter of April 29 in which it was stated that the cost of an ironer and the current to operate it would go a fair way toward paying the wages of an Indian woman to do the work. I may say that the Department did not anticipate that it would be called upon to pay the woman and, in view of the payments and allowances made for this small institution, it does not think it should be so called upon. I have, therefore, to direct you to convey these views to the Reverend Sisters at the institution and say that you are not at liberty to accept further accounts for this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

There has been previous correspondence on these matters which there is no need to repeat.\n\nIt seems well to inquire how the present arrangement is working as regards hospital patients and the cost of their care. The plan is not so old that it cannot be regarded as experimental. The Department's view in most enterprises of this kind is that it should not be asked to pay more than the services cost and that the missionary institution should not be asked to carry on work at a loss. I need not recount the complicated nature of the institution at Tobique in its different functions as teachers' residence and hospital.\n\nThere have been some new developments about Government property and the Department's impression is that the present arrangement should be recast in such a manner that the Department would supply, own and keep up all permanent equipment, including bedding and linen, and pay to the Sisters such a rate as would cover food and laundry for the patients but no other service except the compensation for the services of Sister Electa which would be continued at its present rate. To open the discussion\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nthe Department is prepared to consider the installation of a refrigerator but not of a washer or ironer for reasons given in a previous letter. It is suggested that a rate of $1.00 per day would cover feeding and laundry but this figure is to be regarded as a suggestion only and subject to further discussion on either side. I think you must be asked to get as careful figures as you can on the actual cost of these services and that the Sisters must be asked to make them available to you.\n\nOn reviewing the hospital accounts it is observed that Mrs. John Deveau, with active pulmonary tuberculosis, has been in the hospital since May 3. The Department is prepared to remove this patient to any sanatorium in New Brunswick and to pay for her maintenance there, preferring that the space be occupied by a more active and less communicable type of patient. It thinks also that the case of Mrs. Lockwood should be reviewed as she has been in the hospital since August 25 with a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. In these proposals it is not the Department's wish necessarily to reduce the revenue of the Sisters but it is obvious that a hospital of this size is not a suitable place for active tuberculosis or indeed for any very long term patient.\n\nIn discussing this matter with the Sisters I hope you will ask them to take into consideration all the factors discussed in this letter and to accept as a premise that the Department wishes to deal fairly with them and to make the institution as useful as it can possibly be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDear Sirs,\n\nYou will recall when I was at the Mobique Hospital recently the questions of refrigeration and washing facilities were brought to my attention by the Sisters and the Doctor.\n\nFollowing my return to Ottawa I have discussed these matters with Dr. Stone and, pursuant to advice received from him, I am enclosing herewith a letter explaining the Department's position in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

This patient was being cared for in her home for several months before being admitted to the hospital, and it was only when we could not find someone to care for her that we admitted her. She was a very difficult patient.\n\n---\n\nA few notes:\n\nFrom the enclosed financial report it will be seen that by maintaining this as a combined institution, Teachers Residence and Hospital, the Department can maintain a hospital here much cheaper than otherwise as no less than a staff of two nurses and a cook would do. At the imaginary: Nurse $1000.00\nAss't \" 500.00\nCook 250.00\n\n$1750.00\n\nand the feeding of the patients and the nursing staff. Under the present arrangement, which seems to us very satisfactory, no one is getting rich, and neither is the Department put to too heavy an expense in maintaining a hospital - that is trying to function as such.\n\nWe will be very pleased indeed to have a refrigerator installed by the Department, as one has been sorely needed here. As to the washer - it is a very necessary equipment. Trying to make out without a washer is very unsatisfactory.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFINANCIAL REPORT OF THE TOBIQUE INDIAN HOSPITAL AND TEACHERS RESIDENCE - MALISEET.\n\n- from January 1st 1937 to October 31st 1937.\n\n| INCOME | EXPENSES |\n|--------|----------|\n| Nursing salary - Sister M. Electa for 10 months . . . . . . $1000.00 | Paid Mother House for assistant nurse . . . $500.00 |\n| Hospital cheques . . . . . . 947.00 | Paid for groceries, meats, vegetables, milk, eggs, butter, bread . . . 951.15 as per attached. |\n| Teachers Salaries . . . . . . 1120.00 | Paid wages for hospital cleaning laundry work- . . . . . . 123.10 |\n\n$ 3067.00 | $ 2722.02\n\nBalance $344.98\n\nOn January 1st 1937 we had a balance on hand of $407.18 and on Oct. 31 1937 our balance was $344.98, and part of this balance has already been expended for the current November living expenses. This amount does not signify a profit as we must always have some money on hand.\n\nDuring July and August the teachers are at Summer school and there is no teachers' salary during that period but the hospital staff is on duty - two nurses and a cook - and living expenses during that period continue. If either the nurse or the cook is on vacation she is replaced.\n\nIn the travelling expenses for the sisters we have included such items as Travelling expenses to Perth for bank business and for the purchasing for food supplies for the patients. Some Indian has been paid $1.25 for the use of his car for each trip, and these trips have to be made once and sometimes twice a month.\n\nRe patient Mrs. John DeVeau - we have been waiting for the past two months for authority to send this patient to a Sanatorium, but now she is not able to go. She may live two or three weeks longer.\nMr. N. H. MacPhail,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. MacPhail:\n\nAs requested by Mr. McInnes in his letter of recent date, you will find attached detailed account of all expenses paid out in this institution (Teachers residence and Hospital) from January 1st to October 31st 1937.\n\nAfter preparing this report I sent a copy of it to our Mother General in Saint John - along with a copy of the correspondence you received from the Department. It would have been returned to me at once but our Mother General was away on a visiting tour of our institutions in Western Canada and only returned November 29th.\n\nShe agrees with me that the $2. per day per patient is very satisfactory but that $1.00 per day would not be sufficient. We are glad of an opportunity to furnish the Department with a detailed statement of actual expenses paid. Without these long term cases that have been in the hospital during the past year our hospital cheque would rarely exceed $25.00, and, as you know, provision could not be made outside the hospital for the very sick patients that we have cared for here. Take for instance the case of Mrs. Lockwood, you were paying $4.00 per week for a woman to care for her, in addition to her relief clothing, wood, etc. We were obtaining her help every other week. She really should have been in the hospital a month earlier or have someone during the day and another at night during her last month at home as she was very sick and we only admitted her when the doctor said she needed hospital care, as she would die in a short time, which really happened. In regard to Mrs. John DeVeu as you know we did not wish to admit her here but the doctor asked us to admit her as she had a family of little children. Her condition now is very poor. The doctor is expecting her to die at any time. It is now too late to remove her to a Sanitarium. We will be very pleased to co-operate with the Department is keeping out of the hospital as long as possible such long term cases.\n\nOur Mother General wishes me to say that the Community appreciates the fact that our dealings with the Department have been extremely satisfactory and that she is pleased that we will have a Frigidaire for our hospital and that, regarding the electric washer, she will be very willing to refund to us the price of the washer so that we will not have to do without this necessary equipment.\n\nI am sorry that there has been so much delay in following up the correspondence and I trust that the information attached will be of service.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister M. Electa\nPerth, New Brunswick, Dec 7-1937.\n\nIn reply to letter #68-2-8 dated Nov. 8th I beg to enclose letter and detailed statement from Sister Electa covering income and expenses of Teacher's Residence and Hospital at Tobique Reserve.\n\nThere is nothing I can add to this report as it seems to cover the situation quite thoroughly. Sister also explains the delay in furnishing this information.\n\nI trust the Department will be able to continue to allow $2.00 per day for in-patients and authorize the purchase of at least the refrigerator if not the washer and ironer.\n\nApparently the Mother General is willing to purchase the washer but I do not think the order should be called on to supply equipment of this nature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.H.

H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef. your letter April 13 - Electric Refrigerator Tobique Hospital.\n\nYou will recall previous correspondence on this matter and a financial statement you sent forward on December 7, 1937. That statement went far to convince the Department that a new arrangement is required, but it was thought better to wait until the beginning of the new fiscal year before it should be further discussed. If you have a copy, you will see that the Reverend Sisters have charged into their operating expenses $1,1147.00, much of which represents expenditure for their own clothing, travelling expenses, dentist, insurance, chapel expense and so forth, none of which are charges which have much to do with the operation of the hospital, or indeed, of the teacher's residence, they being personal living costs of the sisters themselves.\n\nIn fact, this sum, with the credit balance on nine month's operations, is almost equal to the cost which might properly be assigned to the hospital operation. This seems to indicate to the Department that the daily rate for maintenance of patients should be reduced from $2.00 to about $1.00 or a little more. If this were agreed upon, there would be nothing to stand in the way of the Department purchasing the electric refrigerator out of the saving.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\n\nFor Secretary.\nPerth, N. B. April 25th, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nElectric Refrigerator Tobique Hospital\n\nOn receipt of your letter dated April 19th, I informed Sister Electa of its contents. I have a copy of the Sisters statement of December 1937 and as I see it the guaranteed income of the Sisters per year is:\n\nNurse................$1,200\nTwo Teachers $1,400\n$2,600\n\nOut of this they have to pay $500.00 per year for an assistant nurse and $250.00 for cook. If the Department would pay the salaries of these two permanent employees I think $1.00 per day for in patients would be sufficient, otherwise it should remain at $2.00 per day. The Mother Superior does not wish to be unreasonable but has tried to point out that whether there are patients, or not, the staff mentioned above must be maintained. If the Department insists on a reduction before the refrigerator can be supplied, the Sister requests that the fee does not go below $1.50.\n\nPlease advise me as to your decision as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.

March 25th. 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nDuring the past two years there has been correspondence on the question of supplying an Electric Washer to Tobique Hospital. While in Ottawa in January I discussed this matter again with Dr Stone.\n\nAs stated in former letters the cost of a suitable washer for this institution would be about $112.00 list price being $137.00 without pump $147.00 with one. These prices would be subject to about #20% making the net between $110.00 and $126.00. These prices are approximate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nReplying to your memorandum of July 4th in connection with the new roof which is required on the Tobique Indian Day School, N.B., Mr. Wetmore Davidson of Perth, N.B., may be employed as foreman-carpenter for this work.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, July 15, 1939.\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th ultimo and Mr. Hoey's reply of the 4th instant in connection with the new roof of the Tobique Indian day school Mr. Wetmore Davidson may be employed as carpenter-foreman. The Purchasing Branch has been requested to secure the shingles and nails. The Department will depend on you to supervise this work in order that it may be completed at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nPerth, N. B. February 16th, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nIn 1937 the question of supplying some electrical equipment for Tobique Hospital was discussed with several Department officials. The last letter on the subject was #66-2-8 dated Nov. 8/37, and included Refrigerator, Washer and Ironer. In July 1938 a refrigerator was authorized and purchased but nothing further has been done about the laundry equipment.\n\nI would again like to recommend the supplying of at least the washer. Enclosed find circular showing machines and prices from authorized dealer L. A. Pinder.\n\nTrusting this expenditure meets with the approval of the Department, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nPerth, N. B. April 15th. 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that when the Tobique Teachers Residence was re-roofed last summer I did not do the two porches as there seemed to be a possibility of this building being converted into a sanatorium which would necessitate a change in these porches.\n\nWould the Department advise if there may be any change in the near future.\n\nIf I complete the roofs as they are only labour would be necessary as I have sufficient shingles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, April 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to re-roofing the porches at the Tobique Indian day school teacher's residence.\n\nIt is noted that you have the material on hand, but before authorizing the work I would appreciate your advising the approximate expenditure that will be necessary, also if Indian labour can be employed. If it will be necessary to employ white men, you should state the tradesmen required and the approximate number of days they will be engaged at the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. N. H. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nPerth, N. B. April 26th, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter #66-2-S dated April 18th, I beg to advise that I will require Mr. W. P. Davidson the carpenter that was employed last summer to do the porches referred to in my letter.\n\nI think the work can be done in one day with the help of Indian labour. I will use men that are receiving relief.\n\nI will also require two rolls asphalt felt and two sheets of zinc. Approximate cost of material about $9.00.\n\nTrusting this expenditure meets with the approval of the Department, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant in which you state that the reroofing of the porches at the Tobique School can be done in one day.\n\nYou may expend an amount of $9.00 in purchasing material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. N. H. MacPhail,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nPerth, N. B. May 9th, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nAuthority was granted by letter #66-2-8 dated July 4/39, to reroof woodshed adjoining Teachers Residence Tobique Reserve. This work was not done last year as upon further examination I considered it should be torn down and enlarged. To make the necessary changes I would require:\n\n| Item                  | Cost |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| 250 Ft Boards         | $6.00|\n| 150 \" Studding        | 4.00 |\n| 500 Ft. Steel Roofing | 35.00|\n| Labour (app.)         | 15.00|\n\n$60.00\n\nThere is also a small building (about 9'x12') that I wish to dispose of. If it has no cash value I would ask permission to give it to some Indian.\n\nTrusting this expenditure meets with the approval of the Department, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $60.00 for material and labour in enlarging the woodshed at the Tobique School.\n\nThis amount together with that authorized in my letter of April 30 exhausts the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Tobique School. Consequently favourable consideration cannot be given to additional requests.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. N. H. MacPhail,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nSir:\n\nAt the time of Inspector Thibault's visit the question of washing machine for Tobique Hospital was discussed. The Sisters of Charity had been obliged to purchase a machine and Mr Thibault was to recommend that the Department refund the full purchase price of $125.00, as yet I have had no advice on the subject from the Department.\n\nThis equipment was absolutely necessary and as I do not feel that the Sisters should be called on to provide same for use in a Department building I would request that the refund be made as per Mr Thibault's recommendation. Please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of February 24 in which you advise the Department that the Sisters of Charity have purchased a washing machine at a price of $125.00.\n\nThe Department had no knowledge of this expenditure, and it apparently was not authorized by any official. I, therefore, must advise you that the Department will be unable to refund the purchase price to the Sisters of Charity, as requested in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPERTH, N.B.\n\nN.N.\nSir,\n\nWould the Department please authorize the supplying of two Simmonds Mattress at a cost of $12.00 each. I understand that the Sisters got this price direct from the Simonds Co. They are for the Teachers Residence, Tobique Reserve. The old mattresses now in use could be given to destitute Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, you may purchase two mattresses at a cost of $12.00 each for the Tobique Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. N. H. MacPhail,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N. B.\nPerth, N. B. Apr. 24th. 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nLast month when it became evident that I was going to have difficulty getting sufficient furnace wood for School and Teachers Residence, Tobique Reserve for next winter, I wrote the Standard Sanitary & Dominion Radiator Ltd. re equipping the furnace in Teachers Residence for coal burning. I have been advised that it would be satisfactory but would have to be fitted with coal grates. This furnace was equipped with new wood grates only last spring, but I would recommend that coal grates be installed and authority granted for the purchase of 15 tons of coal which, I understand is equal to 30 cords of wood.\n\nI will still require wood for School furnace and Teachers Residence kitchen range but I think this should be obtainable.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1943.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to burning coal instead of wood at the Tobique teachers' residence.\n\nFrom information that we have available it appears that it will be almost as difficult to secure coal as wood. Consequently it is doubtful if it is advisable to change at the present time. Please let me know where you think coal could be secured, in the event of the Department approving the use of it instead of wood.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPerth, N.B. June 25th, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.,\n\nIn the estimates for year 1943-44 I had\nPainting Teachers Residence-Tobique Reserve-$500.00\n\nPlease advise if this expenditure meets with\nthe approval of the Department. This building is\nurgently in need of painting and if funds are available\nI would recommend that Nevers Bros. be employed. They\nhave advised me that they would be available between\nnow and September.\n\nM. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 7, 1943.\n\nMr. N. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N. B.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, recommending an expenditure of $500.00 for interior painting at the Tobique teachers' residence.\n\nPlease let me know the cost of painting the interior of the rooms actually used by the teachers.\n\nThe painting of the portion of the building used for hospital purposes should be brought to the attention of Dr. P. E. Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPerth, N. B. July 13th. 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter No 66-2-8 dated Jul. 7th. and wish to advise that estimate of $500.00 was for painting exterior of Teachers Residence, Tobique Reserve.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, in which you state that the painting required is for the exterior of the Tobique School. At the present time we are not in a position to decide if there are sufficient funds available for this purpose. You might write again around the first of September and, if our appropriation is in good shape at that time, we might be able to allow the expenditure, in which case the work could be done during the fall.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPerth, N. B. Sept. 1st. 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe letter No 68-2-8 dated July 20th. Please advise if it will be possible to paint exterior of Teachers Residence this fall.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, September 10, 1943.\n\nMr. N. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.

If it turns wet or cold the painters recommend that the building be given only one coat this fall.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 28, 1943.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information and for any comments you may care to offer, an estimate received by Indian Agent MacPhail for the painting of the teachers' residence at the Tobique Indian Reserve. While the Tobique school is in reality a combined school and hospital, with a rather large teachers' residence occupied at the present time by Sisters, the estimate received seems rather high to the officials of this Division. You will note, from the Agent's letter, that Never Brothers are the only reliable painters left in the area and that he is unable to submit another estimate.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 22nd instant, file 68-2-8, re painting of the Tobique Teacher's residence and Hospital, - as stated in conversation of even date, the prices quoted by Never Bros., Perth, N.B., are excessive, particularly for labour.\n\nWould it not be possible to have this painting done by the Indians, preferably next spring. When you decide to have the decorating done, I would suggest that you send us a requisition for the paint - which we can purchase at a considerably lower price than quoted by Never Bros.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1943.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a memorandum received by this Branch from the Departmental Purchasing Agent. The subject matter of this memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you reviewed early in the spring the labour conditions in the district and, if labour at that date is available, you might send in a requisition for the paint necessary to complete the painting of the Tobique teachers' residence. You will note that the quotation received by you from Never Bros. is not acceptable to the Department.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPerth, N. B. Oct. 9th. 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.,\n\nI have to advise that the expansion tank on Teachers Residence heating system has worn out. Instead of replacing I would like authority to install an Emco-Acme Automatic Pressure Control. The cost is $18.00 plus installation. A new Galvanized Iron expansion tank would cost about half this amount but is not entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may purchase an Emco-Acme Automatic Pressure Control for the Tobique teachers' residence. It is noted that this will cost $16.00 plus installation.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nHalifax, N. B.\nApril 27, 1941\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt., Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAgain in our necessity we turn to you for assistance.\n\nFor the past few years we have received only the bare essentials in the line of materials for repairs, etc., and the teacher's residence is now showing the need of more attention. The basement and halls are badly in need of renovating.\n\nWe feel that this could be done at a very low cost. We would be willing to supply the labour ourselves provided the Department would appropriate at least $25.00 (Twenty-five Dollars) to cover the expenses of repairs, paints, etc.\n\nAs no doubt you know through our Indian Agent, Mr. N. H. MacPhail that we try to keep this house in the best possible condition and much of this work has been done at our own expense, especially since the war. You also know the cost of living is very great and our salaries have not changed since pre-war times.\n\nWe should be very grateful if you would please give this matter your serious consideration and we feel quite sure that if you will do your part the Department will be willing to cooperate with us.\n\nThanking you for past favours and hoping for a favourable reply at your very earliest convenience,\n\nWe wish to remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSister of Charity\nSister Honora (Teacher)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6069, file 284-8, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nMay 3, 1944.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Sister Honora in which she states that the basement and halls of the residence at the Tobique School need renovating. She further states that the material required will cost approximately $25 and that the school staff will supply the necessary labour. The Department approves the expenditure of the amount mentioned.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 3, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\n- Director -\n\nThe following is a brief report of my short visit, November 6, P.M., to the New Brunswick North Agency.\n\nTORIQUE RESERVE\n\nSCHOOL\n\nThe school is a two-roomed building in very good condition. Repairs are required to the roof over the entrance, and the stone foundation at the east or back end will have to be torn down and rebuilt. This work should be done next year. The children are in a clean, neat, healthy condition. Attendance at the time of my visit was very good. However, during the month of September, and part of October, many children went to Maine to pick potatoes. Teacher Smith condemned this practice very strongly. As stated in my other reports the annual movement of children to Maine should be discouraged. The school is equipped with electricity which is supplied by a local Power Company.\n\nTEACHERS' RESIDENCE AND NURSING STATION\n\nThis is an excellent building and it is kept in an immaculate condition. It is my opinion that this building should be made available as a hospital to take care of the needs of all the Indians in the St. John River Valley. At little cost it could be renovated to accommodate fifteen to eighteen beds. A complete laundry service would necessarily have to be installed consisting of washing machines, ironers, etc., - in addition a root-house would have to be constructed adjoining the basement, to provide storage for vegetables, canned fruits, etc. There is a very urgent need to provide hospital space to accommodate the number of sick Indians in the Maritimes. There are many T.B. cases that are not receiving the proper medical care because it is impossible to obtain space in the white hospitals. By converting this building into a hospital it would provide immediate space, and would make it possible for the Medical Division to do something really worth while to take care of medical cases.\n\nThis building is already equipped with electricity from a local Power Company.\n\nIf this recommendation is approved then a residence will have to be constructed to house the teachers and the nursing sisters.\n\nJ.

At the present time the source of hot water is a range boiler connected to the kitchen range.\n\nI would recommend that an oil burning heater be installed in the basement, doing away with the range boiler in the kitchen. This would provide a constant supply of hot water and eliminate a fire in the kitchen range a great part of the time during the summer months.\n\nThere is a small stove in the laundry room, upon which an ordinary wash boiler is used to sterilize patients' bedding. This stove is worn out and must be replaced. I would recommend that a stove similar to that now in use be purchased, as the new heater will not eliminate the necessity for a stove.\n\nThe oil heater installed will cost approximately $200. As yet I have not prices on the new stove but I would estimate the cost from $50 to $75.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent\nNorthern N. B. Agency\nOttawa, July 31st, 1947.\n\nMr. N.H. MacPhail, Indian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th instant regarding the Tobique teacher's residence, please forward detailed information regarding the type of oil heater that you recommend and also the name and address of the firm from whom it can be secured. We will have to secure a purchase order for this and the information requested above will be required by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nAt the same time you might let me have information regarding the new stove, also the name and address of the person from whom this can be secured for $75.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MCD\nMEMORANDUM\n\n- Col. B.F. Neary -\n\nRe: Painting and repairs to exterior of school and teacher's residence at the Tobique Reserve.\n\nI wish to inform you that the school teacher's residence is badly in need of painting on the outside. If money is not available for this work this year then provision should be made in next years estimates so that the work may done early in the next season. I would estimate that the cost of the material and labour for this building would be approximately $1,000.\n\nThe stone foundation under a portion of the school is also in need of repair. I would suggest that $500 be placed in next years estimates for this work.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nActing Inspector,\nQuebec and the Maritimes.\nThe Rheem oil storage water heater is a completely automatic unit built to operate safely and efficiently on any of the better grades of domestic fuel oil. If an oil-fired central heating unit is already installed, this heater can in most cases utilize the same oil supply.\n\nNew in every detail, the Series 70 embodies the most advanced developments in automatic oil storage water heating. Unlike similar heaters, all parts on the Series 70 are protectively housed inside a beautiful steel jacket finished in gleaming baked enamel\u2014a feature exclusive with Rheem.\n\nThe Rheem patented pot-type burner burns the fuel at new high efficiencies that closely approach the theoretical limit, using only a few psi or 0.5 psi inches of water pressure. The patented burner also is specially designed to prevent troublesome carbonizing and plugging. And best of all, this new burner operates on a pilot flame so small it makes possible a remarkable saving in oil consumption; it actually burns only a small fraction of the oil normally consumed by other burners on low fire.\n\nOperation is fully automatic. Oil input to both main burners and pilot fire is monitored at all times and in the event of pilot flame failure, the automatic control stops the oil valve shut until the pilot is manually re-lighted.\n\nInstallation is simple; it requires only a hot and cold water connection, a flue connection and an oil supply.\n\nOperation is easy; once lighted and adjusted, the automatic thermostatic control takes over.\n\nMaintenance is almost non-existent; only at rare intervals does the unit require any cleaning or adjusting.\n**RHEEM GUIDE TO BETTER LIVING** \u2014 This chart lists the entire line of appliance products built by Rheem, one of America's largest manufacturers of quality automatic water heaters, tanks and range boilers.\n\nWhatever the type of fuel used, you will find a Rheem engineered product to serve you. Sizes range from residential and farm units up to commercial and industrial installations. Just check this Rheem guide; then send a postcard for full information on any of the products listed.

Attendance would be better if they had a school. There is jealousy among some families because present building was rented from these people and it was the only building (very poor too) that could be obtained. A school is needed very much. More interest would have been taken and attendance better if we had had material, books, etc., to work with all year. It has been a great put back and very hard for me not to have enough to work with, besides the present building is too small.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Woodstock school for the current year in which you state that some of the children were in need of clothing I have to ask you to be good enough to give the Department the names of any children whose parents, in your opinion, are unable to provide them with proper clothing. You will also be good enough to state what articles you think should be furnished them and the probable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Frances Millmore,\nTeacher,\nWoodstock, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that on my recent visit to the Reserves I visited the schools and they appear to be progressing good the school houses are kept neat and clean and the scholars are the same with very few exceptions. The teachers all appear to take an interest in trying to learn them and the scholars appears to be interested themselves and are doing well.\n\nThey are having a little trouble at the Woodstock school with the party that owns the building and some of the squaws don't want to send their children to school. I think them to pay no attention to them but send their children right along and next summer the Department should build them a new school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames White\n\nIndian Affairs Department\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 10, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Miss Frances Milmore, teacher of the Woodstock Indian school, to $350.00 per annum from the 1st of July, last, and she has been advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

She is only paid $350.00 a year and from the reports received from Father Ryan she is doing good work. He says that the children are improving in manners as well as in studies under her direction. She teaches them sewing, calisthenics and hygiene. She is 22 years old and the holder of a second class professional license. None of the other teachers in New Brunswick are paid less than $400.00 and I think the Department would be quite justified in allowing Miss Brophy an increase of $50.00, which would bring her salary up to that amount.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She has an enrolment of 15 pupils with an average attendance of 10.\n\nMr. Inspector Ryan in a recent report of inspection states that he would like to see better salaries paid to the teachers in the Indian day schools in New Brunswick and that these teachers should receive $100.00 more than the average paid to white schools.\n\nIn New Brunswick there are 11 day schools the teachers of which are paid as follows:- four at $400.00; four at $450.00 and three at $500.00.\n\nThe Inspector reports that Miss Cogger has been meeting with fair success and, as she had only been a brief period in the school, he could not judge as to what success she would make. There is no doubt that the salary she now receives is very low. She has to pay $7.00 a week for board and that leaves her very little for other expenses. She has received the bonus from the date she began duties.\n\nI would recommend that she be allowed an increase of $100.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B.\nWOODSTOCK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL CLOSING\n\nThe closing exercises at the Woodstock Indian Day School, located at the Indian Reservation, took place on Tuesday morning, June 30th. A number of those interested came down from Woodstock by car, while some of the ladies in the neighborhood witnessed the program, which follows:\n\n\"Holy God We Praise Thy Name\"\u2014Chorus, by School.\n\nWelcome Address.\u2014A little girl.\n\n\"We're Pretty Little Birdies\"\u2014Song and Exercise by five little girls.\n\n\"Who's in the Bird's Nest?\"\u2014Dialogue by eight children.\n\n\"The Stolen Bird's Nest\"\u2014Recitation.\n\n\"Three, Bird Song by five little girls, chorus by School.\n\n\"Don't tell about the Bird's Nest in the Daisies!\"\u2014Recitation.\n\n\"Pretty Little Raindrops Laughing kissed the Daisies\"\u2014Song by school.\n\n\"Rapid Jack\"\u2014Recitation.\n\n\"Be Kind\"\u2014Song by School.\n\n\"Flag Exercise and Wand Drill\"\u2014By School.\n\nThe pupils gave an exhibition of Wand Drill movements, keeping time to their own singing of \"Fling out the Flag,\" \"The Three little Sisters\" and \"only a small Bit of Bunting.\"\n\nThe Wards were formed by joined Flag Staffs.\n\nFlag Salute\u2014School.\n\nGod Save the King\u2014School.\n\nGood-bye little School-room\u2014School.\n\nHon. J. L. Carleton and John P. Malaney spoke briefly congratulating the young scholars on their rapid advancement in the English language, and referred in very laudatory terms of the evidence of strenuous work on the part of Sister Agnetis, as was evident in the program of the day, and by Sister Michael, in charge of the hygiene work at the Indian Reservation.\n\nHis Worship Mayor Belson made a hit at the start by making some remarks in the Indian language, which the children affirmed were correct, and he said that there were only 500 words in the Indian language. He suggested that Sister Agnetis prepare a vocabulary with the assistance of the older Indians, during the coming term, which she promised to do. He complimented the Sisters on the program presented, and was greatly pleased with the natural voices of the children. He was much impressed with the deportment and respect shown by the children. This was probably caused by the love of the children for their teachers\u2014it takes love to make flowers thrive. It was only stated that the children should get a reasonable and fair cultivation in the English language. When he was a lad, working in his father's store in Woodstock, he learned a part of the Indian dialect. Those from the present Indian reservation, used to make baskets, ax handles, brooms, etc., and sell these articles in the town, but now these are manufactured by a large scale, and the Indians have lost that sort of employment. He congratulated the Sisters on the care they are taking of the native children, and assured them that they would find for their work they would receive a cherished star in their crowns in the years to come.\n\nThe children then enjoyed a treat of ice cream, cake, sandwiches, candy which was supplied and served by Mrs. E. J. McManus and Mrs. R. C. Tait.\n\nThe visitors then examined the work done in the Manual and Science Departments, and were surprised to find such neat and beautiful work in sewing and knitting done by such small children.\n\nThe children looked very neat and attractive. The girls wore a blue and white striped uniform and the boys a dark grey. These uniforms were a part of the regular school uniform. Two other khaki uniforms were also made and worn by the children during the school year.\n\nThe Sisters in speaking of their past year's work with the Indian children referred especially to the respect, obedience and docility of the children. They tried so hard to do the little things that were asked of them.\n\nThe attendance of the children for the year as read out was most extraordinary. During four months of the year 100 per cent was made, and not a single case of truancy was reported during the year.\n\nThe progress during the year was most satisfactory.\n\nThe decorations on the board were not only decorative, but served as incentives and aids in helping the children in their work.\nSt. Gertrude's Convent,\nWoodstock, N.B.\nSept. 16, 1925.\n\nRev. F.C. Ryan,\nRed Bank, N.B.\n\nDear Rev. Father,\n\nI have intended writing to you ever since school re-opened but failed to do so until the present.\n\nSister Michael has been changed to the Infirmary so she did not return, but Sister Faustina has been sent to take her place. She I am confident will be able to assist me in carrying on the work on the Reserve in the same satisfactory way. Sister Faustina is also a trained nurse, but as Sr. Michael had more experience in nursing, she was needed at the Infirmary in St. John.\n\nDon't you think the Dept. should be willing to give me at least, a little increase of salary this year.\n\nThey expect good work. I have given them my very best efforts at a salary very much less than I received for work which was 100% easier. The work brings a salary of $1300. Two hundred ($200) of this is for transportation. The check per Quarter has been the same for the Teacher and for the Assistant. This leaves a salary of $550 per year for the Teacher of the School.\n\nPrevious to coming to the Reserve, I received a salary from the district of $1,000.00 besides my draft from the Provincial Gov. The Dept. of Ind. Affairs seems to be getting much for a little cost.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Sr. M. Agnetis.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to increase the salary of Sister M. Agnetis, teacher of the Woodstock Indian Day School, by $50.00 per annum from the 1st September last, the beginning of the present school year. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $700.00 per annum of ten teaching months in the year. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Reverend Sister accordingly.\n\nThis increase is made in view of the excellent services which are being performed by Sister Agnetis at this school.\n\nWe have been informed that Sister Michael the Domestic Science teacher has been transferred to the Infirmary in St. John and that Sister Faustina will succeed her. The salary allowed Sister Faustina will be at the same rate as was paid Sister Michael.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nB.J.

It appears that this girl's father was killed overseas. Mrs. Phillips states that the girl has never been to school and that she wants her to live with her on the Reserve in order that she can attend school.

R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\nDear Mr. Scott, Dept. Supt. Genl.,\nOf Ind. Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast June, I had the pleasure of interviewing you and Hon. Mr. Stewart, Minst. of the Interior, re. better transportation facilities for the Rev. sisters from their Convent at Woodstock to the Ind. day school, a distance of three miles. I pointed out that the Rev. sisters were daily forced to take a cold dinner in the school on the Reserve, not having time to drive to their Convent by team and return to open school at the appointed time. This often breaks down their health, for their custom is to make the mid-morning meal their chief repast, so they retire so early after supper that a heavy meal at that hour would likewise have drastic results on their health.\n\nQuick transportation would overcome all difficulties, allowing the sisters to be home for a good hot dinner. For this reason, I suggested to you and the Hon. Minister that an extra $100.00 be given to each of the two sisters for a period of five or six years, this two hundred to go yearly to pay for a Ford closed car. Father Leckery said he would at once purchase the car, if he had a guarantee that in five or six years he would be reimbursed. I was given to understand by both in this interview, that such was agreeable to you and that it would be carried out. In the meantime, the Rev. sisters have certainly passed through another trying year, bearing patiently their trials, yet not without signs that bespeak of failing health. I trust the Dept. will act in this matter at once.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. sister Agnes is very weak; she has been confined to her bed for over a year. You will remember she fell exhausted in the Woodstock Ind. school. On the following day she was taken on a cot to St. John's Infirmary, where she still lies, being but a few days removed from eternity. She claims that her cold dinners were much the cause of her breakdown.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Reserve is certainly blessed by having such a wonderful nurse.\n\nI think it would be only right that the Dept. drop a line of appreciation to Rev. Sister Faustina for all her hard work; God alone knows what she has sacrificed. The great improvement of the Woodstock Ind. Reserve bears witness of her labors.

F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools has been forwarded to this Department.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the salaries of teachers in the Indian Day Schools are paid on a basis of ten teaching months in the school year. The School year begins on September 1st and ends on the following June 30th. You are requested to forward through the office of your Local Agent a return showing the names of the pupils, days taught, etc., at the end of September, December, March and June. For September, as there is only one teaching month in that quarter, you were paid 1/10 of your average salary and at the end of each of the other three quarters, you will be paid 3/10 of your annual salary. You will, therefore, see that when payments are made at the end of June next, you will have received your full salary for the teaching year.\n\nThe amount due for the quarter ending December 31st, 1924, is 3/10 of $500.00 or $150.00. From this amount, the Department is deducting the advance of $75.00, leaving a balance due of $75.00. The same amount is due Sister Michael for the quarter ending December 31st, and cheques for these amounts are being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nDuring the present fiscal year, bonus is allowed to Teachers of Indian Schools at the rate of $15.00 a month, for each teaching month. There is therefore due you for the December quarter $45.00 bonus and the same amount is due Sister Michael.\n\nCheques for these amounts are enclosed herewith.\n\nYou should prepare at once and forward to Mr. Agent Griffith on the form provided for that purpose, a return showing the names of the pupils, days taught, etc., during the December quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It has been my understanding that the manufacturers did not take over the manufacture of these goods immediately after the failure of their predecessor, the Co. of Oswego, and am glad to know they are now being made again.\nThere is no sewer pipe in the town installed upon the streets or Tanks, as they are all liable to become damp and if so must warp and split.

In SANITOR goods, we offer a radical improvement; one which even surpasses the remarkable advance in plumbing sanitation.\n\nWarranted not to Split, Crack or Warp\n\nSANITOR goods are made of wood fibres, indurated by our patented process, and moulded under heavy hydraulic pressure. Being moulded in one piece, there are no joints to become unglued, no cracks to open up and collect disease germs. Moisture, heat or urine will not affect them. We warrant this Seat not to warp or split for a period of five years, and will replace any Seat that does warp or split under ordinary service within that period.\n\nIdeal Construction\n\nThe fact that the Seats are homogeneous and will not warp or split, makes them indestructible and perfect in point of sanitation. The Tanks, being moulded solid without joints or metal lining, are ideal in construction. There is nothing about them to corrode or deteriorate in any way.\nPerfect and Durable Finish\nand Grain\n\nJ-M Sanitor Seats and Tanks are furnished in Natural Oak, Golden Oak, Mahogany and White Enamel, or other finishes as desired. We have devised special machinery which produces a perfect match to natural wood both in grain and color. We use the very best varnish and by special treatment secure a high lustre that is very durable.\n\nFurnished Complete\n\nJ-M Sanitor Seats and Tanks are furnished complete with our regular fittings and attachments. We have adopted as standard fittings, those which have proven most satisfactory to the trade at large and which we can safely recommend.\n\nIn the top supply High Tanks and Low Tanks, we furnish a direct action ball cock guaranteed to stand any pressure up to and including 150 lbs. We have adopted this as a standard because of its positive action, simplicity and ease of installation. Where required we will also furnish compound lever ball cocks at a slight additional cost. Bottom supply High Tanks are furnished with compound lever ball cocks as standard.\n\nEconomical\n\nOur large manufacturing facilities enable us to offer this line of goods at attractive prices, no higher than other high grade Seats and Tanks on the market.\n\nSanitor Seats and Tanks are the most economical fixtures. The cost of maintenance is practically nothing. In this point alone, they save the difference in their cost over cheap fixtures in a year or two.\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find our pamphlet on Sanitary Seats and Tanks which I think will have your consideration for installation for the school house which you have in view for erection for the Indian Reserves N.B.\n\nTrusting to hear from you I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.E.P.-G.B.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing a pamphlet on Sanitor Seats and Tanks.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the intention of the Department to install plumbing systems in the schools which it contemplates erecting in the Province of New Brunswick during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.O.

Father Ryan, St. Mary's Ferry, will act in a similar capacity for the Oromocto school building.

For that reason, he has decided to build the basement walls in brick instead of stone, as it will not freeze.\n\nThe concrete work he would do for $10 extra, and he would like to know as soon as possible if the Dept. would approve the change.\n\nI think it would be in the interest of the work to make these changes, as I know the ground at present is such as he appeals into it.\n\nJune 29th, 1910\n\nJ.

The Department, therefore, is not clear as to whether you have reference to the Oromocto or Woodstock school. In either case you should state whether you consider the price asked for the work reasonable.\n\nIf your letter has reference to the Oromocto school it will be necessary for you to make inquiries with regard to the drainage of the site of the Woodstock school. This should, however, be dealt with in a separate communication in order that the records of the Department may be kept distinct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. J.

The plank walk from the outhouse to the school must be repaired, as some of the planks are rotted and broken. There are also five lights of glass broken, and the furnace needs repairing. This is a small job. The cracks in the plaster will take a man about one day to repair. This and the roof will have to be done by an experienced man. The other work can be done by Indians, except the furnace.\n\nI cannot give a correct estimate of the total cost of this work, but will keep all expenses as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the repairs required to the Woodstock Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the materials required in repairing the roof, plank walk, furnace and the cracks in the plaster on the inside of the school building and also installing new glass in windows, where necessary. The Department expects you to see that this work is carried out satisfactorily and at as low a cost as possible. It should be completed before the school re-opens after the holidays.\n\nWhen these repairs have been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of materials, and accounts, in triplicate for the labour. Please state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.

This is the same amount as was allowed last year, and is the total that can be allowed for the academic year 1935-36.

You should state on the voucher the number of days Mrs. Agnes Polchis, Frank Polchis and Pat Polchis were employed and the rate per day. You should, also, obtain from them an acknowledgment that they secured the supplies from W. W. Cluff for the work that they did at the Woodstock School.\n\nIn future, please do not include expenditures in connection with schools with any other voucher. All expenditures at schools are paid from the appropriation for Indian education and, consequently, separate vouchers should be submitted for all such disbursements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLee MacCutcheon, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\n379 Saunders St.,\nFredericton, N. B.\n\nPP/O'M.\nOttawa, October 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReverend F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the province of New Brunswick, in reporting on his recent inspection of the Woodstock Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the work which was carried out last summer, in repairing the plaster in the classroom. He states that the walls require to be painted or tinted, as the white material which was used in filling up the cracks last summer should be coloured, to match the paint on the walls, and that the interior of the building would be greatly improved if the walls were repainted. You might advise the Department concerning the cost of having the interior walls of the classroom redecorated. This work could be performed during the coming Christmas holidays.\n\nThe Inspector states that the roof was patched where there were no leaks and that it is worse than ever. You should examine the roof and arrange for the carrying out of any minor repairs required to prevent leakage during the coming winter. Any expense in connection with this work, of course, should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR.

If the Department will recall I had less than one month to complete repairs to four schools. Woodstock was the last one repaired and time would not permit me to paint the interior.\n\nI would say the approximate cost of this would be at\nthe least seventy-five dollars including labor.\n\nI will immediately carry out instructions contained in your letter, regarding the roof.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA/ Indian Agent.\nThe Woodstock Woodworking Company, Limited\nLUMBER, MILLWORK, BUILDERS' SUPPLIES\nCHURCH AND SCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nWOODSTOCK, NEW BRUNSWICK,\nCANADA\n\nAug. 19th, 1935\n\nTo Dept.

B.\nMay 25, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe fence of the Indian School yard, Woodstock N. B., has been in bad condition for sometime. Now a part of it\u2014that between the highway and the school is to be moved over toward the school building a space of some feet, to enable the Department of Public Works, Province of New Brunswick, to lay hard surface road. The wires are not in fit condition to be used again. It will be necessary to get new material for this fence.\n\nThe road workers are ready to put it up for us if material is supplied, and it is certainly necessary to have a fence for the school yard. The old posts that are between the school yard and the highway have been replaced with new ones by the Provincial Government.\n\nMay I have authority to purchase wire fencing from the firm of Steward and Steward, Woodstock for this purpose. Approximate cost, $35.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant you may purchase new wire fencing for the Woodstock Indian Day School at a cost not exceeding $35.00. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list. The firm you mention does not show on the list we have in this office.\n\nIt is noted that there will be no charge for labour or new posts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

The drainage is inadequate. For instance, today there was about two inches of water on the floor. Sister Katherine is forced to wear rubbers and sweep the water over to the drain before the children can go downstairs for their domestic work. Eventually, I believe it will be necessary to dig approximately 200 feet and put in a tile drain system. It may be that when the water runs off the roof, it will not drain away but just remains at the base of the wall and seeps down through.\n\nI believe this could be overcome to a great extent, if we had a banking put around the school and this covered with gravel. It would take care of much of the water, which I am sure runs in around the stems and down into the basement. This could be done without a great deal of expense. I will need 4 or 5 loads of gravel and possibly a load of dirt. I would employ an Indian to do the banking.\n\nToday I had a competent engineer inspect the basement with me and this is what he suggests for the time being, of course if this will not take care of the water, in the spring it will be necessary to put in a tiling system.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nNovember 8, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt seems impossible to keep the basement in the Woodstock Indian Day School dry.

MacCutchon,\nFredericton N.B.\n\nDear Mr. MacCutchon,\n\nOn account of the lack of light I am finding it very difficult to dispense medicines in the little basement room of our school which is the only available place for this purpose. The small windows admit very little light at any time and on dark cloudy days it is almost impossible to read the labels and do the dispensing. So I humbly request to have electric light installed. This would also be a benefit to the schoolroom as the boards are difficult to be seen by the children on dark days. But the principal need is in the basement where are located the...\nI also petition that the Domestic Science kitchen and the Dispensary be separated by a partition. At present they are not and the medicines and poisons such as syrup, iodine etc. are all in the room where the children go for lunch and for cooking lessons etc., and there is danger of breakage and even serious accidents might happen as I can not always be present when they go there.\n\nA small partition would separate the dispensary from the kitchen. A door would be needed and in the dispensary shelves for the drugs and bottles etc. Now I am using old packing boxes which are very inadequate.\n\nI trust that you will be so kind as to take up this matter with the Indian Department as\nI can assure you that both these items are badly needed.\n\nThanking you for the kind interest shown towards our work in the past I remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSister M.

Almost at any time of the year the children have to wear rubber and in fact, Sister Katharine wears rubber boots most of the time.\n\nI dread to think of the basement this spring with so much snow and water. I was really at a loss trying to figure some way that it could be drained. Several engineers have looked this over and they all are of the same opinion, and that is, the present drain is practically useless.\n\nIn order to eliminate this, which Sister Katherine tells me is getting worse all the time, one would have to go back of the school closets 50 feet, dig a trench down to the hard pan in the direction indicated on the enclosed sketch and put in either a 6\" tile drain (smaller would not take maximum flow of water) or a rock drain 4\" square to lead down over the hill into the brook back of the house occupied by Mrs. Doc Polchies. This would probably isolate the school from the underground water supply that floods it. (I am told that the school was built in a swamp.) To do this work, labour would probably cost from $200.00 to $250.00.\n\nA rock drain would entail practically all wages, a tile drain about $35.00 to $40.00 for the tile, but I think it would make a job.\nA direct drain into the road ditch would not be allowed by the powers that be at present. We must do something or we will spend much more than this in doctor bills and at times it is impossible to get down in the basement for the Domestic Science classes or dispenser of medicines.\n\nAs I said before I have consulted engineers about this and I am told by men, who surely should know, that this is the only way to eliminate this underground flow of water, which floods the school basement.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nR. Lee MacGutchon.\n\nPlease return enclosed sketch.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in which you recommend digging a drain at the Woodstock Indian day school.\n\nIt was only found possible to provide in our current year's appropriation an amount of $300.00 for repairs and improvements at the schools in your Agency. You will, therefore, note that the drain at the Woodstock school will involve the expenditure of practically the whole amount available.\n\nHowever, as the work appears necessary you may proceed with it as soon as weather conditions permit and a tile drain should be provided.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that only Indians will be employed and in engaging them you should hire all able-bodied Indians who are at present on relief. As soon as they start work no further relief should be allowed to them. Any able-bodied Indian who refuses work in digging the drain should be cut off relief.\n\nPlease let me know when you require an accountable cheque for this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Lee MacCutcheon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N. B.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFredericton, N. B.,\nApril 17, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 13, File No. 56-5-5 re-digging a drain at the Woodstock Indian School.\n\nI believe it will be the first of June before I will be able to do this work. The ground here is covered with snow and there is still 4 or 5 feet of ice in the St. John River.\n\nI note that the amount of $300.00 was provided for the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements for the schools in my Agency, and that it will involve practically the whole amount available for the work at Woodstock. I had hoped to paint the interior of the St. Mary's Indian School. I do not know when it was painted last, but it most certainly needs paint. The old paint is practically all off the Woodwork, and the walls and ceilings need doing as well. The Woodstock School requires paint on the outside in the worst way, and for that matter, Kingsclear School also needs paint on the outside, but as this school is down in the reserve and not visible from the highway, we could pass that up for another year, but if it is at all possible to secure funds, I would paint the interior of the St. Mary's School and the exterior of the Woodstock School.\nPlease let me have your opinion on this as it will save unnecessary correspondence later on in securing authority for this work. Believe me, Sir, the paint job recommended herein is necessary.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nR. Lee MacGutcheon.\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your letter of the 17th instant that you will be unable to dig the drain at the Woodstock school until the first week in June.\n\nAs you were informed in my letter of the 13th instant it was only found possible to include an amount of $300.00 for repairs and improvements at the schools in your Agency during the current fiscal year. There are so many demands that it is practically impossible for the Department to exceed the amount actually appropriated. Under these circumstances I cannot hold out any hope that funds will be available for the painting at the Kingsclear and St. Mary's schools. However, you might write to the Department again about the end of June giving detailed estimates of the expenditure that would be involved and also stating whether Indian labour would be employed or if it would be necessary to employ white men. Your request will receive further consideration at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. Lee MacCutcheon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.

Southwestern for the month of May 1939.\n\nWOODSTOCK RESERVE\n\nThis reserve was visited four times during the month. All unemployment relief was discontinued May 1st. Monday, May 15th, I started excavation for the French drain, using Indian labour with a white foreman. I am attaching a rough sketch of the work as it is completed. I am delighted with the results. The Indians worked well and the foreman understood his job. Two competent Provincial Government engineers have inspected the drain and assure me that now we have a job that will last indefinitely. The school basement is dry, the spring is dry. Fortunately I was able to procure the rock without cost, which effected a considerable saving.\n\nR.

Southwestern Indian Agency for the month of August 1939.\n\nWoodstock Reserve\n\nRecently I received permission from the Department to have the Indian day school on the exterior painted; Indians to be employed. Unfortunately the Indian whom I had to take charge of this work has had some experience in painting, but has enlisted and try as I might, there is not one of the elderly men remaining in the reserve who will tackle the job. If it is agreeable to the Department, I will consult the right people in Woodstock and have them recommend to me a white man and if his prices are not too high, and if the job can be completed for $150. I will proceed with the work.\n\nR. Lee MacCutcheon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted in your monthly report, dated Fredericton, September 7, that you have experienced difficulty in securing an Indian to paint the Indian day school on the Woodstock Reserve.\n\nIn view of the difficulty you have experienced you are authorized to secure a man who can undertake the painting of this school. In your selection of a man it might be well to discuss the matter with the Federal Representative, if you can conveniently do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR.

I regret being so late in sending them in but as the duties had to be done and I could not get the school during the Christmas vacation and various reasons chief being lack of convenient time, I am late in presenting them.\n\nYou will see I have made them out at 10 d per qts. As you may know prices of milk products are up nearly \u00bd and milk prices have advanced in this locality due to the advanced prices of feed and grain. The cows do not know but that feeds are at an advance here & nearly 50% over two years ago. I trust this will be satisfactory particularly as 10 d per qt. is only on a purity basis the price clear base.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWoodstock Indian Day School.\n\nThe population of the Woodstock Indian Reserve has increased so rapidly that the school house at the present time is not large enough to accommodate the children of school age on the reserve. There are, at the present time, 24 names appearing on the register, and this number fill the seats to capacity.\n\nThere are 10 new pupils of school age to go the coming term, while there is only one old enough to leave, therefore 9 new seats are required before the opening of school on October 1, 1943.\n\nThis is not the biggest trouble however, as the school is too small, and in order to place the extra number of desks something will have to be done to the school room.\n\nAt the present time, the sewing room might be used but even then the pupils would be crowded, and with the ever increasing population, it would only supply room enough for a year or so.\n\nI would like for Mr. Arneil to discuss this situation with the proper authorities before leaving Ottawa, in order that we might know what to do when he arrives.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nEdward J.

This he did with the help of a man, Ed Gallagher, for five hours.\n\nThe interior of this school should have another coat and the entry and subbase should be painted as well. We have nearly enough paint to do this and Mr. Nash would go up again if authorized to do so.\n\nThe labour and material for painting the Woodstock and St. Marys schools were kept pretty well within the amount allowed although the Woodstock school received less labour and material than that of St. Marys.\n\nEdward J.

No. 484.\n\nThe first item shown on this voucher was in payment for painting the Woodstock School House by Peter L. Paul, Indian of the Woodstock Reserve.\n\nThis work was done (with the exception of a hallway) during the Christmas Holidays. It was impossible to get anyone else to do this work and Mr. Paul would not consider the job for any less than $35.00. I was obliged to give it to him.\n\nThe second item was for turpentine and paints required over and above the amount which I had on hand.\n\nMr. Paul did a very good job and I like, when possible, to give the work to Indians.\n\nEdward J.

Therefore I gave the work to him.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nThis should be shown in detail. Did he buy the material? Cost? And wages?\nOttawa, February 14, 1945.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Acting Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N. B.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 461. If the statement attached to the voucher is signed by Mr. Whalen we can consider the contract and arrange payment without being supplied with all the details.\n\nI am rather surprised that Dr. McGill gave instructions for this work, as it was not his usual custom to give verbal authority for expenditure. Besides, it has not been our usual practice for some years to install electric lights in Indian day schools. However, as stated above, we are prepared to pay the account, provided the matter is handled in the manner suggested.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWoodstock NB\nFeb 31/45\n\nMr. J.

Whalen,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nDear Mr. Whalen,\n\nIs it possible to have something done at once regarding the Woodstock Indian School?\n\nThe seating capacity of the classroom is about twenty seats. At present there are thirty-four seats in the front row within a few inches of the teacher's desk, making it impossible to carry on any drill or activity work. There are thirty-six pupils attending school; seven are in Grade VII. Of these, three will have attained their sixteenth birthday in 1946. The following grade is Grade VI.\n\nDuring the next three years there will be an average of six pupils per year.\n\nUnder these conditions it is evident that immediate measures must be taken.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister M. Dobroza (teacher).\nFredericton, N.B.\nJuly 9, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Woodstock Indian School.\n\nEnclosed you will find a letter which I received from Sister Dolorosa, teacher, at the Woodstock Indian School.\n\nI agree with this teacher, as the population of the Woodstock Reserve is increasing rapidly and, as stated in her letter, the desks are at the present time too close to the front and back of the room leaving no room for even a class on the floor.\n\nI brought this to your attention on May 22, 1942, when the number on the roll was only 24. Now if there was room enough for them there would be at least 40 during the coming year, and this number would increase yearly.\n\nI believe a new school house would be the only solution as it costs so much to remodel an old one. Besides water and sewerage should be an addition to this school.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 13th, 1945.\n\nEdward J. Whalen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N. B.\n\nRe: Woodstock Indian School.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the necessity of enlarging the Woodstock Indian Day School.\n\nThere are no funds available in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a School this year.\n\nHowever, I discussed your letter this morning with the Director, and we are including in our post-war programme, an amount sufficient to erect a new School on Woodstock Reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Aug 1945  | To Electric Current supplied Woodstock                                  |        |\n|           | Indian Day School to July 17 as per account attached.                   | 1.25   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Sister Dolores is in charge, assisted by Sister Marian Theresa. There are thirty-seven pupils in attendance. The school is crowded. Additional seats will be sent from the Kingsclear School. The children were clean, well-dressed and well-fed. The last time the inside of the school was painted Indian Agent Whalen donned overalls and worked with the painter, which reduced the cost of the work considerably. As at other schools in New Brunswick, the school children accompanied their parents to Maine to pick potatoes. Definitely this practice must be discouraged in the future.\n\nJ. E.

B., with one (100 gal.) tank at the same price quoted by E. T. Hansen for two (200 gal.) tanks.\n\nI seem to have run into a snag, however, in connection with the oil burner for the Woodstock School, as the British American Oil Company and the Imperial Oil Company, the wholesale firms who sell fuel oil, state that at the present time, they will be unable to supply oil for the school at Woodstock, on account of the scarcity.\n\nIt will therefore, be necessary to use wood for the coming year, and I have forwarded a requisition asking for permission to purchase the wood required.\n\nEdward J.

He seemed to have misunderstood me in some way, because when I returned to the school again, he had completed the job (with the exception of painting), which is still undone, and the bills were as attached to the above numbered vouchers.\n\nThis room is large enough now to have meetings for Homemaker's Clubs or other gatherings of the adults. This is what Sister Marion Teresa had been wanting.\n\nThe room in the basement was necessary on account of the overcrowded school room upstairs. I had written to Ottawa about this crowded condition on a previous occasion and Inspector Brooks, the Inspector of the N.B. Schools for that area had mentioned to me that the school room was too small to accommodate the number of pupils.\n\nThe smaller pupils had been taught in the basement for the past two years. At times, the room was very damp, and water drop would (over)\ngather on the cement walls and dampness on the floor. It was for this reason that I asked for authority to repair the room.\n\nI feel that the Indian Affairs Branch will be satisfied with the improvement, and I would strongly recommend that these vouchers be paid.\n\nEdward J.

Scott,\nPrince William, R.R. #2, dated April 13, 1948.\n\nThe above numbered voucher in favour of Walden L. Scott is for 2' furnace wood purchased for the Woodstock Indian Day School.\n\nIt cost about twice as much to heat the Woodstock School this year, as I had planned, and also twice as much as other years. Although, Ray Hall appeared to be doing his best to supply this school with wood, the quality and quantity which he purchased locally was everything but satisfactory.\n\nWhen I visited the Woodstock School the first week in March, and saw such a small amount of wood after having been supplied with so much, I immediately told Mr. Hall to discontinue supplying wood to this school.\n\nOn my way from Woodstock I located three cords of nice old growth maple, beech, and yellow birch, which I purchased. I then had Departmental Truck No. 1105 haul this wood to the Woodstock School.\n\nI would recommend that an oil burner be purchased for this school, as the Indians steal the wood from the school. Last year authority was granted to purchase an oil burner, but no supply of oil could be obtained at that time. Recently, while talking to the Imperial Oil dealer in Woodstock, he informed me that he thought he could supply oil for the school another year, and said he would be certain after May 1.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nSup't. of Indian Agency.\nApril 19, 1948.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant\nwith reference to the Woodstock School.\n\nProvided you can get a definite assurance\nfrom the Imperial Oil dealer at Woodstock that he will\nbe able to supply oil during the heating season of\n1948-49, we are prepared to consider the purchase of\nan oil burner for this school.\n\nIn the event of your being assured of a\nsupply of oil, you should advise at what price you\ncan secure the oil burner. In this connection I\nwould refer you to our letter of September 12, 1947\nand your reply of October 2.\n\nBernard F.

This took extra time and the cost of the painting was in excess of what I had anticipated for the Woodstock School.\n\nEdward McMillan,\nSuperintendent,\nN.B.

Or, cette formation ne peut leur venir que par la formation qu'ils prennent \u00e0 la\nclasse. Il faut donc qu'\u00e0 leur sortie de l'\u00e9cole, ils soient assez instruits et \u00e9duqu\u00e9s pour qu'il leur en reste toute leur vie; c'est l\u00e0 le seul moyen d'obtenir une am\u00e9lioration de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.\n\nJe vous donne ces explications pour vous bien faire comprendre les motifs de ma suggestion et l'importance de cette derni\u00e8re.\n\nLes institutrices ont trop d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves chacune; et malgr\u00e9 leur bonne volont\u00e9 et leur d\u00e9vouement, elles n'ont pas le temps de faire tout ce qu'il faut pour instruire et \u00e9duquer leurs enfants d'une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante. Depuis 5 mois que je suis ici, c'est la premi\u00e8re fois que je soumets cette question \u00e0 votre appr\u00e9ciation, parce que j'ai pris le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour me rendre compte des faits et de la situation.\n\nIl serait donc opportun d'engager une troisi\u00e8me institutrice pour l'ann\u00e9e scolaire prochaine. La M\u00e8re Sup\u00e9rieure et les P\u00e8res, Eudistes de la Mission, qui j'en ai dit un mot y avaient pens\u00e9 avant moi; et trouvent, comme moi, que cette mesure s'impose.\n\nIl faudrait pour cela transformer une partie inutilis\u00e9e du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e pour y transporter la Chapelle; cela comporterait une d\u00e9pense d'environ $300.00 \u00e0 $350.00. Et la pi\u00e8ce qui sert de Chapelle aujourd'hui, serait convertie en classe; il n'y aurait pour cela qu'\u00e0 acheter les bancs et les pupitres.\n\nDu reste, le nombre toujours croissant des enfants nous force-ra \u00e0 en arriver l\u00e0 en 1932, si nous ne le faisons cette ann\u00e9e;\n\nJ'insiste donc tr\u00e8s fortement sur l'importance, je dirai m\u00eame, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9forme. Vous verrez par le rapport annuel, que la culture ne fait aucun progr\u00e8s ici; la raison en est que les vrais sauvages ne veulent rien faire autre chose que la chasse. Ce n'est qu'en les civilisant que nous r\u00e9ussirons \u00e0 leur inculquer le go\u00fbt de la culture ou de tout autre travail; et encore une fois, la civilisation ne leur viendra qu'en raison de leur d\u00e9veloppement intellectuel; et ce d\u00e9veloppement ne peut se prendre ailleurs qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.\n\nSi je puis vous donner plus de renseignements sur cette question, je le ferai avec plaisir. Vous pouvez aussi correspondre, avec les Rvds Peres de la Mission qui se feront s\u00fbrement un devoir de vous donner leurs points de vue \u00e0 ce sujet ainsi que les institutrices actuelles.\n\nB.A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI wish to inform you of certain facts and to make a suggestion concerning the education of children following the Creekin school.\n\nI find that the pupils of all ages do not make as much progress as they should. The blame must not be at-tributed to the teachers whose methods of teaching seem very good and their devotion incessant. The rea-sons are from several difficulties in teaching to Indians; and to the very large number of pupils distributed in the only two class rooms that we have.\n\nIn fact, if we consider, the small aptitude the Indians have for studies; the fact that they only speak their Indian tongue when they enter school, and also the fact that their parents do not care for the advancement of their children; that they even do not care if they go to school at all; and that they care less to have them study at home, we can easily understand the strain the teachers had to go through. If we also consider that this year the only two teachers we have had 83 pupils register, with an average attendance of 70 to 75 children, we then understand that the pupils cannot make much progress. At 13 or 14 years of age, that is when the young Indian has become strong enough to work and he abandons school, the children can only read and write a little and in fact after two or three years they forget it all and the result is that they return to their savage state and forget whatever education they had gained. They then only speak their native language and remain strangers to civilization as if they had never been to school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 1)\nThis is, I believe, a great difficulty which causes us to remain at the same point concerning the advancement and civilization of the Indians.\n\nWhat I wish to suggest is not contrary with the program of economy you are following. I know that, however, if we look up the situation from the right angle and think of the future, the conclusion is quite different. As long as the Indians remain as they are, it will be necessary to assist their old and sick people and maintain expensive organizations to help them along. It is our duty only by education that we will teach them to earn their living like others, to be economical, to save for their old age, finally to live like civilized people.\n\nThat formation can only come to them by the education they gain at school. It is therefore necessary that when they leave school they be learned and educated so that they will retain some of it all their life; it is the only way to obtain some improvement from one generation to another.\n\nI am giving all these explanations to make you understand fully the nature of my suggestions and the importance of the latter.\n\nThe teachers have each too many pupils, and notwithstanding their good will and devotion, they have not the time and to do all that is necessary to instruct and educate their children in a satisfactory manner.\n\nIn the five months I have been here, it is the first time I submit this question to your approval, because I have taken the time necessary to study the facts and the situation.\n\nIt would consequently be opportune to appoint a third teacher for the next school term. The Reverend Father Superior and the Rev. Benedict Fathers\nthe Mission to whom I have said a word about it had thought of this before I did, and believe with me that such action is imperative.\n\nIt would be necessary for what to transform a part of the unused space of the ground floor to transfer the Chapel there; this would cost from $300 to $350. And the space occupied now by the chapel could be turned into a class room; it would only be necessary for that to purchase benches and desks.\n\nAnyway the ever-increasing number of children will force us to do this in 1922 if we do not do it this year.\n\nI consequently strongly insist on the importance I should say the necessity of this reform. One will see by the annual report that farming does not make any progress here; the reason is that the true Indians do not want to do anything else but hunting. It is only by civilizing them that we will give them the taste of farming or of any other kind of work; and once more civilized they will come to them in direct line with their intellectual development, and such development can only be acquired at the school.\n\nI should give you more detailed information on the question I would do so with pleasure. You can write to the Reverend Brother Father of the Mission who would be pleased to give you their point of view on the matter as well as the teachers themselves.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The number of children enrolled and receiving instruction from the two teachers at present employed has been noted.\n\nI regret, however, that, owing to our appropriation for the present fiscal year having been considerably reduced, it will not be possible to fit up a third classroom and provide the salary of a third teacher. It is hoped that the Reverend Sisters in charge will be able to continue teaching services under the existing classroom accommodation as satisfactorily as possible during the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nAugust 19, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWith the concurrence of Mr. Buskard, a representative of the Solicitor General's office called on Mr. Ferrier today, in connection with the appointment of a third teacher at the Bersimis Indian Day School. It was represented that the Order under whose charge the Bersimis School is conducted are prepared to appointed a third teacher and that her salary would be paid by the parents of the white children who attend the Bersimis School.\n\nThe Department was requested to provide for the accommodation of this third teacher at the Indian hospital (or refuge) and allow her free meals.\n\nIt was decided that, if the Indian Agent would present a formal request, the Department would be prepared to favourably consider the proposal to arrange for free accommodation for the teacher in the hospital, provided that her salary was paid by the white parents and that any advanced Indian children would be permitted to attend the class conducted by this third teacher.\nJUL 5 1932\n\n\u00c9cole de N.-D. du Bon-Conseil\nBeloeil, 27 juin 1932\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nAu d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire 1931-1932, je vous demandais de m'aider \u00e0 donner une troisi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9charger les deux autres classes qui \u00e9taient trop charg\u00e9es d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves, ce qui rendait leur progr\u00e8s impossible et dont tout le monde se plaignait.\n\nLe D\u00e9partement n'a pas jug\u00e9 bon, pour le moment, d'accepter ma demande.

Nous avons ouvert une troisi\u00e8me classe que se compose d'indiens et de Canadiens qui ont leur licence pour rester sur la r\u00e9serve. Vous ne sauriez croire tout le bien que cela a fait. Dans les trois classes il s'est fait un travail excellent et les progr\u00e8s sont le double des ann\u00e9es derni\u00e8res. Tout le monde \u00e9prouve une v\u00e9ritable satisfaction.

Et comme depuis trente ans nous continuons d'\u00eatre pour les enfants qui nous serons confi\u00e9s des institutrices d\u00e9vou\u00e9es et des m\u00e8res vigilantes qui en les instruisant, les aiderons \u00e0 faire des femmes mod\u00e8les et de citoyens distingu\u00e9s selon leur condition.\n\nD'avance cher directeur, je vous dis un sinc\u00e8re merci, pour ce que vous ferez pour vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves et pour nous.\n\nVos tr\u00e8s humbles,\n\nLe Dr. de M.D. du Bon Conseil\nSr. Marie du Carmel\nSup\u00e9rieure.\nAt the end of the scholar year of 1931 I, Sister Marie du Carmel, director of the school of Betsiamits, requested you to kindly give us a third teacher so as to reduce the other two classrooms which were overcrowded with pupils, as this was rendering progress impossible and because of difficulties of which everyone was complaining.\n\nThe Department did not judge it proper at that moment to grant my request. Next year, I was told, we will give you that additional teacher. To ease up matters and relying on that promise, which is to be brought to effect this year, we have done our part and we hope that the Department will do his at present.\n\nOur community has supplied a third Sister which was absolutely necessary to help the other two teachers and to give the pupils a chance to make some progress. We have opened a third classroom which is composed of Indian and Canadian children who have their permit to reside on the reserve. You can hardly imagine all the good that this has done. In the three classrooms an excellent work has been accomplished and the progress has been double that of preceding years. Everyone is enjoying real satisfaction. The teachers, first, are not overworked, the authorities, religious and civil, the chief of the Agent and also the parents appreciate the high value of this third classroom.\nAll this is very fine and very good; it is even indispensable as the pupils are too numerous now to be crowded in two rooms. Now the other problem arises. We need to keep this teacher and she should have at least a small salary. The Canadians who are contributing this school have brought their contributions but this is insufficient. If the Department on its side would contribute its share and give us at least $200.00 per year, we can continue this task. I am certainly not too exacting; and I hope, with confidence, that I will be granted this favour soon as you will understand that this is of absolute necessity. Consequently, teachers and pupils will bring all their efforts to profit from the generosity and courtesy of the officers of the Department for the favour which has been given to us.\n\nAnd, as we have done for the last thirty years, we will continue to be for these children, who are entrusted to us, devoted teachers and will conduct them and help them to be good women and distinguished citizens according to their condition.\n\nIn advance I thank you very sincerely for what you may do in consideration of our pupils and ourselves.\n\nVery humbly yours,\n\nThe Sisters of N. D. du Bon Conseil,\nPer Sister Marie du Carmel,\nSuperior.\nOttawa, July 13, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting that a grant of $200 be provided towards the salary of a third teacher at the Bersimis Indian Day School. The Department notes that a third class has been conducted and met with much success.\n\nWe are referring your request to Dr. Lavallee, the local Indian Agent. When we have his reply, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided this year towards the salary of a third teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Marie du Carmel,\nSuperior, Notre Dame du Bon Conseil,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nOttawa, July 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a request from the Sister Superior of the Bersimis Indian Day School that a grant be provided towards the salary of a third teacher. She states that during the last school year their Community supplied a third teacher and that the work at the school met with success.\n\nI would request that you furnish a report showing the enrolment, separately, of Indian and white children in each of the three classrooms. Please also state if you would recommend that the grant of $200 asked for by the Sister Superior be provided. You should also state what arrangements can be made to accommodate and board a third teacher. Your early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nMonsieur,\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la votre no. 3-1-1, dat\u00e9e 13 juillet 1932 je dois vous dire que lors de mon voyage \u00e0 Ottawa, au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des Affaires Indiennes, l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier nous avons longuement discut\u00e9 et r\u00e9solu cette question d'une \u00e9cole pour les canadiens. Vous en \u00e9tiez arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que si cette troisi\u00e8me classe \u00e9tait avantageuse pour les indiens et si ces avantages pouvaient \u00eatre constat\u00e9s apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e d'exp\u00e9rience vous payeriez le salaire de cette troisi\u00e8me ma\u00eetresse. Nous avons l'exp\u00e9rience d'une ann\u00e9e. Les canadiens ont pay\u00e9 seuls, cinq familles, le salaire complet de l'institutrice cette ann\u00e9e. Les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par l'inauguration de cette troisi\u00e8me classe ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9 nos esp\u00e9rances. Dix-huit enfants canadiens en ont grandement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9. En outre en d\u00e9congestionnant les classes des indiens cela a permis de cr\u00e9er une division sp\u00e9ciale pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves indiens les plus avanc\u00e9s. Vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9 pour envoyer des jeunes sauvagesses dans des couvents \u00e0 Rimouski. Cette d\u00e9pense ne sera plus n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'avenir parce ayant trois institutrices, celle qui s'occupe des canadiens s'occupera en m\u00eame temps de la division la plus avanc\u00e9e des indiens. Le degr\u00e9 d'instruction pourra y \u00eatre pouss\u00e9 autant qu'il le serait dans une maison d'enseignement ext\u00e9rieure.\n\nVous pouvez vous enqu\u00e9rir directement aupr\u00e8s de notre p\u00e8re missionnaire des bienfaiteurs r\u00e9sultats que nous a fournis cette ann\u00e9e l'ouverture d'une nouvelle classe; c'est lui en effet qui a dirig\u00e9 et contr\u00f4l\u00e9 cette classe cette ann\u00e9e.\n\nVous pouvez voir par le dernier rapport trimestriel de l'\u00e9cole, qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le nombre toujours croissant d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves l'engagement d'une troisi\u00e8me ma\u00eetresse s'imposait.\n\nLes canadiens sont pr\u00eats pour les ann\u00e9es futures de faire leur part pour le maintien de cette troisi\u00e8me institutrice. Cette derni\u00e8re est une religieuse faisant partie de la m\u00eame communaut\u00e9 que celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9es auparavant. Elle a toute accommodation \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole m\u00eame. Je recommande donc avec instance la d\u00e9pense de $200.00 pour l'engagement \u00e0 l'automne d'une autre ma\u00eetresse. J'ai obtenu des canadiens qu'ils payent la diff\u00e9rence qui sera probablement de $100.00 \u00e0 $150.00.\n\nBien \u00e0 vous.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI reply to yours No. 3-1-1, dated the 13th July 1932. I wish to say that during my trip to Ottawa, at the Dept. of Indian Affairs, last summer, we have discussed at length and solved the question of a school for the Canadians. You came to the conclusion that if that third classroom was advantageous for the Indians and if the benefit could be appreciated after a year of experiment, you would pay the salary of the third teacher. We have now the experience of a year. The Canadians have paid about their salary of the teacher this year; it was shared by five families. The results obtained by the opening of this third room have been far above our expectations. Eighteen Canadian children have benefited greatly by it. This has removed the congestion in the other classrooms for the Indians and has permitted to create a special division for the advanced Indians properly. You have paid in the past to send young squaws to the convent of Brimstone. Such expenditure will not be necessary in future because having 3 teachers, the one who will be in charge of the Canadians will also look over the advanced division of the Indians. The degree of instruction can be advanced as much as it is in an outside school.\n\nYou can inquire directly from our Reverend Missionary if the good results which have followed the opening of the new room this year, in fact he controls and directs that class himself.\n\nYou can see by the last quarterly report of the school, that in consideration of the increasing number of pupils the third mistress was a necessity.\n\nThe Canadians are ready to pay their share of the maintenance of the third teacher in future. The latter\nis a Sister of the same community of those who were appointed at first. She has the perfect accommodation at the school.\n\nI consequently strongly recommend the expenditure of $200.00 for the appointment of another mission in the fall. I have the assurance from the Canadians that they will pay the balance which may amount to $150 or $157.00\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDr. E. Saville\n\nMr. R.J. MacKenzie\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, August 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the providing of a grant towards the salary of a third teacher at the Bersimis Indian Day School. In view of your report as to the work that was accomplished at this school last year, the Department will be pleased to allow a grant, at the rate of $20 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year, for the salary of a third teacher. Please advise the Sister Superior of the School. It is noted that the white residents will pay the balance of the salary of the third teacher. It is hoped that this school will continue to meet with every success and that there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEugene Lavallee, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.

However, if this should necessitate too many corrections in your accounts, we would accept the same ones for this month.\n\nIn future, Sister Ste. Fidele de Jesus is replaced by Sister St. Louis; Sister Marie du Carmel by Sister Ste. Angeline; and myself (Sister Ste.

It would necessitate considerable correction in our accounts to issue new cheques, and I am returning the cheques in favour of Sister Marie du Carmel and Sister St. Fidele de Jesus. I would request that you arrange to have these cheques endorsed by these Sisters and handed over to the new teachers.\n\nThe Department is writing Dr. Lavallee, Indian Agent, informing him of the approval granted for the appointment of yourself as principal and Sister Ste. Angeline and Sister St. Louis as assistant teachers. Your salary will be at the rate of $600 for the present academic year; Sister Ste.

Leur salaires ne paraissent pas sur ma liste de paye. Depuis quatre ans que je suis ici, des changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits chez les Soeurs institutrices; je n'en ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu; elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es \u00e0 mon insu, et l'affaire s'est toujours r\u00e9gl\u00e9e autant que je puisse voir entre leur maison M\u00e8re et vous directement.\n\nCet \u00e9t\u00e9, je n'ai su qu'au mois de Septembre que la M\u00e8re Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait change\u00e9e de m\u00eame qu'une des institutrices. Je l'ai appris lorsqu'elle sont arriv\u00e9es apr\u00e8s leurs vacances.\n\nJ'avais raison, alors de supposer que ces changements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec votre approbation; que les nouveaux engagements \u00e9taient sous votre adh\u00e9sion; et je n'avais rien \u00e0 vous apprendre; c'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t moi qui n'avais raison de trouver que vous ne m'ayez pas pr\u00e9venu des changements qui \u00e9taient faits dans le personnel enseignant de notre \u00c9cole de Bersimis.\n\nUne preuve que je ne suis pas interm\u00e9diaire entre les Soeurs de notre \u00c9cole et vous: En 1932, nos Soeurs de Bersimis ont achet\u00e9, \u00e0 vos frais, une machine \u00e0 coudre, au montant de pr\u00e8s de $40.00; j'ai appris cela seulement lorsque la machine eut \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e \u00e0 Bersimis et qu'il m'a fallu envoyer le compte. J'ai donc approuv\u00e9 ce compte, croyant toujours que les affaires des Religieuses se faisaient directement avec vous et non pas par mon interm\u00e9diaire.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s mes r\u00e8glements, je ne suis pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9penser plus de $5.00 sans avoir obtenu au pr\u00e9alable votre autorisation. Je puis encore bien moins op\u00e9rer des changements d'institutrices \u00e0 $400.00 par ann\u00e9e, sans vous en pr\u00e9venir. Depuis deux mois, je vous adresse un compte de $4.00 par mois pour une assistante \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital, (d\u00e9pense que vous avez autoris\u00e9e et je n'ai encore re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse.

Both these appointments date from September 1st, 1936, and the new appointees will be allowed the same salary as the previous teachers.\n\nOwing to the late date at which the Department was advised of the two changes at the Bersimis School, it will not be possible to forward the cheques for Sister Marie des Seraphins and Sister St. Marc until the end of October. At that time, a cheque will be issued in favour of each of them for their salary for the months of September and October.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. R. L.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to remind you that in 1931 a third teacher was hired for the Bersimis school. This class was to be attended by Canadians who pay part of the salary of the teacher, and 2 more advanced Indians. This year, the older Indians have left the class and have begun hunting with their fathers. The three more advanced are in the third year only.\n\nThis class, this year, is attended solely by Canadian children numbering 25.\n\nI do not think that the Indians will derive any benefit from this class before three years, namely before the pupils who are presently in their third year are in a position to take their 5th year.\n\nI wish to bring this situation to your attention in order that I should not be blamed for the expenditure of $200. per annum paid by the Department of Indian Affairs for a class which is of no benefit to the Indians and which is attended only by Canadians. Naturally the Canadians and myself will be very pleased if you see fit to continue paying this amount.\n\nWhatever your decision may be, whether you deduct part of this teacher's salary, $20.00 per month as from January, or that you drop the class altogether at the end of the year, I should like to be notified as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Dr. E. Lavall\u00e9e,\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 11th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo, it has been decided to discontinue, from December 31st, 1936, the allowance of $200.00 a year for the third teacher at the Bersimis Indian Day School. You should so inform the Reverend Sisters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. E. Lavallee,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nBersimis, February the 11th, 1937\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs school inspector of all the White Children schools in our mission's limits, Bersimis Reserve's White Canadian class included, I have been advised lately by Rev. Sister Superior of Bersimis Convent, Sister Ste-Jeanne, that Sister St-Marc teaching our Canadian students has not received her usual monthly cheque of twenty dollars for the month of January, whilst the other two Sisters have received theirs. Could it be possible that Doctor Lavall\u00e9e, Agent of our Reserve, had written to the Department and asked you to cut that auxiliary fund of twenty dollars a month for the said teacher on some ground or other? I have reasons to suppose he did. But what I can't understand, is it really the fact, is that the Department should have cut that auxiliary fund right in the middle of a school year and without giving any notice to Sister Superior of the Convent... A few years ago, in 1932, Sister Marie du Carmel, then Superior of Bersimis Convent school, had requested that a grant of two hundred dollars be provided towards the salary of a third teacher at the Bersimis Indian School; and the said sum was granted and paid until last January; but that was only part of the teacher's salary; the other part being paid by the few White families living on the Reserve. At the time the said sum was granted, there were three students in the said class whose mother was a squaw; two of those students are still going to that same class. Moreover, it was also supposed that the Department had granted the said fund on the ground that in the future instead of sending Bersimis Indian pupils to convent schools in Rimouski, like it was already done in the past, those pupils could join that third class if they kept on going to school long enough to reach the higher divisions, at least the fifth and sixth Grade. But so far none of them, except the half-breed students above mentioned, have been able to go further than the third Grade; when they reach there, they generally quit school....\n\nNevertheless I beg the Department to continue in the future to pay that third teacher the usual auxiliary fund of twenty dollars a month. Otherwise, as the White families are very few on the Reserve and some of them not very rich and thus can't very well afford to pay a teacher's total salary, we'll have to close that third class; and probably send the sister, teacher of the said class, back to Chicoutimi, and distribute all the white pupils (twenty-six in all, if I am not mistaken) between the other two classes, like it used to be before that third class was opened; but let me tell you, the two classes will soon be crowded, on account of the white students being three or four times more numerous now than in the past years before 1932.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nReverend Father Denis Doucet\n\"P. E. M.- P.P.\"\nSuperior of The Benedict Fathers of Bersimis\nSaguenay Co.\nP. Q.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nThe extra allowance of $200 a year for the third classroom was made at a time when there were some Indian children available to attend this class. However, information recently received indicates that, at the present time, there are no Indian children who could take advantage of the advanced class and, consequently, the extra allowance was cancelled from December 31st, last.\n\nMay I point out that our appropriation is intended to provide educational facilities for Indian children only. We are not responsible for the education of either white children or half-breeds. Consequently, if the parents of the white children are unable to provide the salary of a teacher, the matter should be taken up with the authorities of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIt is not our intention to have the two classrooms at present in the school over-crowded due to the presence of white children. As pointed out above, our responsibility is for the Indian children and white parents will have to make other arrangements for the education of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Denis Doucet, P.E.M.,\nSuperior,\nBaptist Fathers of Bersimis,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of a letter, dated the 11th instant, received from Reverend Father Denis Doucet, Superior of the Benedictine Fathers of Bersimis, also a copy of our reply to him.\n\nIn your letter of November 30th, last, you stated that, during the next three years, no Indian children would be available for the highest class; consequently, you were informed in official letter of the 11th of December, last, that the Department would no longer allow the extra grant of $200.00 a year for the third teacher.\n\nYou will note the contents of our letter to Reverend Father Doucet. Our appropriation is provided for the education of Indian children only and, consequently, the teachers should not allow the classrooms to become overcrowded due to the attendance of white children. Their parents will have to make provision for their education as we would be severely criticized by the Auditor General if we expended any of the appropriation for the education of Indian children in the education of white children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

It is true that the Agent tells me that this cheque will no longer be forthcoming, but I do not wish to believe this because it is hard for me to understand how you could cut off a school teacher's salary without warning in the middle of the school term.\n\nI trust you will promptly forward a satisfactory explanation of this, and remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.)

The Department being unreasonable for the education of the White children, as you say, and no Indian children attending at this time that third class, I understand you have good reasons for acting thus and I have to comply with. We shall have to deal the matter with the Provincial Department of Education, as you advise in your letter. May I ask you, however, in case we should be able to find the necessary funds some way or other to provide for the salary of a third teacher for the education of the White children of the Bersimis Reserve.\u2014If the Department would be kind enough to let the said teacher and her pupils occupy the third class-room in the Bersimis Day School in which a third class has been held for the past few years; as the teacher will most probably be a Sister, and the said room probably be otherwise vacant, at least as long as the Department doesn't decide to open a third class-room for the education of the Indian children. I would be greatly thankful to the Department for such favor; as I don't see where we could find elsewhere in Bersimis a place which we could use as class-room.\n\nA favorable answer would be greatly appreciated by all the White people of the Reserve, including the Sisters, and specially myself, acting as school inspector of all the White Day Schools in the limits of our Bersimis mission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDenis Doucet  \n\"Superior\"  \nThe Benedict Fathers of Bersimis  \nBersimis, P.Q.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter recently received from Reverend Denis Doucet, also a copy of our reply, with reference to the third classroom at the Bersimis Indian Day School.

Hoey, Esq.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nWe were surprised to receive your letter of the 13th ultimo, and, in reply, I must say that there is a classroom for French-Canadian children, 19 in number, and who are in the 9th grade. They are the children of your employees living on the Reserve. This class is maintained by the parents who must pay $1.00 per child every three months. This amount is used to pay the teacher's salary, and it is very small, the missionary, who is also the school inspector, takes it upon himself to secure the balance from charitable people, which is not very easy. No contribution is made by the Department of Education of the province.\n\nIn regard to the amount of coal used by our school, this is due to the fact that the building is very cold, the openings are very drafty. If this room was not used for white children, it would have to be heated just the same, and it would be impossible to leave it unused. The parents of these children are unable to pay even a small share of the cost of fuel.\n\nHeating is carefully done and with the greatest possible economy. I suppose that the whole amount spent is not charged to our school, for, as you are aware, the fuel is used for three houses.\n\nTrusting that these explanations will be found satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Sister Marie de St. Octave,\nR.B.C., Principal,\nDirector of Indian Classes.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in connection with the quantity of coal supplied at Bersimis.\n\nI note from the first part of your letter that you state -- \"There is a class room for French-Canadian children, 19 in number, and who are in the 9th grade. They are the children of your employees living on the Reserve.\"\n\nI would appreciate your stating the name of each employee whose children attend the school, also the number of children each employee has.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter you state that the fuel is used for three houses. Would you please state exactly what houses you mean.\n\nFor your information I may say that the Department yearly purchases the following quantities of fuel:\n\n40 Tons of coal for the Bersimis school\n20 \" for the building used as an old people's home and sometimes referred to as a \"Hospital\"\n15 Tons for the Agency\n\nIn addition to the above quantities of coal a considerable quantity of wood is purchased each year.

This would involve closing the school at the end of June next. It could be re-opened as a seasonal school on May 15, 1941, and operated for a period of four months.

Due to the large quantity of coal required to heat the building the operation of the Bersimis Indian Day School is quite expensive. Consequently it has been decided to close this school at the end of June, 1940, and you should so advise the Rev. Sisters immediately.\n\nAs this action is being taken it will not be necessary to purchase the quantities of wood and coal for which requisitions have been forwarded. However, this matter will be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nThe Department would like to operate a seasonal school at Bersimis. Consequently you should ascertain from the Rev. Sisters if they are prepared to supply teaching services for a period of four months during the summer of 1941. We are prepared to keep this school open from May 15 to September 15, 1941, during which time I understand the majority of the children will be living in close proximity to the school.\n\nIt is realized that the Rev. Sisters have done good work at Bersimis, but, as stated above, our reduced appropriation will not permit, at the present time, the operation of schools that have been kept open in normal times.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. W.

She says that she could not decide before being informed on the two following points:\n\n1. Shall the class for white children be kept open all the academic year long or a period of four months only? Although this has nothing to do with the Indian class, I have replied that, as the building was not to be heated, the possibility of keeping this class open could not be questioned.\n\n2. In case of an engagement for a period of four months in 1941, is any compensation for trips, etc., to be expected from the Department? To this I replied that I was in no way prepared to make such a promise.\n\nAs I am anticipating an endless correspondence about this question, I beg to suggest that nothing be done now towards an engagement of teachers for the projected seasonal school at Bersimis. As I am to make a trip to Escoumain shortly to hold an election for a chief, I might with your permission inquire about getting the services of Les Soeurs Franciscaines who are doing good work at Escoumain. The fact for this Order to belong to the county of Saguenay would render the communications easier and less expensive.

I will write about this question in a separate letter shortly.\n\nDr. W. Barolet,\nIndian Agent.\nTranslation\n\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE OF CANADA\n\nOttawa, July 31, 1940\n\nMy Dear Colleague,\n\nI am just informed by His Excellency Bishop N.A. Labrie, Apostolic Vicar of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that the Department of Indian Affairs had decided to close the school of the Betsiamites Indian Reserve during the winter season on the plea of economy.\n\nI do not know if this matter of economy is the real reason for the decision, but I wish to protest energetically against any attempt on the part of the authorities of the Department to limit to the summer season the educational means for the inhabitants of that locality.\n\nThe white people of the reserve will be greatly affected by this action, and I may add that even Indians will suffer very much. I perfectly understand that they cannot all attend the school in winter, but on the other hand the number who is taking advantage is large enough to warrant the complete maintenance of this school during the whole school year.\n\nYou will agree with me that there should be more serious circumstances than those we are suffering just now to deprive in such a way these people from the educational means they are enjoying.\n\nI would ask you therefore, to give your personal attention to this important matter and I know that you will not allow this decision to be carried out, especially during a time when the most perfect harmony and complete co-operation are so needed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHon.

Mr. Casgrain, Secretary of State, advising that he has been informed by Bishop Labrie, Apostolic Vicar of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that the department has decided to close the school of the Betsiamites Indian reserve during the winter season for reasons of economy. I understand this is the school at Bersimis.\n\nNote specially Mr. Casgrain's protest quote: \"against any attempt on the part of the authorities of the Department to limit to the summer season the educational means for the inhabitants of that locality\", and his pointing out that both the white people of the reserve and the Indians will be greatly affected by the proposed action.\n\nWe have nothing on file to indicate that such action is proposed. Will you please, therefore, furnish a report, and also let the Minister have a draft reply to Mr. Casgrain's letter.\n\nEncl. Letter, & translation-- (you may retain)\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply and report.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum enclosing letter received by the Minister from the Honourable Mr. Casgrain, Secretary of State, with reference to the closing of the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of May 13 last recommending the closing of this school on June 30, 1940, and its operation as a seasonal school during 1941. This action was approved by the Minister.\n\nThe reasons for recommending closing this school were contained in the memorandum mentioned above and I am still of the opinion that the action taken will not adversely affect the Indians and at the same time a considerable saving will be effected.\n\nMr. Casgrain's statement that the white people will be greatly affected no doubt refers to the use made by the white people of one of the rooms in the Bersimis School. This is a very large building and it was brought to our attention that one of the rooms not required for Indian children was being used as a white school. On making inquiries it was found that without receiving any authority from this Branch the Reverend Sisters in charge of this school had, at the request of a number of white people,\nopened a room for white children only. Those attending this white school were:\n\n1 Child of Dr. W. Barolet, Indian Agent\n4 Children of Mr. A. E. Desjardins, Telegraph Operator\n3 \" \" Mr. J.E. Therriault,\n2 \" \" Mr. Jos. Gagnon, Postmaster\n1 Child of Mr. Joseph Miller, Merchant\n2 Children of Mr. G. Bherer, Manager Mr. Couturier's store\n5 \" \" Mr. Edmond Doucet, Farmer\n1 Child of Mr. N. Rivard, Watchman for the Laviolette Co.\n\nThe parents of the white children paid the salary of the teacher but they were using a room in our school without making any allowance for heating it. The closing of the school will, of course, necessitate the white people making other arrangements but the education of these white children is not the responsibility of this Department.\n\nBefore preparing a draft reply to Mr. Casgrain I thought it advisable to place the above information before you.\n\nPP\n\nDirector.\nBersimis, Que. August 3rd, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to securing teachers for a seasonal school at Bersimis, in 1941, I beg to inform you that I have not as yet obtained a definite answer from Les Soeurs du Bon Conseil, of Chicoutimi, about their terms.\n\nIn spite of the school being closed the building, nevertheless, has to be heated on account of the lighting plant being installed in this building to prevent the batteries from freezing. Moreover, the hospital building gets its supply of water through a pump also installed in the school building. To keep the school building unheated would require a change in the installation of the lighting system and the water pump which could be done only at great expense. I, therefore, beg to suggest that the Department reconsider its decision and that the school reopen October 1st next until the end of June, 1941.\n\nI am pretty sure to be able to get two teachers for a total amount of $700.00 for an academic year of nine months, thus saving $400.00 per annum, which would make up for the expense of the coal and wood.\n\nIt would be a very regrettable and sad thing to deprive the young Indians of the elementary principles of education; no effort, I believe, should be spared towards favouring the Indians with this privilege.\n\nI beg to request that the school be kept open for nine months to begin October 1st, this fall, and that I be authorized to get two teachers at the above terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet, M.D.)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the closing of the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know the size of the room in which the water pump and batteries are installed. Are they in the same room?\n\nI cannot understand from your letter why it is necessary to heat the whole building simply to keep the water pump and batteries from freezing. It would appear that if the room in which they are located were heated there would be no damage to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. W. Barolet,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nBersimis, Que. August 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with regard to the closing of the Bersimis Indian Day School and to state, in reply, that the water pump and batteries are installed in the same room the size of which is only 8 x 11 1/2 ft leaving hardly enough space for a man to move around the motor and water pump. The water tank of a capacity of about two tons, though, is installed in an adjacent room of a much larger size.\n\nAs gasoline is used to bring the motor into action, ordinary fuel cannot be used to heat the battery room. The adjacent room also has to be heated, otherwise, the water would freeze in the tank. Electricity only could be used safely to heat these rooms; this would mean heavy expenses without removing later expenses for coal and wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet, M.D.)\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant in which you submit, for Departmental consideration, additional information in respect to the heating of the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the correspondence that has already taken place in respect to the operation of this school I feel that I should explain to you more fully just why it was decided to operate this school only during the summer months. About two years ago a requisition was sent forward to the office of the Minister for 35 tons of anthracite coal and 15 cords of birch wood for the heating of this school. The Chief Executive Assistant asked for the enrolment at that date and learned that the group of pupils in attendance was comparatively small -- so small that they could be accommodated in two ordinary class rooms. He expressed the opinion at that time that the heating costs were out of all proportion to the actual enrolment and passed the requisition on the understanding that additional information would be secured with respect to the school, the heating of the building and the general operation of the school itself. When this information was finally secured it was decided to operate the school only during the summer months and you were notified to this effect.\n\nI may state that no provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the heating of the Bersimis School. In view of this fact it is simply a waste of time for you to communicate with the Department\n\nDr. W. Barolet,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nasking that the matter be reconsidered. I am anxious, therefore, that you should take immediate steps to make provision for the care of the batteries now at the school. Would it be possible to have these batteries dismantled and stored in a building other than the school? I am anxious to know, also, if it is necessary to keep the water tank in operation simply to supply the hospital. Mr. Thibault, with whom I have discussed this matter, suggests that it might be possible to release the water now in the tank and to have a small Quebec heater installed for the purpose of heating the room for the batteries. If this could be arranged at comparatively little cost it would enable the lighting system to remain in operation and thus enable the hospital and the Agent's house to have the use of the lighting plant.\n\nYou might, in your reply, let me know if it is the intention of the white residents of the district to use the particular room in the school building that they have been making use of in recent years. If it is their intention to use this room some arrangement might be entered into with them whereby they would pay the heating costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBersimis, Que. August 26th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in respect to the heating of the Bersimis Indian Day School and to state, in reply, that to install a Quebec or any other heater in the room containing the batteries cannot be questioned on account of the motor being operated with gasoline; the greatest care in the manipulation would not avoid the flame of any fire to come into contact with gas fumes and this would certainly be liable to cause explosion.\n\nI am confident, though, that with a special and constant attention in view to always keeping the batteries in a charged condition and the electrolyte at a specific gravity of around 1.230 I can arrange as to prevent the batteries from freezing.\n\nAs to the tank installed in the school building, I could do without it by installing a forcing pump in the hospital building and connecting with the pipe running from the well; the lining of the tank in the hospital building has to be repaired as it is leaking. This new installation would incur an expenditure of about $35.00 including labour and material. I, therefore, beg to request that I be authorized to make that change.\n\nAbout the white residents of Bersimis using a room in the school building as formerly, I talked the matter over with Father Doucet, Missionary, he said that he and the white residents would be very pleased to have that permission and they are quite willing to heat the room at their own costs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J. Barlow,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 26 and to thank you for the information contained therein. It is noted that certain repairs are necessary to the lining of the tank in the hospital building at the Bersimis Indian Day School and that the expense involved will not exceed the sum of $35.00.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the expenditure of this amount is approved.\n\nIt is noted that the White residents are prepared to pay the heating costs necessary for the instruction of a group of White pupils at the Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Wilfrid Barolet,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nBersimis, Que. January 18th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to the seasonal school which is to open at Bersimis, May 15th, for a period of four months, I beg to inform you that I have not as yet received a definite reply from Les Soeurs du Bon Conseil, of Chicoutimi, Que., about getting their services for that short period.\n\nBefore writing anew to the Sisters I would like to obtain information as to the salary which the Department is prepared to pay and also as to the possibility of getting lay teachers in the event of not obtaining the services of Sisters. At present, Father Doucet, missionary, is employing a lay teacher for the white residents and her services appear to be very satisfactory.\n\nAs a few schools have been closed this year for lack of funds, I presume that we could get two lay teachers at $60.00 each per month with the understanding that they could use the school building for their residence.\n\nI beg to request that I be authorized to engage two teachers for a period of four months, May 15th to Sept. 15th, 1941, at a total cost not exceeding $500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet, M.D.)\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R.A.

Their reply should be forwarded for our information.\n\nIf the Rev. Sisters are not willing to staff this school further consideration will be given to your suggestion regarding the employment of lay teachers.\n\nYou mention May 15 to September 15 as the term during which this school should be operated. I presume it will not be necessary to heat the building during that period.\n\nIn replying you might let me know what expenses, other than teachers' salaries, would be incurred in operating this school for a four-month period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. W.

A separate report will follow.\n\nWilfrid Barolet,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nLeDevoir, Montreal, September 8, 1941.\n\nUnknown Tragedy\n\nUnknown by most people, in any case.\n\nThe matter has to do with the lot of the Indians of Betsiamites, on the North Shore. And it is a contributor to the Progres du Saguenay, of Chicoutimi, who reveals to us, in a quite recent travel narrative, this sad adventure.\n\nIt is painful, he states (PROGRES of September 4) to note the miserable condition of the Indian village of Betsiamites, and it is all the more painful since everything is still redolent of the prosperity that reigned there a few years ago. Spacious and trim houses in design, but in a state of delapidation, some closed, others bearing the scars of age and the lack of upkeep; sidewalks half-rotted; fallen or shaky fences, flower-beds in a state of abandon, where a few flowers still stubbornly survive amidst weeds and undergrowth. Even the public buildings bear the imprint of this increasing desolation. The presbytery reminds one of a kind of elegance in tatters whose former splendor only survives in its appearance and the cordial hospitality and cleanliness of its interior. The hospital is pitiful to see. The Indian school, though of recent construction, suffers from the want of needed repairs and would be a ruin were it not for the wonders worked in the care the sisters of the Bon Conseil know how to bestow upon it.\n\nThis misery is reflected too in the dress and demeanor of the Indians. Twenty years ago, we are told, the Papisnachois, of Betsiamits, constituted the smartest portion of the Eastern Indian tribes. Vigorous and proud, with an unfailing good humour, owning a hunting territory that yielded up to $500,000 and even $600,000 in furs; they were prosperous on all counts and it showed in what accounts for the luxurious residences that look pitiful now, that good taste and that discretion which one still finds amongst them in spite of their present poverty. It seems that these poor Indians are virtually dying of hunger. Their country devastated by intruding hunters who have been invading it for the past twenty years, now only yields from $30,000 to $35,000 in pelts; and the scanty allowance the government gives them is insufficient to sustain them properly. Able-bodied hunters are capable of getting along by their own means, but the others, the resident families especially, have nothing to do but the wolf away from the door. As a matter of fact, their population is diminishing at an alarming rate; and it is a great pity, for Canada has more reasons than one to wish for the preservation and prosperity of this fine and interesting tribe which feeds an important commercial enterprise.\n\nThe contributor to the PROGRES states that the people are beginning to entertain some hope in this\nconnection. It is expected that the steps taken by monsignor Labrie, apostolic vicar of the region and former missionary at Betsiamits, will secure good results.\n\nLet us hope so wholeheartedly.\n\nLe Devoir, Montreal, September 8, 1941.\n\nPeculiar Economy\n\nOne knows that, on the pretext that everything must make way before the needs of the war, certain people are ready to practise the oddest economies.\n\n\"...On the pretext of economy, states the contributor to the PROGRES, the Indian children of Betsiamits are deprived of schools. The government (it is the Dominion Government) has just decided as a matter of fact, \"on account of the war\", that their school will be closed as from September 15 and will not operate during the four summer months. Here are the children of a whole population deprived of schooling; the development of a whole generation sacrificed, for a petty saving. It is extremely unfortunate\".\n\nIt is extremely unfortunate, and this decision takes on the complexion of a sinister maliciousness when one remembers that the government finds at the same time the means of paying for a publicity that tells the whole country that Miss X. shews gum, but does it elegantly, that her day's work done she returns to her boarding-house and takes a bath, that she has no fellow in Toronto because the man of her dreams is a policeman in Montreal. (All that, as the Survivance, of Edmonton, recalled it, was forwarded to the newspapers, for publication, by the Federal Information Bureau.\n\nFrankly, there are a certain number of Canadians who, in order that the little Indian children of Betsiamits should have regular classes, would willingly agree to be forever deprived of the precious information on the ways and customs and the sentimental preferences of Miss X.\n\nO.H.\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE OF CANADA\n\nOttawa, September 11, 1941.\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nOn July 31st of last year I wrote you in reference to the closing, during the winter months, of the Bersimis Indian School.\n\nIn your reply of August 15, 1940, you informed me that due to the necessity of making reductions in the estimates of your Department it was thought that a substantial saving could be effected if this school were open only on a four month basis.\n\nAt that particular time, I made known to all persons concerned the decision you had taken. A few days ago, while reading the daily newspaper \"Le Devoir\", of September 6, my attention was drawn to an article written by a person who has acquainted himself with the existing situation at Betsiamites and who expresses his surprise that the authorities responsible for the administration of Indian Affairs are altogether overlooking the welfare of the Indian people at that particular reserve.\n\nI enclose herewith, for your perusal, a translated copy of this article and I would appreciate it very much if you would let me have the benefit of your comments on same.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPierre Casgrain,\nSecretary of State.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBersimis Indian Reserve\n\nre- (a) closing of school during winter months.\n(b) conditions on reserve.\n\nPlease have special note taken of the attached letter from Hon.

HOEY.\n\nBERSIMIS INDIANS\n\nThe Peribonca Beaver and Fur Preserve covers an area of 10,000 square miles, of which slightly more than half is on hunting lands of Bersimis Indians, who will benefit greatly when it comes into production.\n\nThis must be \"the steps taken by Monsignor Labrie\" who was greatly instrumental in having the preserve set aside for the Indians. The money expended, however, and the management comes from our Branch.\n\nFigures quoted for former fur production ($50,000 per year) applies only to a few years when the Indians killed off nearly all the fur-bearers on their hunting grounds because of white encroachment and no records will show a sustained yield of anything more than 1/10 of that figure.\n\nThe quoted figure, $50,000, for present production of furs amounts to $50.00 per year for each married man, which for a person who has no rent to pay, no meat or fish or fuel to buy removes him from any danger of starvation.\n\nReferences in text:\n\nReferences to houses well taken except that closed houses are a sign only that Indians have left for their hunting lands.\n\nSidewalks:- Not half rotten but certainly in need of repair.\n\nFallen fences:- Certainly not the affair of Department.\n\nHospital and School:- Description grossly exaggerated. Care-taking done by Indian caretaker employed by Department.\n\nFlower Gardens:- Only two in the village - Mrs. Barolet's, due to her own industry, very flourishing. The other in front of the church is not the responsibility of the Department.\n\nTheir country devastated by white hunters:- This is substantially correct but local M.L.A. refused to consider our request to extend the Preserve further into his constituency because he did not want to antagonize them.\n\nVirtually dying of hunger:- See 3rd paragraph which presents subsistence level.\n\nResident families:- There are no farms at Bersimis, so the only resident families are those too lazy to hunt.\n\nPopulation diminishing?\nOttawa, September 19, 1941.\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 11 and also copies of two Press articles that appeared in \"Le Devoir\", Montreal, of September 8, 1941, attached thereto.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that the Bersimis Indian Agency had an Indian population of 704 (1924 census) and a population of 689 (1931 census). It will thus be seen that the population has remained practically stationary in recent years.\n\nThe Indians of Bersimis have at this date Trust Funds amounting to $145,444.80 Capital Account and $5,377.21 Interest Account, or a total of $150,822.01. Relief distributed to the Bersimis Indians from these funds during the last fiscal year amounted to $5,698.00. In addition to this, relief covering the same period was distributed from parliamentary appropriation amounting to $3,060.38.\n\nThese Indians are, as you know, engaged almost exclusively in hunting and trapping. The latest report received from the Indian agent indicates that, last year, the earnings for each trapper from this source amounted to $350.00.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that we have recently secured from the Quebec Government an area to be known as the Peribonka Beaver and Fur Preserve. This area consists of 15,600 square miles and at least one half of the area will be assigned to hunting and trapping for the members of the Bersimis Band. Steps have already been taken by the Department\n\nHonourable Pierre Cassain,\nSecretary of State,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor the conservation of wild life on this preserve. Thirty-nine men have been engaged and will be permanently employed in the area as game guardians. This is the first constructive development, aimed at the re-establishment of the Bersimis Indians on a self-supporting basis, that has been undertaken at any time in recent years.\n\nI regret that I cannot at this time state definitely when this area will be re-opened for hunting and trapping. Our field officers estimate that, if there is a normal increase of beaver in the territory, trapping should be permitted at the end of a 6 year period. These officers assure us that the conservation policy of the Government now in force in the Bersimis district should, in the course of a few years, result in raising the average Indian's catch of furs from a value of approximately $250.00 to a fur catch worth at least $1,000.00 per annum.\n\nI note with interest a reference in the newspaper article to a time when this territory yielded $100,000 and even $200,000 in furs. It is just possible that this is a reference to a period when the white trapper invaded the area and to a time when the Indian, alarmed by the white man's encroachment, hastened to trap every fur-bearing animal available, regardless of the future. The unrestricted trapping of furs in those years has been largely responsible for the comparatively small catch and the resulting loss of revenue to the Indians in later years.\n\nThe Bersimis Indians have had for a number of years a lease on certain fishing grounds. These fishing grounds extend from the mouth of the Bersimis river to High Falls - a distance of 40 miles. During the 10 year period 1922-1931 the Indian Affairs Branch paid to the province of Quebec, from Indian band funds, for these fishing rights, $1,500 per year, or a total of $15,000. A new agreement entered into with the Quebec Government in the year 1932 resulted in a reduction of the license fee charged, from $1,500 to $750 per year. This amount has been paid annually during the last 8 years, amounting to a total of $6,750.00.\n\nThe needs -\nThe needs of the hunting and trapping Indians from an educational standpoint have been carefully and sympathetically reviewed from time to time by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who, as you know, work in close cooperation with the church authorities. I am personally disposed to think that we have not yet succeeded in the preparation of a course of study adapted to the needs of these comparatively primitive people. The Department has been subjected, and is still being subjected, to a great deal of criticism for the policy that aims at keeping the children of hunting and trapping Indians in Indian day or residential schools from the time they are 6 until they are 16 years old. This long sojourn in school, we are assured by the critics, results in rendering the Indian youth almost useless as a guide or trapper. It has been recommended from time to time that children be sent to school during the summer months for a period of three or four months and that the male pupils be permitted to accompany their families on the hunting excursions that take place during the fall and winter months. By way of experiment, therefore, we have been operating a number of summer schools, I am glad to state, somewhat successfully, in the northern sections of the Dominion.\n\nThe operation of the Bersimis Indian Day School was carefully reviewed by the officials of the Department, following the receipt of a report from Inspector Jude Thibault, dated October 13, 1928. The Bersimis School had at that time an enrolment of approximately 67 pupils. It was noted by the officials that 40 tons of coal, purchased at the rate of $17.00 per ton, were necessary to heat the school building. This heating cost appeared to be, and still appears to be, out of all proportion to the cost usually borne by the Department for heating Indian day schools. It was noted, also, that the attendance showed a drastic reduction during the winter months and that this reduction was due wholly to the departure of a large number of Indian pupils who accompanied their parents to the hunting grounds. We did not feel that we were justified, in a period as critical as the one in which\nwe find ourselves, in keeping this school in operation during the winter months, in view of the attendance and the amount of fuel necessary to keep the building heated. This decision does not mean, however, that it is our intention to operate the Bersimis School on a 4 months basis indefinitely. The educational needs of the Indian population will come under review from time to time, and if it is considered economically sound to undertake the reconstruction of the building in a manner that would reduce heating costs, there is no reason why the school term should not be gradually extended, provided the attendance from year to year justifies such extension.\n\nI have been informed that the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec will visit Bersimis and undertake a thorough inspection of conditions at the agency, early in October. It is scarcely necessary to add that immediately following the receipt of the Inspector's report, the educational and other needs of the Indian population will again be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note that the Bersimis Indians are at this date comparatively well off and that the Minister has been making a very sincere and earnest attempt to provide them with the hunting grounds necessary to re-establish them on a completely self-supporting basis.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n613 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, September 19, 1941.\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 11 and also copies of two Press articles that appeared in \"Le Devoir\", Montreal, of September 8, 1941, attached thereto.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that the Bersimis Indian Agency had an Indian population of 704 (1934 census) and a population of 682 (1939 census). It will thus be seen that the population has remained practically stationary in recent years.\n\nThe Indians of Bersimis have at this date Trust Funds amounting to $145,444.80 Capital Account and $5,277.71 Interest Account, or a total of $150,722.51. Relief distributed to the Bersimis Indians from these funds during the last fiscal year amounted to $5,688.00. In addition to this, relief covering the same period was distributed from parliamentary appropriation amounting to $3,089.38. These Indians are, as you know, engaged almost exclusively in hunting and trapping. The latest report received from the Indian agent indicates that, last year, the earnings for each trapper from this source amounted to $350.00.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that we have recently secured from the Quebec Government an area to be known as the Peribonka Beaver and Fur Preserve. This area consists of 15,000 square miles and at least one half of the area will be assigned to hunting and trapping for the members of the Bersimis Band. Steps have already been taken by the Department\n\nHonourable Pierre Casgrain,\nSecretary of State,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor the conservation of wild life on this preserve. Thirty-nine men have been engaged and will be permanently employed in the area as game guardians. This is the first constructive development, aimed at the re-establishment of the Bersimis Indians on a self-supporting basis, that has been undertaken at any time in recent years.\n\nI regret that I cannot at this time state definitely when this area will be re-opened for hunting and trapping. Our field officers estimate that, if there is a normal increase of beaver in the territory, trapping should be permitted at the end of a 6 year period. These officers assure me that the conservation policy of the Government now in force in the Bersimis district should, in the course of a few years, result in raising the average Indian's catch of furs from a value of approximately $350.00 to a fur catch worth at least $1,000.00 per annum.\n\nI note with interest a reference in the newspaper article to a time when this territory yielded $500,000 and even $800,000 in furs. It is just possible that this is a reference to a period when the white trapper invaded the area and to a time when the Indian, alarmed by the white man's encroachment, hastened to trap every fur-bearing animal available, regardless of the future. The unrestricted trapping of furs in those years has been largely responsible for the comparatively small catch and the resulting loss of revenue to the Indians in later years.\n\nThe Bersimis Indians have had for a number of years a lease on certain fishing grounds. These fishing grounds extend from the mouth of the Bersimis river to High Falls - a distance of 40 miles. During the 10 year period 1922-1931 the Indian Affairs Branch paid to the province of Quebec, from Indian band funds, for these fishing rights, $1,500 per year, or a total of $15,000. A new agreement, entered into with the Quebec Government in the year 1931, resulted in a reduction of the license fee charged, from $1,500 to $750 per year. This amount has been paid annually during the last 9 years, amounting to a total of $6,750.00.\n\nThe needs -\nThe needs of the hunting and trapping Indians from an educational standpoint have been carefully and sympathetically reviewed from time to time by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who, as you know, work in close cooperation with the church authorities. I am personally disposed to think that we have not yet succeeded in the preparation of a course of study adapted to the needs of these comparatively primitive people. The Department has been subjected, and is still being subjected, to a great deal of criticism for the policy that aims at keeping the children of hunting and trapping Indians in Indian day or residential schools from the time they are 6 until they are 16 years old. This long sojourn in school, we are assured by the critics, results in rendering the Indian youth almost useless as a guide or trapper. It has been recommended from time to time that children be sent to school during the summer months for a period of three or four months and that the male pupils be permitted to accompany their families on the hunting excursions that take place during the fall and winter months. By way of experiment, therefore, we have been operating a number of summer schools, I am glad to state, somewhat successfully, in the northern sections of the Dominion.\n\nThe operation of the Bersimis Indian Day School was carefully reviewed by the officials of the Department, following the receipt of a report from Inspector Jude Thibault, dated October 15, 1929. The Bersimis School had at that time an enrolment of approximately 67 pupils. It was noted by the officials that 40 tons of coal, purchased at the rate of $17.00 per ton, were necessary to heat the school building. This heating cost appeared to be, and still appears to be, out of all proportion to the cost usually borne by the Department for heating Indian day schools. It was noted, also, that the attendance showed a drastic reduction during the winter months and that this reduction was due wholly to the departure of a large number of Indian pupils who accompanied their parents to the hunting grounds. We did not feel that we were justified, in a period as critical as the one in which\nwe find ourselves, in keeping this school in operation during the winter months, in view of the attendance and the amount of fuel necessary to keep the building heated. This decision does not mean, however, that it is our intention to operate the Bersimis School on a 4 months basis indefinitely. The educational needs of the Indian population will come under review from time to time, and if it is considered economically sound to undertake the reconstruction of the building in a manner that would reduce heating costs, there is no reason why the school term should not be gradually extended, provided the attendance from year to year justifies such extension.\n\nI have been informed that the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec will visit Bersimis and undertake a thorough inspection of conditions at the agency, early in October. It is scarcely necessary to add that immediately following the receipt of the Inspector's report, the educational and other needs of the Indian population will again be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe it was a good economy to cut down the school term to four months. If the Sisters are not interested in short school term, they could be replaced by lay teachers. I have learned confidentially of certain things that happened at the school, which I do not care to mention in details, and it might be advisable to have a change in one or two of the past staff.\nBersimis, Que. April 14th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inquire if it is the intention of the Department to open the Bersimis Indian School this year the same as in 1941, i.e., from May 15th to September 15th. If so, may I be authorized to write to the Sisters of Notre-Dame du Bon Conseil, Chicoutimi, Que., advising them to arrange to have two teachers to take charge of the school for that period at the same salary as last year, that is $60.00 a teaching month for the senior teacher and $50.00 a month for the junior teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet)\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. T.R.L.

Mr. Thibault, Inspector of Indian Agencies, reported to us last year, following a visit to Bersimis, as follows:\n\n\"Returning to the matter of school garden, next to the Agency lot, it would be eighty feet long and one hundred and ten feet long; part of the Agency fence could be moved for one end and there would be about two hundred feet of fence to build. The materials required to build the fence or rather, part of it, would be:\n\n- 20 round posts 6\" x 7' procurable on the reserve\n- 30 Pieces spruce 2\" x 4\" x 12'\n- 300 slats \" 3\" x 7/8\" x 4'\n\nwith nails, labour and paint, it should not cost much over $50.00.\"\n\nIt is very important that the children should be taught to cultivate gardens, as otherwise we can hardly expect the older Indians to do so.\n\nDr. W.

Napoleon Labrie, Vicar Apostolic of the Gulf of St. Laurence, interviewed Mr. Hoey and myself this morning with reference to the Bersimis Indian Day School. The Bishop pointed out that a number of the Indian families at Bersimis do not go trapping in the winter and, as a result, there are 30 or 40 children of school age who are not receiving any training. Consequently he strongly urged that arrangements be made to re-open the Bersimis School for the full academic period each year.\n\nMr. Hoey pointed out to the Bishop the reasons for only operating a summer school. One of the very heavy expenditures was the purchase of coal.\n\nAfter discussing the matter fully it was decided to have Mr. Dube, a contractor of Rimouski, make an estimate of the cost of insulating the present Bersimis School in order to conserve the heat and explore the possibility of cutting off part of the building for winter use. This would naturally involve less heating. The Bishop expects that Mr. Dube will be at Bersimis in either April or May and Mr. Hoey promised the Bishop that at that time Inspector Thibault would also go to Bersimis and be with Mr. Dube when he is preparing his estimate of what could be done to make the building habitable for the winter.\n\nThe Bishop also suggested that the Indians should be made responsible for supplying the wood required for heating the building and Mr. Thibault will be instructed to interview them with regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1943.\n\nDr. W. Barolet, Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, you should communicate with the Sisters of Notre Dame du Bon Conseil, Chicoutimi, Que., with a view to arranging for two Sisters to take charge of the seasonal school at Bersimis for the period May 15 to September 15, 1943. Salary will be allowed them at the same rate as last year; namely, $60.00 for one teacher and $50.00 for the other.\n\nIn connection with the operation of this school, I direct your attention to official letter of April 23, 1942, with regard to cultivating a garden at this school. I presume that the garden was cultivated last year because we paid accounts for preparing the ground and fencing it. We do not appear to have received any report regarding produce raised. It is more important than ever that gardens should be cultivated this year. Consequently the Department will look forward with interest to your report regarding this particular activity.\n\nAs soon as you know the names of the Sisters who will be in charge of the school you should advise this office.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBersimis, Que. April 21, 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the school garden at Bersimis I beg to report that the garden was divided into nine sections and the following boys were taught to cultivate:\n\nAlbert Hervieux, - Edouard Hervieux,\nBarthelemy Picard, - Georges Rock,\nHenri Louis Rock, - Jean Louis Bacon,\nNoise Bacon, - Jean Baptiste Vachon,\nFrancois Vachon.\n\nThe work of these boys was quite satisfactory and enabled them to provide their families with a good quantity of vegetables. I intend to have new children trained this year.\n\nThe boys trained last year ought to be able to make a garden at home this year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mais \u00e0 la marche qui suivit les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, je commence \u00e0 perdre mes espoirs. Il serait temps pour nous de le savoir afin d'arr\u00eater notre Mission Sup\u00e9rieure G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de faire nos pr\u00e9paratifs de d\u00e9part ou d'hiver.\n\nJe regrette beaucoup que le compte-rendu de M. l'Inspecteur Thibeault soit \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 comme les apparences nous le font croire. Depuis 15 ans que j'habite la maison, il me semble \u00eatre une place que personne pour appr\u00e9cier les propositions de M. Dub\u00e9, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites devant des t\u00e9moins dignes de consid\u00e9ration et approuv\u00e9es par M. l'inspecteur Thibeault. Et si j'avais un conseil \u00e0 donner aux Messieurs du D\u00e9partement, ce serait de les accepter sans plus tarder. Ce serait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du D\u00e9partement qui fe...\nrait cette d\u00e9pense une fois pour longtemps, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de M. l'agent qui ne serait plus \u00e0 faire de nouvelles r\u00e9clamations et surtout dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de nos pauvres petits indiens qui sont sans classe et sans formation.\n\nM. l'inspecteur Doucet pourrait faire beaucoup moins mais si ce qu'il propose est accept\u00e9 ce n'est pas sans pr\u00e9voir que nous souffrirons du froid plus que jamais que nous accepterons de passer l'hiver. Ce n'est pas une couche de peinture \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur qui emp\u00eachera le froid de passer entre les briques et \u00e0 l'entour des fen\u00eatres o\u00f9 le ciel est tout part.

We should know how what you intend to do in order that we may inform our Sister Superior accordingly or prepare to spend the winter here.\n\nI greatly regret that, as it appears to us, the report made by Inspector Thibault has been set aside. I have been living in this house for 15 years and I should therefore be in a position to judge of Mr. Dub\u00e9's proposals made before witnesses and approved by Inspector Thibault. If I were allowed to advise the departmental authorities, I would ask them to accept those proposals without delay for it would be in the Department's and in the Agent's interests to do so. Moreover, the Agent would cease putting in new claims and, above all, the Indian children, who are without classroom and tuition, would greatly profit by them.\n\nInspector Doucet intends to do much less, but if his proposals are accepted, we may expect to suffer from the cold next winter as never before in case we remain. A coat of paint in the interior would not prevent the cold from entering through the bricks and around the windows where the cement has chipped off. Would it not be possible to repair the outside and wait for better years to decorate the interior?\n\nWe trust that we shall hear from you soon and that you will advise us of our appointment for the current year.\n\nThanking you.....\n\n(Sgd) Soeur Sainte Jeanne r.b.c.,\nSuperior.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1943.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the Bersimis Indian Day School. For your information I may say that it is not our intention to keep this school open during the coming winter. As you were previously advised, salary will be allowed the teachers to September 15, 1943.\n\nThe quotation that we received from Mr. Dube for repairs to the building was much higher than the amount provided in the current year's appropriation. However, we are writing to him again today with a view to making some improvements, if possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSister Sainte Jeanne,\nPrincipal,\nBersimis Indian Day School,\nBetsiamites, Que.\nMy dear Minister,\n\nA few days ago, you must have received a letter from His Excellency Mgr. N.A. Labrie, Havre St-Pierre, regarding the schools at Bersimis.\n\nThe suggestions contained in his letter are so noteworthy that they will, no doubt, receive your best attention. We must see to it that these Indians receive the best of education, so that later on, they will not become a burden to the Government and I am convinced that Mgr. Labrie's suggestions would help very much in reaching this aim.\n\nI hope, therefore, that this request will be granted and wish to thank you in anticipation for your kind co-operation.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nsgd) Frederic Dorion\n\nFrederic Dorion, K.C.,\nMember for Charlevoix-Saguenay.\n\nHonourable Thos.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMonsieur le ministre:\n\nAllow me to write you again on the matter of the Betsiamites Indian school. I had spoken to you about it last year in my last correspondence and I told you that I would bring the matter up again.\n\nRepairs have been made during the course of the summer. They are not as complete as we would have desired but nevertheless they should constitute a considerable saving in fuel economy. Unfortunately this school remained closed all Winter.\n\nReverend Father Sirois, missionary at Betsiamites, reports to me that this winter there remains on the reservation 15 boys and 13 girls of school age. In this province we maintain a school in operation for 8 and sometimes 6 children. I do not see why the Dept. of Indian Affairs would not give the same care to children who are under its protection.\n\nYou might tell me that their brothers who accompany the parents when they go hunting have no school. But the living conditions are not the same. Those who are in the bush forcibly cannot have any school, but they do not have the same occasions of spoiling their education. They are alone with their parents and it is a fact that the Indian parents in bush camps look after their children. They even teach them to read and the rudiments of religion. In the village, unfortunately, they give them less care and the liberty enjoyed by those children often turns to vagrancy. With the facilities of meeting strangers and therefore being corrupted those children do not constitute a moral and intellectual contribution for the reservation, but rather they are agents of corruption for the others when they come back from the forest.\n\nWith a good school which would be permanently open, those children would get better formation and a few\namong them would get a chance of having a happy influence on their fellow-citizens.\n\nWe recognize the successful efforts of your department in the hunting field. But we will not eternally count on hunting to support our Indians, at least not all. The coming industrialization of the region will give them new outlets. Would it not be proper to use vision and to give, by way of schools, our young girls a domestic economy formation and our boys a preparation at an industrial school. Those things are not impossible even for our Indians and I think that your administration must be interested in them as part of the solicitude which you wish to show those Indians. But I affirm particularly that without the school we will not obtain the standard of morality which we also wish and which honours all races.\n\nConsequently, Honourable Minister, I insist with all my strength upon the fact that the nuns who will come back in the Spring, remain at their post all through the coming winter and all the following ones. One nun will be sufficient for the few children who will be at Betsiamites.\n\nWe are not making this request for the children of French nationality. If there is the need of another nun for them, we shall pay her and she will teach school in another place, if you so desire. But it is simply the future (or lot) of our Indians which prompts us to address ourselves to you with confidence.\n\nHoping, honourable Sir, that my request will be received with all the kindness which was shown me last year, when I had the honour of being introduced to you, I assure you of my gratefulness and my sincere devotion.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nN.

I feel it is advisable to have Mr. Doucet proceed to Bersimis, at which time he will not only interview the Bishop, but, if it is decided to make any changes in the building, Mr. Doucet will be in a position to decide what should be done and authorize the repairs.\n\nWe are also having considerable trouble with the sewage at the teachers' residence at Restigouche and, as Mr. Doucet will be as far East as Rimouski when visiting Bersimis, I feel it is advisable to have him go to Restigouche.

I would have liked to meet Mr Doucet, but I fear it will be impossible now, as I am unable to leave this place due to lack of traveling facilities before the end of this month.

HOBY:\n\nRe: Inspection of Restigouche and Bersimis\n\nThe condition of the teacher's residence did not prove to be as serious as anticipated. On checking the main line of the sewage system, I found it to be clear of any serious obstruction. The trouble was in the building itself. The piping from the kitchen sink was not properly installed. There are no clean out traps installed anywhere. I had the Campbellton plumber, Mr. Walsh, inspect this system and I authorized him to proceed with the necessary changes.\n\nI then proceeded to Bersimis.\n\nHaving completed the work on the North shore, I returned to Restigouche to check the completed work. I found the work done according to directions given. If trouble should arise again, the clean outs will permit the plumber to remedy it quickly by means of sewage rods.\n\nThe flooding water in the sewing room is due to surface water. The road is higher than the school, forming a dam. The condition could have been temporarily remedied by means of a small ditch draining into the adjoining yard. Steps have been taken to have this defect permanently remedied. The school yard will be drained through the existing sewer system. This work is not yet completed. No man who could do that type of work was available at the time. I had an interview with Mr. Beaulieu who will do the work at his earliest convenience. It is a matter of connecting a pipe from a small reservoir (2'x2' x 2') to the present sewage system.\n\nBERSIMIS\n\nI have made a complete study of the educational facilities at Bersimis. Approximately 2/3 of the pupils go trapping during the season with their parents. If the school term were from September 1st to June 31st the majority of the children would not be able to attend school. I would recommend that the school term be from March 1st to November 15th. This would permit the pupils who remain at Bersimis during the year to have nine months of school and also permit those who leave to trap to attend during their stay at Bersimis.\n\nOrganized games should be an integrated part of school work not only to improve the health of the children but also to teach them co-operation. Moreover, games will make school more attractive and will tend to increase the attendance.\nVery little change will be necessary to the heating system. The heating coils in the auditorium should be disconnected. Instructions were left with the acting Indian Agent to do this. I would recommend that birch be used as fuel as much as possible, as it is quite plentiful on the north shore and the price, I feel, would be quite reasonable. This could be supplemented with a few tons of coal for the coldest periods. This, I believe, would reduce the cost of heating this school.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed that Reverend Father Sirois of Bersimis was away on his missions. However, on Saturday, July 1st, I met His Lordship Bishop LeBrie in Quebec city. I explained to him that we were ready to introduce a nine month period starting on March 1 and to conclude about the middle of November. He readily saw the purpose of this arrangement and expressed his satisfaction.\n\nI explained to His Lordship the Department's integrated programme of study. He was agreeably surprised. He did not imagine that the Department had evolved such a splendid training for the Indians. I informed him that the Department was ready to introduce adult education such as, sewing clubs, provided the teaching personnel were qualified to conduct this type of work. Material and incidentals would be supplied by the Department. All the Department asks in return is reasonable results in education. In raising Bishop LeBrie expressed the wish that I get in touch with the Mother Superior of the \"Soeurs du Bon Conseil\" at Chicoutimi. He wishes to receive all our literature on education. I believe, His Lordship was quite pleased with the proposed solution of the Bersimis problem.\n\nAt Chicoutimi, I interviewed the Mother Superior of the \"Soeurs du Bon Conseil\" and I discussed with her very frankly the difficulties at Bersimis. She expressed the opinion that a great deal of the difficulties were due to misunderstanding. I suggested that she visit Bersimis and make a thorough study of the conditions at the school. The Department, I explained, is not looking for perfection, but is only seeking improvement from year to year. She will visit Bersimis in September. I explained to her that the Department was prepared to increase the teaching facilities at Bersimis and was prepared to introduce a term from March 1st to the end of November. Before giving me a definite answer to this proposition the Superior wished to consult her advisors. She will notify us as to her decision in the near future.\n\nI wish to express my sincere appreciation for the splendid cooperation I received from all the officials with whom I had to deal during this survey.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

Au d\u00e9but, les enfants \u00e9taient gauches, mais l'attrait du d\u00e9coupage et du dessin leur a fait se mettre \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre avec entrain. Nous trouvons les r\u00e9sultats tr\u00e8s satisfaisants. Ils connaissent maintenant les noms d'une foule de choses qu'ils ont d\u00e9coupe ou dessin\u00e9e, ils le disent et le r\u00e9p\u00e8tent, composent des phrases ou reproduisent les sc\u00e8nes que telle phrase...\nse explique. Nous faisons de la menuiserie, en carton, ils se sont organis\u00e9s un magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui nous ferait gagner, avant de partir, construire chacun une \u00e9chelle de No\u00ebl. Un rival \u00e9tait que nous n'avons jamais pu obtenir, nous avons pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une petite f\u00eate pour le No\u00ebl o\u00f9 tous nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves parlent fran\u00e7ais.\n\nAvec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves je me suis occup\u00e9 de leur r\u00e9ception apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du plus grand nombre. Tout de m\u00eame ils ont eu le temps d'apprendre une trentaine de mots qu'ils lisent au tableau ouvrent et qu'ils \u00e9crivent m\u00eame en dict\u00e9e, le dessin les int\u00e9resse d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup. J'ai achet\u00e9 quelques livres de lecture pour construire leurs mots et apprendre les lettres nouvelles.\n\nActuellement nous avons 3 \u00e9l\u00e8ves inscrits et qui passeront l'hiver ici. Nos classes sont tr\u00e8s confortables au point de vue temp\u00e9rature surtout depuis que j'ai fait poser des tapis sur les fen\u00eatres par en dessous, je crois que la d\u00e9pense de charbon serait diminu\u00e9e de moiti\u00e9.\n\nNous partirons bient\u00f4t en vacances et tout notre temps sera employ\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer des moyens de...\nmulation et de d\u00e9veloppement de nos proc\u00e9d\u00e9s.

Nous passerons nos vacances aux \u00e9coles o\u00f9 nous tenons nos cours et o\u00f9 nous ferons tout ce qui nous semblera utile. Avec la culture nous avons pens\u00e9 que le soin de int\u00e9resserait beaucoup. Nous avons assez de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de la laine et la payent tr\u00e8s cher. Nous pourrions acheter de la laine card\u00e9e et la filerions elles-m\u00eames. Le m\u00e9tier serait peut-\u00eatre d'un grand attrait aussi mais comme cela exige beaucoup de choses je laisse \u00e0 votre discr\u00e9tion.\n\nVous avez parl\u00e9 de machines \u00e0 coudre, faudra-t-il en faire la demande au d\u00e9partement ou si...\npour vous occuper de nous m\u00eame de nous en procurer des m\u00eames pour les choses utiles aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves.

(RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBethsiamits, October 30, 1944.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAt the termination of our school year, I have pleasure in giving you herewith an account of our activities.\n\nAfter having studied together the explanations received regarding your teaching system, Sister began with the older ones on the 11th of July. At first the children were awkward, but the fun of cutting out and drawing put them to work with a will. We find the results very satisfactory. They now know the names of a number of things that they have cut out or drawn, they can read them and write them, compose sentences or make pictures illustrating such sentences. They have done some building, in cardboard; have organized a general store, which would make you smile; before leaving each one will construct a crib for Christmas. And, something we have never been able to achieve: we have prepared a little party for the Parish Priest, at which all the pupils speak French.\n\nI did not start with the tiny tots until September, after the greater number had left. Nevertheless, they have had time to learn about thirty names which they can read on the blackboard and even write from dictation; they are already very much interested in drawing. I bought some sets of letters for word-building and teaching them print.\n\nAt present we have 31 pupils enrolled, who will spend the winter here. Our classrooms are very comfortable, as regards temperature, especially since I had latches put on the outside of the windows. I believe that the expenditure for coal will be cut in half.\n\nWe shall be soon going on vacation and shall spend all our time in working out better methods. We are anxious to talk this over with you before making any definite changes. We should like very much to have a copy of the books of which you have already spoken to us. Even though they were in English, we would thoroughly study your system and could even prepare many useful things for next year.\n\nThat is all for the children; but we shall not neglect the mothers, since it is your wish that we see to them. We shall spend our vacation at household science schools run by our Sisters, where we shall acquire anything that would seem useful. Along with sewing, we thought that spinning would interest them very much. It is fairly difficult for them to get wool and they pay a high price for it. We could buy carded wool and they could spin it themselves. Perhaps they would like weaving very much, but many things are needed for that, so I leave it to your discretion.\nYou mentioned sewing-machines. Will it be necessary to make application to the Department or will you look after getting us some yourself? Likewise in the matter of things useful for the pupils. As requisitions are not sent in till May and we begin in March, what ought we to do? This is one of the reasons why I should like you to visit us at the beginning of our school year.\n\nThe Reverend Father Sirois expressed himself as much delighted with the interview he had with you. I am glad of it, for, in spite of all that we told him, he had his misgivings. It is homesickness ... as you said when you were here, but this long letter will prove that I am cured. I must conclude.\n\nAssuring you of our entire collaboration in your work of education among the Indians, we are, etc.\n\n(sgd.) Les Soeurs de N.-D. du Bon-Conseil per Sister Sainte Jeanne,\nSuperior.\nOttawa, November 9, 1944.\n\nReverend Sister Superior:\n\nI have great pleasure in reading your report on the closing school term. It is gratifying to notice that the children are taking interest and pleasure in school activities.\n\nI am also pleased to notice the enthusiasm which you demonstrate in your work. Your desire to take the extra courses is sufficient proof to that effect. Social welfare is no doubt one of the main problems which we have to face on the reserves.\n\nAs regards the sewing machines, they will be sent as soon as navigation opens in the spring. It might be well for you to send us a requisition at that time. We will also send a spinning wheel. As circumstances justify, we will in time supply you with small looms.\n\nYou might send in the requisition for school supplies any time after the closing of the school, in order that this material may be sent in time for the opening of the new term.\n\nIt is through co-operation that good, lasting work can be accomplished. Co-operation between the teachers, the teachers, school officials and religious authorities. I therefore, thank you for your assurance.\nof co-operation in this difficult work of better education for the Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J.

Sister Sainte Jeanne,\nPrincipal, Indian Day School,\nBethsiamits, Quebec.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received the enclosed letter from Reverend Father Langlois, O.M.I., who, as you know, is in charge of Bethsiamits Mission (Bersimis).\n\nAs the matters complained of can apparently be remedied without much expenditure, I hope that you will be able to attend to them as soon as possible.\n\nIn a previous communication, Father Langlois warns the Government to be on its guard against certain applicants for the position of agent. He claims that the Reserve is large enough to provide work for a full time Agent and hopes that you will be able to appoint one. Doctor Agents or part-time Agents cannot do justice to the work that has to be done.\n\nThe matter of a residential school for this large Reserve should also be taken into immediate consideration. It is true that quite a number of children can attend a day-school but there is a much larger number, if the information which I have is trustworthy, whose parents trap and hunt in the Northern wilderness of Quebec and whose children cannot, therefore, attend a day school regularly.\n\nAccording to the Day-School Census of 1936, which is the last one published, the average attendance at the Bethsiamits school was 38 and the total enrolment 69. The 1944 Census give 97 children of school age for this Reserve. Although this figure seems much smaller than the average children on reserves, as it is less than 1/6th of the total population, it would still leave 2/3rds of those children without any education.\n\n2......\nThese children form part of that large group of over 2,000 Indian children, in the Province of Quebec, who are not even registered in a school, day or residential.\n\nAs I have occasionally stated to you, this situation is causing very adverse comments on the part of our Bishops and Missionaries and is one which you, as Director of the Branch, will wish to have amended.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

On this occasion, the Principal of the school has drawn my attention to the conditions at this school and I thought that it was my duty to let you know the situation which I have verified personally.\n\nThe classroom supplies for which a requisition was sent last September have not arrived. We will, however, try our best to get along for some time with what remains from last year; but this will not suffice and will last only a short time; it would be necessary for the material requisitioned to arrive soon if education is not to suffer.\n\nExterior and interior repairs of a serious nature should be done to the building.\n\nThe water system in the rooms has been out of order for the last five years. Water has to be transported in pails in order that the toilets may be used. Mr. Blouin and his predecessor were notified of this condition but have done nothing to remedy it.\n\nThe plaster from the walls has fallen from a dozen places; the laths are now exposed. In several places the plaster has cracked and threatens to fall.\n\nSince about twenty years the floors have not been repainted nor have the desks been revarnished.\nAt the exterior the humidity and the cold have destroyed the mortar which is falling from between the bricks of the chimney, and even the walls. The chimney could become dangerous if it is not repaired soon. It will be necessary to repoint the joints at several places.\n\nThe wood of the porch is also rotten and should be renewed.\n\nI am sorry to send in these complaints as I know that you are very busy, but as you are soon to give us a new Agent, I thought that I ought to bring this situation to your attention in order to facilitate the work of this Agent and also that it will enable you to bring about a prompt remedy.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) P.

Arrangements will be made to ship these supplies immediately.\n\nIn 1943 we spent an amount of approximately $1,450.00 in making necessary repairs to this school.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of my last visit to Ottawa and the interview which you were good enough to grant me, I mentioned the condition which prevails from the educational point of view among the Montagnais of Seven Islands and told you that, beginning with 1946, the Oblate Fathers, who now have charge of the Bersimis Indians, had also taken the responsibility of evangelizing the Montagnais of this reserve.\n\nThere are, according to the last census, 176 children of school age who are not at the present time receiving any education whatsoever. As the Indians live mostly by trapping, the building of a day-school would not meet the situation as the children would not attend it, due to no fault of theirs but on account of their absolute inability to do so. In other parts of Canada, for Indians similarly situated, your department has constructed and equipped a residential school. This, in my estimation, is the kind of institution which we must have for these Indians if we want them to receive an education which will fit them to take their part later on among our Canadian citizens. I therefore hope that you will give this matter serious consideration and will submit it at the earliest possible moment to the Minister for action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJune 18th 1946.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nDuring the middle of May, I had occasion to visit Ottawa and interview the Director of the Branch of Indian Affairs, regarding the education and welfare of the Indians of Bersimis and Seven Islands, who have been confided to the missionary care of the Reverend Oblate Fathers by his Excellency Mgr Labrie, of Havre St-Pierre, P.Q.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. Hoey that the Indians of Seven Islands had no school facilities whatsoever and that their number was close to 700. I further remarked that although there is a seasonal school for the Indians of Bersimis, only 53 of them are enrolled. The Indians of this latter reserve are trappers and loggers and living the year round, except for a very short time during the summer, away from the Bersimis village and therefore the school.\n\nThe only method, in my estimation, of educating these children would be the residential school and I have written to Mr. Hoey in that sense. I do hope, dear Sir, that when this question is placed before you for your consideration, you will act favourably upon it. May I mention that the Indians of Quebec have been very sadly neglected in matters of education, by the Department and that you will wish, I have no doubt, to correct the situation. It is rather sad to have to admit that over two-thirds of the Indians of that province are without education facilities.\n\nI, therefore, hope that this matter will receive your serious attention and favourable consideration.\n\nVery truly yours\n\n(Sgd.)

On that date the school will close for two months and will re-open on October 15, 1946. No salary should be paid to the teachers during the two month period the school is closed.\n\nI will advise you later regarding the names of the teachers who will be in charge of the school for the period October 15, 1946, to August 15, 1947.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Bersimis Day School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIt is the intention of Reverend Father Paul Langlois, superior and director of the Bersimis Indian Mission, on the Bersimis Reservation, to adopt the ten month teaching period, for the Indian school. It is also his ambition to bring this school up to the highest standard possible, under existing conditions.\n\nWould it not be possible to pay the principal and her assistant, the ordinary salaries of the Indian Department? This would be an inducement for the community in charge of the school, to send to Bersimis teachers with better qualifications. I think that the salary of $100.00 per month for the principal and $90.00 for her assistant would be acceptable, at least for the present time.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.C. Plourde, O.M.I.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Paul Langlois, principal of the Bersimis School, has written to Mr. Hoey requesting the establishment on the reserve of a residential school for such children who are not able to attend the day school. These number, I am told, well over 100.\n\nIn his answer, Mr. Hoey states that \"It is his understanding that the Minister is communicating with Father Langlois, in respect to the educational needs of the Indian population of Bersimis and suggests that an educational survey be undertaken in the district, at an early date.\"\n\nIt is to be hoped that this survey will be started immediately, as Bersimis is not very accessible during the Winter months. In any case, if the Minister desires the necessary funds to be provided in the 1947-1948 estimates, this survey should be done immediately.\n\nWill you please take this up again with Mr. Hoey and let me know, at your earliest convenience, the result of your interview.\n\nFor your information and that of Mr. Hoey, I might add that Bishop Labrie has written the Minister about this matter and is very anxious that something be done immediately.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 17, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, we will allow salary at the rate of $100.00 a month for the Principal and $90.00 a month for her assistant at the Bersimis Indian Day School, effective October 15, 1946. It is understood that qualified teachers will be sent to the Bersimis School.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited Bersimis recently it was agreed by those interested that in future the Bersimis School would operate on a 10 month basis. It was also decided that the seasonal school at present in operation would close on August 15, 1946, as following this date many of the Indians leave the reserve. The regular academic year, in future, will therefore extend from October 15 to the subsequent August 15.\n\nPlease advise Reverend Paul Langlois, O.M.I., regarding the above and arrange with him to let us know the names of the teachers as soon as they begin duties in October.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 17, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Bersimis Reserve\n\nPlease note Reverend Father Plourde's letter of July 10, in further reference to the request for the establishment of an Indian residential school on the above reserve.\n\nIf a residential school were established, it would probably draw its pupils from the following places:\n\n| Number of Children 7 to 16 |\n|---------------------------|\n| 1944 Census               |\n| Bersimis                  | 99 |\n| Escoumins                 | 10 |\n| Seven Islands             | 176 |\n\nAt the present time we are operating a two-room school at Bersimis with an approximate enrolment of 80 in the summer time and 55 in the winter. We have no school at the other two places mentioned above.\n\nIt is also possible that there might be requests for admission of children to a residential school from the Pointe Bleue Agency. The 1944 census shows 179 children between 7 and 16 years of age. We have a two-room school on this reserve with an approximate enrolment of 70.\n\nBernard F.

Allison Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI am informed that the Indians of the Bersimis reservation have signed and forwarded to you a petition asking for the immediate construction of an Indian residential school and hospital.\n\nAs the welfare of these Indians would greatly benefit by these two institutions, I hope that you will find it possible to accede to their rightful wishes.\n\nYou must be aware that there is much to be accomplished for our Indians of Quebec, mostly for those of this North Shore of the St. Lawrence. What is the cause of this present neglect? I may well answer this question by accusing myself of not asking enough. But presently, I confess that, in a country like Canada, such conditions should not exist. It is time for us all to bring together all our good will and try to improve the living standard for these poor people.\n\nMay I recall to your attention that all the Indians in this county of Saguenay are Catholic. I would suggest, therefore, that should these institutions be granted, they be placed in charge of Catholic teachers and nurses. A religious congregation for the school and hospital would be the ideal solution of the problem.\n\nHoping to hear favourably from you regarding this important matter, I remain, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Mgr.

It will be necessary to conduct a survey of the educational needs of these Indians to ascertain how best we can improve their present training. It is hoped that this survey can be carried out during the winter of 1946-47. I feel certain that this educational survey officer will be able to call on you and your missionaries for any assistance and information which he may require.\n\nI am informed by the Acting Superintendent of Indian Health Services that it is intended to construct a nursing station at Beraimis in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend N.A.

Que.\n\nJuly 18th, 1946.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 26th, written by Mr. James A. MacKinnon, acting Minister and I apologize for not having answered sooner.\n\nIn Mr. MacKinnon's reply, it is said and I quote:\n\n\"There seems to be a wide-spread belief on the part of the general public and of the Indians themselves that the Indian day schools equipped for vocational instruction are on the whole more satisfactory and more efficient than residential schools\".\n\nMay I be permitted to ask: can general public be taken as judge in such a particular case? General public does not know much of the Indian, his real life, his way of thinking, his mentality and his true needs. So how can one judge of a thing that he does not know sufficiently, but only from a few appearances?\n\nThere are so many things to consider in the necessity of establishing a boarding school for the Indians; to give a sound judgment general public would have to know whether the Indians would get more advantage physically intellectually and morally from a day school than from a residential school. I do not think general public can know that sufficiently.\n\nEven the Indians themselves very often cannot judge of the thing for the same reason. Also I would add this other reason. I have not at all the intention of depreciating them by saying so; but the facts show that they have a good or bad opinion of a thing from the good or bad impression they have of it, at that moment; it depends on how they are impressed then. In the case of the residential school, it requires from them some sacrifices, and especially that of going into the bush and leaving their children into the school. So this sacrifice will influence very much sometimes their opinion about the residential school.\nAs for the vocational instruction in the day school, I cannot see why the residential school could not be equipped for such purpose as well as a day school; so with the benefit of the boarding school, the children would get that of the vocational training.\n\nAs Missionary I have been with the Indians for 17 years; I have spent seven years as principal of the Albany Residential School, in James Bay. Here, there is only a day school. I had seen the difference of both kinds of school in the Bay and I notice the same thing here: there is, for the Indian, much more advantages physically, intellectually and morally in the residential school than in the day school.\n\nI, therefore, hope that this matter will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) P.

Doucet, inspecteur\nOttawa.\n\nCher monsieur Doucet,\n\nJ'accuse r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 12 juillet dernier et vous en remercie beaucoup. Il ne m'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de vous r\u00e9pondre plus t\u00f4t, car j'attendais une seconde r\u00e9ponse de son Excellence Mgr Labrie; et ce n'est que vendredi dernier qu'elle m'est parvenue.\n\nEn effet, vendredi dernier j'apprenais que son Excellence \u00e9tait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et devait se remettre le lendemain matin; alors je pris un taxi pour aller la rencontrer. Il m'avait d'abord r\u00e9pondu par t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme qu'il acceptait les changements propos\u00e9s dans ma lettre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, mais sa lettre ne comportait pas les changements que vous m'aviez sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s. J'essayai de le rejoindre de nouveau par t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme afin d'\u00eatre plus certain de son accentuation nouvelle, quoique j'\u00e9tais tout \u00e0 fait port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu'il ne changerait pas d'id\u00e9e et persisterait dans les m\u00eames dispositions.\n\nIl est tout \u00e0 fait satisfait du dernier changement, c'est-\u00e0-dire que les mois de vacances soient de deux, allant du 15 ao\u00fbt au 15 octobre, comme nous avions d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Ainsi tout le monde est satisfait de ce changement. Ce sera donc entendu n'est-ce-pas, que le 15 ao\u00fbt prochain les enfants entreront en vacances. \u00c7a leur permettra d'aller aux beaux jours sans manquer la classe.\n\nJe vous remercie des recherches que vous avez faites pour obtenir une bo\u00eete pour toilette. Nous allons attendre.\n\nVous m'avez promis de nous envoyer un fusil pour remplir les joints de briques et des formes l\u00e0 o\u00f9 besoin se fait sentir. ainsi que 5 ou 6 ballots de ciment gris pour cela. Nous n'avons rien re\u00e7u encore; est-ce perdu ou oubli\u00e9? Ce serait dommage que nous n'en ayons pas; si les joints \u00e9taient repass\u00e9s d\u00e8s maintenant, ce serait une bonne \u00e9ponge de charbon pour l'hiver. Les 25 tonnes de charbon ne sont pas encore arriv\u00e9es, non plus.\n\nNous ferons le travail de tuyauterie demand\u00e9 d\u00e8s le mois prochain; actuellement, notre homme est seul.\n\nBien votre en N.S. et M.I.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doucet, Inspector,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 12 last, for which I thank you. I could not reply sooner because I was expecting a second reply from His Excellency Mgr Labrie, which reached me Friday last only.\n\nI learned, last Friday, that His Excellency was at Baie Comeau and was to leave the next morning; I therefore took a taxi to go to interview him. He had first answered by telegram that he had accepted the changes proposed in my preceding letter, but as he did not propose the changes suggested by you, I tried to communicate with him again by telegram in order to be assured of his new acceptance although I was led to believe that he was not to change his mind and that he would abide by his decision.\n\nHe is well pleased with the last change, that is that the pupils be granted two months holidays, from August 15 to October 15, as we had decided, and everybody is satisfied. It is therefore understood that the children will leave for their vacation on August 15 next. This will allow them to go picking blueberries without being absent from school.\n\nI thank you for the investigation you have made in order to get a toilet box. We shall wait.\n\nYou had promised to send us a gun to fill the joints between the bricks and around the windows where it is needed, as well as five or six gallons of gray cement. We have received nothing yet; was it lost or forgotten? It would be too bad if the joints were not filled now because this work would mean saving of coal next Winter. The twenty-five tons of coal have not yet arrived.\n\nWe will have performed the plumbing work requested, next month; our man is alone presently.\n\nFather Langlois, O.M.I.\nOttawa, October 12, 1946.\n\nA.E. Desjardins, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\n\nSister Ste.Jeanne\nSister Ste.Francois de Sales\nBersimis Indian Day School.\n\nIt is regretted that through an error, salary cheques issued in favour of the above-named teachers August 31st, were in payment for the whole month of August instead of from August 1st to 15th only. Sister Ste.Jeanne is overpaid $30.97 and Sister Ste.Francois de Sales is overpaid $25.81. Would you kindly obtain a refund of $30.97 from Sister Ste.Jeanne and return it to this office at your earliest convenience? We are requesting Central Pay Office to deduct $25.81 from Sister Ste.Francois de Sales October salary in order to adjust the overpayment in her case.\n\nL.W.

Glen,\nMinister of Mines\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI beg to express my thanks for the kindness you showed me on the occasion of my visit. I came back with a greater confidence for the welfare and education of our Indians.\n\nMay I be permitted to recall to your memory the object of this visit? It is a fact that our North Shore Indians have been neglected for many years. Their education very scant attention.\n\nI insist again upon the necessity of a residential school in Seven Islands and, later on in Betsiamits.\n\nWe must take for granted that conditions of life have changed for Indians as well as for other people. We must therefore try to prepare them by education for more radical changes in the future that would upset all their moral and physical life if they are not prepared.\n\nKnowing how deep is your sense of responsibilities I remain confident that you will not fail to have this important question investigated thoroughly.\n\nWith my thanks, I beg to express my most sincere and profound esteem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.)

October 1st, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Education Branch\n\nAs there is no School in Bersimis this year for the whites, I would ask you if you would permit to four children belonging to two families staying in Bersimis for over twenty years to attend to the Bersimis Indian Day School, the families are the following:\n\nJohnny Poulin, married with Delvina Rock formerly Indian (Sister of Paul Rock, Chief) where they have one girl by the name of Rita 14 years of age and the other one is:\n\nAmbroise Collins, married to Angele Thiernish formerly Indian where they have three children\nAnne Marie 15 years\nMarie Noella 12 \"\nChristophe 11 \"\n\nFrom what I know they are being brought up more like Indians than French and I would also like to know what you would charge per child per month.\n\nJ.M.

Unfortunately, through an oversight, salary cheques went forward to you for the months of September and October as follows: Cheque No. 69581, dated September 30, 1948, for $156.00 and cheque No. 60244, dated October 31, 1948, for $156.00.

Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nNovember 23, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY,\n\nBersimis Indian Day School.\n\nThe repairs carried out at this school made a great deal of improvement. There remains, however, some work to be done on the kitchen ceiling which apparently will not hold plaster for some reason or other. This ceiling could be covered with gyproc. This I feel confident would remedy the difficulty. I believe that the contractor in charge of building on this Reserve could handle this very efficiently and the cost should not exceed $75.00.\n\nIt had been recommended several years ago to increase the toilet facilities as there are only two toilets for approximately one hundred pupils. This recommendation, however, was never carried out, due possibly to the difficulty in obtaining fixtures. The addition of two fixtures would greatly improve, although would still be inadequate for the number of pupils in this school. It would take an addition of four fixtures to bring this up to the minimum.\n\nIt must be remembered that plumbing repairs in this section are rather difficult to achieve because all trained help and labour must be brought in from Bay Comeau or even Rimouski. However, the present building overseer appears to have quite a knowledge of this work and possibly he could undertake this improvement. The Agent should be asked to investigate the possibility of obtaining prices for these repairs.\nI had an opportunity of visiting all three classrooms for a short time. I must say that the improvement since I visited this school for the first time six or seven years ago, has been very great. Some radical changes that were suggested at that time have produced dividends. However, I feel that this school has progressed as much as it is able to under the present teachers. I am satisfied that the teacher who is teaching seventh grade is attempting something above her capacity. This matter should probably be taken up with the Bishop and a definite change should be made. Our range of salaries should assure us fully qualified teachers to carry out the training that we are attempting for the people living in this locality.\n\nI was unable to visit the Pastor as he was absent. However, I had a short talk with his Assistant. I did not deem it feasible, however, to discuss the standards of the school at that time.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

Ferland,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nBetsiamits, P.Q.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant suggesting that the opening and closing dates of the Bersimis Indian Day School should be changed to conform with the dates in effect at Provincial White schools.\n\nThe dates on which the school has opened and closed in recent years were settled after considerable discussion and I believe Mr. Doucet visited the Agency and he also decided that the dates on which we have been operating were most satisfactory for all parties concerned.\n\nI have reviewed the reports submitted by the Principal of the school regarding the enrolment and average attendance and it is found that the enrolment in July of 1948 was 121 and the average attendance 120. In only one other month did the enrolment and average attendance reach these particular figures. You might also note the following figures:\n\n| Enrolment | Average |\n|-----------|---------|\n| December 1948 | 70      |\n| January 1949   | 70      |\n| February 1949  | 72      |\n\nIt is evident from these figures that the enrolment and average attendance differs considerably from the mid-winter months.\n\nI think you should give the matter more careful consideration and if you have not already done so, I suggest that you consult the Sisters and the local missionary and write to us again. Please advise the Reverend Sister that she did not forward to us the attendance reports for the months of March and April 1949.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nBetsiamits, Que.

It is understood that qualified teachers will be sent to the Bersimis School.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited Bersimis recently it was agreed by those interested that in future the Bersimis School would operate on a 10 month basis. It was also decided that the seasonal school at present in operation would close on August 15, 1946, as following this date many of the Indians leave the reserve. The regular academic year, in future will therefore extend from October 15 to the subsequent August 15.\n\nPlease advise Reverend Paul Langlois, O.M.I., regarding the above and arrange with him to let us know the names of the teachers as soon as they begin duties in October.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nReverend J.

The boy transported this lumber without my knowledge and I paid him the $1.00 that he asked me for. I have no intention of running after him to get a receipt for it and if the Department does not wish to pay the total amount of my claim, it may deduct the $1.00 in question from me.

Mission although the Department have provided school furniture and paid for the cost of certain interior alterations.\n\nIn company with Inspector Parker and Indian Agent Bosse I made a visit to the school and went carefully over the whole building.\n\nThe building has a cubic foot capacity of 4000 cu.ft. or sufficient for 16 pupils whereas there are 103 children of school age on the Reserve, 85 of whom were on the regular school roll during the summer quarter of last year.\n\nI submit that in justice to the Indians, if the requirements of education are to be met, a school should be provided for the accommodation of at least 90 children having a cubic capacity of at least 22,000 cu.feet. This would entail the construction of a building 60 ft X 35 ft divided into two class-rooms of 11,000 cu.ft. capacity each.\n\nIn company with the priest in charge of the mission, Inspector Parker and the Indian Agent we tentatively looked over the ground for a suitable site and agreed that an excellent situation would be just west of the present school building where there is not only ample space for the new school building itself, but also desirable large space for a playground.\n\nI would estimate the cost of such school after preliminary discussion with Mr. Ogilvie at $15,000 and if this amount is to be expended from the capital of the Indians, their consent will have to be secured.\n\nI would suggest that as all the Indians will be at the Reserve on August 13th to receive their 10% distribution of the bonus from sale of timber, the question be submitted to them at that time, and that in the meantime tentative plans for the building be submitted so that the Department may be in a position to at least commence foundation and exterior work during the present year.\nI would suggest that the cost of construction will be appreciably lessened if the contract is let this year, as a building contractor is on the Reserve there now with all the necessary equipment and men and that if the type of construction is brick, the building would be more permanent, fire-proof and almost as cheap as lumber.\n\nI would recommend that tenders be called for not later than September 15th next.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nHonourable Arthur Meighen.\n\nSchool: Bersimis Reserve.\n\nThe present school building is the property of the Mission and has accommodation for only 16 pupils, whereas there are 85 scholars on the school roll and a population of 103 children of school age.\n\nIt is therefore proposed to re-model the interior of the present school building in order to make it suitable for a small hospital and home for aged Indians, and to construct a new school with sufficient capacity for the requirements.\n\nI would recommend for your approval, the above plan of action as being of great benefit to the Indians and judicious expenditure of a portion of their capital funds.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTranslation\n\nOctober 28, 1919\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nArchitect\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs we have no more agent, we think it is our duty to communicate directly with Ottawa for what we need.

Would you be kind enough to interest yourself in us, and have what we need sent us as soon as possible, with the permit to have the work done? Otherwise what should we do? We will be obliged to close the classes and for ourselves we would have to suffer from the cold which is certainly not the intention of the Department.\n\nThe doctor Boileau has already made all these demands and given us all the explanations, unfortunately he leaves without giving us any answers.

Suivant moi le meilleur temps pour creuser un puits pour \u00eatre s\u00fbrs d'y toujours trouver de l'eau, advenant un hiver avec basses eaux, c'est dans le mois de mars. J'ai consult\u00e9 quelqu'un; celui-ci m'a dit qu'avec $20 ou $25 l'on pouvait creuser de 7 \u00e0 8 pieds de plus, boiser le puits et s'assurer ainsi d'une eau permanente et suffisante aux besoins domestiques des Soeurs.\n\nLe canal d'\u00e9gout, qui, \u00e0 mon avis n'est pas assez enfonc\u00e9 et qui se d\u00e9charge dans un quart (tonneau), au lieu que dans un \"puisard\", a cess\u00e9 de fonctionner.

Indian Affairs\nSir,\n\nWater is completely out of the school's well. It is true that water is at present exceptionally low. I attribute this to the fact that the well was dug during August last when under ground water was high, the laborers finding water easily at that time stopped digging. In my opinion the best time to dig a well to be sure to always find water in case of a dry winter would be the month of March. Consulted with somebody here and he was told that with $20 or $25 we could have it dug 7 or 8 ft. more have it walled and be sure of a permanent and sufficient water supply of water for the domestic use of the Sisters.\n\nThe sewer which in my opinion is not deep enough has stopped working as it discharges into a barrel instead of a cesspool. The cold has frozen everything, the barrel was not deep enough the water froze, the 4 inch pipe is clogged, in my opinion it is filled with ice from end to the other. It is useless to try to get it thawed this winter. Would I be authorized to have it laid deeper in the spring and to have a proper cesspool built? I suppose at the present cost of labor it would cost between $30 and $40 to rebuild a letter of the Sisters. I recommend this demand.\n\nI believe it fair. Now I have only a slight idea of the cost of those shades but by referring to M.M. Eaton's catalogue I see \"opaque window shades\" $6.70 $1.20 each. I mention the Eaton firm for reference. Those shades would cost delivered here about $1.75 each, Total $21.00\n\nThere are repairs needed to the doors, chimneys and to the movable porches, cost about $15. to $18.00\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd.

I enclose herewith cheque No. 2856 for $300.00 in payment for rental from the 1st July 1919 to the 31st December 1920. The reason for delay in payment of rental was due to the fact that a voucher covering the same was not presented to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Powers Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.Q.\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have been requested by the Sisters of the Bersimis Indian Day School to go over to the convent and examine their kitchen stove which needs repairs very badly and which I am afraid will probably cost as much as buying a new stove. The fire-box is all burned out and the oven is in very bad condition from this. I am wiring for estimate of cost of replacing said fire-box, and also for the price of a new stove of the same brand, and will choose the proportionately cheapest.\n\nThere is also a bath installed in the convent but with no hot water running to the bath, would the Dept recommend the buying of a water-front and a boiler and necessary piping to install same.\n\nAs said in my letter accompanying vouchers forwarded last fall for repairs to the School those repairs were only temporary on account of the season being too advanced, can I go ahead with the replacing of new bricks in the School chimneys as soon as the weather gets warm.\n\nExpecting early instructions on the above, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, April 26th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the condition of the kitchen stove in the Bercimis Indian Day School. In reply, I beg to say that, if it is not possible to make repairs to the stove without unnecessary expense, it is considered that it would be better to purchase a new stove.\n\nIf you decide to purchase a new stove, you should obtain competitive prices and purchase a stove suitable for the requirements, from the firm quoting you the lowest price. If, however, you consider the present stove can be repaired, and a new fire-box obtained, you may have this work done.\n\nIf a new stove is purchased, you should forward a memorandum containing the names of the firms asked to quote prices, and the prices quoted by them, which should be attached to properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of a water-front, boiler and the necessary piping to install a hot water system for the bath in the convent.\n\nWith regard to the repairs to the chimneys, I beg to say that you can arrange to have this work undertaken as soon as the weather permits. In the purchase of any material, and labour required, the expenditure should be kept down to the lowest possible point. Properly receipted vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost of the labour and material for repairing the chimneys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nA. W.

Of course I could not at the time get the work started over again as the season was quite advanced and besides the work was nearly completed, and I thought it would be better to leave it as it was till something wrong developed.\n\nThe well would also need to be deepened some three or four feet.\n\nThe whole work of digging a new cesspool and deepening the well would entail an expenditure of about $60. to $70.\n\nThe piping in the sewerage system would still be good to use.\n\nAn early answer would be appreciated so as to get the work under way as soon as the ground thaws out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 19, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th ult., with reference to the trouble you are having with the sewage system at the Borsimis day school, I beg to say that the Department approves of the digging of a new cesspool and the deepening of the well. It is understood that the cost will not exceed $70.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlf. W. Powers, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBorsimis, Que.\nOttawa, April 15th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo regarding the proposal to erect a boarding school and home on the Terrimine Reserve and in reply to state that the Department has had under consideration for some time the question of the establishment of a new school and hospital with doctor's office.\n\nIt is thought that the Department would not be justified in establishing a boarding school on the Reserve at the present time but as it is realized that there is urgent need for a new day school which would have adequate accommodation for the number of children of school age in the Reserve and also for a hospital or doctor's office where patients suffering from contagious diseases might receive treatment, the Department has now under consideration a proposal to erect a new school and re-model the present school so as to make it suitable for a hospital.\n\nAs you are aware the present school building is the property of the Catholic Mission and the Department paying an annual rent of $200 for the use of the building. I have no reason to believe that the Mission would be agreeable to disposing of this building to the Department and what value they would place thereon.\n\nA new school built of brick and with a capacity for 90 children would cost approximately $15,000 and I would ask that you interview the Indians and determine if they would be willing to have this amount expended from their funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Indians by a unanimous vote decided to petition the Department to expend the sum of $20,000 for the construction of a brick day school sufficiently large for the reception of 100 scholars, and this petition was duly drawn up, signed by the Chief and three principal men, and witnessed by the Missionary in charge, the Indian Agent and myself. The petition itself is attached.\n\nThe Indians previously in the year 1919 petitioned the Department to expend the sum of $5,000 for the purpose of providing a hospital for the aged Indians who were physically unable to go hunting and for those suffering from illness who could not be treated in their homes.\n\nThis document is also on this file. See under.\n\nThe whole question of the necessity of providing a proper school and hospital has been dealt with in my memos. of July 14th, 1919 and April 30th, 1922 on this file and I would therefore recommend that the wishes of the Indians in these matters be given favorable consideration, and action taken as early as possible.\n\nWhilst at Bersimis I staked out an excellent site for the proposed brick school, with the concurrence of the priest in charge, Father Jauffret, and Monseigneur Leveztoux the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese. The site adjoins the present frame building and comprises about two acres of land in all, so that there will be ample space for school grounds. A sketch plan is submitted herewith showing the exact site. The question of compensation to the mission for the use of the land, which has been under improvement for about thirty years was fully discussed with the Bishop and Priest. They expressed the opinion that the value of improvements on the land should be worth $500 but I pointed out that in all probability the Department would consider this an excessive price. The mission are unable to give title to the land, having merely been occupants of it and in consequence I proposed that the Department should occupy the site and the question of allowing some compensation should be left for future discussion. This was presented to.\nThe question of providing a hospital and doctor's office presented some difficulty at first. The present school building which is of frame construction was built some 15 years ago and the Department has leased it at a rental of $200 besides from time to time undertaking the cost of improvements such as repairs to fence and roof.\n\nThe building is owned by the Mission and the Bishop placed a value of $3500 on the building and contents. I pointed out that as the building was old, and as the Department had been responsible for keeping it in repair for a number of years besides paying an annual rental for the use of it, I was inclined to the opinion that this sum was quite out of proportion to the assessed value. After some discussion I suggested that the Department should continue to pay rental for the building but on the condition that such alterations might be made by the Department as were considered necessary to make the building suitable for the purpose intended, i.e., hospital and doctors' office.\n\nBoth the mission and the Bishop assented to this, and are prepared to give confirmation of this arrangement in writing if considered necessary.\n\nThis is in my opinion much the better arrangement, as it relieves the Department of a heavy initial expense and avoids an outright purchase of an old frame building.\n\nI submit a blue print photograph of the present building, and a blue print plan showing front view, side view, ground floor, second floor and basement. I secured this plan from the official records of the agent and this will doubtless be of material assistance in deciding as to the requisite alterations.\n\nWith regard to the question of providing the necessary funds for the two buildings as asked for by the Indians, I may point out that in 1919 the Minister approved of the expenditure for these purposes, and I would therefore suggest that the necessary Order in Council be secured so as to enable work to be commenced next spring.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to point out that the Indians all expressed themselves as being very pleased with the manner in which their affairs are being looked after and that I am very grateful myself for the enthusiastic cooperation of the Indian Chief, the missionary in charge, the Bishop of the diocese and the Indian Agent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervisor Indian Timber Lands.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI have examined Mr. Bury's memoranda concerning the proposed 4-roomed school at Bersimis and, after discussing it with him, I beg to recommend that the proposal contained in his memorandum on this file be accepted.\n\nAt present we have an enrolment at our 2-roomed school of 80 and an average attendance last quarter of 42. I am convinced that there are sufficient students to warrant the erection of a 4-roomed school.\n\nAs you are aware, the Band unanimously voted $20,000 to be used in this connection, and the Mission is quite content to leave in abeyance the matter of compensation for the land improvements at the proposed site. I beg to suggest that the building be located so that adequate playground facilities are available.\n\nI note that in 1919 the Minister approved of the expenditure, and I concur in Mr. Bury's recommendation that the necessary Order in Council be secured so that the work may be commenced early next year.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nHis Excellency,\n\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned begs to refer to the fact that on the reserve of the Bersimis Indians, in the County of Saguenay, in the Province of Quebec, there is an enrollment of eighty Indian children for school purposes with accommodation in an old and inadequate building for only sixteen pupils; and also that it is essential that accommodation should be provided for a hospital and doctor's office on the reserve.\n\nWith a view to meeting the requirements of the Band in the above respects, the Indians have passed resolutions in favour of an expenditure of twenty thousand dollars from their capital funds on the erection of a new school-house of sufficient size to meet the requirements of the Band, and a further sum of five thousand dollars to convert the old school-house into a hospital.\n\nAn officer of the Department of Indian Affairs, who visited the reserve in the month of August, 1922, and examined carefully existing conditions, reports in favour of the above mentioned expenditures being made.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, recommend that, under the provisions of Sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act, the authority of Your Excellency in Council be given for the above mentioned expenditures of twenty thousand dollars on the\nconstruction of a school-house, and five thousand dollars on converting the old existing school-house into a hospital on the reserve being made from Bersimis Band capital, which amounts to one hundred and eighteen thousand, eight hundred and sixteen dollars and eighty-eight cents.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mission, and for which the Dept. pays an annual rental of $200. has accommodation for only 16 pupils. There are over 100 children on the reserve, 80 of whom are on the school enrollment, with an average attendance last quarter of 42. The Dept. considers that there should be accommodation for 100 pupils. The Indians have requested that a school-house large enough for the needs of the Band be erected, for which they are willing to spend $20,000. from their capital. An officer of the Dept. visited the reserve last month, and located a suitable site for the school on the reserve.\n\nA hospital is needed for the sick and aged who are unable to go hunting, and in which the physician could have his office. For this purpose it is proposed to fix up the old school-house, and the Indians have passed a resolution to spend $5,000.\n\nThe officer of the Department who visited the reserve advises in favour of carrying out the above mentioned projects.\n\nThe proposed expenditures from Band Capital come under Sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act; that for the construction of the\nThe Bersimis Band has $118,816.88 at the credit of its capital account. This account is being continually increased by the receipt of timber dues; and it is very probable that before the timber is entirely cut their capital account will have reached the sum of $250,000.00, during the next few years.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, September 20th, 1922.\nBetsiamits... 16 Ao\u00fbt... 1922\n\nVente aux b\u00e9n\u00e9voles pour le Bon Conseil\n\nPrix pour enfants d'\u00e9cole\n\n3 chemises et cravate 1.00 3.00\n1 livre pri\u00e8re 4.00 2.00\n18 images 0.25 4.50\n15 Portraits du Roi 0.05 0.45\n\n$ 9.95\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No 3-1-5 July 22nd 1922\n\nFor prizes distributed to the pupils of the Bersimis Indian School as per duplicate accounts attached.\n\n$9.95\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The excavation is about half done and the earth for the other half will be used to fill the present creek.\n\nMr Bury is well aware of the conditions of the grounds and you might refer to him, if possible. But as said before an immediate answer is desirable.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Alt. Powers, M.D.)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn reference to letter hereunder from agent Dr. Powers regarding the necessity of diverting a small creek which crosses the school grounds so as to permit of ample room for school foundation I discussed this matter with the agent when we selected the site, but decided to leave the matter in abeyance until the contractor got on the ground and looked over himself.\n\nDr. Powers now reports that it will be necessary to have this creek diverted and replaced with 100 feet of 18 inch covered drain pipe at an approx. cost of $500.

It is possible that this well cannot be completed this fall, owing to the high level of the water in that location at this time of the year. However, it is necessary that water be supplied to the existing pneumatic tank in order to provide an adequate amount to the heating and plumbing systems. I would therefore recommend that the contractor be requested to undertake this work together with that of installing a gasoline engine and pump on the same condition as that mentioned for the laying of the sewer pipe.\n\nMr. Amyot has agreed to undertake this work and have it completed before the end of next week if authorized to proceed with it at once.\n\nI may add for your information that the building is completed with the exception of the finished floors, all of which has been found satisfactory, and in accordance with the plans and specifications. Will you please advise whether these instructions can be given regarding the above mentioned work. The cost of the pump and engine, including installation will amount to approximately $790.00.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Engineer\n\nIndian Affairs.

Well must be completed Tuesday next. Take note of materials supplied and workmen's time. Letter following.\"\n\nThe reason for requesting the building of an open well within the above mentioned limited time is due to the fact that Mr. LaBlanc will arrive at Borslimis next Tuesday with the pump, engine and other materials required for the installation of the water supply system, which Mr. Amyot the contractor has agreed to install, together with the drainage system on a proven cost plus ten percent basis. It will, therefore, be necessary that the contractor furnish you with copies in duplicate of all the accounts and pay lists upon the completion of the above mentioned work, all of which should be verified and certified by you before they are sent to this office. It is understood that you are to supervise this work and see that it is economically and speedily carried out, in order that it may be completed by the end of next week.\n\nMr. LaBlanc has been requested to arrange, while in Simouski, for shipment of one steel gasoline tank, also an oil tank and other tools which will be required for the operating of the pump and engine.\n\nKindly acknowledge the receipt of this letter and advise me as soon as the above mentioned work has been completed.

This is to be approximately 4 feet square, lined inside and covered with 6 inch squared timbers.\n\nPURCHASING and installing of one water pump and compressor of 10 gallon per minute capacity with strainer and pulley, also one horizontal 1 H.P. gasoline engine with magneto to operate the above mentioned pump, all of which are to be installed in complete working order.\n\nLAYING of a 6 inch vitrified drain pipe from the outlet of the drainage system underneath the basement floor of the school to the Creek behind the building. This pipe is to be laid with a grade of 1/4\" to each foot of drop. The outlet of the sewer pipe is to be protected by the placing of a small concrete retaining wall.\n\nThe Indian Agent was instructed to have this work performed as speedily as possible and it is understood that you are to be paid for this additional work on a proven cost plus ten percent basis. All receipts for materials and labour should be submitted to Mr. Powers for verification and certification, and they should be sent to this office as soon as the work is completed.\n\nI may add for your information that the questions of installing a septic tank and the erection of outbuildings have been definitely postponed for this year, and it will not, therefore, be necessary for you to retain any materials which have not been used in connection with your contract for the main building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

According to the specification the contractor is to install the whole of the water supply system inside the building, but the engine and pump and source of supply are to be provided by the Department.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of two telegrams, one from the Lower St. Lawrence Power Co. of Rimouski, offering to sell to this Department two complete Delco electric light plants which have been in use only ten months in a convent in Rimouski, and, according to their statement, would be suitable for the lighting system to be provided by this Department at the new Bersimis School. The Company state that the whole of the machinery is in perfect working order and that it could be secured at a very low price.\n\nThe second telegram was sent by Mr. Danjou, M.P., recommending the purchase of the above mentioned machinery from the Company.\n\nIn view of the fact that the building is not quite ready yet to receive this machinery I cannot recommend that immediate consideration be given to the Company's request but I would suggest that Mr. A. LeBlanc, who has charge of the heating and plumbing in this school be requested to examine this machinery and report to the Department upon the advisability of taking into consideration the Company's offer. While at Bersimis Mr. LeBlanc could also fully investigate the question of providing a reliable water supply for the school.\nMemorandum: Mr. Scott.\n\ncontinued ..........school.\n\nThis would save a lot of correspondence and would ensure satisfactory results in both items of the work which are not a part of the contract awarded to Mr. Amyot.

(RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Nov. 14th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nAs it will be necessary to have the quantity of coal required for the use of the new school building at Bersimis purchased and delivered at an early date, the Department wired you today as follows:\n\n\"Arrange for immediate purchase and delivery at lowest possible price 25 tons hard coal for new school at Bersimis.\"\n\nNo doubt, you are aware as to where the above quantity of coal can be obtained, and the Department will expect you to make the purchase and have the coal delivered at the school at the least possible cost. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. The vouchers should show the price per ton, as well as the price per ton charged for freight, and any other expenses. We hope that you will be able to obtain this coal and have it delivered before navigation closes.\n\nAs soon as the new building is completed and the floors in the classroom are finished and ready for use, you should arrange to have the seats in the old school building moved and set up in the new classroom. This work should be completed as nearly as possible, and properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W. Powers, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of 2nd and 7th instants with reference to the furnishing by this Department of electrical fixtures for the new school at Bersimis.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Indian Agent, Mr. Powers was instructed by wire on November 10th to purchase the required electrical fixtures and to arrange for their delivery as soon as possible.\n\nThe question of installing a sewage disposal system is now under consideration and I trust I will be able to give you a definite answer regarding this work within the course of a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Amyot, Esq.,\nRicciot St.,\nHull, Que.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, Nov. 14, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of Nov. 6th regarding the offer made by the St. Lawrence Power Company of Rimouski to sell to this Department two Delco electric light plants for the lighting system to be installed at the new Bersimis combined school and teachers' residence, I beg to inform you that this machinery has been examined by Mr. LaBlanc, who reports that it consists of two 25 Ampere generators, each operated by a 5 H. P. oil engine including 56 storage batteries, all of which appear to be in good condition.\n\nThe Company offer to supply this machinery installed in working order for the sum of $2,050. They were not ready to submit a quotation for the supplying of one unit only. After giving the matter due consideration I cannot recommend the purchase of one of these units on account of its capacity, which is much too large for a building of this size, where only forty lights are being installed unless it is proposed to supply electric current to other buildings in the vicinity of the school or for other purposes than that of lighting.\n\nA new suitable and complete lighting outfit including storage batteries could be obtained at a cost of $800.00, but in view of the approaching closing of navigation next week I would recommend that this question be left in abeyance until next spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nRIMOUSKI QUE 9 NFT\n\nJ D CHENE\n\nING CIVIL DEPT DES AFFAIRES INDIENNE OTTAWA ONT\n\nINSTALLATION ELECTRIQUE DANS URGULINES COMPREND DEUX MACHINES\nVINGT CINQ AMPERES DOUZE CENT REVOLUTIONS DES MACHINES POUVENT\nECLAIRER SOUVEN ET FOURNIR DU POUVOIR POUR SYSTEME DE\nPOMPE ET AUTRES PETITS MOTEURS POUR LEVEGE PLUS TARD STOP.\n\nAVANT VOS DONNER REPONSE FINALE DESIRE ALLER BEROTISPOUR\nCONSTATER PROGRES CONSTRUCTION ACTUELLE\n\nA LEGEND.\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\n\nSECRETARY DEPT INDIA AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nWE HAVE REPLACED AT URGULINE SISTERS THEIR ELECTRIC INSTALL-\nATION COMPRISING TWO DECKS NUMBERED TEN VOLTS TWENTY FIVE\nAMPERES THIRTY SIX ELEMENTS OF A MODULATORS STOP THESE MAINTAINED\nIN PERFECT ORDER HAVING BEEN INSTALLED ONLY LAST WINTER STOP\n\nIF YOU HAVE NOT YET BOUGHT MACHINES FOR CONVEY UNDER\nCONSTRUCTIONS AT BERGMAN WE CAN QUOTE VERY LOW PRICES ON THESE\nSETS ALSO ON MOTORS FOR PUMPING SYSTEMS STOP PLEASE WRITE ANSWER\nAT OUR EXPENSE\n\nLOWER ST.

Beland, who would advise him of the probable dates we would have a Departmental steamer in the vicinity of Bersimis.\n\nMr. Beland is in Ottawa today and on taking the matter up further with him he advised me that the \"MONTGAL\" should have left Quebec this morning on a trip to the lower part of the river for the purpose of removing the buoys at Manikungan, which is near Bersimis. This, I expect will be the last trip of one of this Department's steamers to that locality, but, if the weather were suitable, I think arrangements could be made to send our pilot tender across from Father Point when she is leaving her station which will likely be early in December.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIt may also happen that one of our larger steamers will be down the river again on the south shore after the middle of December, in which case, if we were advised in time, it might be possible to divert her to Bersimis to pick up the workmen.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Powers, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBorsimie, P.Q.\nDear Sir:-\n\nImmediately on the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, (No. 3-1-5A), I telegraphed our Agent at Quebec to know if he would have a steamer in the vicinity of Bersimis on the 10th of this month and I have before me now his reply that no steamer is there and there will be no occasion to have any ship there after that date.\n\nI expect our steamship \"MONTCAIM\" will be leaving Quebec sometime around the beginning of the week of the 17th December for Sydney and if the men are not taken off from Bersimis by that time I could arrange to have the \"MONTCAIM\" call there for that purpose if it is absolutely necessary. It will be quite an expensive undertaking for us to send so large a vessel as the \"MONTCAIM\" so far out of her way and I do not wish to incur any such expense if it can be avoided.\n\nI think it not at all unlikely that your people could make arrangements with a vessel owner at Rimouski to run across and get them, particularly if the weather remains fine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Mr. LeBlanc succeeded in completing the installation of both the water supply and sewerage systems in a satisfactory manner with the exception of the water well, which may have to be deepened in the spring.\n\nI would recommend that payment be given immediate consideration.

Amyot for work performed digging open well, and digging drainage, and supplying materials in connection with same for the new Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nThe accounts of Mr Bellavance, Rousseau, and Imperial Oil are not in duplicate as Mr Amyot forgot to get same in duplicate not being aware of the fact.\n\nTo the amount of these vouchers will have to be added the drainage pipes, and different materials which were bought by Mr A. Leblanc, and the invoices of which I have not on hand, and which I presume Mr Leblanc himself must have produced at the Department.\n\nI did not make the total as I do not know what percentage the Dept. allows to Mr Amyot for the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.
