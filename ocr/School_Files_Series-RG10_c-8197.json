Mr. Smith would like to get two \"Air-circulating\" wood stoves to replace the old ones. The cost of these stoves would be approximately $50.00 each. I recommend that this request be granted.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, at present Mr. Smith has to carry his drinking and washing water about 700 feet.\n\nThe water that was formerly used at this school is full of iron and corrodes all the water pails, etc. Mr. Smith will not use this water.\n\nThree years ago the Department tried to obtain a new source of water for this school, but it was not a success. I am getting further advice regarding this matter and will notify you at a later date what I think should be done to improve the water supply for this school.\n\nR. P. G.

Indian Day School.\n\nMr. A.E. Smith, age forty-six, fourteen years Indian experience, twelve years Provincial Experience.\n\nEnrolment is as follows:\n\n| Grade | Enrolment |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 1     | 7         |\n| 2     | 6         |\n| 3     | 4         |\n| 5     | 3         |\n| 6     | 4         |\n| 7     | 2         |\n\nThe attendance on February 3rd, the day on which I inspected this school was sixteen. I tested only Grade 5 and Grade 7 with Achievement Tests and found them good in Spelling and weak in English and especially in Arithmetic.\n\nThis teacher seems to be in a rut and I feel that a change is definitely indicated. He admits frankly that he has lost interest in the lower grades and would like to handle the Senior Room at a two-room school. He is quite willing to move if we so request.\n\nDiscipline is no problem and the children are well mannered. They work well on their own and speak out well. The room is very untidy. In a corner is a work bench which takes up quite a bit of room (see recommendations below). The teacher was unshaven and his appearance left much to be desired in the way of cleanliness and tidiness.\nThis school is about fifty years old and has a large brick fireplace in the front of the room. This cuts down the blackboard surface considerably. The teacher's quarters are made up of a kitchen, dining-room/sitting-room at the back. The whole is lighted with electricity and is adequately wired. The classroom has six semi-indirect lights in the ceiling.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. A brooder house at the back of the school should be fixed up as small workshop and the Manual Training equipment should be moved to it. There is an old stove which can be quite easily put up in the workshop. It could also be used as a small storeroom for Scout and Guide supplies.\n\n2. During 1949-50 we should have an Engineer visit the school and decide what can be done about the foundation. The building seems sound in spite of its age. The present teacher and the Agent seem to feel that the foundation could be dug behind the school and that the building could be moved back to this new foundation. We could then arrange to have it heated by a furnace and at the same time remove the brick fireplace.\n\nBernard F.

Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast fall I wrote asking you to ask the Department for ten dollars a month for supplying a hot dish to the pupils of this school. Your reply stated that only $6.00 a month would be allowed.\n\nYou might write to the Department and ask them to raise the amount to ten dollars for the five months when we serve soup or cocoa.\n\nYou and they must know that the cost of living has raised in the last few years. You must realize that we serve an average of 20 bowls of soup a day for 20 days in the month which gives us approximately a cent and a half a bowl. If we can serve soup at that price and break even we are wasting our time here. We should be in the restaurant business.\n\nWhile we were in the Oka Indian School we were paid ten dollars a month. We had only 10 or 12 children with us for lunch while here we have all 20. And that was in the depression years when food was about half what it is now.\n\nSix dollars a month allows us 30 cents a day. Milk is 16 cents a quart. It takes at least two quarts of milk for the cocoa. Now what should we use for money to buy the cocoa, vanilla, sugar, and butter which are all necessary.\n\nI am sure you can see that we are losing money on this project and still we have met the heart to refuse because we know that the hot dish is necessary for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.E.

Indian Day School -\n\nThe Anglican Indian Day School at Garden River is situated some ten miles from Sault Ste. Marie on the highway. It is a very old building but is soundly constructed and should serve our needs for some years to come. However, there is need for moving the building to a proper foundation as the present one is crumbling. We have now received a letter from Mr. A. E. Smith, the present teacher, forwarded by Mr. Indian Superintendent Laurence. Mr. Smith's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"I am enclosing plans which I have drawn to illustrate my idea of having indoor toilets placed in this school at as early a date as possible, preferably this summer.\n\n\"On sheet 1 I have drawn a plan of the school and porch as it is. There is no need for a four foot door and a door this size is frightfully cold. I would have the porch removed altogether and an 8 foot addition built on the front of the school. As shown on sheet 2 this addition would be divided into three parts each 7' x 3'.

Either of these plans would be much better but would run into higher expense.\"\n\nWe are attaching his drawings to illustrate his recommendations.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education recently inspected this school and reports that action is definitely needed if we are to save this building. Unfortunately, it is a two-storey building with the teachers'age being over the classroom. It would be appreciated if we could have an engineer visit this school and recommend the action that is needed to either\n\n(a) preserve this building, or\n\n(b) decide whether we should erect a new school.\n\nI would suggest that the engineer sent to Sault Ste. Marie check first with our Superintendent of Education, who will be able to provide further details.\n\nEncl.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nMarch 5th, 1948.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nYou will please find enclosed letter received from Mr. A.E.

It appears to be structurally sound, but the windows and doors are noticeably loose fitting. The building is located 55 feet from the main highway.\n\nThe classroom, is 29'-3\" long x 21' wide with a 9 foot ceiling which is somewhat smaller than a standard classroom of modern design. There are seats for twenty-two pupils and at present there is an attendance of twenty-nine pupils with at least thirty-four expected next year.\n\nThe first floor, in addition to the classroom, has a kitchen 10'-6\" x 10'-6\" and a dining room 9'-6\" x 15'-6\" and a small pantry. The second floor has five (5) average size bedrooms and a small lavatory which contains a chemical toilet. The building is heated by stoves.\n\nThere is a shallow well with a hand pump, on the property south of the building, and it was noticed that the water has an oily scum and is unpalatable. There is also a deep well casing near the school which is capped. Should it be desired to use this deep well, it would be necessary to \"blow\" the casing and remove some sand which has found its way into the pipe. The water from this well is said to be of good quality.\n\nIt would be possible to establish a sewage disposal field southwest of the building to serve a plumbing system, if one were installed.\n\nIf a new basement were excavated and built on a site immediately south of the existing building as has been suggested, and the building moved and set up thereon, together with the installation of plumbing, water supply and heating, it is estimated that the sum of $10,000.00 would be required to carry out these operations.\n\nAfter having given careful consideration to the foregoing proposal, it is felt that it would be un-economical to carryout such operations. Nothing would be gained relative to bringing the classroom up to reasonably modern design. In view of the fact that a new modern one room school with basement and teachers' quarters, together with mechanical services, could be erected for approximately $15,000.00, it is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch give consideration to this suggestion.\n\nR.A.

We are asking for two things to be done:\n\nFirst:- that milk, one pint and oranges, one each be supplied the pupils in the schools in place of the Vitamin Biscuits which the children do not like and will not eat.\n\nSecond:- That the children on the reserve be examined for defective teeth, eyes and tonsils and then that said defects be remedied by licensed practitioners in those lines. We would further ask that Dr. J. E. Gimby, Medical Health Officer for Sault Ste.

To supply the pupils of each school with a pint of milk and an orange each day would cost approximately $6,500.00 per year, which is quite an item.\n\nI would suggest that a few extra dollars per month be allowed each school to make hot soup as the present allowance for this purpose is not sufficient due to the high cost of food.\n\nIf the pupils receive the biscuits and a hot cup of soup each day, I would then feel that the Department has done their share and if any milk is needed it should be supplied by the parents from their family allowance cheques.\n\nR.

For next year, I already engaged a male teacher having the best recommendations, and then it is most probable that the number of scholars will increase by a good many more, so a second teacher becomes necessary. Mr. Benson, when he visited us the last time said that a salary for a second teacher would be given provided we maintain the average over 30. The last report shows an average of 33, and in the next it will be about the same or only a little under thirty because on account of bad & cold weather in the 2nd part of February and the beginning of March, many have been obliged to stay at home. By the large attendance of the last month, I see that the second teacher will be necessary not only a few months, as I thought but during the whole year. Please, sir, let me know what the Department will be able to do, because I must on time find a competent person.\n\n(Signed) G. E. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

For the next year I already engaged a male teacher having the best recommendations, and as some of the parents say that when there will be a man to teach they will send more regularly their children, it is almost certain that we will have always at least 40 scholars present. The Department may see at once that a second teacher will be necessary, not only for a few months as I thought, but for the whole year. Mr. Benson, when he visited us for a short time, said that a salary for a second teacher ought to be given, if we maintained our average over 30. In the last report it was near 33, and in the next, it will be, I think, about the same, or a little under 30. Because, on account of bad or cold weather in the first part of September and the beginning of March, many have been obliged to stay at home. Consequently I ask you, dear Sir, what will you do for us, and what will be the amount paid for the second teacher? I must know that on time, to be able to find a competent person for the beginning of the next school year.\n\nRemain, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\nJ. O. Carter\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have the honour to say that it contains no reply to the second object of my letter of the 18th instant. It is however very important for me to know what is to be done next year for a second teacher.

Another man told me then that this protestant teacher and minister was supported by the 300 dollars paid by the band, which is however two-thirds catholic.\n\nAnd again and again people came to talk about the matter.\n\nOf course, dear sir, a long time before the first of them opened his mouth about it to me, I wondered at the extraordinary state of affairs which became the object of their complaint. \u2014 Why, when all sensible people in Canada are now indignant at the unfair treatment of the Catholic minority by an oppressive and dynastic majority in Manitoba; when...\nmost especially, the conservative party is ready to fight in favor of the persecuted minority of this province; ... in the same Canada, and in a village that depends directly for its administration on the conservative government of Ottawa, it is a majority, Catholic, which is robbed of its money and its rights in favor of a protestant minority! There, in Manitoba, it is the Catholics have been obliged to pray for the protestant schools; but, after all, they are the minority, which gives to narrow-minded and bigoted people a bad excuse for the fact; but here, for many years already, the Catholics, although being the great majority, have been obliged to pray for the protestant school! \u2014 The case in Manitoba is an enormous injustice; the case in Ganton River, is it not, besides, exceedingly unreasonable ...?\n\nOne might say: \"This is clear enough; but why did they not send their protestation before now?\" To which question I might answer: \"It does not matter. The right is clear enough, and there is no prescription against Indian rights.\" \u2014 But I say, they did not yet protest because they are a peaceable kind of people, and would not make any noise as long as they did not see in the other party the spirit of animosity with which they seem to be inspired since the last election of the chief; \u2014 Because also they did not yet appreciate as they do now these advantages of education, and one teacher\npaid by another band was sufficient for the number of children who came to school; now it is all different\u2014last year, and this year, most especially in the fall and spring, often 50 children are present and almost always over 40, so that it becomes, if not absolutely necessary, at least very desirable to have a second teacher; and consequently they want now to use their own money for the benefit of their own children.\n\nNow, our people wish to be well understood. They do not desire to suppress the protestant school. They would be pleased to see the protestant children well educated, but their conscience will not allow them to contribute their money to the support of a protestant teacher and minister;... besides what I said already, that they intend using their own means for their own benefit. All others do the same.\n\nNow, dear sir, I send you a copy of the petition that they wish to be sent to you, and to which they added their names:\n\n\"We, the undersigned, and our friends Catholic of Garden River Reserve protest\u2014against the use made of our Indian money to support the teacher of the Protestant school, where we, being the great majority, would not send our children. Our money, if used for school purposes,\nought to go to the Catholic school where a second teacher is wanted.\n\nBesides, as we heard, that some of the money of our band was to be given to a Protestant minister who would come here regularly or stay here, protest again against that; and we hope that the officers of the Department will keep us under these circumstances as justice requires.\n\nJohn Cadotte\nJohn L\u00e9age\nPatrick Whalen\nJoseph L\u00e9age\nJoseph Joe L\u00e9age\nGeorge L\u00e9age\nAntoine Joe L\u00e9age\nJoseph Salomon\nMichel L\u00e9age\nJoseph Boissonneau\nWidow John Whalen\nMrs Charlotte Belanger\nHyacinthe B\u00e9langer\n\nTh\u00e9ophile Boissonneau\nTh\u00e9ophile Boissonneau\nMichel Clark\nGervais Pine\nJoseph L\u00e9age\nJohn Boissonneau\nJoseph Larose\nCharles Larose\nMarie Larose\nFranc Larose\nAmable Boissonneau\nPeter L\u00e9age\nJames Gervais Pine\nJohn Bell\nJoe Savard\nFrancis Perreault Jr.\n1823 Eustache Legros\nJohn Kabirousen\nJoachim Bellon\nWidow Fran\u00e7ois Boissonneau\nMichel Boissonneau\nPeter Desen\n\u00c9lie Boissonneau\nJoe Bell\nWilliam Perreault\nJames Bell\nJohn Bellon\nSam Biron\nJoachim Biron\nRobert Sayer\nHenri Sayer\nWidow Joe Biron\n\nCharles Biron Sr.\nPeter Biron\nCharles Biron Jr.\nGabriel Biron\nJoseph Biron\nRobert Monin\nMichael Cadotte Sr.\nJoseph Cadotte\nMichael Cadotte Jr.\nCharles Cadotte\nMichel Bellon\nJoseph Bellon\nNow, dear sir, you see what our people want: first that their funds be not used for the support of a protestant teacher or minister, and then, that if used for school purposes, they be used to pay a second teacher for their own children, in addition to the teacher already paid for by the Batjwanang Band.\n\nIn the list of these petitioners, they took the names of the men only who are of age to vote and of some widows or mothers of family, all receiving their Indian annuities.

The Garden River Indians as the wealthier of the two bands is assessed $300, while the Batchewana Band contributes $200, and this contribution of $500 towards the salaries of the teachers of the two schools, is supplemented by a grant of $100, making $600 in all for this purpose which is divided between the two schools.\n\nIn regard to the question of a salary for a second teacher, I beg to refer you to official letter of the 9th April last in which you were informed that the Department would consent to pay for an average attendance over 25 and up to 42, after the 30th June last, if Estimates voted.

I write again about the salary for the Roman Catholic school.\n\nIn reply to my last letter you kindly said that Mr. Van Alst was going to send a report on the matter. More than two months elapsed since then; I suppose that the Agent had time enough to forward the information required. It may be mistaken however, as the old gentleman is always sick. But is a report necessary when a petition bearing the names of the great majority of the Indians of this band has been sent to the Department, in a case where there can be no doubt whether the claims are right or not, as they are founded upon the very words of the law in the most evident manner?\n\nAfter having taken these years long, every means and much trouble to obtain that the children be regular at school, I have been successful and raised our average to 37 for the past quarter; without average would be about 45 if the two first weeks, all 37 had come back from the fields. Upon every day, when there is a good weather, we have 50 scholars, and I expect to have yet more of them present. But one condition is indispensable: I must have a second teacher.\n\nIt may be that in the Provincial schools teachers are expected to teach up to 45 pupils; but whoever has any idea of our Indian schools knows that they are much more difficult to manage than the white ones.\n\nAlready, dear sir, in your letter of July 21st, you stated that you consent...\nto pay us for an average attendance over 25 and up to 42. 5 dollars per quarter for each child over 25. Consequently, the estimates having been voted now, I expect to receive for the next quarter $115 instead of $75, and so on each quarter.\n\nBut, dear sir, see the inconvenience of that manner of payment in our case. Assuredly, if nothing extraordinary happens; if the weather is not too stormy, if there is no sickness among the children, the average will be over 42, and I shall receive from the Department an amount which will allow me to pay two teachers. But if anything occurs and keeps at home 10 or 15 of them, there will be no money to pay the second teacher.\n\nAnd if I have only one teacher, as he cannot possibly teach properly so many pupils in different standards, we will see unavoidably the average decrease little by little.\n\nPlease let your Department remember that after and with religion the best way to improve the condition of our Indians is the school; and when after 3 years of experience you see a place where so much is done with success in that way, do, I pray, whatever is possible to help it. For many years, the missioners purchased the schoolbuilding with the whole furniture; we contributed again $25 towards the erection of the new one and paid 30 dollars for the assurance of it; we are yet building a large shed for the children 60 x 25; after promising efforts we are obtaining a very fair average of presence; what more forward ought not to be stopped? And what less if you is only to give me for once the 200\ndollars that according to every probability will have to be paid conformably to your letter of July the 7th (without that I can find no teacher.)\n\nAnd the Indian Act gives you an easy way to get the money. The R. Catholics being the great majority in Mingan River Band, that band ought to pay at least 200 for a R. Catholic teacher. These 200 added to the 300 paid by the Badjowanang Band and the general fund, will afford the 500 required. What our people is asking for is nothing but that, and every impartial mind could not but approve of it.\n\nP.S.

J. A.

Father Artus now writes that although he had raised the average attendance to 45 for the greater part of last quarter, still owing to many Indians being absent from the Reserve in the early part of August, the average had fallen to 38 for the whole quarter, and while claiming that the general average will reach 45 he points out that certain unavoidable things may occur to reduce the average so that he could not always count upon receiving $500.00 a year, the amount required to pay the salaries of two teachers who will be needed for the school.\nA very commodious new school building has lately been put up partly from the funds of the band and the mission, and as the school is divided into a junior and senior divisions two teachers are required.

That only twenty-two of their children attend the school, most of them Band boys located elsewhere and they consider that they should only pay in proportion to the number of children attending, and further that they should be credited with the surplus they have been paying in the past, they said that did not object to pay what was just, but that the Baldwins River Band should pay more having more children attending the school.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Three hundred dollars of this amount is voted by Government, $300 charged the Garden River Band and $300 against the Batchewana Indians, and I may add that the Department considers this a fair division of the account. The Department will, however, be glad to have your views on this subject and any suggestions you can make as to a more equitable arrangement, should you consider that the Batchewana Indians are being over-taxed for the education of their children.

While it has always been recognized that the Church has always been at liberty to nominate teachers when a vacancy occurs, the Department reserves to itself the right to make any such sweeping changes as the one referred to and before you take any further steps in this direction a full report on this subject and the Department's consent will be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

[signature]\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 8th, I beg to say that there is no truth in the statement that the school here is to be conducted by the nuns in future. It was never questioned sometime ago of coming here, but it also was decided long ago that they would not come.\n\nThe Indians state that they are perfectly satisfied with Mr. Reid. I do not know where they took their information, very likely in the same source where they took that the nuns were to conduct the school in future. Acting on the hint left to the church to nominate the teacher, I must say that His Lordship, Right Reverend R. A. O'Connell, D.D., Bishop of Peterborough, the Bishop of this Diocese, is opposed to Mr. Reid's nomination or reengagement as school teacher for another year.\n\nI can also refer you to the School Inspector Mr. J. F. White, who is not satisfied with his success. Here is what he wrote to me on June 22nd 1901:\n\n\"I regret to know that Mr. Reid is again giving you...\"\ntrouble about retaining his position. He will not, however, gain much if he appeals to the Indian Department as our reports on his success would not strengthen his case.\"\n\nAt his visit here in June, Mr. White also spoke to me and quite approved of a change, and he also spoke the same way to others. With these two authorities, I thought I was justified in looking for other teachers in hopes of having better satisfaction.\n\nMr. Reid's daughter told me when she left here at the end of the year, that she would never come back. So this changes the position of Mr. Reid. That same girl has been complaining to me during the two years she has been here, that she was not getting enough of salary.\n\nIt is recognized that I am responsible for the school and I also have many reasons for a change. Mr. Reid would not follow my direction; see for instance, it took him 17 days to make the Return of the last quarter, though the regulations of the Department are that these Returns are to be sent in immediately after the end of the Quarter. Also I never could get Mr. Reid to let the children out at four o'clock; parents were often complaining of it, and I also had to complain about it for this particular reason. Every day, morning and evening, I have to take some of the children across the Garden River in a boat.\nor have a man to do it for me. The children of one class would come out at 4:30 and the man and children had to wait 15 or even 25 minutes before the children of Mr. Reid's class would come out. I also often noticed that he would begin school at 8:15 minutes after 1 o'clock, the same in the morning.\n\nFor Mr. Reid's daughter she has been repeating me right along that she would not come back, even at the beginning of the year. She began to say she was sorry she had come. For her she is out of the question for me, as she had given me notice herself, and I never told her of the notice I had given her father. Both father and daughter could not agree together, how could I get a stranger to agree with Mr. Reid.\n\nChief Michael Cadette who has also received a letter from acknowledging receipt of the petition of July 11th, told me this morning that he did not sign nor allow any one to put his name on a petition to retain Mr. Reid's services. There has been too many petitions made on this Reserve lately, and we can pretty near guess who was at the bottom of them. Before giving notice to Mr. Reid I spoke to the Indian agent, Mr. Wm. Abbott, and he was quite satisfied of the change. He might tell you something himself about Mr. Reid.\nUnder the direction of our Bishop and the approval of the school Inspector and the consent of the Agent and chief of Garden River Band I acted in good faith and for the good of the school in giving notice to Mr. Reid. He knew or ought to know that his position is changed since his daughter has decided not to come back, and he never asked me himself to reengage him, even after the conditions were changed. The Indians never spoke to me about it, though on June 14th they sent me a petition or rather a summons to retain Mr. Reid's services. They gave me only six hours to comply with the request, and after the six hours they wrote to the Department to do so at once.\n\nSome of the Indians whose names appeared on that petition told me they were sorry they had signed the petition, the chief himself declared in writing before a witness that he had been deceived when they asked him to put his name. He does not want to retain his services, though somebody has put his name on the petition. I have already been too long, and I could say much more, I wanted to give as full information as possible. Hoping this will be satisfactory and that the question will soon be settled, to allow me to secure\nTeachers for August the 15th, the opening of the school. With this delay and so late, I am afraid I may not be able to have the teachers who have made applications. It is not my intention to act against Our Bishop's direction, nor the School Inspector's advice and it is not question for the nuns coming here to conduct the school.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant\n\nH. Caron\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Chief Baclutha of the Barlow River Indian Reserve called on me with letter of the above date stating that you had received a petition of the 11th inst., asking that Mr. Paul and his daughter be retained as teachers of the Roman Catholic School on the Barlow River Reserve.\n\nChief Baclutha desire to say that he has no knowledge of either the petition or letter received by you having been sent, except that he never signed the same.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servt.,\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 26th July, 1901.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your instant letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to the proposed change of teachers for the Roman Catholic school on the Garden River Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that our report places this matter in a very different light from that shown in the petition of the Indians and the Department will sanction the change you propose to make in obtaining new teachers to conduct this school, provided your nominees possess the proper qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. H. Caron, S.J.,\nGarden River,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am happy to state that I have come to an arrangement with my two teachers. They are two Misses Downey, of Eganville. They are qualified, having six and four years experience. They are the two sisters, not two men.\n\nNow, as Mr. Reid is putting his application for the Indian agency at Salt Lake City, I thought I would tell you something about him to give you a specimen of what he is.\n\nI paid him last night his money for the last quarter, and he wants now to be paid for July, the time he has been waiting for his money. He blames consequently the Department for it. Our agreement is clear with me, he is to be paid quarterly by the Department. Another thing, he is residing in one of my houses on this Reserve, and I cannot get him out, and I need my house for the new teachers.\n\nIf the Department does not come to my aid, I will have to have him ejected by the sheriff, what will cost me money. I cannot either find out who has signed the petition of the Chiefs, and what names are on it. Chief Michael Cadotte, who received your letter acknowledging the petition, told me he was ready to swear.\nHe had not signed such petition, others also whom I supposed could have signed, told me they had refused of course I do not know if their name is on the petition or not. If really they have used the name of Chief Michael Cadette to have others to sign said petition it seems to me that the Indian act, 1886 Chap. 43, section 12, would be hard on somebody.\n\n\"Every one who incites any Indian to commit any indictable offence is guilty of felony and liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years.\"\n\nI beg your pardon for troubling you too much about Mr. Reid, but I wanted to let you know what kind of man the Department would have, if it was to take his application for the agency into consideration. I like to be friend and side in peace with everybody.\n\nThanking you for your kindness and hoping you will see a friendly spirit in this letter.\n\nI could not but tell the Department how Mr. Reid is stirring up a few of the Indians. I hope you have received other Mr. Abbott's letter relating to the declaration of Michael Cadette.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJ. D. W.

May Ist Mr. Reid gives no sign of moving away.\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that a difficulty has arisen between the teacher Mr. Reid of the Roman Catholic School at Harden River Reserve and Rev. Father Caron, the priest in charge. It appears the latter refuses to leave or give up possession of the house he has rented.\n\nThe Rev. Father has applied to me to take action in the matter but I am not sure of the powers I hold as agent of the Indian Department and have taken no action until I am instructed by your Department. It appears that the school buildings are situated on property held by the Church and whether an order from me would be sufficient.\n\nI might refer to Mr. Abbott's letter of 24th ult., as connected with this matter.

Van Abbott, was false and erroneous in its entirety. The said chief having denied all knowledge of the circumstances of which he was cognizant, and knew perfectly well having been present at the meeting held for that purpose, and as you have a copy of the request to Rev. H. Caron, asking him to reengage our teacher, you will see M. Cadotte's name heading the list by his order.\n\nHaving interviewed Mr. Van Abbott on the subject he stated that you asked for reasons for not reengaging the teacher but he gave no definite reply what\nanswer he sent you to that question.\n\nNow since your letter to the Chief, who is in bosom confidence with the priest and in opposition to the people, the latter (priest) has changed his mind from getting nuns which he says he never mentioned (another falsehood) to getting two girls, which is worse still\u2014because it is a well known fact that no girl or girls can conduct this school. Moreover since the school was established we always had female teachers, but a good scholar or even a meddling one, never left the school yet. Now Rev. Carson takes no interest in the school, he had no examination at Christmas nor prizes, nor at the close on 30th June last, nor even went into the school on the latter occasion.\n\nThe whole trouble arises out of a bitter spite and vindictiveness on the part of the Rev. H. Carson against the teacher because he tried to keep half the teacher's salary in October\u20141900 saying, as how he did not earn it during the holidays, but when the teacher informed the Indian Agent, Mr. Wm Abbott ordered payment at once, since that he (the priest) is desirous of removing the teacher whom we desire to keep.\n\nThirdly inform the present Indian Act to engage our teacher, as the priest will not do so. He announced from the pulpit on Sunday last that school would reopen on the 15th inst., as the teacher asked for the keys today, he was told there would\nbe no school, hence there is no school\nand we do not know when there will be any\nunless your good offices interpose at once.\nAnxiously awaiting your reply,\nI beg to remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.J.

School of Garden River. The teachers I have now will not stay at this salary, and if they go away I am afraid that other teachers would do the same. The way that everything is too dear around here and at Sainte Marie, and that they have to pay too much for board which is not very good with that.\n\nSo I hope you will consider my request and grant the increase of salary. I cannot afford myself to add to the salary, for as you are aware, I give tea, sugar and milk to the school children every day, besides having a man to start the fires in the school, and I do not mention what I give as prizes to the children as a reward for application and attendance.\n\nI may also add that generally the teachers have to pay much for their transportation as there is no teacher available in this part of the country.\nand there is nothing very attractive as a rule in an indian village.\n\nHoping that my request will find favor with you and that the increase of salary asked for will be granted.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant\n\nH.

There is a Roman Catholic, as well as a Protestant school on the reserve, which meet the requirements of the larger portion of the members of the Band, and even if some of the children are compelled to walk nearly two miles in winter to attend school, it is no great hardship, as the main travelled road passes close to their homes, and white children in rural districts often have to exceed this distance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nChief\n\nPatrick N\u00e9hanegooding,\nGarden River,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the unsatisfactory attendance at the Garden River (R.C.) school. The last report of the Separate School Inspector showed that out of a total school population of 70, most of whom reside within a reasonable distance of the school, only 47 were enrolled and the average attendance for three months previous to his visit was only 19. This is a very poor showing and the Department would like to see the teachers of this school make some vigorous effort to improve matters. Unless some improvement can be effected the Department will not be warranted in continuing the services of two teachers.\n\nExperience has shown that a great deal depends upon the personal efforts of the teachers in arousing the interests of the parents and thus inducing a more regular attendance and the Department is prepared to co-operate if you can offer any practical suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

For two weeks now the burden of the whole school weighs on the shoulders of the one teacher. The teacher of the higher class is laid up with pneumonia. She is out of danger now but cannot resume her work before a few weeks. I will bring home the remarks of the Dept. as soon as circumstances will allow me. There was want of tact on the part of the younger teacher last fall in carrying out the regulations of the school which caused a sudden fall in the attendance. It gave me much trouble to bring back to school those pupils who were displeased. This along with sickness and other reasons demoralized the school last winter also. I would be sorry to change these teachers before giving them another chance, for they understand the children quite well. New comers always find it hard at the start. I hope the attendance will improve as soon as the teacher has recovered. Yours truly,\n\nJ.K. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As my predecessor here, Rev. V. Renaud, S.J., did not make any arrangements to that end, I have to do so.\n\nFirst, dear Sir, I would propose to the Department to have just one teacher, my predecessor having told me that one could do the work on hand.\n\nSecondly, I would suggest to the Department to grant the teacher I will propose unto them, a salary of $500.00. The two Misses Reid cost the Department last year $600.00 + $50.00 for fuel.\n\nThe person I have in view\u2014though I do not yet know her name\u2014is capable, having had 3 or 4 years experience, and is highly recommended as to her character. Her certificate expired this year, she would, I think, board in some family near the school.\n\nAs the matter is urgent and I have not yet made the acquaintance of Indian Agent Mr. Webb of Sault-St. Marie, I forward this directly to you.

School.\n\nThe applicant's name is Margaret Devoy, aged 23 years, P.O. address Eganville, Ont. She has been teaching for 5\u00bd years, in Bigotting, Co. Renfrew. She has been a successful teacher - as vouched for by Rev. P.J. Dowdall, P.O. of Eganville. For the last two years she has received permits from the local Inspector of Public Schools, and Mr. Michael O'Brien, Inspector of Separate Schools is willing to give her a permit to teach in Garden River. She has an excellent character. But she asks a salary of $500.00, with $50.00 additional, to help her to buy fuel, if she take the house too well in (it is an old house of ours, now in pretty bad shape), or else she wants the Department to pay for her board, if she can find a satisfactory boarding house. Her board would come to some $170.00, or so, for a month.\n\nConsidering everything, I refuse Miss Devoy's application, and let her know my decision by this very mail. I am convinced the Department will be of the same opinion as I.\n\nI will make at once application for another teacher offering a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, if the candidate is capable of\nhandling successfully the work previously done by the two teachers,\nas you say yourself. I suppose this will be alright.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly\n\nJos. Specht, S.S.\nOttawa, September 10, 1913.\n\nRev.

I taught in the Goulais Bay School part of the year 1905, and for the last five years I had charge of the Garden Village Day School in the Sturgeon Falls Agency.

School, I beg to say that we do not want any help in the winter months. The best attendance is in the Summer, say from April 1st to November 1st if we would be allowed an assistant at that time I would act as truant Officer myself and guarantee good attendance. I have had the Policeman acting as Truant Officer, and I would assist him personally in getting the children to school.\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from Miss Mc Dermott, and I would recommend her being engaged to commence Teaching after the Easter Holidays.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

The school-house contains two school-rooms and they have always had two teachers there. During the winter the attendance is not more than one teacher can look after comfortably. As there are over seventy-five Roman Catholic children on the reserve of school age there would be plenty for two teachers, if they all attended. Mr. Agent McNabb says that if they were allowed an assistant from April to November he would act as truant officer himself and guarantee a good attendance.\n\nMiss McDermott, who formerly successfully taught the Garden Village School near Sturgeon Falls for some years, would be willing to take the position for the short term and teach the younger children. Both rooms are equipped and I think...\nthink it would be to the advantage of the school to allow an assistant for the summer months.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Many of the children come from French Bay, a distance of 2\u00bd miles and these never start back after the Christmas vacation, until the end of March. I would suggest that for the winter quarter one of the teachers teach in the Bay. A small room fitted up temporarily would be all that would be necessary for the three months. Both class rooms are heated here and only pupils for one. Let this second fire be kept in vacant house or room in the Bay. This of course only for three winter months. For the remainder of the term, the present conditions are excellent. One teacher for the junior and one for the senior room is a much better arrangement than the two teachers with a class of junior and senior pupils in different schools.\n\nIS JANITOR'S WORK PERFORMED IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER? Not so well as would be desired.\nSeparate School, Teacher, Miss Margaret Darby.\n\nPupils in section of school age 70.\n\nOn roll, Senior, 31\nJunior, 22\n\nAverage 17\n\nThis school is without the teacher's manuals, they also are without any kind of books on nature study.\n\nI would recommend that the Ont. Teachers Manuals be sent, also Comstock's Manual of Nature Study.\n\nThe pupils are bright, they seem to be progressing splendidly with the present teacher.\n\nThey are planning to have gardens at home, also at the school this year.\n\nThe wood for the schools should be cut one year ahead, green wood makes poor wood and it takes more than if seasoned.\n\nEnglish School, Teacher, L. T. Hardyman.\n\nPupils in section of school age 30\n\nOn roll 19\nPresent 9\n\nIn grade 3 there are 2\n2 5\n1 11\n\nThere are no pupils in the 4th grade.\n\nAlthough Mr. Hardyman has been in this school for 15 yrs. he has not, as yet, had a single pupil in grade 4.\n\nI am of the opinion that a new teacher should be engaged. My reasons are as follows:\n\n(1) Mr. Hardyman is not a competent teacher, has never had any training as a teacher.\n\n(2) He is very sloshy about the school, often is not properly dressed.\nREPORT ON SASKATCHEWAN RIVER AGENCY.\n\nBY R.M. Abraham, B.B.A.\n\n(3) He has the school closed much too often, I am told by a reliable white man that often the school is closed 2 days a week.\n\n(4) He is at present paying marked attention to an Indian girl of questionable character and the Indians are talking.\n\n(5) He has adequate private means to live on.\n\n(6) The parents refuse to send their children to him.\n\nI believe a suitable boarding place could be found for a lady teacher at Mr. Addys, the store keeper.\n\nI interviewed Inspector Green regarding Mr. Hardyman's work in the school. He admitted that he is a poor teacher not a competent teacher, but said that he had no other school where he could place such a poor teacher. He said that he didn't think the Indian Dept. required a very high standard.\n\nI would recommend that the truant officer be instructed to prosecute parents who refuse to send their children to school. The attendance is very poor, as you will see.\nGarden River, Ont.,\nJune 28th, 1918.\n\nMr. A. D. McNabb,\nSault Ste.

This, I am willing to do, if I get the above mentioned salary but decidedly not otherwise.\n\nWhen sending in the reports would you kindly make a note of the fact that my September cheque was $47.50 instead of $50.00 which should make my June cheque $202.50?\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nMargaret M.

(RG 10, Volume 6127, File 390-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent McNabb forwards the resignation of Miss Jean McDermott, assistant teacher at the Garden River (R.C.) Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present quarter, and enclosed a doctor's certificate stating that she is permanently unable to carry on the duties of school teacher. Miss McDermott requests that, in view of her long service, she be granted super-annuation. There is no provision for the granting of superannuation to teachers of Indian day schools, but a gratuity on retirement has been granted in the case of several teachers in the past.\n\nMiss McDermott has been in the employ of the Department since 1908, having first been engaged as teacher of the Goulais Bay School. She was transferred to the Garden Village School, Sturgeon Falls Agency, after the summer holidays in 1909. Her salary was $350.00 per annum, which was increased to $400.00 on January 1st, 1912. She taught this school till June 30th, 1914, and was re-engaged as assistant teacher of the Garden River (R.C.) School, beginning duties April 1st, 1915, at a salary of $400.00 per annum. This was increased to $450.00 on July 1st, 1916, and further increased to $500.00 on July 1st, 1917, and further increased to $550.00, her present salary, on January 1st, 1920. Besides salary she has also received bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the past three years. This covers a period of thirteen years.\n\nThe Department has, in the past, granted a gratuity on retirement in several cases, as follows:\n\nIn 1909, Mrs. C. A. Vollick, who had taught the No. 3 School on the Oneida Reserve for a period of 17 years and who resigned on account of failing health, was granted a gratuity of $100.00, in recognition of her long and faithful service. The salary allowed her at that time was at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nA gratuity\nA gratuity was granted Miss Annie Kehoe, teacher of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School in June, 1915. Miss Kehoe was in the service of the Department for eight years. She contracted tuberculosis from her work among the Indians. In addition to teaching, she acted as field matron and visited and attended the sick on the two reserves on which she had taught. The Department allowed her a gratuity equal to one-quarter of her yearly salary, or total of $125.00.\n\nL. F. Hardyman, teacher of the Anglican School on the Garden River Reserve, after completing 30 years of service as a teacher in Indian schools, was granted a gratuity equal to six months' salary (March 31, 1919). The amount paid him was $300.00.\n\nIn November, last, Mr. John R. Lickers, teacher of the No. 5 School on the Six Nations Reserve, retired after 35 years' service as a teacher in Indian schools. He was allowed a gratuity of six months' salary, which amounted to $350.00.\n\nMr. Agent McNabb states that Miss McDermott has been a faithful, efficient, painstaking teacher, always at her post, never finding fault with her work or surroundings, but cheerful and kind and beloved by her pupils and recommends that the Department grant her some assistance for the few remaining years of her life.\n\nI would draw your attention to the case of Miss Kehoe, mentioned above, who was granted a gratuity on retirement on account of tuberculosis, which she claimed she contracted on account of her association with the Indians.\n\nI would recommend, in view of the Miss McDermott's faithful service and the circumstances under which she is compelled to resign and also to the fact that it is impossible for teachers to save any money from the salaries paid them, that the Department allow her a gratuity on her retirement equal to at least one quarter's salary, namely, $137.50. This could be paid from the appropriation for Indian Education, as was done in the cases mentioned above.\nWestmeath, Ont., April 12/61.\n\nMr. L. D. McLean,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nRoth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDo you know if there will be a vacancy in Garden River (P.C.) School after the summer holidays? If there is, will you consider my application?\n\nI hold a second class non-professional certificate, with model training and have about five years experience. As to my ability to teach I refer you to Mr. Inspector, Mr. L. D. Cruells, Pembroke, Ont.\n\nIf there is no vacancy in above mentioned school, would accept a position in another locality.

You should state when Miss McDermott gave up her duties and, as soon as returns have been received covering the period up to the time when she leaves and the full amount of salary and bonus due her is paid, payment can then be made of the above gratuity. Kindly state as soon as possible whether Miss McDermott has given up her duties and also whether there is any further balance of salary due her. A cheque for her salary to March 31st, last, has been sent.\n\nThe Department has received an application for the position from Miss Malvina Cahill, Westmeath, Ont. She is the holder of a second-class non-professional certificate, with model training, and has had five years' experience. If you have not succeeded in obtaining the services of a teacher to succeed Miss McDermott, you should communicate with Miss Cahill with a view to obtaining her services. She would be allowed the same salary as was paid Miss McDermott.

On enquiry, I find that this teacher will hardly remain; chief reason is the condition of boarding facilities in Cutler. Beyond a doubt, if a teacher's residence was here, it would be an inducement to remain. Maybe this teacher could be engaged as principal of Garden River Indian School. I would recommend this, for the following reasons:\n\n1. A strong principal is needed there.\n2. Children would attend better.\n3. Standard of proficiency would be raised.\n\nHowever, a residence should be built at Cutler or rather at Kenabutch.

I do not think that the two got along very well together, and of the two I would rather loose Miss Toner than Miss Cahill. Miss Toner is not liked by either pupils or parents, and Miss Cahill is worth a good deal more money than Miss Toner.

I do not approve of changing from one school to another although I do believe that Miss Angela is a better Teacher than her Sister, I cannot say that I am very favorably impressed with either of them. I am satisfied that the best Teacher in my Agency is where there are the least number of Pupils, I mean Miss Rose Chaput at Batchewana. I would be very willing to let Miss Toner at Garden exchange with Miss Chaput after the summer Holidays. If Miss Daly had remained here until this time we would have had a number of children in the High School, but now I cannot see that any of them are any farther along in their studies than when she left, as far as I can see I do think that Miss Chaput would do better work at Garden River than any one since Miss Daly left. Miss Cahill was good and was well liked by the Pupils and Parents but she was only teaching the Junior Classes. I tried to get her to come back but she would not for even a raise of pay, she gave me her reason but I do not want to interfere with the Teachers as long as the Inspector is satisfied. At the same time I do not think it would be wise to make the change asked for, of course I will leave that for Mr Ferrier to decide, I am satisfied to live up to what he says.\n\nAwaiting your answer soon.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

I would recommend that Miss Rose Chaput be transferred from Batchewana to the Garden River School and that Miss BellasXM Peletier a former Teacher at Batchewana be given the Batchewana School. I cannot say anything about Miss Bush as I do not think she has very much to say about the school. I wrote you last year about making a change at Garden and have Miss Cahill appointed Principal but it seems the Inspector gave Miss Toner a good name. Miss Chaput has been confined to Batchewana all winter and she appears to me to be a good teacher and has good common sense and I hope you will see your way clear to give her the Principal's place at Garden River.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the reports of the Separate School Inspector, the Travelling Nurse and yourself concerning the work in the classroom, the condition of the school room and the poor attendance, it has been decided that it would be in the interests of the work to make a change of senior teacher for the next school year. You may therefore inform Miss Mildred Toner that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz.: June 30th, next. You will be good enough to see that before she leaves she prepares and hands to you her quarterly return of attendance, etc.\n\nWe will approve of the transfer of Miss Rose Chaput from Batchawana to take charge of the senior room to succeed Miss Toner - the salary allowed her will be the same as was paid Miss Toner. You should ascertain definitely whether she will be agreeable to the transfer from Batchawana to take charge of the senior room at the Garden River R. C. School and inform the Department accordingly.\n\nMiss Ada Bush, the present junior teacher, may remain for the next school year. You should also ascertain from her whether she will be prepared to return after the summer holidays and inform the Department accordingly.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher at Batchawana to succeed Miss Chaput, I beg to say that we will approve of the appointment of Miss Beila Pelletier who formerly taught this school. The salary allowed her will be the same as is now paid Miss Chaput. All the above salaries will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

C. Indian Day School. I have to confirm official day letter of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"Reference Garden River Roman Catholic Day School.\n\nIt is considered false economy to move present school building and to erect separate teacher's residence. Arrangements will be made to prepare plans and let contract for combined school and residence early next spring. Full explanation in today's letter.\"\n\nI have to inform you that the proposed building activity in the case of this school has been given serious consideration, and, in view of your recommendation, it has been decided that lot 135, of the new survey of the reserve, would be the most central site for the Roman Catholic pupils. As you were informed in the official telegram, it is not considered wise to move a 26-year-old building, at considerable cost, to a site on the main road. The Superintendent of Indian Education and the Separate School Inspector both report that the present school is not attractive from any standpoint. A new teacher's residence has to be erected in any case, and it is considered in the best interests of economy to arrange for a combined school and teacher's residence. Such a building would contain two classrooms on the ground floor with cloak-rooms for children. The teacher's living rooms would be upstairs and might consist of a combined kitchen and dining-room, two bedrooms with clothes closets, etc. A proper basement should be provided with furnace and perhaps a dry chemical closet for winter's use. The funds necessary, over and above the $8,000 which will be taken from the Garden River and Batchewana Capital Accounts, will be provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe plans for such a building should be prepared by the Department and the contract awarded. I regret that this arrangement does not provide adequate residence facilities for the two teachers at the Garden River Indian Day School for the coming winter, and the Department will give favourable consideration to any recommendation you make with a view to ameliorating conditions for them.\n\nYou should make arrangements with the members of the Band to release lot 135 for school purposes. The resolution in this connection should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to refer you to official letter of the 17th ultimo, in which you were informed that the Department had made arrangements with the Nardene Sisters at Spanish, Ont., for the future teaching services at this school. Miss Chaput was informed on the same date of these arrangements and also that her services would not be required at the Garden River School after the end of the school year which has recently closed. She was also informed that, if she is desirous of continuing in Indian school work, if she would write the Department, her application would receive favourable consideration. I may say that we have already placed Miss Bush in a suitable school, but no word has been received from Miss Chaput as to whether she desires another school or not.\n\nA number of our day schools are being conducted by the Nardene Sisters, who are giving excellent satisfaction, and the Department considered, when they made the offer to take over the Garden River R. C. School, that it would be in the best interests of the work to have them do so. The Nardene Sisters are a teaching Order and besides, these workers take an active interest in the welfare of the Indians - not only in the work they perform as teachers, but also among the older Indian women on the Reserve. We have already received the nomination of the two teachers who are taking charge of this school, and it is hoped to inform you in the near future of their names, salary, etc.\n\nYou should inform the Indians who signed the petition forwarded by you of the arrangements made for the future carrying on of the teaching activity at this school. The Department regrets that it is unable to comply with their request to continue the services of Miss Chaput.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The bonus has been increased to $4.15.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nMiss Z. St. James,\nGirls' Indian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have been appointed to take charge of the Junior Class at Garden River, over one year ago. You advised me to carry out the policy which I thought best for the good of the children and the school. I want to thank you for that advice and I followed it very closely and I can say that progress was made. I have stuck strictly to the interest of my class in order to avoid friction and even at that I have to take a lot of abuse and interference which really does not affect my teaching but makes life pretty miserable.\n\nLast year I put on a concert with the Junior Class only. The class did very well and was highly appreciated by Mr. Greening, the School Inspector and Mr. J.J. Young, who were present for the concert. This year I want to put on a similar concert by the Juniors.\nto avoid any friction, interference or misunderstanding I would like a note from you authorizing me to do so as interference has already begun in this matter.\n\nI like Garden River very much and there is a great deal of work to be done with the children.\n\nThere are thirty-five children in my class ranging from seven to ten years. There are thirteen boys who can serve mass and say the Latin prayers by heart. Six of my last year boys have passed into the Senior Room having nineteen altar boys in all. This was one of the greatest accomplishments. The Cubs have been organized and are progressing nicely. Their initiation will take place early in the New Year.\n\nFather Dwyer has built a large hall and it is at the disposal of the children. This hall is the basement of the new church and Mass will be said there till the upper structure is completed. Father also bought the school ground which is joined to the school yard. It allows the children to play in it but the school yard is rather small. Father is expecting a Resident priest but he has not arrived yet. I hope that he will.\narrive soon and lighten Father's responsibilities.\n\nThe coal stores were a problem but Father Davis showed us how to clear them and they have been wonderful.\n\nI expect that you will give my request prompt attention as the situation is not very bright.\n\nI thank you for all favours and I will strive to go about with my duties correctly and efficiently.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMary Morris.\nOttawa, 2 December 1946.\n\nDear Miss Morris:\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to arranging a Christmas concert for the children in the junior room at the Garden River R.C. School.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to issue instructions regarding such activities. You should be guided by the wishes of the Principal of the school.\n\nAn extra copy of this letter is being sent to Miss Goody.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Mary Morris,\nBox 307,\nSAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI received your letter and was quite surprised with it and your sending a copy to the Principal. The situation is now unbearable.\n\nThe matter was discussed with a person of very good judgment before I wrote to you. This person knows and understands the situation perfectly.\n\nSome of the reasons why I am resented and subject to so much is: I have results to show of my best year's teaching and the children's progress; Secondly, I have order and discipline in my Class Room. Something that cannot be found in the Senior Room. The pupils of the Senior Room have positively no respect for anyone, not even the Parish Priest.\n\nAs I said before, the situation is unbearable. I am \"down\" but not \"out.\" There is so much work to be done with\nthat there is no time for disagreements.\n\nIn any matter concerned I have the very best of backing here. I am doing my work and only hope it continues so well.\n\nI hope that you will give me some assistance in the foregoing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Maria\nOttawa, 13 December 1946.\n\nRev. Dwyer,\nGeneral Hospital,\nSAULT STE. MARIE,\nOntario.\n\nDear Father Dwyer:\n\nRecently I received a letter from Miss Morris requesting authority to plan a Christmas concert at the junior room at the Garden River R.C. School.\n\nI considered this a most unusual request as a matter of this kind should be settled by the Principal. With this in mind, I wrote Miss Morris and sent a copy to Miss Goody (see copy attached). Miss Morris has replied and from this letter, it is more or less evident that the Principal and herself are not on very good terms.\n\nI know you visit the Garden River Reserve regularly and while I dislike troubling you, I thought you might be aware of the situation and would let me know exactly what the trouble is. It is understood that anything you write will be treated confidentially.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from letter dated Dec. 12, 1946 received from Miss Zoe St. James.\n\nOriginal on File No. 36-5-1.\n\n\"You are aware that Miss Mary Morris lacks co-operation with the principal of Garden River R.C.

Children (R.C.) of age for school are about 75. The free coverage of persons in winter 30 and in fullwood Spring about 65. The school house and the furniture belong to the people. Now this building is so small and in the same time so old and rotten to be worth repairing. The Missionaries are willing to contribute their part for our school, but as the cost of a suitable house with a lodging for the teacher would be about $1000 dollars they ask the Department for a pecuniary assistance. Besides, when all the families are in the Reserve, the number of the children (48, 58, 55) are in very different standing to buy for one teacher an appropriation of $150 dollars ought to be given to the principal, for a second teacher to be called in the Spring.\n\nIn attention of the Department might be called on the fact that the Badgerwam band paid always larger as I know the whole salary, while many children belonging to the other Band enjoyed only the advantage of the schools. This other band ought to join the supplementary salary required for a second teacher, while the money for the building of a new school ought to be divided at least equally by one and the other band.\n\nNow the majority of the children in the Gordon River band coming to school being catholic, they might give up their protestant school where no free children are going and we would take charge of all the children, having the teachers for the whole year, provided our school would be always a Roman Cath Sep. School and is so although we might find objections to that policy.\nwe do not hesitate and propose it because we think it is the best calculated to open the eyes of our good and dear people.\n\nWe ask for a prompt reply, as we are anxious to have the building as soon as the money shall be granted.\n\nI am dear sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.J.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward you herewith copy of letter received from Rev.

Gentlemen he informed me that the Society would be able to raise $500.00 for the building and he wished that the Department would furnish the other $500.00, half to be charged to the Garden River Band and half to the Balcanance Band, the $150.00 for Extra Teacher to be paid by the Garden River Band who at present contribute nothing toward the Catholic School.\n\nInform him that the matter after being approved by you would have to be submitted to a joint council of the Band, and I understand the amount asked for was larger than they would be willing to vote in view of the attention to Section 76 but action of the Modern Act.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Arthas, the undersigned begs to state that when he visited this school on the 17th September last there were 43 pupils present, and the school-room was overcrowded with that number. The building was old and inconvenient and the enrollment has reached as high as 56 during the current year. A modern school-building is the undersigned thinks, a necessity and he considers that the Garden River Band, who are chiefly interested in the maintenance of this school, should be called upon to contribute towards its erection, but before deciding upon the amount they should give to this purpose, it would be well to have a detailed estimate of the cost of the proposed new building to which the R.C. authorities propose to give $500. The Garden River Band have about $70,000 to their credit, while the Batchewana Band, who are asked to contribute half the cost have...\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa,\n\nabout $10,000 to their credit. The school would be on the Garden River Reserve which is about 40 miles from the Batchewana Reserve, and the undersigned thinks it would be unfair to ask the Batchewana Band to contribute to any extent to the erection of this building.\n\nThis school is doing very good work,\u2014the children are encouraged to attend by receiving a warm mid-day meal. Although the Protestant School is the older, the Roman Catholic School appears to have far out-stripped it in the matter of attendance, the average attendance at the latter being fully four times as great as at the former.\n\nWith regard to the application for the salary of a new teacher during Spring and Fall, the undersigned does not think that the attendance would justify this expenditure, as the teachers of the Ontario Public Schools are supposed to look after from 45 to 50 pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

G.A. Artus, Principal of the Roman Catholic School on the Garden River Reserve, asking for assistance towards building a new school-house and lodging for the teacher, and also for a grant of $150, as an extra allowance for a second teacher during the Spring and Fall terms; and in reply I beg to say that while the Department is alive to the necessity for more accommodation for this school, it does not consider that it would be justified in taxing the Batchewana Band for a contribution to a new building. The Garden River Indians being most concerned in the maintenance of this school, which is in very flourishing condition, should, it is thought, contribute solely towards the erection of the proposed new school building.\n\nAs it is suggested that the Indians should contribute one-half of the funds necessary for the proposed building, the Department considers that it should be furnished with a detailed estimate, and plan. The Department is willing to contribute from the funds of the Garden River Band an amount not to exceed $500 for this purpose, but it does not consider\n\nWm Van Abbott, Esq:\nIndian Lands Agent\nthat it would be justified, in view of the attendance at this school, in expending the amount asked for for a second teacher, as the teachers of the Ontario Public Schools are supposed to look after from 45 to 50 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 21st May in answer to mine of the 16th inst enclosing letter of Rev.

I may also here say that there are between 30 or 40 children of the Batchewana Band on the school roll. I therefore think that they should contribute something toward the amount. There was great dissatisfaction among the Barlow River Band at the small amount of money paid them this spring and I was unable to pay them anything in a court circuit having reached me.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General I have the honor to be\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then we agreed to pay $100.00 for ceiling but school also to have their share of the expenses. The capital will be used next year and will be used for its distribution in the future.\nDear Sir,\n\nIndian agent Van. Abbot communicated to you my request for pecuniary assistance that enable me to build a new school-house, and for an augmentation in the salary in view of having two teachers in the spring and in the fall when the number of children is very large.\n\nThe reply has been that 500 dollars might be granted provided the band consent. It seems most probable that it would not consent, so except perhaps if that money were taken from their consolidated fund.\n\nNow I find in the law ruling Indians affairs a means to build this school without asking from the people a cent more than what is due. (Ch. 43, 16975.) For a read as follows: \"... the teacher 'always' shall be of the same denomination as the majority of the band, and... the Protestant or Catholic minority may likewise have a separate school...\" Consequently in any Indian reserve, the principal school must be always of the same denomination as the majority of the band, and again consequently the principal salary must be paid to the teacher belonging to the same denomination.\n\nNow the Catholics are in the Garden River band, and have been for years, if not always, in great majority. The only school supported by that band (or the principal one, if there must be two) ought to have been theirs, and must become now theirs if the law is the law.\n\nThe Garden River band pays (if my informations are right) 300 dollars to the first school, and probably nothing to our Catholic teacher who is paid.\nBy the Bahnawang band.\n\nThe law shall be observed if the 500 dollars are given to us. Being sure of that sum yearly, I will have a second teacher where it will be necessary, and borrow money to build the new school large enough to seat as many children as might come from the two bands. And when the school-house will be all set instead of 600 dollars yearly (300 from the Garden River and 300 from the Bahnawang) I might be able to do with 200, provided the 200 gift be applied to another teacher at Goulais Bay. So the Indians will not have to give rent as they do already; and the law will be obeyed.\n\nI hope, Sir, that you will be able to give me a prompt answer because I must start the work as soon as possible.\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in X,\nG.

A. Carter\n\nGarden River, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI find today your favor 15328-5, dated June 26th, in reply to my application for assistance in the building of a new school-house here, and I see with great surprise that my request has been misunderstood in several respects, and particularly as to the establishment of a school at Garden River, to which I did not make the least allusion in any preceding letter. (At least, in the copy I kept here of the important part of my letters, I do not find any word about it.)\n\nAgain, this is my request: The Indian Act reads as follows: Ch. 43, No. 76, \"The teacher shall be always of the same denomination as the majority of the band,\" and \"the minority may likewise have a separate school... under certain conditions.\" Now, here, at Garden River, the Catholics have been, for years if not always, the great majority in the band of Garden River called otherwise the Mingwak Band. Consequently, the teacher for the school of that band ought to have been, and ought to be now a Catholic teacher, and any cost paid to another teacher before that Catholic teacher be appointed and paid, has been paid and is yet paid against the law... most evidently.\n\nSo I apply to the Officer to whom the maintaining and the enforcing of the law is given in charge, to obtain a fair application of it... because it is just and the common interest of the two bands residing here, to have a good school with teachers in conformity of religious principles with the majority of them.\n\n300 dollars are paid to me already here for the salary of\n\nIndian Affairs.

Charitably the children of the Stingwah band have been taught here for years. But the law gives us more rights, because it is the interest of the great majority, we want to enjoy full liberty.\n\nI say again \"Give me the 300 dollars that have been for years given to the Protestant teacher. Being sure of that sum, send teacher when it shall be necessary, and borrow a school large enough to seat as many children as possible.\" So the Indians will not have to give up their land, and there will be here a good schoolhouse with public teachers, but where are will be some Christian zeal. \u2014 Let us hope that the Stingwah band will be so and have a school that according to the law must mostly most of the\n\nreceive a prompt\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nOttawa 10th July 1895.\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst. In further reference to your application for assistance to build a new school house for the Catholic Indians residing on the Garden River Reserve. And in reply I beg to say that the following statement was made in the concluding paragraph of your letter of the 3rd ultimo: \"And when the school house will be all paid, instead of $600 dollars yearly ($300 from the Garden River band and $300 from the Badgering band) I might be able to do with $400, provided the $200 left be applied to another school teacher at Godin's bay,\" from which you will see that no misunderstanding took place.\n\nIn regard to your remarks as to the present mode of payment to the two schools now in operation on the Garden River Reserve, I may say that these schools were established years before the passing of the Act to which you refer. The Church of England school having been carried on for more than 30 years while returns from your school have been received since 1873, although the majority of the Indians now on the reserve are apparently Roman Catholics, this was not always the case and the change is no doubt due to the efforts put forth by your Church. Still there is a large number of Protestant Indians on the Reserve who are entitled to have the school still carried on, and the Department could not consent to its being closed for the reasons that they are in the minority, and the attendance is less than...\nThen at your school, or that accommodation could be provided for all the children on the Reserve in your school when rebuilt. Such a course if pursued by the Department would be most unjust as many schools, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, would have to be closed if such a precedent were established or recognized.\n\nThe contribution towards the support of these two schools are made from the Indian School appropriation and the funds of the Garden River and Batchewana Bands - the Garden River Band having the largest attendance as well as the largest capital, contributes the greatest share - but this is only just and is not a violation of any law. It is admitted that your school is doing excellent work and it was to assist it in continuing this good work and to meet the requirements for increased accommodation that the Department consented to recommend a grant of $500.00 towards erecting a new school building.\n\nGood results have in the past been obtained in the Protestant school and the Department looks forward to its future success. The number of children of school age on the Reserve is quite large enough to justify the maintenance of two schools especially as they belong to different religious denominations.\n\nThe Department has under consideration the advisability of re-adjusting the salaries of the Teachers of all its schools, and under the new regime it may be feasible to increase the amount paid to your school.\n\nIn\nIn conclusion I may add that the Department is anxious to assist to the utmost of its power in the education of the Indian children under its charge and its only regret is that the funds placed at its command for this purpose are not larger.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. G. N. Arbus,\nGarden River,\nOntario.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe allusion made to the establishment of school at Godpia-Bay in my letter of July the 25th was in my mind very secondary in importance and written down only for transference; so it is that I did not take copy of it and that I forget altogether.\n\nNow, dear Sir, as a reply to your letter No. 153328-5 of July the 10th, I have to say...\n\n1) That according to a census taken in 1854 by Rev. Father Koster, the Catholics were already thrown in majority at Garden River; the number of Protestant families being 19 with 108 souls, and the number of the Catholic families being 22 with 124 or 129 souls.\n\n2) That a code of laws made to rule a community is supposed to have the effect that matters of great importance be ruled, after a short delay, according to its letter and to some extent, in some cases, before the act is passed. For equitable motives, a state of affairs has been established that is contrary to the law; those who were benefited by that state of affairs continue to get the benefit of it, whereas those in whose favor the new law is made are not permitted to enjoy also the benefit of that law.\n\nConsequently we will be pleased to let the minority of this band have their own way, but in the same time, we want to have also the benefit of the law. We have the majority, and the law is with us; so it seems, sir, that no body that has a right could refuse to give us satisfaction, so much so that in our present case, not but a part of what we consider to be our indisputable right.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If instead of giving a salary to two teachers for the Garden River band, I proposed to have only one school and one teacher for all, but belonging to the same denomination as the majority; it was because I knew that the Department has not much money, and because I was informed that the school of the minority has a very small attendance. My opinion is also that after a short time greater peace and friendliness than in the past would reign in the reserve, because children learning and playing together would by and by bring complete union between the families.\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT Ottawa, 1st August, 1895.\n\nRev.

The plans and specifications have been approved as being satisfactory for a building of the dimensions set forth; but it is questionable whether the Department can assume the responsibility of sanctioning the erection of such a structure. The full grant contemplated by the Department has all along been $500 (See letters of 25th June and 10th July last) and this amount can hardly be increased. Of course if the Mission would contribute the balance of the outlay the Department would not object to a building of the style and size outlined in the plans and specifications being erected. But in the event of the whole expense devolving upon the Department it would be necessary to modify the plans, so that the total cost would not exceed $500\u2014the contemplated grant. This might readily be done by diminishing the size of the whole structure, by providing no room in\n\nRev: G:A: Artus, S:J:\n\nthe Garden River.\n\nOnt:\nattic and by omitting at least one room and the leanto on the ground floor. However, as I have before remarked the Department will not object to the erection of the building as outlined if the maximum Departmental grant be fixed at $500; the balance of the cost to be met by your Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt.-Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Sept. 12, 1895, No. 153328-5, about the grant necessary for the building of a school at Gordon River.\n\nBeing sure that the Department is animated with a spirit of justice, I am certain that after further consideration of the matters alluded to in my letters of July the 1st and July the 22nd, the only equitable decision will appear to you to be one permitting us to have a building in proportion to the number of our children (95 of school-age) and the needs of the place. I make my plea so as to avoid every useless expense, but with the view of having a school strong and comfortable for children and teachers. The Department is aware, I suppose, of the difficulty that teachers have in finding a suitable boarding place in Indian Reserves. Consequently, considered as necessary to have in the same building as the school-room for two teachers. The building intended will cost $1500 fifteen hundred dollars, besides extraordinary expenses; and as the mission is able to afford only a little more than $700 dollars, we ask the Department to grant us kindly the balance, a thousand...\n\n.....first as a compensation for the wrong evidently done to us, although until recently throughout a long series of years; when the money that according to the very text of the law ought to have been given to us, the Majority, was given for the benefit of the Minority.\n\n.....secondly as a grant made once for all instead of a yearly gift of $300 that we are by the law entitled to for the salary of a Catholic teacher for the Gordon River.\n\nIndian Affairs.

My predecessor, in his letter of July the 29th,\ndid ask if I am not mistaken for two clocks, because\nthe school is divided now in two rooms, but if you\ncan supply one of those clocks with a double dial\nthat could be fixed in the partition between the two.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6128, File 390-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nrooms, it would be just as satisfactory as two clocks. As for the description of the clocks, I may say that any clock will do, as long as it keeps time well.\n\nIn reference to the blackboard mentioned in the petition; one of the rooms that counts over 60 pupils possesses but a small blackboard, 2 x 4 ft. It ought to be at least 4 x 10 ft., and must be made of thin boards. The partition and the walls, that are made of wood, do not present a plain surface, an account of grooves perceive in the boards.\n\nI hope these particulars will be sufficient.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nReve Pannache\n\nGarden River, Ont\nOTTAWA 26th August 1927\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant; and in reply I beg to say that the Department notes that you have succeeded Rev. G.A. Artus as Principal of the Garden River Roman Catholic Indian school.\n\nIn reply to your remarks regarding school material asked for by Father Artus, I beg to say that the same was ordered from the Government Stationery Office on the 3rd instant and you will, doubtless, have received it before this.\n\nRegarding the blackboard which you state is necessary I beg to say that you may have one, 10 ft by 4 ft made at the least possible cost. The Department does not consider that two clocks would be necessary, but thinks that if one were placed in the senior room it would answer the purpose, and it would like to be informed as to the cost of a suitable clock.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA.W. McNeill\n\nRev. P. Lamarche,\nGarden River\nOnt:\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nA.M.S.O.\nOctober the 14th,\n\nGarden River, Sept. the 29th 1897.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been authorised by your letter of Aug. the 26th No. 153328\u2014-5, to have a black board 10 ft. by 4 ft. made at the least possible cost. I could not get it made before this time. The lowest price I could get it is $2.00. But this does not include the painting.\n\nIf the Department would be pleased to send one half gallon of that special preparation which is furnished to other schools, I could get the black board painted without any extra charge. If I have to get the paint from Garbato it will cost me $1.50 more.\n\nAs for the cost of a suitable clock I could not find any to be recommended for a lower price than $4.00 or $5.00. But I beg to remark that one clock placed in the senior room, as suggested by your letter, may be sufficient to determine the beginning of class, the end or the recesses. But we live to understand that the teacher in the junior class is to go in the senior room to consult the clock in order to determine the work of each section in her own room, and if the\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. A. Atkin had been authorized by a letter of Mr. D.M. Lea, Secretary July the 30th No. 153328 to purchase two brooms for the school and one axe. The two brooms cost .50\u00a2 each and the axe $1.10.\n\nI also enclose the receipt of the Purser on board the steamer City of Collingwood if I am not mistaken for the amount paid by Rev. G. Atkin for the fare of the children back from Sainte Marie to Manitouwining. I remark that the name of the steamer is not mentioned on the receipt, neither the name of the children, if the Department would require these specifications please let me know in your next letter.\n\nAccording to the new disposition of the rooms, 11 stone pipes and 3 elbows were required for the two stoves, the stone pipes cost 10\u00a2 each and the elbows 20\u00a2 each = $1.70. I have been obliged to purchase them before the authorization of the Department on account of the cold days we had last week.\n\nA desk for the Teacher of the senior room is also wanting. Actually the teacher uses a kind of bench instead of desk.\nBut there is no press or cupboard in the room where she could keep the school material as it is recommended by the Department. I have taken informations about the cost of a suitable desk and I could not get it made here for less than $8.00 or $10.00 with soft wood. We could import one from Toronto for the same price ($10.00) made with hardwood. I have seen one of these desks the other day in the separate school at the Sand St. Marie, they are topless with three drawers on one side and a little press on the other side.\n\nThe other articles wanted for the school, I shall mark down on the quarterly Return.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. Pelanore, Principal Teacher,\nGarden River, Ont.\n\nP.S. This letter ought to have been mailed on Sept. 29th. I took it with me to mail it at Sand St. Marie, but when there I remembered that I had forgotten to send in the different receipts. As I was bound for my missions in Lake Superior, I had to wait until my return to send it.\nOttawa, 10th October, 1897.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, I return herewith the accounts forwarded by you as it is necessary, in order to comply with the regulations governing such matters, that they should be submitted to the Department by the Indian Lands Agent, Mr William Van Abbott, of Sault Ste Marie, Ont., who must certify to them in the usual manner before payment can be made.\n\nIt would be well for you to have the blackboard for the Garden River School painted, and forward the bill for the same to Mr Van Abbott, with the other accounts.\n\nUnder the circumstances described two clocks may be purchased, the price paid should not however exceed $4.00 each.\n\nThe desk required for the senior school room may be bought but it should not cost more than $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

The enclosed bill shows that it cost a little over $3.00, but I would not charge the Dept for the brush which can be used for something else. I do not charge neither the painting itself which has been done by ourselves. The material itself amounts to $1.94, but as there is a little sugar left, we can put it at $1.75. There is one quart of Methylated Alcohol for which I have not the bill; it was required to thin the sugar after adding the lamp black and the white of lead.\n\nThe desk that I have been authorized to purchase for the school, came only last week. It costs $10.00 as stated in my letter of September the 24th, with .35\u00a2 for the freight from Sainte Marie to Garden River. The desk also gives good satisfaction.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev.

I was absent the greatest part of the month of July and August and every time I was called out suddenly for sick calls as far as Batchewana and Maniwissa. When I returned the last time it was too late to write for authorization and some of these things had to be done before opening the school.\n\nSome of the desks' supports were broken, and all of them had to be consolidated as well as the seats. The doors had to be fixed and panes of glass to be replaced. The wooden partition which divides the two rooms is in panels and has to be opened for examinations or some other causes, but this partition was only fixed with nails which had to be removed every time we wanted to open the partition, so I had the panels fixed on hinges and rollers.\n\nThe amount for the work done is $7.50 and for the bolts, screws, hinges, panes of glass $4.61. Total $12.11\n\nI thought it was as well to send these bills with the Returns.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. Chamarche, Principal Teacher,\nR.C.

The manufacturers have never inflicted the public\nwith experiments. For years they have been masters of perfect mechanism. The new \"Ball\nBearing\" School Furniture embodies essential principles that are made possible by experience and expert\nconstruction, aided by the best material that the ingenuity of man can produce. Our new \"Ball Bearing\"\nDesks combine grace and beauty with the highest forms of durability and rigidity. They embody every re-\nquirement\u2014durability, simplicity, comfort, beauty of outline, superb finish, accuracy of fittings, and an abso-\nlutely permanent, noiseless Automatic Folding Seat.\n\nThe Desks made by the CANADIAN OFFICE & SCHOOL FURNITURE CO. are in use in all\ncivilized countries of the Globe.\n\nPATENTED, MANUFACTURED AND CONTROLLED BY THE\n\nCANADIAN OFFICE & SCHOOL FURNITURE CO.,\nPRESTON, ONTARIO.\n\nRECOGNIZED LEADERS IN DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS.\n\"BALL BEARING\" HINGE DISSECTED\n\nSHOWING CONSTRUCTION.\n\nTHREE STEEL BALLS IN EVERY HINGE.\n\nCosts No More than the Ordinary Iron Hinge with Makeshift Buffer.\n\nAccept No Substitute.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 1 represents the seat arm showing \"socket\" which fits over the \"ball\" on Figure 2 (which represents upright seat arm). This socket is called a \"ball and socket,\" or, as it is termed by some, a \"trunnion joint\" hinge. When the seat arm (Figure 1) is fastened over the standard (Figure 2), the entire weight rests upon the seat arm socket joint and whatever on the bolt, it being merely used to clamp the seat arm and standard together. On close inspection you will observe two iron lugs which are the stops when the seat is folded down or up.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates reverse side of seat arm showingitudinal grooves in which the steel bicycle balls run. Figure 4 is a cap which fits over grooves in Figure 3. You will observe that cap 4 is grooved to correspond with Figure 3, and when they are fastened together they form a trunnion joint in the middle than at either end, through which the balls roll as seat is moved up or down. Figure 5 represents the reverse side of seat. Note that the face of Figure 5 is \"dished\", or concave in shape. When hinge is put together a cap is placed over the ball in Figure 6 fits over the dish in Figure 5. The different parts are then bolted together with bolts and washers. The tall piece in caps 4 and 5 passes through hole in standard (2) maintaining both cap and standard in one stationary position, the seat arm moving between them.\nThe Little Balls Do the Work.\n\nThe Steel Bicycle Balls Inside the Hinge of the \"Ball Bearing\" Increase the Life of the Hinge Many Years and Make It Absolutely and Permanently Noiseless.\n\nFigure 7 shows seat arm (Figure 3) is moved up or down the hinge groove in any direction. This groove, as before stated, is inclined and as the balls approach their stopping place this narrowing space in groove, or rather tube, forces out or expands the cap Figure 4, which is made possible by the reverse side of cap being dish shaped with a flat steel washer over it, which sticks into the dish as the pressure of the ball forces the cap out. When pressure is released, the seat the weight of cap part does not rest on balls, but on the ball and socket joint before described, and the stops or lugs described in Figure 6. The purpose of the balls and the steel washer is merely to act as a brake and arrest the force of the stop when seat is folded or opened. There is no weight or undue pressure on them, but the weight rests entirely on the ball and socket joint and stops.\n\nFigure 7 shows seat folded down with cap (Figure 4) made transparent so as to show position and workings of balls. C, C, C represent inclined grooves in which balls run. D, D, D, the stops or ends of grooves.\n\nFigure 8 shows seat folded up with position of balls consequently reversed.\n\nFigure 9 shows a sectional view of the complete hinge put together. The seat is folded down and you are supposed to be directly in front on a level with the hinge looking into it. B represents desk standard. F represents seat arm. D represents \"ball\" or stumps. G represents \"socket\" on arm. C represents lugs or stops on standard and arm. F, F, F, represent the steel bicycle balls rolling around in groove or tube. H represents soldered joint in tube. I represents the tail piece that passes into hole in standard, keeping the cap in stationary position. J represents steel washer before described in Figure 6. As the seat is folded down, the balls have forced the cap out slightly and the steel spring washer, as you will observe, is sprung into the dish of cap. J represents nut on bolt. A represents head of bolt which passes entirely through seat hinge, clamping the whole together and forming the only common sense, permanently noiseless hinge ever placed on a school desk.\nFastening of Wood and Iron.\n\nThe accompanying cut plainly shows our exclusive method of fastening wood work to iron. B represents upright standard. A represents lug which slips into mortise D in back of wood work. There is a main casting, C, on the opposite side from lug A, extending the whole length of back. When the wood is placed over the iron lug A, fitting into mortise D, the back is driven downward and the lug A acts as a wedge, forcing the flange of standard firmly into the recessed groove C in wood work, thus producing continuous fastening the whole length of the wood. The wood work of seat and top of desk is fastened to the iron in a similar manner. This is the only common sense method of putting up school desks. We believe we are the ones who invented it and who have a monopoly of its use. E represents wood work showing dovetailed groove. When lug A is placed in mortise D and driven down, the lug A wedges the flange before described firmly, forming a permanently secure fastening.\n\nNote the perfect tongued and grooved glued joints; we make our tongues and grooves very large in size and of a peculiar shape which gives an extraordinary amount of glue spread, thereby making the most perfect joint possible. Our method of jointing has stood the test of years, and no other desk made can compare with it in this particular.\n\nNO KEYS OR BOLTS USED IN SETTING UP THIS DESK.....\n\nIn Process of Setting Up.\n\nThe accompanying cut represents a \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic partially set up with the back off, showing the flange and lugs on the standard and the mortise and recessed groove in the wood back. When the Solid Top, Seat and Back are driven home they wedge themselves firmly, locking all parts securely.\n\nEVERY SLAT SUPPORTED BY THE FLANGE, AND EACH LUG A PART OF THE MAIN CASTING.\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf.\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf is secured in place by being pushed into grooves in the standard from the front, before the back of seat is placed in position. It can never be removed by mischievous boys, allowing books, pencils, etc., to fall on the floor, to the great annoyance of teachers and orderly scholars.\nINCOMPARABLE FOR EASE OF OPERATION\n\nOUR Double Desks have entire seats or separate sittings, and with the \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic Double Desk with separate seats, each pupil can take, vacate or resume his seat without disturbing his neighbor or obstructing the aisle. No sitting in front of this seat! Pupils cannot slide into the aisle before they rise up, as in other seats. Some manufacturers of the old-style turn-up seats, to meet the demand for Double Desks with separate seats, have made a center seat, but make the separate seats, for which they charge you from 50 to 75 cents per desk extra, and which are no better than a double desk with one long or entire seat. Can you imagine them getting into the school room without getting into the aisle first? You might as well have the continuous seat, for you cannot fold their double desk with separate seats; they are not practical. The arrangement of this seat is acceptable in singing, breathing, reading or callisthenics, where a large portion of the pupils are engaged simultaneously.\n\nOur arrangement virtually gives both occupants of a double desk a separate seat. Also more room with less floor space than any other desk made.\n\nWe also make a Double Desk with Entire Seat which is less expensive.\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE!\n\nThe \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic is a Revelation in School Desks.\n\nNOT a luxury for the rich, but a perfect seat for everybody and a preventive of dreadful and painful deformities and diseases that must follow the use of the old style barrel back school desk. Note the position as illustrated above. With the Perfect \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic there are no deformed spines, stooped shoulders, congested headaches and congested vessels of the eye. Surely these fearful facts will appeal to the heart of every parent or school officer in the land. What is the saving of a few dollars compared with the health and comfort of our future men and women? Think of this!\n\nSCHOOL DESKS should fit the human form. The spine shouldn't be twisted to fit the desk. That is contortionism. There are plenty of form theories, but only one true model, the natural human form. That is the pattern of the \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic. Beware of \"barrel\" backs. The \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic is a revelation, so completely does it cut loose from traditional evils, and remember, it is a perfect FORM FITTER.\nSIZES AND DIMENSIONS OF DESKS.\n\n| SINGLE SEATS AND DESKS | DOUBLE SEATS AND DESKS |\n|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Size | Height Seat | Height Top | Width | Length | Floor Space | Age accommodated | Size | Height Seat | Height Top | Width | Length | Floor Space | Age accommodated |\n| Normal | 17 in. | 29 | 16 in. | 24 in. | 28 in. | 16 to 20 | Normal | 17 in. | 29 | 16 in. | 40 in. | 28 in. | ADULTS |\n| High School | 2 | 16 in. | 27\u00bd | 16 in. | 24 in. | 27 | 16 to 20 | High School | 2 | 16 in. | 40 in. | 27 | 16 to 20 |\n| Grammar | 3 | 15 in. | 25\u00bd | 14 in. | 21 in. | 26 in. | 12 to 18 | Grammar | 3 | 15 in. | 25\u00bd | 14 in. | 38 in. | 24 in. | 10 to 15 |\n| 1st Intermediate | 4 | 14 in. | 24 | 14 in. | 21 in. | 24 in. | 10 to 15 | 1st Intermediate | 4 | 14 in. | 36 in. | 23 in. | 8 to 12 |\n| 2nd Intermediate | 5 | 13 in. | 22\u00bd | 13 in. | 19 in. | 22 in. | 8 to 12 | 2nd Intermediate | 5 | 13 in. | 22\u00bd | 12 in. | 36 in. | 23 in. | 8 to 12 |\n| Primary | 6 | 12 in. | 20\u00bd | 12 in. | 19 in. | 21 in. | 8 to 8 | Primary | 6 | 12 in. | 20\u00bd | 12 in. | 36 in. | 21 in. | 5 to 8 |\n\nFlush Top Ink Wells.\nNICKEL PLATED.\n\nOur ink bottle is securely locked in place. It cannot be spilled by accidentally striking underneath, but bottle can be easily removed and replaced by turning half around. The cover is flush with top of lid, and books, slates, etc., can be moved over the surface without noise or interruption. The pen rest attachment is of great convenience.\n\nThe Shield.\n\nWhile our desk is the strongest made, and needs no bracing, we decided to add strength where we knew it was required. The shield protects the seat in front from being injured or broken by occupant of desk in rear. Boys cannot place a pin in their shoes and \"electrically\" the studious scholar in front; and neither can they fold the seat down when not needed. The shield also braces the desk laterally, supporting the castings where the leverage is greatest when leaning upon the lid.\n\nWARRANT.\n\nWe fully warrant in every respect the \"Ball Bearing Automatic Desk for 15 years. This warrant covers every part and every piece that enters into the construction of the desk. We make no reservation whatever, neither do we stipulate that the breakage must be due to some fault of material or construction, as other desk manufacturers do. We simply say, if a desk of our manufacture gets broken in any way or from any cause whatsoever, notify us of the fact and we will send the necessary repairs without charge and without asking questions as to how the breakage occurred. This is a broad-gauge warrant, but we are broad-gauge people and our responsibility is such that a warrant issued by us is a practical gilt-edged insurance policy on every desk bought from us.\n\nTeachers' Desks and Chairs.\n\nWe carry a very large stock of these goods which we illustrate in our catalogue. If you are interested, send for our catalogue. It is yours for the asking, and is well worth your examination.\n\nIf You are Undecided, Write Us. If in Need of Anything in Our Line Examine Our Goods and Get Our Prices.\n\nThe selection of our furniture will save you lots of worry in the future. There is no guess work in the construction of our work. Every device offered by us has been thoroughly tested and tried. The highest grade of product is our goal. We aim to make each year's work more perfect than the preceding year. Our prices are no more than is charged by others for inferior work. DON'T buy experiments or deal with experimental concerns.

School at Garden River it will be necessary to remove a chimney which is placed just in the middle of one of the rooms. Some alterations have been made in the school; this chimney has always been in the way very much, but as the long desks were set in two rows only, they could go on each side of the chimney, but the new desks will have to be fixed in three rows so I would like to be authorized to remove that chimney. There are two chimneys in the school. But it is good to remember that the school was built for one teacher only with the intention of giving lodging to the teacher, and one of these chimneys would have been used in that case for the teacher's apartment. But since the new school was built, the number of pupils has increased considerably so that it was found necessary to make two rooms and to remove the partition where is the chimney mentioned, in order to enlarge one room. I do not intend to remove the chimney altogether, but have the top of it and set it on the rafters so that it will not spoil the appearance of the school, and might be used in case of necessity.\n\nFor the present I will bring the two stove pipes in the same chimney. I think that I can have this job made for $4 or $5 dollars and for sure it will cost around $7 dollars - an immediate answer is kindly solicited for we expect the new desks from day to day.\n\nYours respectfully,\nRev.

School, for the year ending December 31, 1911.\n\nTo improve the attendance it would be necessary to hire a man with a team from December to April to collect the children. I think that somebody here would do the work for 50\u00a2 a trip or $1.00 a day. As for the parents who live near the school and keep their children at home I think a little fine should be imposed upon them.\nOttawa, January 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. Father Renaud, who is in charge of the Roman Catholic School on the Garden River Reserve, suggests that arrangements should be made to have some of the children conveyed to and from the school during the winter months.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report on the distance these children reside from the school and what numbers, if any, there are residing at such distances that it is not possible for them to walk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMurdoch MacLennan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

I have to ask you to be good enough to report as to the probable cost and the best means of having this work done. I may say that on a previous occasion when painting had to be done on this reserve the Department supplied the material and the Indians did the labour and this might be the best method to follow in this particular case, if it is decided to take action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMurdoch MacLennan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 153328/5 January 27th, in which you request me to report upon the matter in question. I have given the matter considerable thought during the winter months, and find that the children who reside at a distance that would be considered too far to walk, are those now living on the part called \"French Bay,\" and are largely, if not altogether, members of the Bathurst Band. The school has been held about 2/3 of the time at this school, and some of them work or live from 2\u00bd to 3 miles away, and as the roads are now in good order and should be better for the balance of the winter, I would think that the expenses of a conveyance would be too large. It will be necessary further details concerning the fact that the Bathurst Band are anxious to have their rights on the Gordon River more definitely defined, and I am now doing what I can to do so in that connection.\n\nJ D McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6128, File 390-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nGarden River, March 25-1912\n\nMr. Murdoch McLenan\nSault Ste Marie\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt last, I saw John Boyer yesterday, and spoke to him about the painting of the schoolhouse.\n\nIf the Department supplies the paint, John will charge $2.50 a day, and it will take him about 16 days to give two coats. Now, if you like better to give him the job, he will supply the paint and do the whole work for $70.00. By the \"whole work\" I mean the outside wall only. I think it is cheap enough, and neither you nor I would do the same work for that price.\n\nThe size of the main building is 22 x 46 ft., the wall being 16 ft. high. Besides, there is the equivalent of a building of 14 x 22 ft., with a 8 ft. high wall.\n\nWith these dimensions, one can find out how much paint it would require.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. Renaud S.J.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge with your letter No. 15328/15 January 31st to inquire enclosed from Mr. R. O. Rumant, Principal of the R.C. School on the Sarnia River Reserve, in which he submits an offer of John Boyce, a member of the Band, to do the job of painting the outside of the school for $70.\n\nI asked Mr. Rumant, if the Indians of the Band would be able to do the work required by the Department, and he stated that he did not think there was many of the Band that could do the work.\n\nConsidering the fact that the Sarnia River Band is acting for the painting of the Council Chamber on the Reserve, I would think that our competent painter could do the work.\n\nIf it is desired to have the important done to better advantage, I find that it will require about 20 gallons of paint to give two coats inside and outside of the R.C. School, which will cost about $25 per gallon at the current market price.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the Department was willing to buy this bell, I would charge only $25.00, and put it up at my own expenses, which will cost me about $10.00.\n\nHoping that this suggestion will meet your approbation, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nV.

School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the price asked by Rev. Father Renaud for the old bell is altogether too high. In the first place the bell is smaller than the usual small school bell. The Department has before it two catalogues of school bells and the smallest is twenty inches in diameter, weighing about 105 pounds and costing $16.00. If you cannot obtain a bell in Sault Ste. Marie at a reasonable price the Department will order one from Toronto. Nothing, however, will be done until you are heard from again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D.

We have been waiting now quite a while for it, the matter is urgent.\n\nAnother point I beg to bring to the notice of the Department, viz., the necessity of some repairs about the Roman Catholic Schoolhouse, among others, the two porches, a covering over the bell on the roof, etc. I mentioned this to Mr. Indian Agent Mr. Webb, lately. He said he knew about it and would look after it. Still, I thought that I should say a word about this matter to the Department, as school is to open at the end of this month.\n\nHoping that the Department will take these matters into its kind consideration,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours truly,\nJos. Specht, S.J.\nP.S. I likewise wish to bring to the knowledge of the Department that several parties have been of late disfiguring the walls of the schoolhouse by scribbling or carving thereon.

Father Specht has called the attention of the Department to certain repairs being needed about the Roman Catholic school at Garden River. He mentions that two porches and a belfry are needed and the Department would like you to see that any repairs which you consider necessary are made to this school before the reopening after the summer holidays.

Day School, in her report for the year ended December 31st, last, states that the building requires painting inside.\n\nIf you consider that this building should be painted inside kindly submit an estimate of the probable cost of having it done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSkult Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, April 3rd., 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to draw attention to the fact that on the 29th December you sent to the Department an account of $6.25 in favour of Miss Luise Lasage for service as caretaker of the Roman Catholic School at Garden River Reserve during December quarter last. The voucher in question was paid by cheque No. 3441 which went forward on the 14th of January. In view of this fact you should explain why you sent to the Department on the 30th March a voucher in favour of Antoine Boyer, rendered at $10.00, for service as caretaker of the above mentioned school from the 5th December to the 29th February. The Department is paying Boyer $5.00 by cheque No. 4519, which is going forward for service as caretaker of the school during January. Two caretakers will not be employed at the same time for the school and consequently payment will not be made to Boyer for service rendered during December. You should see that a caretaker is appointed at a yearly salary to do the work in question at that school.\n\nI may say that it is considered that $25.00 a year should be ample remuneration. This is the amount allowed for the services of the kind at other schools. The appointment is only left in your hands, and the Department relies upon you to see that the work is entrusted to a responsible person. You should report without delay as to the action you have taken.\n\nI may add that the allowance of $5.00 a month authorised by official letter of the 7th December last for A. D. McHagg Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In making the purchase of the wood or of any material required for the above repairs you will be guided by the requirements of the War Purchasing Commission.\n\nThe inspector also states that the attendance is very unsatisfactory. Possibly this has to some extent been due to the weather but there is no reason why the attendance at present should not be improved and the Department will expect you to take steps to increase the attendance at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Roof of school leaks a little in one place. There are no ladders to enable one to fix it.\n\n2. Teachers report that the building is terribly cold in winter, due to lack of putty on windows, floor boards heaved up, roof leaking almost all around edges of eaves - painting urgent - new roof needed. In fact, a new house should be built as almost as much would be spent on repairs.\n\n3. Teachers' residence is such that in case of fire it would be so inflammable that the church and nearby buildings would be burnt.\n\n4. Teachers, I understand, will have to vacate the residence in June, as it is in such condition that it is no fit habitation.\n\nThe outstanding remark is this: - Somebody will have to provide a new teacher's residence for September. Can something be done immediately?\n\nRegarding this report, I have to request that you will arrange to have the roof of the school building repaired, and you should furnish a report and estimate of the cost of the work that would be required to place the school building in good repair for next winter.\n\nRegarding the teachers' residence, I have also to request that you will furnish a report as to the work that would be required to place this building in good repair, and make it comfortable for the teachers' use.\n\nThis information should be received as soon as possible in order that, if it is decided to undertake any repairs, the work could be carried on and completed during the coming summer holidays. In making your report as to the desirability of a new teachers' residence, you will take into consideration the remarks of the Inspector mentioned above, and state whether, in your opinion, the present building could not be repaired without any large expenditure.\n\nWe will expect an early reply giving full information regarding the school and teachers' residence, and the cost of having any repairs considered necessary carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant No 13-3-5 and have to say.\n\n1st The roof of the School room does leak in one place, but it does not need a new Roof.\n\nThere are no ladders at this school, and we need one very much.\n\n2nd Those paragraphs of your letter must refer to the Teachers dwelling house, I quite agree with all that is said in reference to this building, IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED. It would cost more to repair this building than it would take to build a nice cottage with 2 bedrooms, a dining Room Parlor and small Kitchen, a one Storey house.\n\n3rd We need a Woodshed at this School and also to have the Kiss Closets removed and wood shed built where the closets now stand. We are losing wood every year and have no way of checking the loss as it is only an open shed.\n\nThe cost of repairing the School roof would not cost over $5,00 for Shingles and Labor. I cannot estimate the cost of repairs to the Teachers dwelling as it is not worth spending any money on it, it is a menace to the Church and other buildings, all frame and as dry as tinder.\n\nShould you decide to build a Teachers cottage and a woodshed I will get you prices as soon as I get plans of the buildings.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nA.

C. Indian Day School.\n\n1. In connection with the repairs needed to the roof to prevent leakage, I beg to say that you should arrange to have this work done as soon as possible. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be about $5.00.\n\n2. You may arrange to have a ladder made for this school, or, if you consider it cheaper, you may purchase one of the length needed.\n\n3. Regarding the teacher's residence, I beg to say that we will have no funds this year to erect a new residence for the teachers at this school. If a few minor repairs could be carried out in order to make the building as comfortable as possible for another year, I will be pleased if you will state the nature of the work that would be needed. Only such repairs should be undertaken as are necessary to enable the teachers to reside there with a fair degree of comfort for another winter.\n\n4. Regarding a wood shed and the removal of the closets, I will be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of building a wood shed large enough to provide storage for the fuel used, as well as a small compartment for other storage purposes. A small building with a sloping roof and rough boarded walls should serve the purpose. The doors should have proper padlocks or other means of being securely fastened. You will have an idea of the size that will be required to meet the demands.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state approximately the amount that will be necessary to erect this wood shed and have the closets removed and placed in good condition on another site. I may say that we have no plans for a wood shed. Kindly furnish this estimate, also that for the minor repairs to the teacher's residence, as soon as possible so that, if it is decided to authorize the work, it can be done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The doors should have proper padlocks or other means of being securely fastened. You will please see that the building is of sufficient size to meet the requirements.\n\nIn your letter of May 18th you state that the closets should be removed and the wood shed built where the closets now stand. Before the work of building the wood shed is commenced, you should arrange to have the closets removed to another site. The repairs required to the roof should also be attended to.\n\nWhen this work is completed, you will be good enough to forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. For the above amount, it is expected that the contractor will provide all the necessary material and you will be expected to see that the work is performed in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYou have not stated what minor repairs would be required to the teacher's residence in order that it can be used during the next school year.

School for the year ended March 31, 1923.\n\nThe teachers have to burn green wood all winter, therefore, they consume more kindling and it is very hard to get the school heated. And in case of fire I think they should provide ladders that would lead to the chimney of the school. It is impossible to get anyone to clean the pipes of the school rooms or the house because they have not been paid for the last work they have done. Also other necessary work should be done around the school as the teacher cannot do it herself.\n\nMildred Toner,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 28th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe senior teacher of the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School, in her annual report for the present fiscal year states that it has been very hard to get the school rooms heated owing to the fact that green wood has been used all winter. She recommends that ladders that would lead to the chimney of the school should be supplied. She also states that it is impossible to get any one to clean the pipes of the school rooms or house because they have not been paid for the last work they did, and also that it is difficult to get any other necessary work done.\n\nRegarding the wood, you should arrange to have the supply required for next winter delivered at the school, where it could be stored and dried, and would be ready for next winter's use. This matter should receive your attention, and a request should be made early in the summer for the necessary authority to purchase the quantity required.\n\nYou should state whether you consider that ladders are necessary, and if so, the cost of supplying the same.\n\nIf there are any amounts due for work performed in connection with this school, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, and, if satisfactory, payment will be made.\n\nAs it is difficult for the teachers to attend to the care-taking, I would be pleased to have your views as to whether you consider it would be advisable to appoint a janitor to do the care-taking and other necessary work around the school, and, if so, the amount of salary you would suggest be allowed for this service.\n\nYour attention to the above matters will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo No. 13-3-5 in reference to the heating of the Roman Catholic School, I beg to say that heretofore we have had no complaints about the heating of this school. We have used more dry wood during this time Miss Toner has been teacher than we have in the last two years. She does not seem to want to use green wood, and it is impossible for me to get her dry wood now.\n\nIn regard to the clogging of the pipes in the school room, I had Mike Larose clean the pipes and put on the storm windows and Miss Toner neglected to send his bill. This is the reason that he has not been paid.\n\nIn regard to the ladders, I would say that one ladder is necessary.\n\nI will arrange during the summer to have wood cut and delivered for next winter's use.\n\nIn regard to the care taking of the school, Mrs. Mike Lemage was attending to that, but she could not get along with Miss Toner. She told me she would not work for a slave driver. If suitable to you I will get Mrs. Lemage to again take up the care taking of the school and with the understanding that Miss has nothing to do with her.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D. McBeth\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 6th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, referring to the complaints made by the teacher regarding the quality of the wood supplied and the heating of the classrooms of the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School during the past winter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the furnishing of the wood - either dry or green - and the proper use of the same are matters that should be adjusted between yourself and the teachers. There should be no cause for complaint to the Department regarding this matter.\n\nRegarding the caretaking, while it is expected that the caretaker will perform these duties to the satisfaction of the teachers, yet, the teachers themselves should use tact in their dealings with, and in any instructions given by them to the caretaker. Any disputes that arise should be settled without having to refer such matters to the Department.\n\nIf there is any amount due for the cleaning of the pipes of the school room, putting on storm windows, or for any other services, you should obtain the accounts from the teacher, attach them to proper voucher forms, which you should certify and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYou may purchase a ladder, which you state is required. Properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

He also states that there is leakage around the windows.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as to the repairs required to place this roof in good condition, and also to prevent leakage around the windows. This matter should receive your early attention, in order that, if it is decided to have any repairs made, they can be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the stove pipes in the school and teachers' house require to be cleaned. You should, therefore, arrange to have these pipes taken down, thoroughly cleansed out and replaced.\n\nYou will be good enough to arrange during the summer to have the necessary supply of wood cut and delivered, in order that it can be dried and ready for next winter's use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Laput\nPrincipal\nThe following is a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, held on the 18th October, 1923, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 19th October, 1923.\n\nIndian Affairs -\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs reporting that the residence in use by the teachers of the Indian Day School used by the Roman Catholic portion of the Garden River and Batchawana Indians and situated on the Garden River Indian reserve, in the district of Algoma in the province of Ontario, is inadequate and so dilapidated as to be beyond repair, and it is necessary to replace the same at a cost estimated at $2,000.00 for a suitable four-room cottage to accommodate the two teachers employed; that a capital at the credit of the Garden River and Batchawana bands amounts respectively to $97,822.86 and $67,117.51, and it is proposed to meet the cost of the new building from their funds in proportion to the number of children attending the school from the two bands, namely, $1,500.00 from the Garden River band and $500.00 from the Batchawana band.\n\nThe Superintendent General recommends that under Section 89 of the Indian Act, authority be given for the above mentioned expenditures of $1,500.00 and $500.00 being made from the Garden River and Batchawana capital accounts, respectively, on the construction of the teachers' residence referred to.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Nov. 5, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your night letter of the first, your telegram of the 2nd and your letter of the first instant - all with reference to the proposed building activity in connection with the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School. I have to confirm official day letter of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"Reference Garden River Roman Catholic Day School.\nIt is considered false economy to move present school building and to erect separate teacher's residence. Arrangements will be made to prepare plans and let contract for combined school and residence early next spring. Full explanation in today's letter.\"\n\nI have to inform you that the proposed building activity in the case of this school has been given serious consideration, and, in view of your recommendation, it has been decided that lot 185, of the new survey of the reserve, would be the most central site for the Roman Catholic pupils. As you were informed in the official telegram, it is not considered wise to move a 26-year-old building, at considerable cost, to a site on the main road. The Superintendent of Indian Education and the Separate School Inspector both report that the present school is not attractive from any standpoint. A new teacher's residence has to be erected in any case, and it is considered in the best interests of economy to arrange for a combined school and teacher's residence. Such a building would consist of two classrooms on the ground floor with cloakrooms for children. The teacher's residence would be upstairs and might consist of a combined kitchen and dining-room, two bedrooms with clothes closets, etc. A proper basement should be provided, with furnace and perhaps a dry chemical closet for winter's use. The funds necessary, over and above the $2,000 which will be taken from the Garden River and Batchawana Capital Accounts, will be provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe plans for such a building should be prepared by the Department and the contract awarded. I regret that this arrangement does not provide adequate residence facilities for the two teachers at the Garden River Indian Day School for the coming winter, and the Department will give favourable consideration to any recommendation you make with a view to ameliorating conditions for them.\n\nYou should make arrangements with the members of the Band to release lot 185 for school purposes. The resolution in this connection should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSAULT STE.

The junior room with the smaller desks should accommodate 35 pupils and the senior room, 25. You will remember that we discussed the best type of building and agreed on the classrooms with children's cloakroom on the ground floor. The teachers' residence could be on the second floor and might consist of a combined kitchen and dining room and two bed rooms with clothes closets, etc. A proper basement with furnace and perhaps a dry chemical closet for the teachers' use in winter is needed. $2,000 is available from the Garden River and Batchawana Bands' Capital Account and $3,000 will be provided in the Appropriation.\n\nThe need at this school is great and building operations should commence as soon as possible in the coming season.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the form of tender we stated three months as the time of completion, from the acceptance of the tender, which was Sept 18th. Although the school will be completed before Dec 18; it is not possible consistent with good work to have it ready by Dec 1st.\n\nAll the outside work, with the exception of one coat of paint is complete, the second coat of plaster started this morning. The floors and inside painting are the only things that will not be complete the first week in Dec.

Brechin & Nancy,\nGeneral Contractors,\nSault Ste Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department whether it will be necessary to supply any new desks for the use of the classrooms in the new R.C. Indian day school which is in the course of erection at Garden River. No doubt a number of the desks at present in use in the old building could be transferred. If any new desks are required, you should state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use in order that if a further number is required desks of a similar type can be ordered. It will be necessary to give the sizes of any desks required, and I may say for your information that desks are manufactured in the following sizes, viz:\n\n| Size No. | Pupils 5 to 8 years |\n|----------|---------------------|\n|          | 5 - 8 to 12         |\n|          | 4 - 10 to 15        |\n|          | 3 - 12 to 16        |\n|          | 2 - 16 to 18        |\n\nYou should consult the teacher in this matter and prepare a list giving the sizes of the desks and the number of each size required. I may say we prefer that the single type of desk be used. Please give as full information as possible regarding any school desks that may be required.\n\nYou should also state whether it will be necessary to supply teachers' desks and chairs, or if the ones at present in use will be satisfactory.\n\nIt may also be necessary to supply some new articles for the teachers' living quarters. A list of the equipment required should be furnished. Any articles of furniture that are serviceable in the present residence should be utilized in the teachers' living quarters in the new building, and it is hoped that it will not be necessary to furnish any further large supply.\n\nYou should consult the teacher regarding the desks required and any new furnishings for the living quarters, and prepare a list which you should forward to the Department at an early date. Full shipping directions as to where any supplies should be sent by rail should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McAbb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D.

School at Garden River I beg to say that I cannot give any close estimate of the cost as I do not know what kind of Closets you would want there. We should have at least one acre if not more cleared of underbrush and make it fit for a play ground; it is my intention to leave some of the Pine trees standing for Shade trees. I cannot give an estimate of the Well required as I cannot tell how deep we would have to go.\n\nAs to the closets I interviewed Dr Mc Caig and he asked me to suggest that you put in what is called a kaustine system he informs me that they have it in one of the Schools here and it is satisfactory. I would suggest that your Architect draw up plans of the work required and let it by tender. We have a nice building and I would like to see the surroundings correspond to the building.

This should be submitted to the Department without delay and instructions will be given you if it is to be added as an extra to the contract. The Department is not prepared to put in the Kaustine system.\n\nYou may make the most economical arrangements for the boring of a suitable well by a responsible man. When it is completed, indicate what type of pump is required. Would it be possible to use the pump from the well at the old site in this connection?\n\nWith reference to a drain from the basement, please report fully concerning the advisability and secure an estimate of the cost.\n\nYou are authorized to arrange for the clearing of one acre, suitable for playground. Engage Indians on a day labour basis. You should give supervision to the work, so that the expense will be as low as possible.\n\nThe Department will arrange for the purchase and delivery of two suitable box stoves for the classrooms.

There is being directed to you, under separate cover, plans of a woodshed and closets which, it is considered, would be suitable for this school. Please have the contractors submit a price for the woodshed and for the three closets. The teacher's closet could be attached to the woodshed. This price should be submitted to the Department by telegram.\n\nYou are authorized to arrange for the installation of a drain from the basement. Your estimate of $17.50 should not be exceeded.

(RG 10, Volume 6128, File 390-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT ON THE GARDEN RIVER R. C.\nMELANIE DAY SCHOOL, JANUARY 20, 1925.\n\nNew main building, 2 classrooms, 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen and cellar appear well built.\n\nA.- The contractor should not be fully paid until all is satisfactory. Rain entered through walls of one cloakroom and one classroom from the ceiling. It also entered over inside door of kitchen on the top and a few other places. The valley on the floor alongside the bedroom could not have been properly flashed with tin. This should be looked into before the plaster is destroyed.\n\nB.- For some reason or other the beautiful white walls, here and there, even of the ceiling, have been splashed with varnish. (see below)\n\nC.- The old teacher's desk and old school desks are still being used. They will do. However, they should be varnished. Summer time would be the best time so that a good job of them would be made.\n\nD.- The doors should be weather stripped. They need it. Metal after all is best.\n\n(2)- The two toilets and woodshed are up. The woodshed is certainly small. It is only 12 x 10. Rather small. Toilets should be screened as they are facing the road.\n\n(3)- Playgrounds should be arranged for.\n\n(4)- The seats in the junior room, just furnished, are too small altogether. The same is true of new seats in senior room. I suggest that new singles in senior room be put in junior room and junior seats be transferred and sold to some school-board for five-year-old children.\n\n(5)- The storm windows freeze up easily and when melting point comes there is a whole ledge full of water that cannot get out between the windows. It soaks through and comes under the sill into the room.\n\nThe points noted in this report are as I saw them. Weather being severe may be the cause of A. & S. It may not be the contractor's fault.\n\n---\n\nA small table and cupboard or kitchen cabinet is necessary since there is no pantry or shelving space.\n\nWash stand needed. A classroom cupboard or bookcase is needed.\n\nJ. M. Bennett - Insp.\nOttawa, February 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School, states regarding the new school building and teachers' residence that rain entered through the walls of one cloakroom and one classroom from the ceiling, and that it also entered over the inside door of the kitchen, on the top and a few other places. He also states that the valley on the roof alongside the dormers could not have been properly flashed with tar, and that these matters should be attended to before the plaster is destroyed. The Inspector further states that for some reason or other the walls and even the ceiling have been splashed in places with varnish. He also states that the storm windows freeze up easily and, when melting point comes, there is a whole ledge full of water that cannot get out between the windows and that it soaks through and comes under the sill into the room.\n\nYou should take the above matters referred to by the Inspector up with the contractors, and they should see that the roof is put in a first class condition and the other matters should also be attended to. The Department will rely on you to see that this is done.\n\nThe Inspector requests that the old desk of the teacher and the old school desks which are still in use should be varnished and recommends that this work be done during the summer holidays next. You should bear this matter in mind and arrange to have the desks varnished.\n\nRegarding the toilets, the Inspector recommends that, as they are facing the road, screened approaches should be provided. Please furnish a report regarding this matter and state the approximate cost of the material and labour required in having same erected.\n\nEarly in the spring you should draw attention to any levelling of the grounds or clearing required to provide suitable playgrounds for the children. In making your report regarding this matter, you should state the amount of work that could be realized and the approximate cost, also the size of the playgrounds you would recommend be put in condition.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the desks, he states the seats in the junior room are too small and that the same is true of the new seats in the senior room.

I may say with reference to the new seats which were provided that they were the sizes as selected by the teacher and yourself.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that a small table and cupboard are necessary in the teachers' living quarters, as there is no pantry or shelving space. He also states that a washstand is needed, as well as a bookcase or cupboard for the classroom. If you consider these articles are necessary, you may arrange for the purchase of same, competitive prices, if possible, being obtained, and no unnecessary expense should be incurred. If you make any of these purchases, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you regarding the various matters referred to by the Inspector, and you should also report as to any action you have taken to comply with the suggestions made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd Instant No 13-3-5 in reference to the Garden River new R. C. School and in reply have to say, that I had an interview with Mr Brecken one of the Contractors and he informs me that the reason for the leakage in the building is that the ice forms on the eaves and backs up the water under the shingles and cause it to run down the walls he says if the ice was kept away from the eaves it would not leak.\n\nHe also claims that all valleys are flashed with 26 gauge iron the plan calls for 28 gauge.\n\nThe reason of the storm windows frosting is that the walls are damp from the lateness of the plastering although there has been fires kept going continually the walls have not got properly dried but after this season that complaint will be eliminated now the water runs down between the storm & inside windows and causes the dampness there.\n\nMr Brecken informs me that as soon as the snow is gone he will go down with me and rectify any defects in either the material or workmanship.\n\nHe also informs me that he will have the painter fix up the varnish stains on the walls.\n\nIn reference to varnishing the Teachers Desk and the old school seats I had in mind doing that in the summer vacation also put screens in front of the closets. Just at present it is utterly impossible to get a man at Garden to do any work as they are all away in the woods and it would cost too much to take a man from here. If the Inspector will give us time we will have all the work required done early in the spring.\n\nI have the same to say about the small table I can get one made at Garden for one half what it would cost to buy one from the Furniture dealers. I have the order for their dishes on order with the T. E. Simpson Co Ltd. I can also get the Rock case made at the Garden for far less than I can buy it ready made. The washstand is also ordered and I understand on the way this was part of the Order given the Simpson Co for the furniture already delivered, they did not have the washstand in stock and ordered it to be sent to Garden River direct from Factory same as cupboard for dishes.\n\nIn reference to the desks I went by the sizes mentioned in your letter of Nov 29th No 13-3-5 giving the sizes for certain ages, I would suggest that we leave the desks as they are for the present.\n\nOn account of the heavy expenditure incurred in connection with the new School I am trying to keep the expenses as low as I can.\n\nIn reference to the playground when the spring opens up I will have a proposition to lay before the Council to have the present road passing in front of the School building closed and open another road about one hundred and fifty feet to the east of the School this will be for safety for the children. This will not cost much as it is only a few rods of a new road to build, however I will take this matter up later on.\n\nHoping this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nO.

(RG 10, Volume 6128, File 390-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the new R. C. Indian day school building at Garden River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you have taken up with the contractor the matter of the leakage in the roof. It is also noted that this is caused by the ice which forms on the eaves and backs up the water under the shingles. The janitor should be instructed to see that the snow and ice on the roof are cleared off at frequent intervals. It is further noted that the complaints regarding the water between the storm and inside windows will be eliminated when the walls have properly dried, also that the contractor will rectify any defects in either material or workmanship. It is also noted that the contractor will arrange to have the painter remove the varnish stains on the walls.\n\nRegarding the desks, it will not be necessary to make any alterations in the seating arrangements at the present time. You should arrange, however, early next summer to have the teacher's desk and any old school seats varnished.\n\nIt is noted that the furnishings have been ordered and that you will arrange to have a table and bookcase made locally. You should attend to this matter as soon as possible and have the table and bookcase made and placed in the school at an early date. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost. Vouchers covering the cost of all furnishings should also be forwarded.\n\nWe note that you will take up the matter of providing playgrounds early in the spring. You should also bear in mind the question of having proper screens erected in front of the closets.\n\nI have to request that you will see that the contractor leaves the building in good condition and that all work is completed to your satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Garden River School and Teachers Residence.\n\nAs you are aware we completed this school on the 14th of Dec. 1924 according to the plans and specifications supplied by the department, and have fulfilled all the requirements of the contract which was signed by the Dept' and ourselves. This contract called for the payment of 90% as the work progressed and the balance in 30 days after completion, which would have been Jan 14th.\n\nIn regard to the letter of the inspector in regard to water coming through in several places and attributed to the rain, I discussed this matter with you at the time, and as there had been no rain from the completion of the school till the date of his visit, it could not have been rain, therefore it must have been the ice forming along the eaves causing the water to back up under the shingles, which is as you are aware a common occurrence with 90% of the shingle roofs in this part of the country, where there is so much snow. Re the flashing the valleys and sides of the roof are flashed with 26 gauge iron which is heavier than called for in the specifications. In regard to the several spots of varnish we beg to advise that we have had the rooms affected given a coat of Alabastine. Further in regard to rain coming through I have visited the school on two separate occasions during a prolonged rain and beg to advise that the roof does not leak.\n\nAs it is now nearly five months since we should have received the final payment we respectfully request that you take the matter up with the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, with a view of having a check covering the amount due in a short time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBrechin & Haney\n\nPer ____\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only way to effectively keep the basement dry would be to install on the outside at the bottom of the foundation wall all the way around the building a four inch field tile drain, same to be connected to the drain leaving the building. The top of the field tile drain, up to the level of the ground, to be filled in with coarse gravel, and the drain leaving the basement should be deep enough to carry away any water that will collect.\n\nIt will be impossible, of course, to do anything with this until the spring, but I would ask you to please keep it in mind, and when weather conditions will permit obtain and submit to the Department a price for the field tile drain above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

About a year ago we expended quite a sum of money driving for water but had no success. This man claims he can locate water with a crooked stick, and the two Teachers and myself saw the stick turn in his hand and he said to dig there and we would get water. I cannot get any person to give me an estimate of the cost of digging or driving a well, but the Batchewana Chief Mr Nolan will do the work for 40\u00a2 per hour and Board himself.\n\nIf we drive I will have to buy pipe and a point to drive.

School at Garden River, in looking it over recently I find several matters that need attention.\n\nFirst. There is no proper place to get good water. Mr Bossineau and Mr Lessage two dependable men advise digging a well 10 or 12 ft deep. They are sure good water will be secured at that depth. Mr Bossineau has a well only 10 ft deep and gets splendid water. Digging and lining and proper covering would not cost over $30.00. I would recommend this as something must be done to get a better water supply.\n\nSecond. The roof of the School must be attended to, the plaster inside is already damaged from the water coming through. The ice forms on the lower part of the roof and the water backs up under the shingles. I would recommend galvanized iron be laid on the lower part of the roof extending from the eves up 4 or 5 ft around the entire building. This has been done on some of the large buildings in the City and has proved very satisfactory.\n\nThird. The inside walls of the School are very dirty, and the damage done from the water has left them in bad shape. I would recommend all walls be sized and painted two coats, then heavy burlap put around the lower part of the rooms, as plaster is getting broken.\n\nFourth. The Teachers have asked for two ceiling registers to be put in, as their sleeping quarters are very cold in winter, also two screen doors and several screen windows are badly needed. If these repairs are made it will put the building in splendid shape.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nActing Agent.\nOttawa, June 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the water supply and repairs required to the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, I have to say the Department will approve of having a well dug at a suitable location near the school. It is noted you are of the opinion that good water can be secured at a depth of approximately 12 ft., and that the digging, lining and covering of the well would not cost over $250. You may arrange to have this well dug and a proper covering placed over same. No unnecessary expense should be incurred and, if possible, the cost should be kept down to the estimate mentioned by you.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the roof, the renovating of the interior of the school and installing two ceiling registers, I shall be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having galvanized iron laid on the lower part of the roof extending from the eaves up 4 or 5 ft. around the entire building; also the cost of having the interior walls sized and given two coats of paint and having burlap put around the lower part of the rooms. Please state, also, the cost of installing the two ceiling registers. In furnishing this estimate, you should state the cost of the materials and the labour, separately. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing having the work done.\n\nYou may purchase and have installed two screen doors and several screens for the windows and forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your early reply, giving the information requested concerning the amount of the repairs mentioned above, so that, if it is decided to have this work done, it can be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The only remedy that we have found is to line the tiles all around and lay sufficient width up on the roof.\n\nIt will take 232 linear ft of metal 36\" wide to go around it and also 232 pieces 12\" wide.

INSPECTOR BENNETT,\ndated September 30th, 1927, on his inspection of the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 13-3-6.\n\n\"1. Cupboard needed for Jr. Room. Nothing there now.\n\n2. New well is absolutely no good. The water coming from it smells and is tainted and cannot be used.\n\n3. Walls of Jr. classroom need burlap as a protection from the children. That much of the wall is quite marked up.\"\nOttawa, October 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School, states that a cupboard is needed for the junior classroom. It is thought that you might be able to arrange to have an inexpensive cupboard, with lock and key, built locally, which would serve the purpose. Please ascertain from a local carpenter the cost of building a suitable cupboard of an inexpensive type and inform the Department.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the new well is unsatisfactory and that the water obtained from it smells and is tainted and cannot be used. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter. You should state what steps you would recommend be taken to remedy the conditions as mentioned by the Inspector.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the walls of the junior classroom should be burlap. He states the walls are marked up. Please state the approximate cost of having burlap placed around the walls of this classroom.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to have a report from you regarding the above matters at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

School Garden River. In reply, I beg to say, that I would recommend that a pipe be driven the present well a sufficient depth to get away from the surface water. Of course there is the possibility that we may not be successful in getting water, but it is worth trying, the school certainly must be supplied with good water. Owing to the uncertainty of the proposition, I am unable to give an estimate as to the approximate cost, but I should say that the labour and material would not exceed $40.00.\n\nAlso re burlap for the walls of the Junior Class Room. I beg to submit what I consider a very reasonable figure for the job. The measurement around the wall is 33 yards, and the price put on, and one coat of paint is $1.10 per yd. I would strongly recommend that the two Class Rooms be done and also the two wash rooms, as the walls are very dirty. The entire measurement for all is 96 yds, and at $1.10 per yd complete would be $105.60.\n\nAlso a bookcase for the above school, I can have a very suitable one built, stained and varnished to match woodwork in school for the sum of $34.00.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa Ont.\n\nActing Agent.\nOttawa, October 13, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the well at the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School, also the burlapping of the walls and the providing of a bookcase.\n\nWith reference to the well, it is noted you recommend that a pipe be driven down the present well a sufficient depth to get away from the surface water and that you consider this would be the best arrangement to make. If you are satisfied that this would overcome the difficulty in the water supply for this school, you may arrange to have the pipe installed. If possible, the cost of the labour and material should be kept within your estimate of approximately $40.00.\n\nRelative to the burlap required for the walls, I have to say that the Department will approve of having this burlap put on the walls of both classrooms and the two washrooms. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $105.60. If possible, this work should be carried out without unnecessarily interfering with the classroom routine.\n\nYou may arrange to have a suitable bookcase built, have it stained and varnished to match the woodwork in the school and supplied with lock and key. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $34.00.\n\nPlease attend to the work in connection with the well before the cold weather sets in and the other work can be carried out when considered most advantageous. When all is completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H.

If you recommend that the painting be undertaken, please give an estimate of the cost of the material and labour, and state definitely the amount of painting that should be done, also how you would propose the work should be undertaken.

I might also add that the shed is very necessary, as most of the wood remains outside during the winter and has to be dug out of the snow. I may say that I can get the work done for the above prices but if the Department wishes me to call for tenders I will do so.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should arrange for the purchase of the paint, oils and other material required, obtaining competitive prices and making the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest. Please see that a good grade of paint, etc., is procured and arrange for the labour in having the work performed, under the direction of a competent painter. You should keep proper time sheets of the labour employed. A supply of forms for this purpose is enclosed. The outside of the building should be given one coat of paint and the inside, including living room, kitchen, wash rooms and classrooms, given the necessary sizing and two coats of paint. Burlap may be placed around the kitchen. You should select the colours of the paint to be used.\n\nThe cost of this work should be kept within your estimate, viz., $145 for the outside painting and $146 for the inside. Should you require an advance to pay labour, same will be sent you upon request, stating the amount required.\n\nRegarding the extension to the woodshed, would it require to be extended the length mentioned by you, viz., 30 ft.? The Department does not desire to expend any large amount in the extension of this shed. I shall be pleased if you will submit another estimate of the cost of an extension, which should not exceed the length absolutely necessary.

However I do feel if this is granted to the R.C.

C. Indian Day School for supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and for hot lunches for the children during the coming winter months.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the teachers preparing and serving a hot lunch to the pupils at midday on each day the school is in operation and also teaching sewing, knitting, etc. You may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of sewing material as mentioned in the requisition prepared by the teachers, and you may arrange for the purchase, as required, of the various supplies and utensils for the serving of the midday lunch. It is not intended that a regular meal be supplied the pupils, as the purpose of the hot lunch is to augment the lunch brought by the pupils from their homes. It is thought that an expenditure not exceeding $15 per month would be ample during the winter months to cover the cost of the groceries and for supplies required for the serving of the lunch. You should arrange for the purchase of the sewing materials, utensils, and a sufficient quantity of food supplies to enable the teachers to start serving the lunch, and you may arrange during the winter months for the purchase of the food supplies as required. It is expected that the teachers will see that there is no waste of these supplies. Please forward certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the sewing material and cooking utensils, and also from time to time for the supplies for the midday meal.\n\nIf the teacher of the Anglican School will prepare and serve a similar lunch to the pupils at midday, the Department would favourably consider authorizing the supplies required upon receipt of a requisition for any supplies and utensils, etc., that may be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You may also have prepared for next year a garden plot.\n\nYou will please make an effort to find the trouble with the drain from the cellar.

J. Greening, regarding his inspection of the GARDEN RIVER R. C. INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on October 13th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 13-3-6.\n\nBuilding:\n\nIt is in excellent shape except for the fact that water leaks into the cellar. At time of inspection, I took the trouble to measure the water lying in the cellar. There was a depth of almost four inches.\nOttawa, November 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Garden River R. O. Indian Bay School, has drawn attention to the condition of the drain from the cellar of the school building. He states that at the time of his inspection he took the trouble to measure the water lying in the cellar and that there was a depth of almost 4\".\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter dated June 23rd, last, in which you were requested to make an effort to find the cause of the trouble with the drain. It is noted that you forwarded an account to the amount of $24 for \"digging up cellar drain and making temporary outlet for water\". It appears from the Inspector's report that the work done to the drain last summer has not solved the problem and, as the present condition is dangerous to the health of the pupils and to the building, I would request that you give this matter further attention and report to the Department what you consider should be done to provide proper drainage and to prevent the water from getting into the cellar. You should give an estimate of the cost of any work you would recommend be carried out. You should also state whether this work could be done this Fall. When we have your report, consideration will then be given as to whether this work can be authorized at the present time or not. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request we have examined the premises of the R.C. School at Garden River and we are prepared to waterproof the basement of this building making it watertight for the sum of Sixty Six dollars ($66.00).\n\nWith reference to drain from the School to the Creek we are prepared to supply material and do all labour consisting of vitrified pipe with cemented joints for the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00).\n\nTrusting we may be favoured with this work, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcLartys, Harten & Wiber Limited.\n\nPer: [Signature]\n\nJMcL:R.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.13-3-5 of the 4th instant with reference to the cellar drain at the R.C. School, Garden River, I am enclosing a letter from McLarty's Harten & Wiber Contractors giving the cost to make the basement waterproof.\n\nI may say that when we dug up the drain last summer we found that the joints were fully one half apart and wrapped with tarpaper which had rotted and let in the sand, and it would be necessary to dig up the entire drain 400 ft. and lay proper tile with cemented joints. We made a temporary raft that time which took care of the water until the heavy rains in October.\n\nMr. McLarty who is a reliable contractor states that he is prepared to make the cellar waterproof by putting in a new floor and coating the entire cellar with waterproof cement for the sum of $66.00 which seems to be reasonable, and will I believe solve the problem.\n\nThere is at present only one inch of water in the cellar and I am having this taken out at once. Mr. McLarty can do this work as soon as the cellar is dry.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. McLarty be given the job of making the basement waterproof for the sum of $66.00\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 14, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the drainage from the cellar at the Garden River R. C. Indian Day School and enclosing a quotation which you received to waterproof the basement and make it watertight.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your recommendation to make the cellar waterproof by putting in a new floor and coating the entire cellar with waterproof cement, for the sum of $66. You may, therefore, arrange to have this work carried out, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed. The total cost should not exceed the estimate given by you, viz., $66. It is hoped that as a result of this work the difficulty occasioned by the water seeping into the basement will be overcome.

I therefore had it done at once and also had it cleaned which hadn't been done for a good while. It is in first class shape now, may also say that I had to buy one 12 ft 2\" plank to put on the sill of the school over the cistern as the sill was getting badly decayed.\n\nI would recommend that enclosed account for labour be paid and also the plank paid for.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario.\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| Dec. 10 | Lunch supplies for R.C.

If I am permitted to believe I could get some of the keep\u2014grown up to get out of place. They for a very moderate price. If the wire could be gotten. Of course I shall await your advice on this.\nand if you think well of it I can ask Mr. Sims permissin' to let me deal with the boys for the pots etc. The lumber for closets also can be obtained at very low rate from Turko Falls or Hallday and I could have one of their handy Indian men to do the carpentering. If permitted I could pay it off at I believe cheaper than by dealing in Toronto. Then I could effect the bill\u2014They I mean only for lumber for closets & work on patios.

I did not know when he spoke of it at Spaine whether you meant me to go out or to go myself or not. May I? or should I ask Mr. Smith? It will only cost more if you mean do it. However just advise me what to do. If I had the permission to do it, perhaps you would tell Mr. Smith. Perhaps you should let me help him. Mr. Smith is very efficient and will help me out.\n\nLastly I wonder whether you can help James out for just one year more. He came to see me and pleads to be allowed to go out this year. I interviewed the Principal of Technical School and he assured me that he will exert every special effort in James' behalf in order that he may complete successfully the Commercial Course this year. It is a Special Course given at Tech. James has won favor by his conduct and application.\nhe tried does not seem to be able to work hard in Algebra & Chemistry. Mr. Henry Municipal Tech says he will study him carefully & if he finds that he is not capable of great progress before too long in terms she will notify me at once.\n\nNow see, the poor boy feels he must fit himself for something and he had more courage & perseverance than any of their class. However he told me this year, that he felt he was a failure but that he believed he could complete Commercial Course this year if the Dept would help him. \"Otherwise\" he said \"there is no hope for me to go on to school.\" He will continue to \"plod\" as one of his teachers told me he did\u2014and I believe he can make good on the course.\n\nPlease, Mr. Phelan give him this last chance\u2014for he shows in every way that he is a little man. It would take $175.00 for board. Tuition is free. I shall anxiously await your advice and tell me whether to apply through Mr. Jones officially.\nI know you will help accept\nPlease excuse this rush\nink blots appear just now.\nI'm real ashamed & need\nit but its mail time now.\n\nSincerely,\nCatherine Dressel\nOttawa, September 10th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss O'Driscoll, teacher of the Garden River R.

You should arrange, also, for the installing of new steps, platforms, pulley cords for windows and other minor repairs that are necessary. The total expenditure should not exceed your estimate of $200. It is to be understood that the labour will be performed by Indians of the Band. You should purchase all materials, from firms on the approved list, and obtain accounts, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nReturns should be kept of the labour employed, and full particulars should be given regarding the days or hours each man was engaged and the rate paid.\n\nThis work should be carried out during the coming summer holidays. Please see that a good job is completed and at the lowest possible cost. The above authorized amount must not be exceeded in performing all the painting and repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

This is quite a little distance and here also I often find that the Truant Officer is not at home\u2014 thus necessitating much inconvenience, and I am obliged to make another trip.\nIf this favour be granted it will surely mean a great deal to me as it will be of great benefit in our work.\n\nThe approximate cost for school year would amount to $30 and the box costs $2.50.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nCatherine Whisell\nOttawa, September 20, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say that the Department does not supply telephones for teachers in Indian day schools.

These are serious times and all interested in Indian education are expected to co-operate as expenditure must be kept at a minimum.

She intimated, also, that blinds are badly needed for the windows.\n\nIn this connection, may I refer to departmental letter to you dated July 8, 1942, in which you were authorized to buy certain supplies necessary at this school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could visit this school at an early date and discuss with the teachers, who will likely be there at that time, the best ways and means of decorating the interior of the school, so that the general surroundings will be reasonably attractive.\n\nWhen you are there, it would be appreciated, also, if you made an inspection of the school grounds. Miss Burke is of the opinion that these grounds are wholly unsuitable as a playground but might be improved by levelling and seeding. You should send in a specific recommendation in respect to steps that might be taken to improve the playground surrounding this school. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.F.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

This made itself felt among the pupils and for a while there was \"guerilla warfare\" to and from school in active style. However they are most agreeable lately, and, at least among the children, the feud has died out or nearly so.\n\nThe single desks and the decoration of walls and ceilings has had a most subduing influence on both boys and girls. When the school opened in January, I was greeted with a chorus of: \"Miss, is it ever nice\" \"Miss, it is just swell\". We notice a much better and more cooperative spirit among both, parents and pupils, but punctuality and attendance are not up to the mark; at least not what we hoped for. Some certainly deserve credit for regularity and studiousness, but no amount urging or effort on our part can interest or waken up a few of the parents. As a last resort we sent the local constable around but I do not think they are afraid of him, perhaps the Mounties could help.\n\nOur Agent, Mr. Lawrence, has been most considerate and cooperative. We had an understanding with him last fall that social evenings could be held in the school provided school property was not damaged and there was no rowdyism or drunkeness. These social gatherings brought us in friendly contact with the people and promoted good fellowship. Now we are annoyed by one of the Councillors, Mr. Williams, who claims he is a ward of the Department and tells us we are breaking \"the Sabbath\" etc. He intrudes even while the games or other entertainments are going on! I understand Constable Thibault has been active in breaking up their affairs when held in private homes, altho' I do not think he goes himself probably has his agents.\nIf the Department would notify those men to leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it. After all it is not their affair. We could never get around to all the houses, and the social evenings held occasionally give us the opportunity of meeting the people we would otherwise miss. It is not practical to hold them on week days, it would interfere with our class work.\n\nI know my letter is altogether too long, but before closing I would like to let you know how much we appreciate the moving pictures held in the school. We had them for the first time on Monday. They have a decided educational value and bring both the children and adults in touch with the world's great questions of today. I hope they will continue to be given in the school.\n\nTrusting I have not encroached too long on your time and thanking you cordially for all the help you have given us.\n\nRespectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have a letter from the Principal of the Garden River R.C. School in which she states that, while there appears to be a better and more co-operative spirit among both parents and pupils, the punctuality and attendance are not as good as they should be. This applies particularly to a few of the parents who do not seem to recognize the importance of sending their children to school regularly. Any assistance that you can give Miss Burke in this regard would be appreciated.\n\nThe following is an additional extract from Miss Burke's letter:\n\n\"Our Agent, Mr. Lawrence, has been most considerate and co-operative. We had an understanding with him last fall that social evenings could be held in the school provided school property was not damaged and there was no rowdyism or drunkenness.

Many are out. I hope do not have to close school, but it may come to that.\n\nJust got word from Dr. Heath the measles are not as severe or dangerous as I thought.

Marie, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss S. Burke, teacher of the Garden River R.C. School, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"We are snowed in almost to the eyes here. It took a man and relays of the school boys one whole day to get the snow and ice off the roof when I returned after Christmas. I wanted to have the snow plough turn in at our gate and make a road from the school to the highway and in turning make a circuit in the yard, instead of piling the snow up five feet deep at the gate. I did not succeed in getting the favour, but I don't see why it cannot be done. It takes the boys nearly a half day shovelling the bank the plough makes at both gates.\"\n\nMiss Burke's request appears quite reasonable and it would be appreciated if you could arrange to have the snow plough do what she requests. I feel there should be no difficulty in arranging this with the provincial authorities who, I suppose, are supplying the snow plough on the highway.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGarden River, Ontario.\nFeb. 9, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn Account with: Mr. John P.

There has always been difficulty along this line. One year we lighted the fires with heavy school wood and kerosene\u2014a dangerous and disagreeable system. No light or kindling wood was supplied for two or three months. Another year the kindling was brought in six-foot length slabs from the mill, and lay out for over a month in the rain before I could get it split and sawed in stove lengths. During the vacation some of our wood has been stolen.\n\nOn the whole it is most unsatisfactory and has always been a cause of worry. Even when it is brought, it is often heavy and too large for the stoves\u2014hence clumsy and so heavy to lift. Then it has to be re-split, and this costs high, as the natives do not believe in speed.\n\nThe crude-oil system is much cheaper and more convenient. The extra expense in procuring stoves suitable for the purpose would be paid in a short while. As far as I know, the crude oil stoves would cost about $125, each. We would need one for each classroom and a much smaller one for the living room. I forget the amount of oil needed for each room, but it was far cheaper than the wood.\n\nLast summer you spoke of giving new floors. If you cannot give us both, I would prefer the crude-oil system to be installed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6129, File 390-5, part 6)\nOttawa, May 6, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is considering burning crude oil at the Garden River R.C. Day School. I understand it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure wood and that, as a consequence, green wood has to be used to a great extent during the winter months.\n\nI have been informed that crude oil stoves can be purchased in Sault Ste. Marie for an approximate amount of $125.00. Three of these would be required at the Garden River R.C. School.\n\nPlease investigate the matter thoroughly and let me have a report from you. At the same time you should obtain a quotation for the oil stove and forward this for our consideration. The name and address of the firm quoting should be given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.
