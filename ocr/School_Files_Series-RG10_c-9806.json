Indian Residential School at this Agency, complained to me of some trouble the school was experiencing with their hot water system, for which they could not find the cause. I engaged a local machinist, Mr. E. Rotherham, to visit the school and ascertain the trouble, and he has reported to me that there is a leak in the steam coil inside the hot water tank which is preventing the water from heating. This hot water tank is constructed of heavy boiler plate iron, and, as it has no manhole, by which one could get to the interior, it will be necessary to have one cut out before any repairs can be made to the steam coil inside. Mr. Rotherham has not the necessary tools for this work and it will be necessary to bring in a man from Lloydminster to do it; but as the school in the meantime is without hot water, I would ask you to telegraph me authority to have the trouble remedied. I do not think the job will be a very expensive one, probably under $50.00.\n\nI enclose a rough sketch which I had Mr. Rotherham prepare for me, which I believe will aid the Department in understanding the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nthe following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, January 27, 1931.\n\nLang Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nONION LAKE, Sask.\n\nREFERENCE LETTER TWENTYSECOND IF NEW COIL MORE EXPENSIVE YOU MAY REPAIR WATERTANK CATHOLIC SCHOOL.\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 4)\nONION LAKE R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on May 6th, and made a general inspection of the school and outbuildings. There are 119 pupils enrolled, 56 boys and 63 girls, all of whom\nONION LAKE R.C., INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nwhom were present on the day of my visit. There were two pupils sick in bed under the doctor's care, but the general health amongst the others appeared to be very good, and they presented a clean and well nourished appearance. The pupilage is divided into three classes - senior, intermediate, and junior. There are three Sisters who act as teachers. Sister St. Wilfred, in charge of the senior room, has a first class Alberta certificate. Sister Stebbing, intermediate classroom, and Sister St. Delmas, in charge of the junior classroom, each have Quebec certificates. The staff appear to be quite efficient.\n\nThe girls are given training in cooking, sewing, knitting, and laundry work, and during the summer months, in the milking of cows. The boys assist on the farm and in the care of the stock. They are given ample meals of wholesome nourishing food, including soup, meat, eggs, potatoes, bread, butter, puddings, tea, and milk. The diet is varied.\n\nI found the school building very clean and tidy throughout. This is a comparatively new building, but the work on the building was not performed in a satisfactory way. The plaster is cracked, and has fallen off in many places, and the paint on the outside of the building has peeled off to the boards. The lighting, heating, and plumbing appears to be satisfactory. The fire hose and equipment in the interior of the building is in good shape. A large 20 horse power Fairbanks-Morse engine, together with a force pump, is installed in a separate building for fire protection, but this unit cannot be used as there is no belt tightener provided.\nONION LAKE R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nand when they start the engine they cannot keep the belt on the pulleys. A belt tightener with a pulley with a 20\" face, together with a shift lever, should be provided in order to make this unit workable. There is ample hose provided in connection with this plant, but it is absolutely useless, for the purpose for which it was provided, in its present condition.\n\nThere is also need for a small storage cellar in the building to enable them to keep milk and food stuffs. There was no room provided for this purpose. It could be easily added to the west side of the kitchen.\n\nIf burlap were provided in the hallways and stairways, it would be a great protection to the plaster in this building, which appears to be of a poor quality and easily knocked off.\n\nThe farm at this school is in charge of a practical farmer and so far has been very satisfactory. They have 170 acres under cultivation. Last year they raised 4,400 bus. of grain, 2,190 of which was wheat. They had 1,375 bus. of potatoes and a large quantity of other roots and vegetables sufficient for their requirements. They also grew 45 tons of sunflowers.\n\nThere are 10 cows milking, and 2 to freshen, and they already have 8 calves this spring. These animals are all Ayrshires. They have 62 pigs and about 80 hens. Their henhouse is rather small for the requirements of an institution of this size, and it should have at least another section added.\n\nIt was noted that a new ice house has been built since my last visit. It was also noted that a brick chimney...\nONION LAKE R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nchimney has been built from the laundry, which adds a great measure of safety and convenience.\n\nThe work at this school appears to be progressing in a very satisfactory way. The Rev. Father Portier is in charge as Principal. He appears to be a good business man, and is taking a keen interest in the welfare of the school. He is assisted by Mr. Balduc as Farmer, and Mr. Chartier as engineer. The interior work is performed by thirteen Sisters including the Superior, Rev. Sister St. Ferdinand, who has had many years experience in managing Indian schools.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency which were inspected by Mr. Murison.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the St. Lawrence Day School on the Cold Lake Reserve. I concur in his remarks.\n\nThe work at the other schools appears to be carried on in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYou will note the Inspector's remarks regarding the 20 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse engine, with force pump, at the R.C. Residential School, namely that it is of no use without a belt tightener. This should have been provided by the school authorities themselves. We cannot attempt to look after the hundred and one details in connection with these schools, unless we make up our minds that we are to manage them entirely and be responsible for everything.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11 of the 22nd instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his recent inspection of the various schools in the Onion Lake agency.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's remarks that the 20 N. P. Fairbanks-Morse engine at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School requires a belt tightener, I have to say the Department is taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Turner, with the request that he have the school authorities arrange to have a belt tightener and pulley, together with a shift lever, provided, in order to make this unit workable. We are also drawing attention to the condition of the plaster which, the Inspector states, has fallen off in many places.\n\nThe Agent is also being written with reference to the various suggestions of the Inspector regarding matters that require attention at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his recent inspection of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, states that the 20 H. P. Fairbanks-Morse engine, used for fire protection, is in an unworkable condition. He states that a belt tightener with a pulley with 20 inch face, together with a shift lever, should be provided in order to make this unit workable. I have therefore requested that you will take this matter up with the school authorities at once and arrange with them to install the necessary equipment to place the unit in a workable condition. This should be provided by the school authorities themselves. The Inspector states that, while ample hose has been supplied in connection with the fire protection, it is absolutely useless for the purpose at present, until the engine has been placed in good condition.\n\nThe Inspector further draws attention to the condition of the plaster which, he states, has cracked and fallen off in many places. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter, as well as any recommendation with reference to the necessity of repairs being carried out at the present time. If you recommend that any work be done in connection with the plastering, please state in what parts of the building it is required and the approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n\nONION LAKE, SASK.\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of May 29th last, No. 115-8-5, with reference to Mr. Inspector Murray's on the R. C. Indian Residential School here, and, in reply to the first paragraph thereof, to state that I am still in correspondence with the Washburne-Morse Company with respect to one of their engines for this school which is unworkable. I have furnished them every bit of all the information it requires and believe that this trouble will be made right almost immediately.\n\nWith respect to the condition of the plaster at this school. Most of the damage has been done on the two stairways, east and west, from the basement to the second floor. There are also a few patches requiring an extra plastering and other parts of the building. The whole of this work can be done for, approximately, $25.00.\n\nIn connection with this work I would say that both the Reverend Principal and the Sister Superior urged me to ask the Department to have burlap placed throughout these halls and stairways, and, if the Department will see its way to do so I would certainly recommend having it put on. The quantity required would be about 200 yards, which at 50\u00a2 per yard would amount to $100.00 and, together with an allowance of $60.00 for the necessary moulding and labour would cost a total of, approximately, $160.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the plaster in various parts of the building at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have the repairs to this plaster carried out. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $25. After the repairs have been completed, please forward a certified account, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelating to the request of the Reverend Principal to have burlap installed throughout the halls and stairways, I have to say that we have no funds available for this purpose, and this work will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Kennedy M.P.\ndesires to secure some further information regarding the Brown Hudson contract relating to the erection of an Indian School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve about\nthe year 1927; will you kindly furnish him with the desired information.\n\nYours truly,\nThomas G. Murphy\nAugust 18th, 1931.\n\nDr. D.C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt.-Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn re claim of Brown and Hudson.\nIn re erection of Indian School at Onion Lake in or about the year 1927.\n\nRelative to the above claim I submit the following observations:\n\n1. The merits of this claim were originally presented to your Department by J.T. Thorsen, ex M.P.\n\n2. Latterly the claim was gone into by our Firm, and certain facts presented to your Department.\n\nA careful perusal of all correspondence impresses upon me the importance of ascertaining the following facts, namely: When the Department decided to erect a new school in the area in question was it the original intention to have the school erected at or adjoining the site of the old school at Onion Lake? If so, when was the decision arrived at or communicated in any way in respect to the erection of a school some distance from the former site?\n\nAs this phase of the matter seems very important to me I interviewed the Minister, the Hon. T.G. Murphy when going through Winnipeg last week and obtained from him the necessary authority directed to you to make available to me all information or correspondence relating to the erection of the Indian School in question.\n\nFor that purpose I enclose herewith the original authority signed by Mr. Murphy, and would very much appreciate receiving the following information:\n\n1. Was it the original intention to erect a new school at or near the site of the old school at Onion Lake? or was the erection at that point considered?\n\n2. If such was the original intention when was the change of the location to the present site of the new school decided upon?\nWill you kindly furnish me with all Departmental correspondence and memoranda relevant in any way to the question of the site on which the school was to be located or any changes in respect thereto.\n\nThe Minister advised me that he would be returning through Winnipeg before very long and I arranged to obtain this very necessary information from you in the meantime so I could then take the whole matter up with him in detail.\n\nIf I can have this information at your earliest convenience it would be very much appreciated, also any relevant facts which occur to you relevant to the question whether or not the mistake of Brown and Hudson as to the location of the school was an honest mistake.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

The original and only intention was to erect the said building on such a site as might be selected as being particularly suited for the purpose wherever that might be.\n\nI am enclosing departmental correspondence and memoranda relative to the question of the site on which the school was to be located.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.W.

Indian Residential School has now been put in working order. It appeared that the trouble was caused by the pump being too powerful for the size of the discharge, which caused the belt slipping. However, by the installation of a by-pass this has now been overcome. I enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 201 and 202, amounting to $13.65 and $44.72 respectively, in connection with this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report with respect to the lighting plant at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nThe school could obtain lights only whilst the engine was running and reported to me to this effect. I had Mr. E. Rotherham, local electrician, look over the plant, and he reported that the batteries were used up; that many of them had broken plates and that all were defective. The Reverend Father Portier, the principal, wanted immediate action, and, as, at the time of our conversation, he was just leaving for Lloydminster, I advised him to speak to the Indian Commissioner over the telephone. He demurred at doing this and said he would rather telegraph, and asked me to draft a telegram for him, which I did. On one or two occasions since then I have asked Father Portier if he had yet received any word of new batteries being supplied; and on the last occasion, yesterday, he told me that he had ordered a new set from Edmonton, and that they would be installed in about two weeks time. The Reverend Principal also asked me to write the Department requesting it to bear the cost of this installation, and this I am pleased to do, as it was really imperative to have these batteries replaced.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI wired you on the 22nd October advising you of the condition of the storage batteries at the R.C. Residential School at Onion Lake and followed this by another telegram on the 29th idem. On the 2nd instant you telegraphed stating that you would advise me in regard to the batteries as soon as possible. Since then I have had no further information from the Department, and shall be glad to know how the situation stands at the present time and if any action has been taken to remedy conditions there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

School.\n\nOn the 20th of November I received a letter from the Indian Agent stating that the Principal, on his own responsibility, ordered new batteries from an Edmonton firm, as I presume he considered the matter urgent, and I understand that they have been installed. Under these circumstances I am not ordering the batteries from the A. F. Miller Hardware Co.

Brown and Hudson, Winnipeg, Man., $79,891.00\n- Wynolds Construction Co., St. Boniface, Man., $64,000.00\n- H. H. Wyant, Winnipeg, Man., $54,902.00\n- J. H.

The following is a statement showing the amount paid to Mr. Brown for extra work performed in addition to his contract at the Onion Lake R. C. School, together with deductions for work omitted.\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Contract Price                                   | $79,891.00 |\n| Extra                                           |          |\n| Recreation room entrances @ $25 each             | $450.00  |\n| Partitions in corridors @ $2.00                  | $156.00  |\n| Pit in machinery room for pressure tanks         | $157.75  |\n| Stairway to Gallery from Chapel                  | $55.34   |\n| Paper on sheeting under Metal Ceiling            | $44.00   |\n| Copper wash tables                               | $200.00  |\n| Extra pulley                                     | $13.96   |\n| **Total**                                        | $1,069.05 |\n\nTotal: $80,979.05\nDeductions\n\nPartition omitted in sewing room .................. $73.65\nPartition omitted in Sisters' community .......... $38.79\nClothes Closet omitted in Priests' sitting\nroom ........... $35.38\n2 Doors, Frames and trim in Chapel ............... $49.85\n2 \" \" \" \" \" in corridor to chapel .............. $40.47\nCement base and floor in machinery room ......... $52.90\nCement furnished for repairing floors ............ $13.05\n$295.29\n\nThe following items were claimed for extra work by Mr. Brown but were not allowed for the following reasons:\n\n1. Balance for verandah extension and stairs to chapel, $501.00\n   Mr. Hamilton, who was the Inspector of Construction gives the following explanation of this extra charge and Mr. Brown was paid on this amount $86.34.\n\n   \"Verandah extension and Stairs to Gallery in Chapel. I authorised the stairs to the gallery in the chapel, and which item I have allowed them $6.34 in the final estimate, and in reference to the verandah I refused to have anything to do in the matter on receiving your letter of July 12/27, and I notified the Sister Superior of your decision. She then took the matter up with the Contractor who gave her a price for the work and which she accepted and authorised the work to be carried out, which they did and when completed Mr. Hudson received a cheque for part of the amount and made arrangements with her to pay an account for gravel or $50.00 to the Indian Agency, and the balance which amounted to about $50.00 was taken up for wood which the Mission furnished them, therefore the Department had nothing to do with the extension to the verandah.\"\n\n2. Brass Clips for doors. This amount of $15.00 was not allowed.\n   The following is Mr. Hamilton's explanation:\n\n   \"I am surprised at Brown and Hudson asking for an extra on these clips, they were used for the folding doors between the classrooms on the ground floor. The hangers on those doors were not put on properly at first and when they tried to make them work they split the styles of some of the doors and ordered them to have the doors replaced so they offered to put these clips on, if I would allow them to use the doors, so I consequently consented, providing they made a good job of it and that is where the clips were used, which saved them...\"\n\"from having other doors ordered.\"\n\n3. Extra excavation and concrete work for machinery room $273.92. Of this amount $137.75 was allowed. The following is Mr. Hamilton's explanation:\n\n\"The work was carried out by the men from time to time and I was there all the time that the work was being done. I told the Contractor that the work would be paid for according to the detailed estimate which they furnished me at my request, as there was no estimate given for the work, and the second clause on page 4 of the specifications covers that item.\"\n\n4. Extra electrical work $117.86. This item was not allowed. The following is Mr. Hamilton's explanation:\n\n\"The account for extra electrical work as per invoices from MacDonald Wilson Electric Co., and forwarded to you Dec. 16th which includes supplies ordered by the Mission, and as for the contractors financing the work they had nothing to do with it and it seems hardly the right thing to do to ask for 10% of the account.\n\n5. With reference to question No. 3 included in the $250 claimed by Mr. Brown for change of site there is an item of $1,200 for cost of gravel, and the following is the explanation furnished by Mr. Hamilton with reference to this item:\n\n\"All the gravel used in the building did not cost them more than $1.25 per yard as most of it was purchased within a mile of the job and when the pit ran out they hauled from another pit from which they paid $1.25 per yard for hauling and 20\u00a2 to the Agency. The reason the Government had to pay $1.75 for the gravel was an account of most of the teams being out harvesting. Mr. Hudson put their trucks at hauling the gravel and they made eight trips per day with each truck from the farthest.\"\nThe Honorable D. Scott  \nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nPlease let me come to you today with a confession to make and a request to present, and the feeling that you will approve what I have done and grant my demand.\n\nA few weeks ago, it was noticed that our lighting system was failing. I tried to get expert advice and service, but all we could do was in vain, and progressively it came so bad that we have not any light and any water pressure unless we keep the engine running all the time, the batteries are completely gone for and have to be replaced. Mr. Turner, the Indian Agent, came to verify the bad predicament in which we are, and admitted that we could not go on any longer that way, and decided we had to notify Mr. Grisham at Regina and to make an appeal to him; Mr. Turner himself wrote this telegraphic message: \"Storage batteries absolutely used up at the R.C. Res. School; can obtain light only whilst engine running. Many of the #12345 jars have broken plates. Kindly arrange for batteries to be replaced.\" The message was sent, but we did not get any answer, and in the impossibility of waiting any more, taking the advice of Mr. Turner and with his approbation I thought it was my duty to go ahead and to buy new batteries. I am just coming back from Edmonton where I made the deal, and I am expecting these batteries to be soon installed.\n\nWell that's what I have done, the necessity was patent and pressing, I had no time to communicate with you and to obtain your approbation, so I hope confidently that you wont refuse your approbation and now the granting of a special help in order to pay the bill. The amount of expenditure will go up to $700.00. To have 56 batteries with good materiel and a guarantee I could not manage for less than this amount, but if it is left to us, it will be too heavy to shoulder, specially that this fall we have been obliged to make the acquisition of a new truck.\n\nI trust that in your kindness you will find a way and the money to help us, and in anticipation very sincerely I thank you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOnion Lake R.C. Res. School\nHonorable DC. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI herewith forward a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School concerning the lighting plant at that Institution. I am aware that everything possible was done to repair the plant, but without avail, and that new batteries were immediately required. It is true that the Reverend Principal made this purchase without formal authorization from the Department. But you may notice that the Indian Agent, Mr. Turner, was perfectly acquainted with the precarious situation at the School and it was with his advice that the Principal went ahead and made the purchase of the new batteries.\n\nI hope, Dear Sir, that you will deign to take this matter into serious consideration, and that you will be in a position to recommend the refund of this disbursement in favor of the above Institution.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, December 7, 1931.\n\nMr. Beget,\n\nWhen this account is received,\ndo not make payment but refer it to me.\n\nD.S.C.I.A.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFrom mentioned by\nMinister's Office Revenues\ngiven business for\nC.E.

Residential School has made the purchase of storage batteries required for the lighting plant. Is it to be understood that the school authorities are paying for the batteries in question? As, if so, I presume this can be taken as a precedent and other schools making similar requests will be called upon to meet the charges likewise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 5th, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nReferring to my memorandum of the 4th ultimo regarding the new batteries for the Onion Lake R.C. school, I send herewith a communication from the principal with account attached.\n\nYou will note he bought these batteries from the Blais Bros. Battery Co., Ltd., Edmonton. The principal's letter might seem to bear the meaning that we had agreed to the purchase of these batteries from the firm just mentioned.

I am very glad to hear that you have kindly received my request. Let me tell you today that the new batteries have been installed, and everything is working to the satisfaction of all.

Further, payment for the batteries is to be withheld until a more satisfactory explanation is received from the principal.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJanuary 13, 1932.\n\nDear Father Portier:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with the account for the new batteries at the Onion Lake R.C.

I was almost confident and sure that you would give your approval to what I have done concerning our lightning system, and back up the expenses. Before acting the way I did, I took the advice of your representative here, Mr. Agent Turner, and it is only after I got his approbation and encouragement that I went ahead.\n\nAt the moment I even thought that I would deserve a censure if I did not take steps to relieve the situation for the necessary good of my School.\n\nThen my request to you has been backed up and strongly recommended by the same Mr. Turner, as well as by my Provincial, the Rev. U. Langlois.\n\nLet me hope, I beg, that you will kindly reconsider your decision and give us the help we are in dire need of.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOnion Lake R.C. Res.

Water is right on the job, and I do not think the gravel haul will be more than a mile. Common boards and dimension can be purchased locally; I will ask the owner of the mill to write you re prices.

My tender was based on the above information that the building would be erected at Onion Lake.\n\nFor reasons of which I had no control, this building was not erected at Onion Lake, but was built eight miles from the town, which resulted in higher costs as conditions were much different from those outlined in Lang Turner's letter to me.\n\nExample:\n\nBoarding camps and outbuildings had to be built. Lumber and supplies had to be teamed eight miles from the town. Gravel had to be located and hauled four miles. Water had to be hauled three-quarters of a mile and up an incline of approximately 300 feet. The site was four miles off the main road and could only be reached by traversing private property.\n\nI will enclose Mr. Turner's letter to me. It coincides in detail with the original site at Onion Lake, and not one syllable in it suggests an alternative site.\n\nDue notice of extra costs was furnished the Department and Mr. Murphy suggested an arbitration in his office in the Langevin Bldg., but after accepting it he has failed to act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd.

Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the letter of the 9th instant addressed to the Right Honourable the Prime Minister by Mr. Sam Brown, Contractor, Winnipeg, regarding a claim against the Department arising out of his contract for building the St. Anthony Indian School, Onion Lake Reserve, Saskatchewan, on the alleged ground that the site was changed after the tenders were invited for the building, necessitating additional expenses on his part, I beg to give you the following facts covering the statement made by Mr. Brown in the said letter.\n\nMr. Brown states, \"That the advertisement calling for tenders for the above school stipulated Onion Lake No. 2 School in Saskatchewan.\" This statement is not correct. The advertisement inviting tenders for this building provided that the tenders should be addressed as follows\u2014\u201cTenders for St. Anthony\u2019s Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown further states, \u201cPlans and specifications also stipulated Onion Lake School.\u201d This statement is not correct. The heading of the specifications is as follows\u2014\u201cSpecifications of work to be done and materials furnished in the erection and completion of the St. Anthony\u2019s Indian Residential School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown further states, \u201cThat the specifications instructed bidders to communicate via Long Turner, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, for all information relating to the site of the school. There was a note preceding the specifications that for all information with reference to the site of the proposed building the contractor should refer to Indian Agent Long Turner, Onion Lake, Sask. The specifications provided that before submitting a proposal the bidders shall carefully examine the plans and specifications, visit the site of the proposed work and ascertain for themselves the nature of the soil to be excavated and the amount of excavation required, and also inform themselves as to all existing conditions. With respect to this statement by Mr. Brown he points out that the specifications provided no site reference to the site of the proposed building contractors were to refer to Indian Agent Turner. Pursuant to this direction Mr. Brown wrote to Mr. Long Turner and received a reply stating that the site for the new school was about 30 miles North of Lloydminster. The location as given by the Indian Agent was only of a general character and could not have been intended by him or relied upon by Mr. Brown in defining the boundaries of the site. It is impossible from such information, nor could the information be given me in the exact site by correspondence with an accurate plan of the portion of the Reserve on which the school was to be built. I may say that the Department has never considered any other site for this building but the one on which it is located.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn March 20th, 1927, the Deputy Superintendent General telegraphed to Commissioner Graham asking that arrangements had been made for the site, and on March 31st a telegram was received from the Indian Commissioner stating that an excellent situation for the school had been chosen by the Inspector and the Principal, approximately 1\u00bd miles North of the South-west corner of Seesamkooch, good spring, good farming land and lake. This telegram was confirmed in a letter of the same date from Mr. Graham. In this letter he further states that Mr. Hamilton advised him that the Reserve Principal had selected the site mentioned in his telegram two years ago, and it was situated in the best farming land on the reserve.\n\nMr. Hamilton, Inspector of Construction during the erection of this school, checked the mileage from Lloydminster to the site by the speedometer on one of the trucks and found it to be a little less than 50 miles.\n\nMr. Brown further states, \"that the contract specified that the building was to be erected at Onion Lake, Sask. My tender was based on the above information that the building was to be erected at Onion Lake\". This statement is not correct as above stated both the specifications and the advertisement inviting tenders stated that the building was to be erected on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Sask. Mr. Brown's tender was made and his offer accepted before the contract was signed, and he could not have been misled by the wording of the formal contract which designated this building as the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask. The latter is merely an abbreviation of the fuller description in the specifications on which Mr. Brown had already tendered.\n\nMr. Brown further states, \"that for reasons over which I had no control this building was not erected at Onion Lake, but was built 6 miles from the town, which resulted in higher costs as conditions were much different from those outlined in Letter No. 1's letter to me.\" The description given by Mr. Lang Turner in his letter to Mr. Brown was as correct a description as could be given by letter as the site is about 6 miles or 30 miles south of Lloydminster. There is a lake about 200 yards from the school site, and a fine spring 150 yards from the school building. This spring is at present supplying all water requirements for the school. Most of the gravel used by Mr. Brown was procured within a mile of the job.\n\nMr. Brown apparently did not visit the site to ascertain for himself the necessary particulars as provided for by the specifications. He made arrangements with Mr. Lang to send a man to look over the ground on his behalf. It is said that the man was told at Onion Lake that the site was right beside the old school at Onion Lake. It is not alleged that this man was told by the Indian Agent. The Department can take no responsibility for any information given to this man by anyone else as to the location of this site. Mr. Turner, in his letter to Mr. Brown above referred to, apparently volunteered some information or gave it on request from Mr. Brown as to the availability of gravel, water and lumber. As Mr. Brown in the specifications was referred to the Indian Agent for the location of the site only, and Mr. Brown was requested to visit the site and ascertain the facts for himself, the Department can take no responsibility as to what correspondence passed between the Agent and Mr. Brown as to these matters.\nAs above stated, however, the information given by the Agent to Mr. Brown as to the availability of gravel and water and the site where the school was intended to be erected and was erected is substantially correct.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of Mr. Brown's letter, I beg to say that he has furnished the Department at different times with a statement of his claim for extras for moving the site and has been advised that in view of the facts that favourable consideration could not be given to his claim. When Mr. Brown first submitted his claim the same was referred to Mr. Hamilton, Inspector of Construction on this work, and I beg to quote from Mr. Hamilton's letter as follows:\n\n\"In answer to your letter of the 5th which was received today asking information re claims of Brown and Hudson as to change of site of the R. C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, I will give you my opinion on the several items in the order as they appear in your letter.\"\n\nItem No. 1. Building and furnishing camp $18,000.00.\n\nIn the first place the specifications call for the school to be erected on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, and that the bidders were supposed to visit the site of the proposed work and ascertain for themselves as to the existing conditions, the buildings referred to as bunk house, cook house, office for the company, also office for the Inspector did not cost them $600.00 altogether, and that they got a fair price for them when they were bought with them, and in my opinion it would have cost them far more if they had rented buildings.\n\nItem No. 2. Hauling water. $400.00.\n\nThere is a lake about 300 yards from where the school site is and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building, and if Mr. Hudson had taken the interest in the work he should have had the spring tapped and installed a small engine and a pump at the spring and could have supplied all the water required for the work, also for drinking purposes. This spring is at present supplying all the water required for the school, and as for Mr. Turner saying that the water was right at the site he was correct, and in all my conversation with Mr. Turner he never mentioned any other site than the one where the school is located, and the water is far better.\n\nItem No. 3. Difference in cost of gravel. $1,000.00.\n\nAll the gravel used in the building did not cost them more than $1.25 per yard as most of it was procured within a mile of the job and when the pit ran out they hauled from another pit from which they paid $1.25 per yard for hauling and 20\u00a2 to the Agency, the reason the Government had to pay $1.75 for gravel was on account of most of the time being out harvesting. Mr. Hudson put their machines at hauling gravel and they made eight trips per day with each truck from the farthest pit.\n\nItem No. 4. Hauling lumber and camp supplies.\n\nThe price charged for hauling lumber from Onion Lake was $3.00 per thousand, and the amount of lumber they received from Onion Lake was approximately 35,000 feet, but the balance of the 125,000 feet of lumber, namely about 90,000 they saved money on the hauling as the new school is...\nis about seven miles closer to the railway than the old school site, and the above applies to the camp supplies.\n\nReferring to the change of site they never mentioned anything to me about it till about the time the contracts had been signed and in talking with the Agent, Mr. Turner, at Onion Lake and also the authorities at the St. Anthony's School they told me that they had never considered having the school erected at the old site in Onion Lake.\n\nThere are some conditions that existed in the handling of the work in connection with the erection of the school which was anything but good management, and I feel every reason to believe as any loss which has occurred through the way the work was handled will have to be borne by him, but of course it was his own fault as he should have known the man he was sending there to handle the work.\n\nI hope that the above explanation may be of assistance to you in deciding on the claim referred to, and in reference to the first clause of your letter of regret in having to trouble me in regard to the particulars, I am only too pleased to give you any assistance possible in getting the matter straightened out, for I am sure you must be near the end of your patience, and any other information I can give you will be cheerfully given.

RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school in the forenoon of October 20th. It is under the management of the Roman Catholic Church. The staff consists of the Reverend Father Portier, as Principal, Mr. L. Oullette, as Farmer, and C. Chartier, Engineer. There are also twelve Sisters of Charity, including three teachers, the Superior, cook, laundress, seamstress, and their necessary helpers. The school is well managed and I have always found it in a very creditable condition. The Provincial School Inspector speaks very favorable with regard to the results obtained in the -\nobtained in the classroom work.\n\nThere are two stand pipes running from the basement to the top of the building connected with the pressure tanks for fire protection. Adequate hose are provided on each floor attached to the stand pipes. There are also fire extinguishers placed in easily accessible positions on each floor. Outside fire escapes are also provided which are easy of access. I examined the fire fighting equipment and found it all in good working order. In addition to the provision made for fighting fire in the interior of the building, there is a separate unit installed about fifty feet from the building, which includes a 25 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse engine and a pump with a capacity of 250 gallons per minute. Five hundred feet of hose are provided for this unit, so they are well equipped in this connection. The children receive frequent training in fire drill. I have seen the building evacuated in two minutes from the time the fire alarm sounded.\n\nThe paint on the exterior of the building has pretty well all peeled off, particularly on the West and North sides. Apparently this building was painted at the wrong season of the year, either that or an inferior quality of paint was used as it has been unsatisfactory from the beginning. I noticed that the plaster on the walls in the stairways was badly scaled and broken in places. Where there are so many children climbing these stairs several times daily it would appear necessary to have the plaster walls protected with burlap. This has never been done.\n\nThere are 640 acres of land set aside for the school. It is all fenced in with a four strand barbed wire fence strung on cedar posts. The crop consisted of 35 acres of wheat which yielded one thousand bushels, 45 acres of oats yielded 1900 bushels, 15 acres of rye and 50 acres of green feed. Forty-five acres of summer-fallow were prepared this\nsummer. They have a large garden which provided for their requirements. They took up 400 bushels of potatoes, although the garden was not as good as usual.\n\nThe live stock at the school consists of 46 cattle, 80 hogs, about 150 poultry, and 7 work horses. They milk 13 cows regularly. The cattle are grade Ayrshires. They are not a very good class of cattle in my opinion and I think the Principal would be well advised to dispose of them and get a good quality of Shorthorn or Holstein. Our experience has been that they give a larger flow of milk and are more profitable to raise.\n\nI found the out-buildings in a good state of repair and the premises clean and tidy.\n\nW. Maclean,\nInspector\n6th December, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nFor a considerable part of yesterday afternoon I took up with Mr. Brown his claim with regard to the Onion Lake School. The basis of Mr. Brown's claim is that he was misled as to the location on which the school was to be erected and he endeavoured to place the blame on our Indian Agent. It was pointed out to Mr. Brown that the information given him by the Agent was correct and that if he had been misled in the matter it was due to his own negligence or to the negligence of the man he sent up to ascertain the exact location of the site.\n\nMr. Brown asked that the Department consent to arbitration of his claim. I pointed out to Mr. Brown that so far as I could see there was nothing to arbitrate and that even if he had an apparent claim I would not be in favour of leaving it to arbitration. I advised Mr. Brown that the Exchequer Court was the proper tribunal to adjudicate on any claim brought against the Government. I may say that this view has been concurred in by the Deputy Minister of Justice.\n\nMr. Brown now takes the position that even assuming that he had no legal claim, in view of the remoteness of the location for the erection of this school and the difficulty in getting full information to enable him to properly estimate the cost, and in view of the fact that it cost him, as he alleges, approximately $10,000 more than he got out of the contract, the Department having received the benefit of this excess, he\nthinks as a matter of grace the Department might properly meet him halfway in his loss.\n\nI may say that the Architect is of the opinion that the loss sustained was not due to the lowness of the tender but due rather to the inefficiency of the men that were associated with Mr. Brown in this contract.\n\nI may say that it is not the practice of the Department to make such contributions as is now asked for by Mr. Brown. It is not altogether unusual for a contractor to occasionally lose money on a contract.\n\nI advised Mr. Brown that if he should apply to the Attorney General for a fiat to sue the Department in respect of this claim, that, subject to your approval I would not oppose the granting of the fiat if the application were considered regular in other respects.\n\nMr. Brown desires to see you this morning in further reference to this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegina, March 9th/29.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 5th which was received today asking information re claims of Brown & Hudson as to change of site of the R.C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. I will give you my opinion on the several items in the order as they appear in your letter.\n\nItem No.1 Building and furnishing camp. 1800.00\nIn the first place the specifications call for the school to be erected on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, and that the bidders were supposed to visit the site of the proposed work and ascertain for themselves as to the existing conditions, the buildings referred to as bunk house, cook house, office for the company, also office for the inspector did not cost them 500.00 altogether and then they got a fair price for them when they were through with them and in my opinion it would have cost them far more if they had rented buildings.\n\nItem No.2 Hauling water. 1400.00\nThere is a lake about 200 yards from where the school site is and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building, and if Mr. Hudson had taken the interest in the work he should have done he could have put up a small gasoline engine and a pump at the spring and could have supplied all the water required for the work and also for drinking purposes, this spring is at present supplying all the water required for the school, and as for Mr. Turner saying that the water was right at the site he was correct, and in all my conversation with Mr. Turner he never mentioned any other site than the one where the school is located, and the water is far better.\n\nItem No.3 Difference in cost of gravel 1200.00\nAll the gravel used in the building did not cost them more than 1.25 per yard as most of it was procured within a mile of the job and when the pit run out they hauled from another pit from which they paid 1.25 per yard for hauling and 20 cents to the Agency, the reason the Government had to pay 1.75 for gravel was on account of most of the teams were out harvesting. Mr. Hudson put their trucks at hauling gravel and they made eight trips per day with each truck from the farthest pit.\nItem No.4 Hauling lumber and camp supplies.\n\nThe price charged for hauling lumber from Onion Lake is $3.00 per thousand, and the amount of lumber they received from Onion Lake was approximately 35000 feet but the balance of the 125000 feet of lumber namely about 90000 feet they saved money on the hauling as the new school is about seven miles closer to the Railway than the old school site, and the above applies to the Camp Supplies.\n\nReferring to the change of Site they never mentioned anything to me about it till about the time the contract should have been completed and in talking with the Agent, Mr. Turner at Onion Lake and also the authorities at the St. Anthonies School they told me that they had never considered having the school erected at the old site in Onion Lake.\n\nThere are some conditions that existed in the handling of the work in connection with the erection of the school which was anything but good management, and I feel sorry for Mr. Brown as any loss which has occurred through the way the work was handled will have to be borne by him, but of course it was his own fault as he should have known the man he was sending there to handle the work.\n\nI hope that the above explanation may be of assistance to you in deciding re the claim referred to, and in reference to the first clause of your letter of regret in having to trouble me in regard to the particulars, I am only too pleased to give you any assistance possible in getting the matter straightened out for I am sure you must be near the end of your patience, and any other information I can give you will be cheerfully given. I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. A. Hamilton,\n\n2259 Lorne Street.\nApril 11 1933\n\nThe Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I be allowed to make again several requests already sent to the Department on various occasions. I consider that all I beg instantly is necessary for the good of my School; it has been approved by the Inspector and by the Indian Agent:\n\n1). Materiel for a partition in the children refectory,-cost about $60.00; we will do the work.\n2). Materiel for a cellar and a bakery, that will cost about $525.00; work to be done by the staff.\n3). Burlap or finishing lumber to cover some walls of which the present state is really disgracefull, to cost about $100.00.\n4). A gang-plow for the farm is necessary and will cost about 120.00.\n\nI am really anxious and will be indeed very grateful to have these requests approved and granted; I trust that you will not think that the outlay is excessive.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJos. Portier  \nPrincipal  \nOnion Lake R.C. Ind. School\nOttawa, April 22, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, and, in reply, I have to say that certain funds have been provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for repairs and redecorating of the interior of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. I would request that you take this matter up with the local Indian Agent and have him advise the Department of the work required in the erection of the partition in the children's refectory, the supplying of burlap or finishing lumber to cover some of the walls and any other work required in the interior of the school building. The cost of materials and labour should be definitely stated and only the work urgently required should receive consideration.\n\nI regret we will have no funds to supply the material for a cellar and a bakery or to provide a gang plough for farm purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend Jos. Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nDear Doctor,\n\nMr. A.F.

Batteries for adjustments should be shipped the cheapest way. If not, the difference between the actual cost and what it should have been, will be charged to the owner.\n\nIn order to avoid the expenses to purchasers of B.B.B. Batteries, we authorize our local service stations to make all necessary adjustments without delay.\n\nBLAIS BROTHERS BATTERY Co., Ltd.,\n\nPer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay I call your attention to the fact that the system existing at the said school is far from being modern and at the time I went to install the batteries referred to, I mentioned that I had known the system when I made the sale, I would have refused to give our usual guarantee. However, had I done that when the batteries were installed, it would have looked as if we wanted to shirk our responsibility of a reliable firm. This I refused to do, again taking a chance, on which we lost.\n\nThe handicap in the installation existing at the R.C. school is that the batteries have to be charged in two banks, because the generator can not deliver a high enough voltage to charge them in a straight 112 volt system. That means much more care and attention on the part of the operator and naturally exacts more from the batteries than the modern systems of charging in a straight bank. After my personal call there this week, I am satisfied that the present operator is very conscientious and on his job and I have not the least doubt that the new set of batteries will give service to the extent of our guarantee if not more as in most cases where we have installed batteries.\n\nIn regard to the batteries for the plant in the house you occupy, we beg to confirm our price of $150.00 f.o.b. Lloydminster with a guarantee of five years on adjustment basis as per the attached form.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will meet with your approval and thanking you for your kind courtesy, we remain,\n\nYours truly\n\nBlais Brothers Battery Co., Ltd.\nPer\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hill Esq\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConfirming my verbal reply to your letter of the 17th instant, in regard to the set of batteries installed by us at the R.W. school at Onion Lake on or about the 5th of December 1931. I wish to make the following explanation:\n\nUnfortunately for all concerned, those batteries were burnt up through overcharging and discharging. As mentioned to you, a set of batteries is only good for so many complete cycles and should not be relied upon for carrying all the load one may like them to do. The average life of a battery is from 3 to 10 hundred cycles. If you give that many cycles to a battery in a year's time they are used up. When we give the guarantee we do on a set of batteries we take it for granted that the owner is just as anxious to get the longest service possible out of his investment as we are to give him value for his money. Under the present circumstances, the owners relied upon employees and as a common occurrence in our days, the employees did not realize the extent of their responsibilities.\n\nThe batteries concerned started to give trouble last fall, and realizing the conditions, we done some work to them to try and extend the life for a while. We realized at the time that this was a gamble in the right way, but we lost out. They were too far gone at the time.\n\nAs stated verbally, we are willing to live up to our guarantee as per the attached form. This means that we agree to put in a complete new set of batteries for the sum of $362.50, which represents a service of two years, which we are charging for.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the batteries at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School are practically out of commission. They were purchased in December, 1931, by the Principal, Rev. Father Portier, from Blais Brothers Battery Co., Ltd., Edmonton. Recently, at the request of the new Principal, Rev. Father Pratt, I wrote the firm and they sent down Mr. L. D. Blais, who made an inspection, and his letter of the 26th ultimo, to me, which I am enclosing, describes their present condition, the terms on which they were purchased, also terms for replacement of batteries. At present it is necessary to keep the engine running when light is required, which is neither economical nor practical.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacKenzie Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa:\n\nSir:\n\nOur best and most appreciative thanks for your letter of June 27th. In accordance with your suggestion, we would like to bring before your notice only those repairs and improvements which are absolutely necessary. In the first place the Electric Plant (15 H.P. Machine) which has been in use for seven years is now in need of repair.\n\nOur engineer has been in touch with Fairbanks Morse (Winnipeg) and finds that it will cost approximately $50.00 to have the defective engine fixed.\n\nSecondly, we have excellent Spring water which is pumped from a distance of about six hundred feet to a reservoir in the school yard. Unfortunately however the reservoir near the school is below ground level with the result that surface water, rain and the like, carry down undesirable matter, making the water unfit for cooking and drinking purposes. The agent Dr. Hill, has already strongly condemned the reservoir. On going into the matter we find (given that the Dept. is willing to supply cost of materials) that between $50.00 and $900.00 would be necessary to make a good job, we ourselves being willing to furnish the labour.\n\nFurther the floor in the Recreation Room boys and girls, is much in need of attention as it is very rough and the corridor floors would be none the worse for a coat of paint also.\n\nAt the present time we are at our own expense painting the corridor walls and with our 15 per cent grant reduction in view find that each additional expense however small counts enormously.\n\nTrusting that the Dept. may see their way to help us in our most pressing needs and with renewed thanks for past courtesies\n\nYours very truly,\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 8, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I beg to say that Indian Agent Dr. J. T. Hill was written on the 17th ultimo regarding the electric lighting plant at the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School.\n\nI regret that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to authorize the expenditure that would be required for building a new reservoir for the water and repairing the floor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-5, of the 17th ultimo, with respect to the lighting plant at the R.C. school.\n\nMr. Rotherham, who was called in by the principal of the school in May, condemned the batteries as useless. Since then the principal installed new batteries at a cost of $725.00 less $66.50. These he procured from Blais Bros., Edmonton, who supplied the last set. I did not know that this was being done until the invoice was brought to the office on July 30th, 1934 by the principal.\n\nMy letter of May 2nd, together with an enclosure from Blais Bros., dealt with the situation as it was then and I had been waiting instructions for further action.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nWe were more than pleased to welcome you on the occasion of your visit to our school and were complimented and encouraged by your sympathy and courtesy. During the short time you spent here you saw for yourself just how things were in the engine room. The children are now back and we fear very much that the 15 H.P Y Style Fairbanks Morse engine is about to fail us entirely.\n\nIt is completely played out, having received rough handling prior to my taking Office here and despite the patient and constant efforts of our qualified engineer, it is impossible to do anything more with it.\n\nIt is imperative therefore that the matter be dealt with at all possible speed, otherwise we are soon going to be without light, water and fire protection, and the cold weather will soon be here too.\n\nIf permission be granted, work can begin right away but in the mean time we absolutely must have the use of some kind of an engine to take the place of the one away being repaired.\n\nWe figure that the engine will be away at least two or three weeks. With regards also to engine which is used in case of fire, you agreed, if you remember to have it exchanged for a 20H.P. gas engine and furthermore you promised that if we wrote you later on the matter you would have Grant extended for the services of a Night-watchman from Oct. to March. Naturally after our past experience we dread fire very much.\n\nThanking you for your immediate attention in the matter of the defective engine\n\nI remain Yours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, September 12th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, in which he requests that a grant be allowed to enable him to employ a night watchman.\n\nIt has been decided to allow a grant at the rate of $40.00 a month for this purpose from October 15th, 1934, to April 15th, 1935. You may so inform the Principal.\n\nIf the Principal employs a reliable man and you are aware that he is regularly employed, you may, at the end of each month during the period mentioned above, forward a voucher similar to the one that you forwarded for the same payment last winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J.T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, September 14, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School has drawn attention to the condition of the 15 H. P. Fairbanks-Morse engine, used for lighting, water and fire protection purposes. He states this engine is in need of immediate repair and requests that the Principal advises that it will require at least three weeks to have this engine sent away to be repaired and that, in the meantime, it would be necessary to have another one to take its place. Further, he requests that the engine which is used for fire purposes be exchanged for a 20 H. P. engine.\n\nThe Department is not definitely aware, from the Principal's letter, whether he requires a new engine to replace the 15 H. P. Fairbanks-Morse engine or if he only wishes to have this engine sent away to be repaired. You might also report and state your opinion regarding the Principal's request to exchange the present engine used for fire purposes for a 20 H. P. engine. It is considered that a 20 H. P. engine is of higher power than would be necessary. If possible, you should submit an estimate of the cost of carrying out repairs to the present engines or the supplying of new ones, as requested by the Principal. Please state the horse power of any new engines which you recommend be supplied and also the purpose for which they are required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, September 14, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the gasoline engines required for use at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School and also requesting that a grant be provided to extend the services of a night watchman.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. J. T. Hill, Indian Agent, is being requested to submit a report concerning the engines required.\n\nMr. Hill is also being informed that the Department will extend the grant for a night watchman from October 15th to April 15th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I have to say that, as these batteries were purchased by the Principal without the authority of the Department, you should look to him for payment of your account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.R. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nBlais Brothers Battery Co. Ltd.,\n10361 - 106th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-5, of the 14th instant, with reference to the engines at the R. C. Indian Residential School. The 15 H. P. engine in use at present in the school building is defective. It needs overhauling, and certain portions have to be sent to the factory for adjustment.\n\nThe 25 H. P. engine which was installed in a small detached building was intended for fire protection but it is too slow in starting to be of any use for that purpose. The time required to get it into action is at least 30 minutes. It was suggested to the Deputy Superintendent General and Inspector Murison during their inspection of the school, that it be traded in for a 20 H. P. gasoline engine which could be brought into immediate action in the event of fire. It was also suggested that a lean-to addition be made to the engine room of the main building for the installation of a proposed gas engine where it could also be used as an auxiliary if and when required. I am told that the present engine is being run at full capacity to supply the requirements of the school. A 20 H. P. engine would probably have a little reserve, which would be all to the good, and would last much longer, with less cost, than one that was doing the limit at all times.\n\nThe estimated cost for material for building would be $700.00, additional labour $75.00, repairs to engine, including freight, $75.00, or $850.00 in all.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter this morning from Doctor Hill with reference to the two engines at the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nThe engine in operation in the school proper is defective and a portion of it will have to be sent to the factory for adjustment. The 25 H.P. engine in the detached building, installed for fire protection, is too slow in starting to be of any use for the purpose. It was suggested during our visit that the 25 H.P. engine be traded for a 20 H.P. gasoline engine and placed in a new structure adjoining the engine room of the main building. This addition was to have a reservoir. The estimated cost for material is $700.00, additional labour $75.00, repairs to the present engine including freight $75.00, making a total of $850.00. Doctor Hill appears to be quite anxious about the situation, as the school has absolutely no fire protection. I take it from his letter that the cost of repairs to the engine now in use, which we saw in operation, will amount to $75.00 including freight. If this expenditure is approved, I would suggest that Doctor Hill be wired to that effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the engines at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required in overhauling and adjusting the 15 H. P. engine at present in use in the school building. It is noted that it will be necessary to have certain parts of the engine sent to the factory for adjustment and that the cost, including freight, will be, approximately, $75.00.\n\nThe Department has noted the request that the 25 H. P. engine, which is installed in the small detached building and used for fire protection purposes, be traded for a 20 H. P. gasoline engine, to be placed in a new structure adjoining the engine room of the main building. It has not been stated whether there would be any expenditure in making the trade. The Department will approve of trading in the 25 H. P. engine, provided the cost involved is low. If you can arrange for the trade in or this engine for one of 20 H. P., from a firm on the approved list, and, as stated, if there is no large expense involved, the Department will approve of you making the arrangements for the trade in. It might be advisable for you to have the trade arranged by Mr. Inspector Hurison, who has a list of the approved firms. No doubt, it will be necessary to obtain the new engine to carry on the work of the school while the 15 H. P. engine is being overhauled.\n\nRegarding the erection of a lean-to addition\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nadjoining the engine room in the main building; it is noted you estimate the cost of material for this purpose to be $700.00 and additional labour $75.00. The Department will approve of this work being carried out, if it is not too late, before the extremely cold weather sets in. Purchase of all materials should be made from firms on the approved list. Mr. Inspector Murison would be able to advise and assist you in the purchase and also in the employment of any outside labour that may be required in the erection of the building.\n\nOur funds are extremely limited, and, as no special appropriation was provided for the expenditure above authorized, it is hoped that all costs can be kept within your estimate, viz.: $850.00 - this to include the repairs to the 15 H. P. engine, the trade in of the 26 H. P. engine and the material and labour in erecting the new structure adjoining the engine room in the main building. I would request that you advise the Department whether there will be any added cost in the trade in of the engine mentioned above. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering all expenditure, and these you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison is being informed regarding the authority given you for the erection of the new structure and in connection with the engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the two engines at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School and the erection of a new structure adjoining the engine room of the main building, to house the new gasoline engine, which is to be obtained on a trade in of the 26 H.P. engine.\n\nMr. Agent Hill will, no doubt, communicate with you regarding the trade in of the engine and also with references to the purchase of materials and the labour for the new structure. It is hoped that all costs can be kept within the estimate submitted by Agent Hill and yourself; viz.: $850. A copy of official letter to Mr. Agent Hill is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File-115-8-5\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReplying to yours of the 26th instant, there must be a misunderstanding somewhere.\n\nIn fairness to the principal of the St. Anthony's School, we must say that he told us that the expenditure referred to was not authorized by the department, but as it was urgent to have batteries installed, we agreed to do so immediately and wait until the department would sanction the payment of same.\n\nThe batteries were installed on the 26th of May last and as agreed, we waited patiently. On July the 31st we received a letter from the principal stating that he expected to get the matter settled within a reasonable time. Last month, we received another letter stating that some high officials of the department had been on a tour of inspection of the school and he had succeeded in getting them to approve of the expenditure and we would get our check after their return in Ottawa, which was to be towards the end of August.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we understand your answer to our telegram and it may be that the officers in question were delayed longer than they expected and probably did not have time yet to attend to the matter.\n\nWe hope we have not offended anyone by asking what we considered fair and just and that the matter will be settled within a short time now.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBlais Brothers Battery Co., Ltd.\nPer\n\nIndian Affairs.

We were obliged to run constantly the big engine in order to keep the generator charging. I went to see our Indian Agent and himself wrote to the Blais Bros. about the defective set of batteries and they came to inspect our batteries and gave to the Agent himself their report. In the meantime I had another expert giving a thorough test to the batteries and were found entirely defective.\n\nAs it was urgent that something be done immediately Dr. Hill our Indian Agent told me and Mr. Blais to go ahead and he will take up the question with the Dept.\n\nAs you see nothing was done without permission or from my own authority.\n\nThe reply from Ottawa to Blais Bros. says that these Batteries were purchased without any authorisation it was up to the Principal of St. Anthony's School to pay for them. I have seen today Dr. Hill our Indian Agent and he shown me a letter from Ottawa regarding these Batteries and he was immediately to write again to the Dept. with all the necessary explanations.\n\nHoping dear Mr. Dr. McGill that these explanations will prove satisfactory to you and to the Dept.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly\n\nST.

H. Ashdown Hardware Co.'s Frigidaire Dept. in Saskatoon, the writer had the pleasure of meeting you at Onion Lake and discussing with you the possibilities of Frigidaire Electric Refrigeration for use in the Indian Schools.\n\nWe understand, now, that this matter is under consideration for both the R.C. and Anglican Schools at Onion Lake and also for the Sisters of Assumption School at Deimas and that quotations have already been submitted by Ashdowns. These three schools are all in the territory served by Electric Shop Limited as Frigidaire agents for The J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. and we would be responsible for their installation and service so, to enable us to make adequate preparations for the coming refrigeration season, we are taking the liberty of writing you at this time to inquire as to the probability of any or all of these installations materializing in the near future.\n\nWe might mention that we offer what we believe to be the only skilled refrigeration service between the cities of Saskatoon and Edmonton, the writer having had many years experience and being one of the few factory trained Frigidaire experts in Western Canada.\n\nThanking you in advance for any information with which you may favor us, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nELECTRIC SHOP LIMITED.\nLloydminster.\n\n[Signature]\nPres.\nOttawa, January 21, 1935.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the possibility of installing Frigidaire electric refrigeration at the Indian Residential School in the Onion Lake agency and also in the Residential School at Delmas, Sask. In this connection I have to say the Department does not contemplate installing this equipment in the above schools during the coming fiscal year. No funds for the purpose have been provided in our Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

W. E. Pratt, Principal, R.C. Indian Res. School, Lloydminster, Sask., for Grant towards salary of night watchman.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-8-5 dated September 12, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nReferring to your letter No. 115-8-6, dated October 3rd last, addressed to Hector T. Hill, Indian Agent, Onion Lake Agency, a copy of which was sent to me authorizing the expenditure of $900.00 for material and labour in erecting a new structure adjoining the engine room in the main building, repairing the 15 H.P. engine and the difference in connection with a proposed trade-in of the 25 H.P. engine.\n\nI may advise you that immediately after the receipt of your letter I requested the Indian Agent to obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting the addition which he did and found that the cost of erecting the addition and repairing and installing the engine would exceed the amount allowed. Doctor Hill stated that the season was too far advanced to make a success of the cement work and he asked for my approval to move the present generator into the detached building with the 25 H.P. fire engine to generate the necessary light and power while the 15 H.P. engine was undergoing repairs. I at once got in touch with the Manager of the Fairbanks-Morse Company here and had an interview with him and their Manager from Winnipeg and explained the situation to them. They stated that the plan was feasible and I at once ordered the necessary cable, pulleys etc., to make the necessary hook up and had same shipped to the school.\n\nI had planned to go to the school and telegraphed Doctor Hill to meet me at Lloydminster, but was unable to do so at that time owing to my wife's sudden and serious illness. I however visited the school on January 16th last and was surprised to find that nothing had been done since repairs were still unpacked. The 15 H.P. engine was knocking badly and four days later gave out entirely, leaving the school without light or pumping facilities in 45 degrees below zero weather. They appeared to be helpless with only half an inch of water showing in the gauge glass of the boiler. The Engineer over the telephone stated that he had no means of injecting water into the boiler other than the unit which was out of commission.\n\nI advised that they use their farm tractor by making an opening in the wall of the building to admit the belt and erect a temporary shelter over the engine. This has been done and is working out alright. They have two heating boilers and they were told to shut off one and fill it with water by hand and when the water was exhausted in the one in operation, it could be shut off and the other fired and vice versa. This has met the emergency.\n\nI instructed the Engineer to remove the 15 H.P. engine and prepare a base for the 25 H.P. engine and move it in. When this larger engine is installed it should meet their requirements for many years to come and it will not be necessary to provide the -\nprovide the proposed addition to the engine room. When the larger engine is installed the 15 H.P. engine can be repaired and installed in the outside pump house.\n\nAs there have been too many novices connected with the old engine, I am making arrangements with the Fairbanks-Morse Company to send a competent man to install the 25 H.P. engine properly.\n\nI may say that the reason given by the Engineer for not installing the first proposed hook up with the fire engine was that the building in which it is installed is only a shell and it would be impossible to keep it warm enough in the extremely cold weather to prevent the cooling system from freezing up, and it has been impossible to operate this engine in winter for that reason.\n\nRegarding the proposed trade in of the 25 H.P. engine on a 15 H.P., I found that I could get very little allowance for the larger engine although it has never been used. The reason being that so many villages and small towns find that they can purchase current from the large Power Companies cheaper than they can generate it themselves and there is no demand for that type of engine. In fact they can be purchased for a fraction of their value.\n\nI trust that the Department will approve of the action I have taken. I have had in view providing an adequate unit to provide the requirements at the least possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nOttawa, February 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 4th instant, with reference to the expenditure that was authorized in connection with the erection of a new structure adjoining the engine room in the main building at the Big Lake A.G. Indian Residential School to be used in housing a new gasoline engine, and also with reference to repairing the 15 H.P. engine, and the difference in connection with a proposed trade-in of the 25 H.P. engine.\n\nThe Department has recently paid an account to the amount of $97.03 for new parts to repair the 15 H.P. engine, and we are surprised that the repairs to this engine have not been completed.\n\nIt is noted that you have instructed the engineer to remove the 15 H.P. engine and prepare a base for the 25 H.P. engine and move it in, and that, when this larger engine is installed, it will meet the requirements for a number of years to come, also that it will not be necessary to provide the proposed addition to the engine room and that when the larger engine is installed the 15 H.P. engine can be repaired and installed in the new engine room. The Board of Directors will have to leave in your hands the matter of carrying out the necessary work in the remains to the 15 H.P. engine and the utilizing of the 25 H.P., - which, it is noted, you have not traded in - in proving proper water supply and fire protection services at this school.\n\nIt is considered that the school authorities should arrange for the services of a competent engineer to carry out minor repairs and properly look after the equipment. You should take up the matter with Mr. Agent Hill at the earliest possible date, with a view to completing arrangements for the providing of an adequate unit to meet the requirements at this school.\n\nIt is hoped that the work can all be completed before the end of March, next, and that the accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred, can reach the Department before that date.\n\nThe Department understands that it will not now be necessary to provide the proposed addition to the engine room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nInspector's report on Onion Lake R/C Residential School\n\nSir:\n\nI visited this school on January 18th and made a general inspection of the building, visited the classrooms, and made a general enquiry into conditions.\n\nThe Reverend Father Pratt is in charge as Principal. He is assisted by an adequate staff, including a Farming Instructor, Engineer, Night Watchman, and a staff of Sisters of Charity, three of whom are teachers. There are three classrooms. There are 110 pupils enrolled at the time of my visit, 55 boys and 60 girls. A grant is provided for 110, but I was informed that this is being increased to allow for 120 after the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nThe pupils presented a healthy appearance. I found the building very clean and tidy throughout. It is a large frame structure, heated by steam furnished by two large heating boilers. The school is electrically lighted. Water is piped through the building and pipes with hose connections on each floor are provided for fire protection as well as a supply of fire extinguishers placed at easily accessible points throughout the building. A lay-brother acts as night-watchman and makes hourly visits throughout the building during the night.\n\nA separate fire-fighting unit was installed in an out-building. This unit consists of a 25 H.P. engine with a large rotary pump. This unit has never been operated. The building is not sufficiently warm to keep the water in the cooling system from freezing in extremely cold weather; and until proper housing is provided for this unit it will be useless to them.\n\nWhile I was at this Agency the engine which operates the pumping and lighting plants gave out and temporary arrangements had to be made to carry on until such time as this engine could be repaired. It will be necessary to send the engine to Winnipeg in order to put it in shape, and in the meantime I instructed them to install the engine which has been used in the detached building. This work is now being carried out and the matter has been reported to the Department in a separate letter.\n\nA farm is operated at this school and produced last year 600 bushels of wheat and 1000 bushels of oats. They grew about 25 tons of green feed. The garden and root crops were not up to the usual mark this season. They obtained only about 120 bushels of potatoes.\n\nTheir livestock includes 56 cattle, 10 work horses - 90 pigs and -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n90 pigs and 65 poultry. They are milking 25 cows and have ample milk to allow the children all they care to drink. They purchased 65 tons of hay from the Indians to supplement the supply of green feed for the stock on the farm.\n\nI may say that the exterior of the school building requires repainting very badly. The paint has sealed off the outside walls. Either a poor quality of paint was used in the first instance or it was put on too late in the season after the frost had set in. In any event the exterior of the school presents anything but a good appearance for this reason. The out-buildings are in a good state of repair and the premises are kept in a tidy condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Langlois, O.M.I., Oblate Fathers' Provincial House, Edmonton, Alta., visited the Department yesterday and submitted the enclosed report, prepared by the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, regarding the condition of the hot water tank, fire equipment, water supply and the building of a pump-house.\n\nThere is available, in our appropriation for the current fiscal year, the sum of $1,200, which was for the purpose of painting the building and for minor repairs. Father Langlois states he would prefer that this money be used in putting the water and fire equipment services in good condition, rather than for painting the building.\n\nI would request, therefore, that you furnish the Department with a report, stating in detail the work you would recommend, along the lines suggested by the Principal in his report. You should state, also, if you could arrange for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, of any supplies and equipment required and for any outside labour that would be needed in carrying out the work. The Department would like as full particulars as possible, at your earliest convenience, regarding the improvements and equipment requested by the Principal in his report. I would request that you return the enclosed report with your reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary\n\nDf. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nW. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., 29th April, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI am in receipt of copy of a letter dated March 25th addressed to yourself by the Reverend Father J. E. Pratt, Principal of the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School, in which he reports in connection with their power unit, water supply, and hot water tank.\n\nI may advise you that when I visited the school in January the weather was extremely cold. The Reverend Father did not at that time bring to my attention or make any complaint regarding the water supply itself or the condition at the spring. The serious problem at that time was obtaining power to operate their pumping unit and electric lighting plant. This was arranged for by moving the 25 H.P. engine which was provided to operate a pump in an outside building for fire protection and which could not be used. The 25 H.P. engine was placed in the school and is giving excellent satisfaction. The 15 H.P. engine requires very extensive repairs. The work of repairing this engine was held in abeyance until the other unit was installed.\n\nThey are however in exactly the same position with regard to exterior fire protection as they have been since the school was erected. The interior provision for fire protection consists of stand pipes installed in the building connected with pressure tanks and hose connections on each floor. It is a question in my mind if the rotary pump installed in the outside unit can ever be successfully operated. It appears to me to be too large and when an attempt has been made to operate it at full strength I am told that two men could not hold the hose. I have before me a report of the engineer, Mr. J. Littlewood, who goes very fully into the whole matter and his suggestion is that, if possible, the present\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\npossible, the present rotary gear pump and old 15 H.P. engine be disposed of and a smaller unit installed. I feel very much inclined to agree with him. However as the summer is now approaching and it will be some months before there will be any real need for this unit, I would like to again visit the school and make a thorough enquiry into the whole business before submitting any further report or recommendation in connection with the matter. When I visited the school in January arrangements were made to meet the present emergency and that was done quite satisfactorily, but it was impossible during the winter months to take up any outside work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\nMissionnaires Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e\nAdministration Provinciale\n9016-110e Rue\nEdmonton - Alberta\n\nM.J.D. Sutherland,\nActing Spdt.of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCher M. Sutherland,\n\nJe viens de rencontrer le R.P. Pratt, principal de l'\u00e9cole de Onion Lake, et naturellement nous avons parl\u00e9 du sujet dont je vous avais entretenu lors de mon r\u00e9cent passage \u00e0 Ottawa, c'est-\u00e0-dire de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 urgente de prot\u00e9ger l'\u00e9cole et ses habitants contre le feu.\n\nIl m'a dit qu'il avait re\u00e7u la visite de l'Agent M. le Dr. Hill, et que tous deux avaient \u00e9tudi\u00e9 ensemble de nouveau le projet sur lequel je vous ai laiss\u00e9 des notes et des estimations. L'ex\u00e9cution de ce projet entra\u00eenerait des d\u00e9penses un peu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es que les $1,200 d\u00e9j\u00e0 vot\u00e9es pour la peinture de l'\u00e9cole. Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re cependant, aupr\u00e8s de vous et aupr\u00e8s du Surintendant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mes instances les plus pressantes pour que vous ne vous laissiez pas arr\u00eater par ce surcro\u00eet de d\u00e9penses. Il me semble qu'il y a trop de dangers et trop peu de protection contre le feu pour qu'il soit permis d'h\u00e9siter. Je ne veux pas porter la responsabilit\u00e9 d'un tel \u00e9tat de choses lorsque la vie de tant d'enfants et d'un si nombreux personnel est en jeu; c'est pourquoi j'insiste avec tant de force pour que des mesures soient prises imm\u00e9diatement.\n\nJ'entends dire que le D\u00e9partement doit lancer sous peu un projet de construction d'une couple de centaines de dollars; je ne sais ce qu'il y a de vrai en tout cela. Mais si les choses \u00e9taient ainsi, je ne pourrais m'emp\u00eacher de trouver tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange que l'on puisse se procurer des sommes consid\u00e9rables pour un projet qui ne presse pas, tandis qu'on refuse de pourvoir aux n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s les plus urgentes des institutions d\u00e9j\u00e0 en plein fonctionnement.\n\nVeuillez croire, cher M. Sutherland, \u00e0 toute ma consid\u00e9ration,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEdmonton, Alta., June 4, 1935\n\nJ. D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Dept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have just met the Rev. Father Pratt, Principal of the Onion Lake School, and, naturally, we spoke of that matter which I mentioned to you during my recent visit at Ottawa, that is to say, the urgent necessity of protecting the school and its inmates against fire.\n\nHe told me that he had received the visit of the Agent, Dr. Hall, and they studied together the new project about which I left you some estimates and dates. The execution of that project would cost a little more than the $1,200 already voted for the painting of the school. I reiterate, however, with you and with the Superintendent General, my most pressing instances so that you are not stopped by this little extra expense. It seems to me that there is too much danger and so little protection against fire to take any chance in hesitating. I do not wish to bear the responsibility of such a state of affairs, when the life of so many children and such a large staff is at stake; that is why I insist with so much energy so that the proper steps should be taken immediately.\n\nI heard that the Department was to launch a building programme of a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the near future; I do not know what is true in this rumor. But if matters were at that stage, I could not help finding it strange to see the possibility of obtaining such considerable sums for a project which is not at all pressing, while you refuse the most urgent necessities to institutions which are already fully functioning.\n\nKindly believe, dear Mr. Sutherland, to all my consideration,\n\n(Signed) U. Langlois, P. M. I.\nOttawa, June 13, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the necessity of putting the water and fire equipment in good condition at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is awaiting the report of Mr. Agent Hill. He was requested to consult the Principal and inform the Department what he and the Principal advised be done. We are expecting Mr. Hill's report at an early date, when the matter will be given favourable consideration and authority granted to carry out the work. I think you may feel assured that this work will be performed during the present summer.\n\nThe Department was not successful in obtaining any funds under the Public Works Construction Act for the erection of new buildings and carrying out repairs to existing buildings. Parliament has recently approved of a further expenditure of thirty million dollars; but, as I have said, our Department was not allowed any of it.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nJune 24, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 30th, with reference to the R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nThe exterior of the building needs paint, but I agree that fire protection should be given precedence. This was provided in a way when the school was built. A 25 H.P. engine, with a six inch pump, was installed in a detached building for the purpose, but it never worked satisfactorily, as it required thirty minutes to get into action, and while in action it was almost impossible to handle the 3\" hose. This particular engine was removed last spring to replace the 15 H.P. engine in the main building, where it is giving complete satisfaction; and the engine that was in the main building is not worth the freight to the factory, according to a representative of the firm of Fairbanks-Morse, who inspected it this week. He recommends a 75 H.P., Z type engine, with a 5000 G.P.M. pump, and two 1\u00bd inch hose. The cost of this engine and pump, F.O.B., Lloydminster, together with accessories for installing, would be approximately $750.00. Two strings of 4\u00bd inch hose, one hundred and fifty feet each, would cost 70\u00a2 per foot.\n\nThe building in which the engine and pump were installed was built in a low spot, on a very low foundation. The foundation will have to be raised to prevent the surface water from running into the 20,000 gallon reservoir which is beneath the building. I would recommend that the above engine and pump be installed together with the 1\u00bd\" hose, and that the foundation of the present building be raised at least one foot. The $1200.00 referred to should be sufficient, providing we get considerable assistance from the staff at the school.\n\nAnother item of importance is the hot water boiler at this school. It is corroded through at several points on the lower side and should be replaced. The boiler is 46\" x 48\" and costs at Crane Limited, Edmonton, $250.00. Freight and installation of this would be at least $100.00. I regret the delay in forwarding this reply, as it was most difficult to get the information that I am conveying. The Rev. Principal of the School wanted a frost-proof building, 30x60, with a garage at one end for four cars. The building alone would have cost $1200.00. I tried to get a price on the six inch pump, but Fairbanks-Morse would not make an offer but promised to notify us when they had a sale for it. I also expected that the old engine would have been worth something on a trade-in. The pool formed by the spring should be cleaned out and enlarged; and it is quite evident that all of the $1200.00 will be...\nwill be utilized for the water and fire protection, and no portion of it will be available for the replacing of the hot water boiler.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 16, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the water and fire equipment services at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, and giving an estimate of the cost of supplying a new engine and protection purposes, a quantity of fire hose, and a new hot water boiler, and also the cost of raising the foundation of the building in which the engine and pump are installed.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a 7\u00bd h. p., \"Z\" type engine, with a 5,000 G.P.H. pump. It is noted that the cost of the engine and pump, f.o.b. Lloydminster, together with accessories for installation, will be approximately $750. It would be advisable for you to consult Mr. Inspector Murison, Regina, as to the purchase from firms on the approved list. No doubt, Mr. Murison would arrange to make the purchase in Regina. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to the amount of $750 in the purchase of the engine and pump. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state, on your vouchers, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3483.\n\nRegarding the purchase of the two strings of 1\u00bd\" hose, 150 ft. each, you may arrange for the purchase of this equipment. In this case, also, Mr. Murison would, no doubt, be able to advise you of the names of the firms on the approved list, from whom purchase should be made. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $210, in the purchase of the fire hose. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, certify and forward same for payment. You should state, on each copy, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3484.\n\nWith reference to the condition of the present hot water boiler, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a new boiler, of a type that would be suitable. It is noted, you estimate the cost to be $258.00, and freight and installation, $40.00. Included in encumbrance certificate No. 3484 is an item to the amount of $300.00, to provide for the expenditure. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the hot water boiler.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3484.\n\nRegarding the raising of the foundation of the building in which the engine and pump were installed, you may arrange to have this work carried out. The school authorities should provide the greater amount of the labour. You should purchase any materials required, from firms on the approved list, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed in the raising of the foundation. I enclose encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $240 for the purpose. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, and also forward accounts in triplicate, for the outside labour employed. You should state definitely the number of days or hours each employee was engaged and the rate paid. You should attach these accounts, for material and labour, to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3490.\n\nThe above authorized expenditures, to the amount of $1,500.00, make up the full amount that is available for this school, and, should the expenses run over that amount, the school authorities will have to pay same from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nI would request that you give all the work at this school your personal attention, as far as possible, and see that it is satisfactorily completed, at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nI must thank you very sincerely for the good will shown to this school by allowing us to spend the money $1000.00 voted for the painting of this school towards the equipment of fire protection.\n\nThis gesture from your part is well appreciated here and by the Staff and by the authority of our Church.\n\nI have been talking with our Local Indian Agent Dr. Hill about it and also had the Fairbanks Morse people at the school to look at the things. Those people are not ready to give anything for the big Fire Protection Pump and hose and any fire protection whatever against fire except the inside fire house. This big gump is too big for this school and its capacity is strong enough to supply II or two hydrants and will be the thing for a large city or a school were there is an unlimited amount of water.\n\nYou saw by yourself Dear Mr. McGill during your visit last Summer how things are here at the school and we are at the very same point.\n\nLast Winter our 15 H.P. Engin broke down entirely and we with your permission have bought in the 25H.P. Engin which gives entire satisfaction.\n\nI would like to start the work on the proposed building over the water supply or reservoirs immediately and also to install the other engine. Dr. Hill is getting full information from the Fairbanks Morse Co. and also the definite statement about what is urgently required here.\n\nThe Spring, our main water supply needs badly to be cleaned and I have been asking it to Dr. Hill our Agent for quite a while and I suppose he intends to include it in his visitation. The water needs to be analysed as the children were sick last Winter and we are inclined to believe that the water must be for something in it.\n\nOur boiler tank I mean our Hot Boiler tank is badly leaking and has been plugged with a wooden plug and also needs to be repleased as it is entirely gone out with rust. I fear very much to start the winter with the hot boiler in such a state. What will we do during the cold spell she breaks entirely. We could in no way keep the house and everything will freeze solid. It is quite a job to remove this boiler and install a new one as the house has been built to meet such an emergency.\n\nDear Mr. McGill it is my greatest desire to have the work called for done immediately as we are very busy by now and we will be more busy yet when teaching comes. It is getting late already and Rev. Father Langlois our Head Superior has sent me a brother carpenter to do the work on those buildings in order to save money and time and I am still waiting for the definite answer from the Dept. through the local Indian Agency. Please allow us to start at least the building over the reservoirs and to clean the Spring down below the Hill before the children come back.\n\nAgain I repeat I am very grateful to you and to the Dept. for what they have already allowed us and we sure deeply appreciate it.\n\nWishing Dear Mr. McGill that you will understand my position and the reasons for rushing the work.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly\n\nRev. Fr. J.E. Battison\nPrincipal\nSt Anthony's school, Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nJuly 12th, 1935.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nWill you please be kind enough to renew the permission towards a grant for our nightwatchman for at least six months. This year as the Spring has been very late I was forced to keep out Nightwatchman on the beat for an extra month because we were without exterior fire protection and had to keep the boilers going to late in May.\n\nRev. Fr. J.E. Pratt, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 23, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. McGill, Deputy Superintendent General, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the work required to improve the water and fire equipment services at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that, on the 16th instant, Dr. J.T. Hill, local Indian Agent, was authorized to arrange for the purchase of a 7\u00bd h.p. \"Z\" type engine, with a 5,000 G.P.H. pump. He was requested, also, to arrange for the purchase of two lengths - 150 ft. each - of fire hose. He was requested, further, to purchase a new hot water boiler and to arrange for the raising of the foundation of the building in which the engine and pump are installed. It was estimated that the above authorized supplies and work would cost, approximately, $1,500. No doubt, Dr. Hill will consult you in connection with the matter.\n\nRegarding that portion of your letter of the 12th instant in which you request that a grant be provided towards the salary of a night watchman for at least six months, I would say that a grant, to the amount of $40 per month, is allowed towards the salary of a night watchman at your school, from October 15th to April 15th - a period of six months in each year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

This leak has been repaired in a temporary manner, and the hot water supply has been maintained up to the present.\n\nThe cause of the leak is due to corrosion of the metal by the alkali in the water. On examination, the tank shows evidence of having several weak places along the lower portion where the water lies, and it is certain that it will not last much longer, also that it would be more costly to keep in repair than it would to install a new tank. We have experience of some other tanks that have started to corrode in this manner and the most economical thing to do is to replace them with new ones at once, as trying to repair them has proved to be most unsatisfactory.\n\nReport on Fire Equipment Water Supply\n\nThe water for the use of the school, for drinking, domestic supply and fire appliances is taken from a spring, approximately 100 yards from the school.\n\nBeside the pool formed by the spring is a pump house and a reservoir which is 8-0 by 800 feet deep. This reservoir is filled from the pool by a \u00bd\" pipe and takes about 5 hrs. to fill. The pump has a 2\u00bd\" discharge and its capacity is 2000 gallons per hour; it is driven by a 6 H.P. Fairbanks Morse Engine. The water is pumped from here to another reservoir at the Fire Pump House near the School Buildings. The reservoir here is 20 by 12-0 by 10-0 deep. The capacity of the reservoir is about 4000 gallons and the capacity of the reservoir at the school is about 18000 gallons.\n\nThe pump at the spring can empty the reservoir there in about 2 hours and it takes 15 hours to fill up again and in its present condition cannot keep up a sufficient supply for fire purposes.\n\nWe would suggest that the pool formed by the spring should be cleaned out and enlarged and that the reservoir for the pump should be supplied by a 4\" pipe so as to keep a sufficient supply of water to keep the pump running independently; this could be done with...\nFire Pump House:\n\nThis was equipped with a 25 H.P. Fairbanks Morse Engine and a 6\" Rotary Gear Pump which was capable of emptying the reservoir in about half an hour, after which the water supply was finished. This plant was contained in a pump house built partly over the reservoir and with no concrete foundation, consequently all the surface water from round about is drained into the reservoir and as this water is used for drinking and is the only supply the result is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe 25 H.P. Engine has been removed and taken to replace the 15 H.P. Engine to drive the Generator for the lighting supply and also the Laundry machinery, the 15 H.P. Engine that was used for this purpose being in such a condition that it would cost more to recondition it than it is worth.\n\nThe Rotary Gear Fire Pump has a 6\" suction Pipe and one 3\" Fire Hose is taken of the discharge side the remainder of the discharge is returned to the reservoir through a 6\" eye pass pipe so that at per cent of the energy taken to drive this pump is wasted in the 6\" eye pass pipe.\n\nWe suggest that this pump be disposed of and in its place there should be installed a pump of similar pattern as is used in the pump house at the spring; so a 2000 gallon per pump with a 2\u00bd\" fire house discharge driven by a 6\"H.P. Engine of Fairbanks Morse Z Type. The advantage of this is that the Engine can be started up at a moment's notice in cold weather; the cooling water hopper would be empty and no fear of the Engine or pump freezing both being drained. All that would be necessary to start up would be to run over with a pail of hot water, pour it in the Engine Hopper and start up which could be done in one minute; previously it took at least 35 minutes to start up the 25 H.P. Engine for the Fire Pump. We would also suggest that the new engine & pump should be direct coupled and not Belt driven.\n\nThere should be a new building to contain the Fire Equipment which should be kept heated in winter and used also as a Motor Garage, this building should be over the Fire Reservoir and built on a concrete foundation. The concrete walls of the reservoir should be brought up to above ground level to prevent surface water entering the drinking water. We have an estimate for the purpose new building and we think the other improvements...\nwould not cost more than about $900.00 dollars this without the proposed new building.\n\nIf the Rotary Gear Pump and the old 15 H.P. Engine could be disposed of advantageously the receipts from the sale of these two items would go a long way towards the expense of the new Equipment and improvements.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It seems to me that the building needs a few coats of paint. But such a work is expensive and only of short duration. Would it not be preferable to complete the work once for all, in brick? The building would look much nicer and would in a long run prove to be a saving for the Government. I need to lay stress upon the necessity of completing the work in brick.

However, Reverend Father Langlois requested that these funds be used, instead, in placing the water and fire protection system in good condition, and the funds provided for the painting of the building have been utilized for this purpose. This work, I understand, is practically completed.\n\nI am unable to state, at the present time, what funds will be available next year for further improvements to this building. Your request, however, will be kept in mind when our Estimates for next year are in course of preparation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nRight Rev. J. H.

The children presented a healthy and well nourished appearance. They responded brightly to questions asked them and made a very favorable impression. There are 117 pupils enrolled, 54 boys and 63 girls.\n\nA general inspection of the building was made. It presented a well kept and tidy appearance. The exterior walls of the building are badly sealed. The paint has come off to a large extent and something will have to be done. The paint job on this building has been very unsatisfactory. The paint started to scale off shortly after the work was done and before the walls can be repainted they will have to be scraped, which will entail a lot of extra work and expense. I am of the opinion that it might be more economical in the end to place a cement stucco on the outside walls rather than to repaint them. A cement stucco would add to the warmth of the -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwarmth of the building and effect a saving in fuel. Before undertaking to repaint this building, I would suggest that the question of the cost of stucco as compared with the cost of paint be ascertained, and, if the difference in cost is not too great, I feel that it might be good business to use stucco.\n\nA new hot water boiler was on hand, but had not yet been installed.\n\nThe equipment to provide an independent unit for fire protection has been ordered for some time, but had not been delivered at the time of my visit.\n\nThe 25 H.P. engine which was transferred from the pump house to the school building is giving very satisfactory service.\n\nThe source of water supply at the spring was examined.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLately I have been enquiring into the cost of purchasing an Acetylene Welding outfit for use at the School.\n\nAs you know, we are thirty five miles from Lloydminster and, owing to the considerable amount of machinery that we are operating, there are many occasions when such an outfit would be most useful and save me considerable expense as every time a break of any kind occurs, the machine in question has to be dismantled and the broken part taken to Lloydminster for repairs.\n\nI find that I can purchase such a plant locally for approximately $27.00, and would ask your consideration of this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\nper [signature]\nPrincipal\nLloydminster, Sask.\nOctober 26th, 1935.\n\nT. McGill,\nDeputy-Sup't. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that, owing to the break-down of the pump engine at the School, we are under serious difficulties owing to the hold-up of our water supply.\n\nThe base frame of the pump engine was broken last winter and I had it welded after going to considerable trouble and expense to dismount it and take it to Lloydminster. The weld, however, did not hold for any length of time and the situation became so bad that I had to take it to Lloydminster for the second time. This time the weld did not hold for more than two minutes, and the engine is now in such condition that I dare not run it and am, therefore, held up.\n\nI have obtained a price from the Fairbanks-Morse Company on a new frame for this engine and it would cost $135.57 laid down in Lloydminster. In addition there would be an expense of approximately $5.00 for repairing other small breakages caused by this break-down.\n\nI have taken this matter up with Dr. Hill, the Indian Agent at Onion Lake, and he agrees with me that there is only one thing to do and that is to buy a new base for this engine, and has intimated that he will write to you also on this matter.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is, therefore, to request that you give me authority to spend up to $140.00 for these repairs. I wish to point out to you that this is a real emergency with the winter coming on, and would be very grateful to you if you would look into this matter and give me the necessary authority with the least possible delay.\n\nWith very pleasant remembrances of your last visit to the School, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSt. Anthony's School\nper [Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, reporting the breakdown of the engine for pumping purposes at the school. He states that the base frame of the engine has been repaired on two occasions but is now in such condition that he is not able to use it. He states, further, that he has obtained a price from the Fairbanks-Morse Company for the supplying of a new frame for this engine, at a cost of $135.87, f. o. b. Lloydminster; and that, in addition, there would be an expense of approximately $5.00 for repairing other small breakages to the engine. The Principal states, also, that he has taken up this matter with you.\n\nThe Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $140.00, in the purchase from the above named company of a new frame for the engine and in carrying out any small repairs required to the engine. I would request that you arrange for the purchase of the new base and have same delivered and installed, at the earliest possible date, together with any necessary supplies covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The Department is informing the Rev. Principal of the authority granted you to arrange for the purchase of the new base frame for the pumping engine.\n\nThe Principal has requested, also, that an acetylene welding outfit be supplied, at a cost of approximately $87.00. The Department has undertaken considerable expense at this school during the present fiscal year, and I regret that we will have no funds to supply the welding outfit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, November 4, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letters of the 26th ultimo, requesting that a new base frame be supplied for the pumping engine and also that an Acetylene welding outfit be supplied for use at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Hill, Onion Lake, in connection with these matters. For your information, I enclose copy of letter to Agent Hill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C.

The approximate cost would be $170.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLloydminster, Sask.\nNovember 9th, 1935\n\nMr. W.H. McGill,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for a letter of recent date from your Department, signed by Mr. McKenzie, authorizing the purchase of a new base frame for our water pump engine, and beg to advise that I am taking steps to purchase this immediately.\n\nI am very pleased that you saw your way clear to grant this request as it was impossible to go on as we had been going, and this ought to save us considerable trouble from now on. I do regret, however, that you were unable to see your way at present to grant my other request, namely the purchase of an acetylene welding outfit, as such an outfit is a real need located, as we are, so far from a plant of this kind with so much machinery in continual use.\n\nAs an illustration of the need of this outfit, I am in Lloydminster today with a small broken part which only took about seven or eight minutes to fix and, owing to the condition of the roads, it necessitated a two day trip; and, at that, I am very fortunate that I did not have to go to St. Paul, over 100 miles from the School, as the river has only just become safe for crossing.\n\nI wish to again thank you for permission to buy the engine base, and would request that you give the above matter further consideration and, if you still find it impossible to do anything at the present time, I would ask that you bear it in mind and see if you can get it through for me at the very first opportunity.\n\nThanking you for past courtesies, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\nOttawa, November 14, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that it has been decided to supply an Acetylene welding outfit for the Onion Lake R.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 14th inst., in which you advise me that the Indian Agent at Onion Lake, Dr. Hill, has been instructed to purchase an Acetylene Welding Outfit for our school. This will be a big help to us, and I wish to assure you that I appreciate this authority very much.\n\nI wish to take up with you two matters in reference to our school work, on which I would like your consideration:\n\nFirst: due to the fact that we are now handling 120 children instead of 110 for which we are equipped, we are short of desks for the lower grade and also room in which to handle the children of this grade. This matter was taken up with Mr. Morrison when he visited the School, and he approved of another room in which these children could be taught and took with him a list of the desks needed but, to date, we have not heard anything from your Department in reference to this matter.\n\nSecondly, I would like to get your permission to receive into the School seven children from the LeGoff and Cold Lake Reserves. Two of these children belong to the Desjardins family, of which we have already been given permission to receive two children. The other five belong to the Desjarlais family. While these children are all half-breeds, their mothers are pure Indian and they are all living on the Reserve, the Desjarlais children and their mother living with their Grandparents who are Treaty Indians, and, as there are no public schools anywhere near these reserves, this is the only opportunity the children have of receiving an education. I would, therefore, appreciate it very much if you would forward the necessary authority for us to receive these children.\n\nI hope that you will take both these matters into consideration and let me know your decision as soon as possible. Thanking you in advance, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 7, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I regret that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to supply at the present time the desks which you request. We have already expended a considerable amount at the Onion Lake R. C. School during the past summer, and the appropriation available for the balance of the fiscal year has been assigned.\n\nWith reference to the half-breed children mentioned in the latter part of your letter, the Department is communicating with the Indian Agent, Dr. Hill. When his reply is received, your request for the admission of the children mentioned will receive further consideration, but I may say that the Department considers there should be sufficient Treaty Indian children available to fill your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Hill, Indian Agent at Onion Lake, with which he enclosed the attached estimates received from the Reverend Principal of the Roman Catholic School at that point with reference to repairs etc., required in connection with his school. The Indian Agent does not make any recommendation or comment regarding these Estimates.\n\nIt will be noted that the Contractors, Fraser Bros., submit an estimate for finishing the exterior of the entire building with stucco at a cost of $5,225.50, also one for repainting the interior of the school at a cost of $2,231.00, and another for placing maple flooring on the basement of the school and to stain and varnish same at a cost of $1,366.50, bringing the total request to an amount of $9,422.00.\n\nI reported on the condition of the exterior of this building particularly on the 25th October. The estimated cost of having the exterior of the building stuccoed is much higher than I had anticipated and in view of this being a frame building and not fire proof, I question if the expense would be justified. There is no doubt but that the stucco would add to the warmth of the building. The Principal has not submitted an estimate on the cost of painting, but the Department will have a good idea of what that would amount to as no doubt the repainting of a similar type of building has been undertaken at some other point.\n\nThe suggestion that maple flooring be placed in the basement was not made to me when I visited the school in October. I am of the opinion that if the floors in the cement basement were given a coat of good quality of cement paint, it\n\n- would take -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwould take care of the difficulty complained of, that is that the sand and dust is being carried on the children's shoes to the upper floors.\n\nWhen making an inspection of this school in October the condition of the exterior walls of the building impressed me as being unsightly owing to the paint having scaled off. This is a condition which has existed practically since a short time after the school was completed. The condition of the interior walls did not apparently impress me as being in a bad condition, as I did not consider it necessary to comment on them. I did note that the odd piece of plaster was cracked, but that is a condition which one will find in many of our buildings and it can be taken care of with very little outlay.\n\nIf a limited amount of funds will be available for repairs at this school, my opinion is that they should be expended in repainting the exterior walls of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, January 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 7th instant, regarding the estimates that were obtained by the Principal of the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, for finishing the exterior of the entire building with stucco and also for painting the interior of the school and installing maple flooring in the basement.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the Department is not prepared to consider finishing the exterior of the school building with stucco or installing maple flooring in the basement.\n\nRegarding painting, I have to say it is expected that there will be funds available during the coming fiscal year to provide for a certain amount of painting of the exterior and interior of the building. The Department has incurred considerable expense at this school during the past summer, and there are no other funds available to carry out any further work at this point during the present fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Mc Gill Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe regret to inform you that we have received a complaint from the Principal of the R.C. Indian School at Onion Lake in regard to the trouble they had with their batteries again.\n\nHe has sent us two of the jars, and upon examining same, we find that the positive plates are worn out. This does not surprise us, as we are aware of the fact that the present lighting plant installation at that school is exacting too much from any set of batteries.\n\nAs already explained to Dr. Hill and Father Pratt, the charging system is not the proper one to give fair treatment to a set of storage batteries.\n\nFirst, the fact of charging those batteries in two banks is very obsolete, especially with the lead that they have to carry in this case. The result of the above conditions is that when the generator is running, they are liable to be overcharged, and when the engine is not running, the lead is too heavy.\n\nAs you are aware, a set of storage batteries are only able to give so many cycles, and when these cycles have taken place, they have done their duty and no one can expect more from them. In the present case, the cycle capacity is between four hundred and four hundred and fifty.\n\nWe might recall that when we installed the first set in 1932, we mentioned at the time that, had we known the type of installation existing at that school, we would never have agreed to give the usual guarantee. However, the batteries were there and such an attitude on our part might have been taken as if we wanted to dodge our responsibility as a reliable firm. This we refused to do, and it turned out to be expensive for us.\n\nIt is not our intention to dictate to the Department what to do or not to do. We simply want to make our position clear and emphasize the fact that it is impossible and useless as well to carry on replacing these batteries, even under our adjustment basis guarantee, with the present system existing.\n\nTrying to do this, we consider would be unfair, both to us and the Department.\nMay we be permitted also to call your attention to the fact that the water pump alone is quite a load on the batteries, and no one can expect the 25 horse power engine to run for that purpose alone.\n\nThe Principal of the School does not want to take upon himself any more responsibility in this, without the authorization from the Department. On the other hand, there is a danger of being without light or water at any time.\n\nWhen we consider that there is over a hundred lives at stake if that should happen, miles away from any outside help, we are arranging immediately to relieve their situation.\n\nAgain, we wish to repeat what we have already said, namely that we are not trying to dictate, but as citizens and in fairness to all concerned, we consider some changes should be done with the present electrical installation.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nBlais Brothers Battery Co.Ltd.\nPer\n\nL.

Indian Residential School. They state they received a complaint from you, that trouble has developed with these batteries. The Department understands that there is no overload in the use of the batteries, which are to be used in connection with the lighting system only, and no other attachments of any kind are to be operated from this power. We understand that the water pump and other equipment is operated by the batteries of the lighting plant. When this equipment was installed, it was intended to be used only in connection with the lighting plant, and you must arrange to discontinue utilizing the batteries for any other service than for the lighting plant of the school. Otherwise, the Department cannot be held responsible for the cost of supplying new batteries.\n\nWe are forwarding Dr. Hill, Indian Agent, a copy of this letter and requesting him to see you and forward a report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI regret very much to have to inform you that the Lighting Plant in our school is giving me considerable trouble, and it has now got to the stage where batteries are almost useless. In fact, the present state of the batteries is such that we have to run the 25 H.P. Engine all the time that we need light, even during the short periods in which we have to turn off our water pump. This means, of course, that, as storage batteries, they are absolutely useless.\n\nThere are two very serious consequences to this state of affairs. One is that the cost is almost prohibitive as we used 793 gallons of fuel and a complete barrel of lubricating oil during the month of December, and it is quite possible that the quantity will be even larger for January. In addition to this there is the expense of coal oil lamps which we are compelled to use during the main part of the night when the plant is not running.\n\nThere is also what might be considered a much more serious side to this state of affairs, and that is the danger of coal collapse in a wooden school housing 120 children, to say nothing of the staff.\n\nAs you know, this plant has been declared inadequate by several engineers who know their business and, from all the information we can obtain, this appears to be the reason for the batteries giving out in less than half of their natural life. These experts tell us that the plant is not only inadequate to carry the load but that the system under which the charging is done also damages the plates.\n\nThese, however, are technical questions which I am not fully qualified to discuss, and I would suggest that sometime when it is convenient to your Dept. you would have a qualified engineer pass on the ability of this plant to do the work required of it.\n\nI would further like to point out that I have taken special care to see that a duly qualified man is in charge of the plant, the man in charge having taken special courses in the operation of both Diesel engines and electric light plants. When this man took over the plant after looking it over he informed me that while he would do his best, he certainly would not like to take full responsibility for the plant giving satisfaction as it was overloaded and the batteries were not suitable.\n\nThis, however, is beside the point at the present time as the matter of vital importance right now is just what to do to give us light for the balance of the winter, and the situation is gradually getting worse. I find that I can obtain from the people from whom the batteries were bought new groups of plates and material necessary to repair these batteries for $150.00 In addition to this I could have to buy sufficient acid to bring them all up to strength, the cost of which I do not know. Also there would be, ordinarily, an extra charge for a man and his expenses to install these materials. The last time this was done it cost me approximately $75.00. This, however, could be saved in the present instance as the man I have in charge is willing and capable of going this far.\n\nHaving explained this matter to you as fully as I can I would request that you give me authority to spend this $150.00 for material and as much more as will be necessary for acid, and freight, so that the plant may be put into shape to continue until next summer or such time as you see your way to have a competent engineer to examine the plant and make you a report. This matter is very pressing and I hope that you will\ngive it your immediate and favorable attention\n\nThanking you in anticipation, and hoping to hear from you by return, I am\n\nYours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing your estimate of the cost of finishing the exterior of the building at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School with stucco. In reply I have to inform you that the Department will have no funds during the coming fiscal year to provide the cost of having this work carried out.\n\nWith reference to painting the interior and installing maple flooring in the basement, the Department is not prepared to authorize this work at the present time, and it is very doubtful if there will be any funds available for the purpose in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEric Fraser, Esq.,\nBonnyville,\nAlberta.\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nRe: Painting the School\n\nIn reference to the above matter, Dr. Hill, our local Indian Agent, reported to me that he had received word from Mr. Murisson of Regina to the effects that the best would not consider either brick veneering or stuccoing the School but would allow for a quantity of paint for both exterior and interior work.\n\nYou will remember that when you visited the School, after looking it over you agreed that it would be very expensive to paint the exterior as the whole thing would have to be gone over and cleaned off owing to the bad condition of the present paint and the woodwork, and that it would be hard, even after going to this expense to obtain a good result.\n\nI am certainly pleased to hear that your Dept. is willing to grant us some paint but would still like to suggest that if at all possible your Department again consider either a brick veneer or a stucco finish for this building.\n\nAlthough it is necessary that something be done without much delay, viewing this matter in the light of future expense I would suggest being willing to forego exterior painting this year provided I could get some money spent on the interior which is badly in need of it, if the amount Dept. would put by the amount which they are willing to spend on the exterior this year with a view to helping to pay for the cost of stucco or brick next year. This however, is a matter for your consideration but it seems to me that, in view of the continual cost of repainting, it would be better for the Dept. to make up their minds to make a permanent job of the exterior finishing if at all possible.\n\nWaiting your valued consideration of this matter\n\nI am, Yours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 20, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the painting of the exterior and interior of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say it is hoped to be able to provide, in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year, certain funds towards the cost of painting. However, this money will not be available until the appropriation is provided by Parliament. I am unable to state, at the present time, what amount of painting or other work can be carried out during the coming summer. I would request that, at the end of April, next, you take the matter up, through the office of your local Indian Agent, giving full particulars regarding the amount of interior painting and other work required and an estimate of the cost. You should state, also, how you would advise having the work carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your 115-8-5, of the 4th instant, with reference to the batteries for use in connection with the lighting plant at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, and in reply.\n\nThe school supply of water is procured from a lake, approximately 500 yards distant. At this point there is an installation, engine and pump, which forces the water up a steep hill into a large reservoir located about thirty feet from the main building. The reservoir supplies the water tank in the school by means of a small electric motor which works automatically. This is the only part that has been made of the batteries, apart from lighting the buildings, and apparently it was the intention when the building was constructed, as it is part of the original installation.\n\nHowever, I conveyed the Department's instructions to the Principal and the engineer, and both agreed to comply, but it will mean the running of the 25 H.P. engine twice daily to get sufficient water in the storage tanks. This in turn is hard on the engine and expensive to the school, e.g., it took 793 gallons of crude oil to operate the plant in December. My knowledge of batteries is very limited but from the information I have been able to gather, together with some comments in Blais Brother's letter, it would appear that the original installation, which is known as the two pole and double switch board system, is not the most suitable. Blais Brothers' opinion is that it is very obsolete, due, I believe, to the faulty distribution in the cells. The fact remains that two sets of batteries have been completely used up since 1932 in this school, and they are practically without electric light. The secondary system, lamps, is being partially used. The Principal now requests plates and materials to repair the batteries, which can be purchased for $10.00 from Blais Brothers, Edmonton. His electrician is quite capable to carry out the repairs. I regret that I do not know sufficient about batteries and lighting systems to make a definite recommendation. The Principal's request if conceded will restore the batteries for a time, but it may probably be more economical to install a more modern system that would give less trouble and some degree of satisfaction. The present batteries consist of 36 cells.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the batteries used in connection with the lighting system at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. It is noted that the school authorities have discontinued using the batteries in connection with the operation of the pumping plant; and it is understood, also, that no other attachments are being operated on the batteries.\n\nRegarding the request of the Principal, that plates and material to repair the present batteries be authorized, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, at a cost not to exceed the sum of $160.00, of the plates and other materials required to place the batteries in a fair state of repair. It is understood that the electrician at our school will be able to carry out the repairs. Our funds for the current fiscal year are practically assigned, and the above expenditure is all we will be able to provide in supplying the materials and making the repairs to the present lighting system. You should make immediate arrangements to obtain the plates and material, and you may make the purchase from Blais Brothers, Edmonton. Please obtain an itemized account in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The account should reach the Department not later than March 31st, next, at which time our books for the current fiscal year will close.\n\nI may add that there are no funds provided in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year to supply new batteries for this school, and, should a real emergency develop, the Department would have difficulty in obtaining funds to supply new sets. The Principal should understand that no attachments, other than the lighting system, are to be operated on the present batteries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-8-5 dated Feb. 26, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to express my appreciation and thanks for the permission contained in your letter of February 4th to spend $160.00 repairing the storage batteries at the school. The \"Brother\" I have at the School and who is a qualified engineer, is repairing the batteries free of charge and seems to think that, with these repairs, the batteries should be in shape to carry us through the School Year.\n\nI understand from Dr. J.T. Hill, the Indian Agent, that he recommended that the system be changed if possible before next winter and be brought up to date as he realizes that if this is not done there will never be 100% satisfaction and will always be more expensive to keep up as brand new batteries have never, at any time, lasted more than 2\u00bd years.\n\nFrom your letter I gather that you have a certain misunderstanding in reference to this system, as you seem to think that the storage batteries are being used for other purposes than for which they were intended when installed. I would like to explain, in reference to this, that the system has never been changed since it was installed, the hook-up for water, etc., being exactly the same as when it was new. In reference to pumping the water, which you seem to think causes this damage, I would like to point out that the water is originally pumped from the spring into a storage tank by a 6 H.P gas engine and is pumped from the storage tank into the basement tanks by an electric motor which starts and stops automatically. This pumping by the electric motor takes place three times a day, morning noon, and night evening. In the morning and in the evening this motor is run when the generator is running and takes the current direct from the generator, and it is only for about half an hour in the middle of the day that it draws from the storage batteries and at that time it only draws approximately 10 amps. for the half hour it runs, so you will see that the charge or suggestion made that the batteries are being used to pump the water for the School thereby causing too large a drain on them, is not correct.\n\nI wish also to assure you that, in addition to there being no change made, every care is being taken by a qualified man to do everything possible to save an excessive draw on the power of the batteries. I felt, in view of certain remarks in your letter, that it would be as well to explain this matter to you.\n\nAgain thanking you for your courtesy and past favor.\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In March, last, the storage batteries were overhauled, at a cost of $150, and, in so far as the Department is aware, they are in fairly good condition. No funds have been provided in our Estimates to supply new batteries for this school. The local Indian Agent is being requested to forward a report.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received an intimation that the Onion Lake R.

The Department has received no request to provide new storage batteries. As you are aware, an account to the amount of $160 was paid for supplies and repairs to the batteries in March, last.\n\nThe Principal or yourself should take no action in purchasing new batteries if it is intended that the Department shall be called upon to pay the cost, without referring the matter to the Department, giving particulars as to size and type of batteries required. I may add that no funds have been provided to supply new batteries. Please advise the Department as soon as possible regarding the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is quite correct in assuming that the tradesmen required will be painters, but it is in error re the $300 required for covering the boilers with asbestos. In my letter of April 20th I stated that the $300 appropriated for general repairs could be used to good advantage in covering the boilers with asbestos, painting new out buildings, etc., etc. The cost of the asbestos required in connection with the two boilers would be approximately $90, and probably $10 would be required to place it in position.

An estimate has been received of the cost of stuccoing the entire building, for the sum of $5,826.00.\n\nThis is a three-storey frame building. Either brick veneering or stuccoing the exterior of the building would not overcome fire hazard, as there is little danger of fire from outside sources. Fires are more likely to occur inside the building. Last year, a large expenditure was incurred in placing the water supply system for fire protection purposes in good condition.\n\nSCHOOLS\ngood condition. No funds have been provided to either brick veneer or stucco the building.\n\nThe Anglican Indian Residential School at Onion Lake is a building of similar type, and, if the Catholic school was brick veneered, the Anglican authorities would, no doubt, request that similar work be carried out at their school.\n\nIt is considered if the exterior of the St. Anthony's Catholic School is painted, this should be satisfactory and greatly improve the appearance of the building. Funds for this purpose could be included in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year. It would cost approximately $1,600.00 to paint the exterior of the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, October 1st, 1936.\n\nDr. H. McGill\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nRe main school building at St. Anthony's Indian Residential School, your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, file 51-115-3.\n\nWill you kindly advise me by memorandum if your Department owns this school building and also the Anglican School at the same place.

SCHOOL:** $2,640,530.78\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:-\n\nI have Mr. Pratt's memorandum of the first instant, requesting information regarding the Onion Lake R.C. (St. Anthony's) and the Onion Lake Church of England Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Department owns both these schools. The St. Anthony's (R.C.) School was erected during the fiscal year 1927-28. The Church of England School was erected during the fiscal year 1925-26.\n\nThese schools are located on reserves, and the Church Authorities did not possess ownership in the buildings that were in use previous to the erection of the new schools.\n\nAttached hereto are statements, showing the total cost of buildings and the furnishings, equipment, and repairs carried out during each fiscal year since these schools were erected.\n\nNo painting has been done to the exterior of the St. Anthony's (R.C.) School since the building was erected. Funds were provided to have the exterior of the school painted in the summer of 1936, but the Principal of the School and the Church Authorities requested that the funds be utilized, instead, in repairing water and fire protection services.\n\nThe exterior of the Church of England School building and the outbuildings were painted during the summer of 1930 and in the summer of 1935.\n\nEncl.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your 115-8-5, of March 26th, which authorized the expenditure of $900.00 in connection with the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, viz., $600.00 for painting parts of the interior and $300.00 for maintenance and repairs.\n\nYour 115-8-5, of July 25th, authorized the expenditure of $700.00 of this, in which was included $100.00 for covering the boilers with asbestos. The amount estimated for covering the boilers was too low. It will take $165.00 for a first class job by a competent workman. In addition, the following has been asked for, and, in my opinion, should be carried out:\n\n1. Cleaning out and regravelling the filter supplying school with water $35.00\n2. Flooring and sheeting interior of blacksmith shop $60.00\n3. Constructing a small building over the well at the stock barn, to protect pump and engine that operates it $40.00\n4. Extra required for covering boilers $65.00\n\nAuthority for the expenditure of $200.00 will be required to complete the work referred to.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, regarding the expenditure which was authorized for painting parts of the interior, for maintenance and repairs and covering the boilers, at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nBesides the work authorized, the Department will approve of having the following carried out:\n\n- Flooring and sheeting interior, blacksmith shop - - $60.00\n- Constructing a small building over the well at the stock barn - - 40.00\n- Extra amount required for covering boilers. - - 65.00\n\nWith reference to cleaning out and re-gravelling the filter, at a cost of $35.00, it is considered that the school authorities, themselves, should be able to do this work, without expense to the Department. However, if they are unable to do so, the Department will approve of an expenditure, to the amount stated, in having the work done. The total additional work, as mentioned above, should not exceed the sum of $200. This will make a total expenditure authorized at this school during the current fiscal year of $900. When all the authorized work has been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nQ. F.

ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\nFile--E..7\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to the condition of the exterior of the R.C. Indian Residential School. Something should be done to it this year if finances will permit.\n\nThe original painting was faulty, owing, I believe, to most of the work being done very late in the season, when it was subjected to frost. The boards are showing through, and in places 50% of the paint is entirely gone, and that remaining resembles fish scales. In its present state it will take considerable labour to prepare the surface for paint, and, under the circumstances, perhaps stucco should be considered. The work involved in preparing the surface would be at least three times as much as that required for the actual painting.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Brett\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the following incident in connection with the R. C. Indian Residential School. On the 12th instant smoke, which could not be accounted for, was discovered in a hall in the basement. After considerable investigating it was finally located in the interior of the wall, a small portion of which was removed and a fire extinguished. A defective wire connecting the fire alarm bell with the electric system had ignited the lath upon which it was resting. The repair should be made at once as it is important the fire alarm system be intact at all times, but in order to do this in its present location I am told that a considerable portion of the wall would have to be torn down. An alternative, which I would recommend, would be to make the connection on the outside of the wall, and, in this event, the enclosed list, which was made at my request, by the resident engineer and electrician at the school, would be required.\n\nENCL.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This should be obtained at the earliest possible date. You should state whether you consider that the work should proceed this year and, also, whether, in the event of the Department deciding to do this painting, the work should be done by contract or by day labour.\n\nAs mentioned above, a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of this painting should be given for our consideration as, if the cost is high, it will not be possible to secure the necessary funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Pratt,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-5, of the 5th instant, with reference to painting the exterior of the R.C.

The work to consist of wire brushing the walls and applying two coats of paint. The original painting was done late in the season and was damaged by frost, and the surface of the building, especially the east side, resembles inverted fish scales. The work in connection with removing these and preparing the surface for paint will require much more time than that for applying the paint. Blower's estimate may appear high, but in view of the condition of the building and the preparation required, I think it fairly reasonable. His services are also available at 45\u00a2 per hour. The work, if funds will permit, should be proceeded with at once as the exterior of the building is in a very bad state of preservation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nJ.T.

Sufficient information has not been supplied to enable a decision to be reached as to whether the prices quoted for materials and labour are high, or as to whether the work should be undertaken and paid for by the Department.

School from May 1st 1936 to June 15th 1937, at $25.00 per month, as Carpenter and painted the inside of said School. In June 15th 1937, I was hired by the school Principal at that time Rev. Mr. Pratt, but he was transferred in May, and went away without a word as to my salary.\n\nThe new Principal Rev. Pascal, says that he did not hire me, but he laid me off just the same. I also spoke to Mr. Hill, the Agent at Osin Lake, and he says the same thing. I have still $1.95 coming on my salary, and I would like to get it.\n\nI am a man of 63 years, and I don't feel able to lose this amount.\n\nIn October they made a requisition to you for 250 Hours at $4.00 per Hour, also eight in November and other for $28.00.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThey claim that was all it was coming to me for ten months of labour.\n\nMr. Hill knows all the work I done there. I have used all the white paint that you sent last summer, also 415 yards of burlap, beside the varnish and floor oil.\n\nI am kindly asking you to look into this matter at once, and in hoping to hear from you also with cheque for $71.95 I beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\nJ.E. Fagerson\n[Signature]\n[Stamp]\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-5, of July 6th, 1937, re J. E. Gagnon's account with the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nI could not get any definite information in connection with the case until today, as the Reverend Father Pratt, who was principal when Gagnon joined the staff, was transferred on May 20th, and his successor, Rev. Father Pascal, knew nothing of the arrangements between Father Pratt and Mr. Gagnon.\n\nToday I succeeded in getting a history of the case from the lay brother, who is the chief executive in the absence of the principal, and has been on the staff for several years. He states that J. E. Gagnon, his wife and son, arrived at the school in September or October, 1935, and asked to be taken on the staff for their keep as they were unemployed. They were admitted on compassionate grounds but were not assigned any special duties as they were to make themselves generally useful. During the seven month interval between May 1st and December, the following year, he was promised and received $20.00 per month wages for six months, from the school, and $100.00 from the Department, for interior painting in the R. C. School. The brother claims that Father Pratt paid him in full before he left and that Father Pascal paid him an additional $50.00 before he returned him on the flat. The last $50.00 was not due him, but he just gave it to him as a peace offering - as all agreements between Father Pratt and Gagnon had been verbal. Gagnon was a first class painter and did a most satisfactory job in the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

Residential School for a new set of batteries.\n\nIn his letter, the principal states that the batteries required are as follows:\n\nG.Da12 .66 cells, 110, Volt.168.A. H. GLOBELITE Battery.\n\nThis information appears rather indefinite and I would appreciate if you would again interview the principal and let me know exactly what is required. At the same time you should state whether any other make of batteries would be suitable. As the purchases are now made by the Purchasing Branch, it is necessary that we have specific information before the Purchasing Agent can obtain prices.\n\nThe principal also states in his letter that he has secured a price on the Globalite batteries F.O.B. Frenchman's Butte. Please let me know why he mentions this place, as we have always understood that the freight address of this school is Lloydminster, Saskatchewan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to the great distance from town or railway centres & necessarily much more expenses are occasioned by freight etc., thus am obliged today to ask the Department for further help with the supply of paint for the farm buildings; four dormitories of the Main Building have been left unpainted for lack of paint last year. More over two sewing machines would also be greatly appreciated as the old ones now refuse service.\n\nI had to buy a new binder last fall to take in the crop; to replace the engines of the pump house.\n\nFor fire protection I had to install the tank for the gas under ground and thus get rid ourselves from the dangerous barrels around the buildings.\n\nOwing to all these expenses I would like to be favoured with a certain amount to help defraying and it seems to me that about $1000 would not be too much to meet with the expenses made.\n\nYour cooperation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you in advance I remain,\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSt. Anthony's School, Lloydminster, June 30, 1938.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 6, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo requesting paint and two sewing machines for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, it was found possible to include an amount of $600 only for repairs, improvements, and purchase of material at the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nToday we received a letter from the Indian Agent, Dr. Hill, in which he states that a new set of batteries is required by your school. We have been obliged to write him for further information. However, these batteries will cost approximately $400. In this event, it would mean that there would be $200 remaining for the purchase of other equipment for the school. However, the Department does not wish to make any further expenditures at Onion Lake R.C. School until the batteries are secured and we are certain of their cost. You might discuss your requirements with Dr. Hill and he will let you know what amount is available after the batteries have been secured. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nRev. E. Pascal, O.M.I.,\nOnion Lake R.C.

Plourde O.W.J.,\nGeneral Supt. of Oblate Indian Schools,\nUniversity,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Rev. Plourde:\n\nThe writer called at the St. Anthony Indian School in October last year, and had quite a nice visit with Father Pascal. A representative of our firm usually calls at this school every year. We do this usually to inspect the lighting unit, particularly the battery, because most of the installations are Globelite batteries and, as part of our service, we endeavour to contact every school and agency.\n\nThe installation in the St. Anthony School is a 180 A.H. battery which will have to be replaced probably in the next six months. In conversation with Father Pascal and the Engineer, they acknowledged that the battery was far too small for the load it has to carry. A larger capacity battery would be far more serviceable, efficient and more economical to operate, and they are therefore interested in our type W15, 315 A.H. battery, or our type W17, 360 A.H. battery. One of the latter is installed in the School at Delmas where it is giving excellent satisfaction.\n\nWhen it comes time to replace the present battery at the St. Anthony School, we would like to know will it be bought locally by Father Pascal or will your department handle the transaction, or will it go through the Department of Indian Affairs who purchased most of the batteries in the Indian Schools. If you will be good enough to give us this information, it will be very much appreciated and we will then know to whom we will submit a quotation and make the necessary recommendations about the size and capacity.\n\nThe writer contacted Mr. Leveille, Mr. Allen and The Canadian Publishers Limited, who are well known to the writer, and we have enjoyed very satisfactory business relations for some years. They of course gave me your address which has prompted this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED.\n\nSales Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 7)\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nEnclosed please find a letter which I have just received from the Globelite Batteries Limited of Winnipeg. I might say in this connection that I received sometime ago a letter from Father Pascal to the effect that the school was in need of new batteries, and that he wished the order to be placed as soon as possible due to the rationing difficulties in force.\n\nIf you can supply these batteries out of the present budget it would certainly be very much appreciated. Whilst it is not my intention to unduly influence your purchasing department, I wish to say that Globelite batteries have given very satisfactory service in all the schools where we have had them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 7)\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReverend Father Plourde has forwarded to this office a letter dated January 27, 1944, from Globelite Batteries Limited, with regard to the condition of the batteries at the Onion Lake R.C. School. I should appreciate it if you would let me know as soon as possible the approximate date on which the Department purchased the set of batteries that is at present in use. I understand from the letter from Globelite Batteries that the present installation will have to be replaced probably within the next six months. At the present time funds at our disposal will not permit replacement of the batteries immediately, but I should like to have the information requested in the first part of this letter at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As stated in my letter of the 8th instant, we understand that the present installation is still in operation and will not have to be replaced for some months. Owing to the approach of the end of the current fiscal year, our funds are practically all assigned and, under the circumstances, I believe that it will not be necessary to place any order until after the first of April, when the new fiscal year begins.\n\nI note that you suggest a very much heavier and more expensive battery than the one at present in use. You might let me know exactly why you consider that this is required rather than a battery of the same size and capacity that you are now using.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It would have concrete walls and a new roof with a capacity of approximately 3,000 bushels of potatoes, including material and labour the price would amount to no more than three hundred dollars.\n\nThe school will furnish the gravel and hauling of cement and lumber along with some rough help for the cement mixing.\n\nWe should greatly appreciate a prompt reply from the Department in order to start this urgent work immediately after sowing.\n\nI trust that you will approve our request.\n\nDevotedly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSt. Anthony School,\nvia Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is in real bad shape this spring and should be completely re-built using concrete walls. I would strongly recommend that this expenditure be allowed.\n\nDonald H.

Dear Sir,\n\nAcknowledging your letter of January 24th., enquiring for an estimate of the cost of repairs to your 25 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse Type Y Style H.B. engine, it is very difficult from this distance to say exactly what the cost might be without a very complete list of the new parts required and some idea of the present condition of your engine.\n\nA new crankshaft alone would cost $484., and there may be a good many other parts required, such as bearings, injection items, fuel pump items, governor parts etc., all of which are fairly expensive. Labour may take a day or two, or as long as a week, depending upon the condition of the engine. Our regular charge for the services of a repair man is $16.00 per day, plus travelling, hotel and living expenses, from the time he leaves our plant until his return. In your territory, it will no doubt be closer to have the service man from our Calgary Branch do the work.\n\nWe trust with the above information you will be enabled to arrive at an estimate of the cost, knowing perhaps much better than we do, the exact condition of your engine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Canadian FAIRBANKS-MORSE Company Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

Power Engine, which before long will not be in order to supply us with Electric Power. May I ask you to submit this request to the Department of Indian Affairs so that we may receive their suggestion as to what may be done for the future. I thank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E. Pascal, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Father Pascal, Principal, of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, requesting authority to have the 25 H.P. engine overhauled. Attached to Father Pascal's letter is one from the Fairbanks-Morse Company, Winnipeg, Manitoba, with reference to the matter.\n\nThe engine referred to is the one supplying electric light and power for the school. It has been in operation steadily for approximately 12 years. It is badly in need of an overhaul. I might add that in my opinion the matter is urgent, although I think they can manage to get along until spring when conditions would be more favourable for having the work attended to.\n\nDonald H.

Cameron, Indian Agent,\nONION LAKE, Saskatchewan:\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th inst., recommending that the 25 H.P. engine at the Onion Lake R.C. school be overhauled.\n\nIf the principal and yourself are satisfied that it is not necessary to do the work immediately you may defer it until Spring. However if immediate repairs are required you may make the necessary arrangements with the Fairbanks Morse Company.\n\nNeedless to say, the Department expects that every possible effort will be made both by the school management and yourself to keep the costs of repairs as low as possible.\n\nBernard F.

It will also be more economic to operate.\n\nAs the winter season will soon set in, I hope that the order for the outfit will be placed without delay so that it may be in operation at least by the first of December of this year.\n\nThanking you for your cooperation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School, the cost of the crank shaft was approx $500.00 and the installation charges would cost approx $20.00 per day, and on this basis the Principal was advised to proceed with the repairs.\n\nTo date the engine has not been overhauled, and the repairs have not been carried out.\n\nAbout a month ago I spoke to the new Principal, who informed me that he was having difficulty in this connection, and that the Cor had advised him that a new crank shaft and installation would be in the neighbourood of $1000.00. He stated that from his experience with this particular engine over a period of years, that the general condition of the machine was very bad, and that even if it were possible to have the authorised repairs done, the engine performance would be far from satisfactory, and a new engine in the long run would be more economical.\n\nI pointed out that authority had been obtained for repairs only, but that if in his opinion a new engine was necessary, he should immediately make application through the Agency Office to this effect, and submit his reasons for the new request, together with comparative costs etc; in order that I could take the matter up with the Dept.\n\nIt is apparent from your a/m letter that the Principal did not interpret my instructions correctly.\n\n(H.S.

Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of January 19th last, in connection with electrical equipment for the above schools, you are advised that three tenders were received by the Departmental Purchasing Agent in response to requests for quotations from Western Firms for equipment as specified by the Indian Affairs Branch. These tenders were referred to this Division for advice as to the suitability of equipment offered.\n\nAccording to information on file, the existing lighting plants are composed of the following equipment:\n\n(a) Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n   10 K.W. generator driven by a 25 horsepower diesel engine charging a 316 ampere hour 110 volt storage battery.\n\n(b) Guy Residential School.\n   7.5 K.W., 125 to 180 volts D.C. generator driven by a 16 horsepower steam engine charging a 220 ampere hour 110 volt storage battery.\n\nWe note from the call for quotations, only one diesel electric unit is required and that two schools are under consideration, and it is assumed that an investigation has been made at both locations and generating equipment at present in use was found to be worn out and requires replacing.\n\nThere are many different types of systems available for operation from storage batteries and in order to select the proper generating equipment it is necessary to have all the facts concerning the electrical system before attempting to choose a generator and controls applicable to the existing conditions. We do not have this information on our file and we are therefore, not in a position to advise if the equipment offered is suitable for use at the schools under consideration.\n\nWe suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch defer the placing of orders based on tenders received until further information can be obtained. If Indian Affairs concur in this action we would ask them to obtain the following information from both schools and upon receipt of same this Division will give it prompt consideration.\n\n1. A detailed description of the generator now in use including all available information regarding watts capacity, voltage, speed and type of winding. Nameplates are usually furnished on the generator giving this information.\n\n2.

The battery is in fair condition considering the length of time it has been in service, however, it needs a good charge and he left instructions accordingly. Evidently the old plant broke down and is being replaced and this is partly responsible for the battery becoming partially discharged.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED.\n\nSales Manager\n\nSEP 29 1948\n\nA.M.\n\nREGISTERED\nColonel Neary:\n\nONION LAKE (RC) INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nOnly a brief visit to this school was possible today.\n\nSome of the points requiring attention are:\n\n1. Water Supply: A tractor has to be used to furnish the electric power to operate the pressure tank. This is awkward and expensive. The Postman has telegraphed requesting Fairbanks-Morse to accelerate action.\n\n2. Lighting: also dependent on the tractor.\n\n3. Enrollment: School not working at full potential. Ninety-seven present. It could handle 150.\n\n4. Health: An epidemic of chicken-pox has overtaxed infirmary space and necessitated make-shift arrangements. Nearest doctor is 35 miles distant, but one of the nuns is a Registered Nurse.\n\n5. Bathrooms: The inspection report should be studied.\n\n6. Kitchen Range: Curry-Oxford. The makers should be queried re the possibility of supplying spare parts.\n\n7. Dishwashing: This is done in the dining room.\n\n8. Laundry: The Principal claims the ventilation is poor. I suggested a fan to force out the air.\n\n9. Fire extinguishers: Require checking and re-filling.\n\n10. Bakery: Health and Welfare to be requested to suggest best material for making dough-bin covers.\n\nC.W.T.

Davis, Supt.,\nMeadow Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg of you, to obtain for me the grant from the Department at Ottawa for our night-watchman, for the longest time possible, at least for the time we need to have fire in the building, which would be at least from October 1, to the end of May.\n\nHe has been at the job since the middle of Sept., this year. The inspector for fire also recommended that we have him all the time the children are in the building.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSt. Anthony's School,\nPer Rev. Jules St. Pierre, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nFurther to our conversation in Frenchman's Butte concerning the water-softener ordered for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School and your instructions for me to wire the Purchasing Agent for instructions re: the shipping of the water-softener now held by the C.N.R. at Frenchman's Butte:\n\nI felt that I would like to investigate the case further and I found in interviewing Mr. W. Zier, the plumber who installed the water-softener, that the Principal, Father St. Pierre, ordered this softener from Mr. Zier of Lloydminster on June 9th. At that time a sample of the water used in the school was submitted to the firm making water softeners to be analyzed and the firm found that there had to be a special type of water softener used with this type of water. A check on our correspondence on file here goes to show that this water softener was ordered prior to this office knowing anything about it.\n\nI find it necessary to report that the principal of this school has on numerous occasions in the past ordered equipment and then afterwards submitted same to this office for payment. He knows full well that this is contrary to policy and on one other occasion I have been reprimanded for okaying materials he had previously purchased. I feel that some sort of action should be taken to stop this in the future.\n\nI notice the difference in the price that Zier charged for the Water-softener EH90 and the Departmental Purchase Order price is $78.25. Seeing that the softener was installed prior to July 15th would recommend payment on the basis of the Departmental Purchase Order price, namely $391.00 and that Father St. Pierre be asked to pay the difference that and the Zier price or $469.25, and that the Departmental Purchasing Agent also ask him to pay the return freight on this softener which the Department ordered and which now lies in the C.N.R. station at Frenchman's Butte. In fairness to all concerned I feel that Father St. Pierre should pay the difference seeing he went ahead and made the purchase unauthorized.\n\nJ.A. Davis\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nPlease refer to the third paragraph of Department letter dated September 9th, 1949, File 659-5 (EL), which refers to the purchase of a water softener, range boiler, and stand for the boiler, at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nHaving been informed by Mr. J.T. Warden, Field Assistant, Regina Office, that the water softener ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent arrived at Frenchman Butte, and that one had already been installed by Mr. William Zier, of Lloydminster, on an order placed with him by the Reverend Principal of the school, I discussed the matter with Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis, at the first opportunity thereafter, and requested him to make full enquiry and report to me. I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Davis' report in this connection.\n\nI would recommend that the Department follow the recommendation of Mr. Davis that Mr. Zier be paid the amount indicated in the Departmental Purchasing Order, which Mr. Davis states is $391.00, and that the Reverend Principal of the school be required to pay Mr. Zier the difference between that price and the amount of $469.25 which apparently Mr. Zier has charged against the school. I would also recommend that the Reverend Principal of the school be required to pay the return freight on the softener which lies at the C.N.R. Station at Frenchman Butte. This latter should have immediate attention as I presume demurrage is being charged while the water softener remains in the freight sheds at Frenchman Butte, and delivery is not taken.\n\nJ.P.B.

Your File 171/2-8-659\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, the Department is prepared to allow an amount of $60.00 a month for the period October 1st, 1949, to April 30th, 1950, towards the salary of the night watchman at the above mentioned school.\n\nWhen forwarding a Voucher at the end of each month in favour of the Principal, you should word it as follows:\n\n\"Allowance towards the salary of the night watchman at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, for the month of ............. $60.00\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nAIR MAIL\n\nDecember 6th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.H. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. Your File 2808-171/6-1-659\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the purchase of a water softener at the above school.\n\nAs you are aware, the request for a water softener was contained on a requisition dated August 12th, 1949, from Superintendent Davis, and forwarded to this office under cover of your letter of September 1st. It is noted that two months previous to that time, the Reverend Principal had ordered a water softener and had it installed.\n\nIt is simply impossible to control our appropriation if Principals incur, without authority, expenditures for which they expect the Department to pay.\n\nWe have given very careful consideration to the contents of both your letter and Superintendent Davis' letter, and you should inform the Principal that the Department is not prepared to pay any amount towards the cost of the water softener, which he placed in the school without authority from this office.\n\n......2\nIs a water softener required at any other school in Saskatchewan? Pumps and Softeners, Limited, have supplied a machine that is regularly ordered by the Department, and we dislike asking them to take it back as it is not fair to the company to request them to do so. Is it not possible to accept the softener from the railway company and have it stored for the time being at least, as this will save payment of demurrage.\n\nPP/ST\n\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMeadow Lake, Sask.,\nNovember 26th, 1949.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Your letter of November 23, file 2761-171/6-1-659.\n\nWish to state that we inspected this school on the evening that I left you at Onion Lake and before submitting this report would like to draw your attention to the fact that this office did not receive a copy of the fire inspector's report and the only way that I knew that the fire inspector had made an inspection was that I happened to see the fire inspector's report at the school. May I suggest that a request be made that the fire inspector in the future supply the Agency offices with a copy of their report in order that we may take whatever action is recommended.\n\nThe Inspector's report brings out the following:\n\n1. Install a cement block on exhaust pipe on diesel engine in basement.\n   This work has now been carried out and completed.\n\n2. Protect the wall behind the laundry stoves in basement with heavy asbestos.\n   This has been completed.\n\n3. One laundry stove was found with the fire box burned out and this should be replaced.\n   My inspection showed that now all three stoves are burned out and I recommended to the Father Principal that these be replaced at once.\n\n4. Install approved fire doors on boiler room. These to be self closing or held open by fusible links.\n   The Father Principal has had part of this work done and is now awaiting further supplies from Sterling Mills, North Battleford, to complete same.\n\n5. All three metal fire escapes to be extended to ground level.\n   The carpenter now has this work about half done.\n6. Fire escape doors on all floors to be changed to open outwards, and the same to be equipped with panic bolts.\n\nThe Father Principal has ordered this from Sterling Mills, North Battleford, and has the men ready to install them as soon as the material arrives.\n\n7. Illuminated Exit signs to be installed over all doors leading to fire escapes.\n\nThe Father Principal has ordered the wire and expects the same to arrive any day when he will have same installed.\n\n8. Fire alarm system is inadequate and should be extended to each dormitory with an alarm bell and an alarm station.\n\nThe principal ordered this equipment which arrived the other day and is having same installed.\n\n9. All 2\u00bd gal. Soda Acid fire extinguishers are to be recharged annually and hung on brackets three feet from the floor. Each extinguisher should also have a dated tag affixed and a record kept of each recharging.\n\nThe Father Principal has had these refilled and I informed him that dated tags must be affixed and records kept.\n\n10. CO\u2082 1/2 extinguishers should be installed in the kitchen.\n\nThe Father Principal is having these attended to at once.\n\n11. Recommend discontinuance of using slide pole fire escape. The pole on the east side of the building is not anchored at the base and should be removed.\n\nThese slide poles have been taken down.\n\n12. Recommend all doors leading to the dormitories from the stair wells be made self closing so that in case of fire they would always be in a closed position.\n\nThe Father Principal has purchased them and was telling me he is having them installed as quickly as possible.\n\nHad this office received the inspector's report we would have been in a position to have checked over the requirements and requisitioned for same. We are now, again, faced with the same problem which seems to continue in that school in that the Father Principal goes ahead and does the purchasing.\ndoes the purchasing and then requests payment even though he is familiar with regulations which state that purchases have to be made through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nOn my next visit to this school I will check up on the balance of the work which has not been done.\n\n(J.A. Davis)\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\n\nJAD:G\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have received a report from Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis regarding action which you have taken as the result of criticism from the Provincial Fire Inspector on the fire hazards at your school. The total of these accounts will result in quite a large expenditure which, I presume, you will expect the Department to pay.\n\nIt is evident that you have been following the habit of making considerable expenditures in connection with the buildings and equipment at your school, without reference to the Department in the first instance, and hoping the Department will re-imburse your school funds later. This is not the proper procedure and will, no doubt, result in your school funds having to pay for matters which, if properly submitted, would be paid by the Department.\n\nIn the future you must discuss with Indian Superintendent Davis any matter which, in your opinion, needs attention and in which some expenditure is involved. He will then submit the matter to the Department for consideration, and decision as to authorization and payment.\n\nI am bringing this to your attention not only because of the difficulty which we will face in asking the Department to pay for the improvements required by the Provincial Fire Inspector but also because of the difficulty we are now placed in through you ordering the water softener and installing it, then making a request for it. The result of that action was that the Departmental Purchasing Agent ordered a second water softener, which arrived at Frenchman Butte after you had one installed at the school. I do not know what the ultimate result will be in this connection, but, at least, it causes considerable trouble and extra expense.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P. Oatrande,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 8)\nRegina, December 1st, 1949.\n\nJ.A. Davis, Esq., Indian Superintendent, MEADOW LAKE, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, File 1128-171/6-1-659, regarding action at the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School upon the report of the Provincial Fire Inspector.\n\nApparently Father St. Pierre has proceeded with correcting most of the matters criticised by the Fire Inspector and, of course, this should have been reported to the Fire Inspector long ago. I am asking that in the future when an inspection is made by the Fire Inspector one copy of his report be left with the Principal of the School, one copy sent to you, and one copy sent to me. However, you have apparently not been visiting and inspecting the school as closely as you should have or you would have known about the work that has been performed in connection with the Fire Inspector's report, and could have stopped Father St. Pierre from going into these large expenditures without proper authority from the Department. You will now be faced with the difficulty of trying to get the accounts paid, as I am quite sure that Father St. Pierre will not expect to pay all of the cost out of his school funds.\n\nWith regard to item (j) of the Fire Inspector's report, regarding the laundry stove, I note you recommended to the Principal that all three stoves be replaced at once. I expect he will proceed to do this, assuming that he has authority from you for the expenditure. As you are aware, a requisition in this connection should be prepared in order that the order will be placed by the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Father St. Pierre now has an excellent alibi for improperly making the purchase in that he will say you told him to do so. If he has not already ordered the stoves you should quickly instruct him to not order them and you should prepare a requisition and submit it to the Department at once for the purchase of the stoves, giving the reasons in your covering letter.\n\nI am sending a copy.....\nI am sending a copy of your letter to the Department in order that they will be warned that some rather large bills will be coming along to reimburse the Reverend Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School for expenditures in connection with fire hazards. I am also writing to the Reverend St. Pierre, and I am enclosing copy of the letter.\n\nJ.P.B.

Indian Residential School, and it was shipped to Frenchman Butte, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe are considering shipping this water softener to another Indian residential school and I am enclosing a report of analysis of the water supply at the other school, in the hope that the water softener which you shipped to Frenchman Butte will be suitable for the other school.\n\nWill you kindly have this analysis given careful consideration by a person qualified to make the decision, and advise me at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

Indian Residential School and which is stored at Frenchman Butte.\n\nAs I was aware that Mr. W.W. Perrie, Resident Engineer, Department of Mines and Resources, was taking steps to purchase a water softener for the Gordon's Indian Residential School, I discussed with him the possibility of shipping the water softener from Frenchman Butte to the Gordon's School. As I do not have a report of the analysis of the water at the Onion Lake School for which the water softener was ordered, I am not sure that it will be suitable to deal with the water at the Gordon's School. I have therefore written to the company which shipped the water softener to Frenchman Butte, Pumps and Softener Limited, P.O. Box 454, London, Ontario, sending them a report of water analysis of the water at the Gordon's School, to ascertain whether or not it is advisable to send the water softener from Frenchman Butte to the Gordon's School. I am enclosing copy of a letter today sent to Pumps and Softeners Limited.\n\nPlease give me authority to re-ship the water softener if the reply from Pumps and Softeners, Limited, indicates that the machine will be suitable for the Gordon's School.\n\nJ.P.B.

Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency dated December 15th; and copy of Mr. Davis' reply, with which was enclosed copies of correspondence between his office and the Reverend Principal of the St. Anthony's Indian Residential School regarding 1950-51 Estimates.\n\nMr. Davis has not enclosed requisitions covering the requirements, but he has enclosed a copy of Reverend Father St. Pierre's letter and a copy of a list of the requirements which accompanied that letter, including paint; varnish; repairs to the roof of the main building; new batteries for the lighting plant; a workshop for the boys; and other needed machinery and equipment.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Davis endeavours to blame Reverend Father St. Pierre for the delay in submitting requisitions for the 1950-51 Appropriation. Perhaps the Reverend Principal has been somewhat lax in the fact that he sent the list in to Mr. Davis on November 19th, 1949. However, I feel that Mr. Davis is more to blame than reverend rather St. Pierre, and he is always anxious to find a \"scape-goat\" when neglectful of his duties. If he had been visiting the school regularly and examining the school equipment, as well as discussing the needs of the school with the Reverend Principal, as he should have, it would not come as a surprise to him, on the 19th of November, that these things were needed, particularly such items as paint, varnish, repairs to the roof, and new light batteries. The other items, of course, are requested with a view to improving the equipment of the school and should have been discussed and placed before the Department for consideration.\n\nIn passing the matter on to the Department in its present shape I realize that...\nshape I realize that the information is considerably short of the requirements of the Department, but I would ask that if possible $7500.00 be added to the Estimates in order to be available to meet the needs at the St. Anthony's Indian Residential School in 1950-51. If this can be done I shall instruct Mr. Davis to prepare necessary requisitions properly describing the needs, with an estimated cost of each.\n\nMay I be advised in this connection at an early date, please.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 650-5, part 8)\nSt. Anthony Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask. Dec. 13, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a month ago I sent in my estimation for the year 1950-1951 to Mr. Davis.\n\nHe sent me word that this should have been done last May. I was surprised as this has always been done at this time of the year.\n\nI wish to state that I had put in a note concerning the roof of the school, which is really in a very bad shape, and needs to be completely renewed in the early spring, as the slightest rainfall all comes through.\n\nAlso, the batteries for the lights will not hold on much longer and will need to be replaced by September, the latest.\n\nI therefore beg that you please put in a good word for me and that with the help of the Department you will kindly obtain for me the favours I request.\n\nThanking you most sincerely,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Jules St. Pierre\nPrincipal.\nRegina, December 15th, 1949.\n\nJ.A. Davis, Esq., Indian Superintendent, MEADOW LAKE, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Reverend Father St. Pierre, O.M.I., Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, regarding submission of his 1950-51 Estimates.\n\nPlease advise me what action you have taken to provide in the 1950-51 Estimates for the repairs referred to by Father St. Pierre.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Your file 3010-171-16-S, dated Dec.15/49.\n\nWe attach copies of the correspondence in connection with the estimates referred to in the above file for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, No.659.\n\nYou will note by the date on the covering letter with Father St. Pierre's list that it was not made out until November 19/49, and was received by this office on Nov.21, 1949. The Father Principal has not quoted prices on any of the objects requested, nor has he given us full details of companies manufacturing such items as \"one machine for mending stockings\", \"one electric mixer\", (he does not say whether this is a bread mixer or a general mixer with attachments such as a \"mix-master\") \"one potato peeler\", nor does he list what tools are required for the woodwork.\n\nWhen the Principal of the Beauval Indian R.C. Residential School, Father Gagnon, submits his estimates they are worked out to the last detail. A drawing is given for any proposed buildings, showing approximate distances, areas, and installations required. He submits full quotations of prices of all equipment, where it can be bought, and how much it will come to laid down at Beauval. He also gives full reasons for his requests so that we can see they are definitely needed and the school will suffer for lack of same.\n\nAs you very well know from experience the tracking down of companies and prices delivered for the items listed in such a manner as Father St. Pierre has done will take months. First we will have to try to obtain from Father St. Pierre a more accurate description of these items, the company manufacturing same, and then the correspondence with them to obtain quotations laid down at the nearest freight depot.\nIt is unfortunate that we did not notice that batteries for the lighting plant would be needed and include these in the Estimates for 1950-51. As it is we have not made allowances for any repairs to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. Father St. Pierre had submitted no requests or estimates and we did not realize that any would be needed.\n\nA quick guess at the cost of the items listed for Onion Lake R.C. Residential School appears to be quite a sum. If the roof is in the condition he states it is we cannot see why this matter was not brought to our attention months ago.\n\nWe would like to know just how much help the Indian Affairs Branch gives to these Residential Schools. So far we pay for the nightwatchman at Onion Lake, tuition for each pupil attending, repairs and installations, furniture and equipment needed and new additions and repairs to the buildings. What part, besides providing the regular teaching and supervising staff does the R.C. Church provide? Knowing that it is called the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School we believed they paid the upkeep and we just paid for the tuition of the pupils the same as white children's tuition is paid at boarding schools by their parents. We believed any extra help we gave was in the way of encouragement and special grants to thank them for the work they are doing for our Indians. If our Branch is responsible for the entire upkeep of these schools just as we are for our day schools then a more strict watch must be kept to ascertain needed repairs to both buildings and equipment so that same may be made before the expenditure amounts to such large sums.\n\nBeyond the fact that the Father Principal has submitted no cost Estimate we are not complaining but would like to know where we stand with these schools. May we please have your advice on these matters so that no future errors such as this should occur.\n\nJ.A. Davis\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your File 19-17/16-3\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing requisitions from the Principal of the above school for certain supplies and work for which he wishes the Department to provide funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1950-51.\n\nAs you are aware, the Estimates for the coming fiscal year were prepared several weeks ago, and although we did not have any definite information regarding the requirements at the Onion Lake School, we included an amount of $700.00 for new equipment and $1,000.00 for repairs. If the amounts are granted, it will not be absolutely essential to spend the money in the manner just stated. I mean that we could expend the whole amount for repairs, or vary the amounts for repairs and equipment in a manner which would best meet the requirements at the school.\n\nIn reviewing the list which you submitted, it will not be possible to provide funds to erect a manual training shop during the coming fiscal year.\nWe do not appear to have received any recent correspondence regarding the condition of the roof at this school. Would it be possible for you to let us have an estimate of the cost of the work which the Principal considers necessary, or do you wish us to arrange to have Mr. Perrie visit this school and inspect the roof and report to us.\n\nAbout April 1st Superintendent Davis should submit requisitions for the paint, refrigerator, potato peeler, mattresses and batteries. We will then be in a position to decide exactly what we can allow. When submitting the requisition for the battery, the Superintendent should state the capacity of the battery presently in use, and the date on which it was supplied.\n\nAt the present time we are not prepared to consider supplying the electric mixer or the machine for mending stockings.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

This was done some time ago and it was found necessary to replace some of the control equipment. These controls have been brought in to Saskatoon, and are ready to be installed on the unit.\n\nWe are, however, in receipt of a letter from Mr. Charbonneau, from our Montreal Office, asking that we hold up the installations of these repairs until such time as we are in receipt of an order from the Department of Mines and Resources for the work. Mr. Charbonneau, in the meantime, is taking this matter up with Ottawa, and advises that he will let us know when this work should go on. However, realizing that the Indian School at Onion Lake may be inconvenienced if the plant fails altogether, we thought possibly you might issue an emergency order for this repair work here. If in the event that Ottawa duplicates, we could see that there is no duplication made.\n\nThe repairs which are required is an automatic switch of which the price is $55.00 and a new control which is $19.00. However, this would be offset by the Indian School returning a unit which they already have and which is not suitable. However, there is travelling expenses from Lloydminster to the School which are quite expensive at this time of the year, and we would appreciate hearing from you in this regard.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJWS/ea\nc.o.

As we\nwish to comply with orders of the Provincial Fire Commissioner\nit has been customary to submit requisitions to the Department\nfor that purpose. However, in this case Reverend Father St.\nPierre, the Principal of the School, had proceeded to order\nthe materials necessary for the work, and I am enclosing Meadow\nLake Agency Voucher No. 160 for $449.45, in favour of Sterling\nHardware & Millworks Limited, North Battleford, covering the\ninvoices and in accordance with orders issued by Reverend Father\nSt. Pierre.\n\nI would recommend payment of this voucher because of the\nurgency of having the work done, as the Union Lake R.C. Residential\nSchool building is not, by any means, safe, and the least we can\ndo is to comply with the Fire Commissioner's orders.\n\nThe whole thing was done improperly, as indicated in my\nletter above referred to, but the damage had been done before I\nwas aware of it, as, at that time, the Fire Commissioner was not\ncareful to supply me with a copy of each order issued. So far as\nI know, the only one who received the order in this particular\ncase was the Principal of the School.\n\nJ.P.B.

Indian Residential School\n\nThe Department is returning unpaid Vouchers 130 and 131.\n\nAs you are aware, the water softener was purchased by the Principal without receiving any authority. As a matter of fact, previous correspondence indicates that when the original requisition for the water softener was forwarded to the Department, the Principal had already purchased and installed a water softener.\n\nIt is simply impossible to control our appropriation for residential schools if Principals incur, without authority, expenditures for which they expect the Department to pay.\n\nPayment of the water softener which has been purchased will have to be made from school funds, and you should so advise the Principal.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Indian Residential School.\n\nOn September 1st, 1949, Regional Supervisor Ostrander forwarded to us a letter he had received from Superintendent Davis of the Meadow Lake Agency, enclosing a requisition for a water softener for the Onion Lake School. We forwarded the requisition to the Departmental Purchasing Agent and the softener was subsequently purchased.\n\nWhen the softener reached the freight address of the school, Superintendent Davis made further enquiries and found that the Principal, Father St. Pierre, had ordered the water softener from Mr. William Zier of Lloydminster, a local plumber, on June 9th without the knowledge of the Superintendent. Therefore, the softener we supplied was not required and we transferred it to the Gordon's Indian Residential School, where it could be used.\n\nRecently we received an account covering the cost of the softener, and I may add that Mr. Zier charged considerably more than the price at which we could have purchased the softener.\n\nYou will note from the above that considerable work was caused to several of our officials and that the\nexpenditure was incurred without any authority, and consequently, we are returning the voucher unpaid and requesting Superintendent Davis to notify the Principal that its cost will have to be paid from school funds.\n\nPP/7T\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMeadow Lake, Sask.,\nMarch 13th, 1930.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFather St. Pierre has informed us that fire broke out in the barn at the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School and before being brought under control caused damage estimated at $1,000.00. This fire was on March 1st and was caused by the motor on the milking machine back-firing and the carburetor immediately took fire. This fire spread to the straw above. In about 15 to 20 minutes the pupils and the men of the school had connected about four to five hundred feet of hose to the water system and pumped water into the fire which soon brought it under control.\n\nThe Father Principal approves very much of their water system which he states saved them from a loss of about $5,000.00. He has asked that our Department aid them in repairing the roof, the north half or side of the building also, are destroyed. We have written to him asking that he submit a list of the supplies required and their approximate cost so that we may submit same to Ottawa and ask for their authorization to repair same. We definitely told him that we cannot authorize the repair until these lists have been sent to Ottawa and they authorize the repair through this office.\n\nThe Father Principal states that they themselves will do the labour of repairing.\n\nTrust this is the correct procedure in notifying you of damage by fire to school properties.\n\n(J.A. Davis)\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from Superintendent Davis regarding a fire which occurred in the barn at the Union Lake Residential School, on March 1st, causing damage estimated at $1,000 to the building.\n\nAt the present time, I do not think there is any further action necessary until Father St. Pierre submits a list of the required material for repairs, which will go forward to you for authorization. You will note in Mr. Davis' letter, he has warned the Reverend Father that no repairs will be paid if carried out unauthorized.\n\nJ.P.B.

I have received two cheques on account totaling $66.12 less a balance of $47.25. I have written to Mr. Davis the Superintendent at Meadow Lake several times concerning this account but have had no reply. I think I am entitled to some explanation as this money has been outstanding for so long.\n\nI am enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope and would appreciate hearing from you concerning this matter. Thank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nZier's Plumbing,\n\nPer:\n\nWm. Zier.\n\nEnc./bm\nApril 1st, 1950.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Indian\nResidential School.\nYour File 663-171/6-6-659\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant reporting the fire at the above school which caused damage to the extent of $1,000.00 to the barn.\n\nAs the Onion Lake School is owned by the Government, it is felt that either the Principal or the Indian Superintendent should have notified us sooner regarding the fire which occurred on March 1st.\n\nWhen Superintendent Davis forwards the list of materials required to repair the barn, further consideration will be given to what action we can take. We approve of Mr. Davis' action of informing the Principal that no repairs will be paid if the work is carried out without authorization.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nApril 1st, 1950.\n\nMr. Wm. Zier,\nP.O. Box 400,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Zier:\n\nWe have your letter of March 20th with reference to an account which is owing to you by the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nThe equipment which you supplied was ordered by the Principal without first receiving authority from this office, and consequently, we are not in a position to pay the account. Both the Principal and the Indian Superintendent have been so advised.\n\nI have no doubt that the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School will pay you what is owing to you.\n\nI am returning the stamped self-addressed envelope which you forwarded.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

I\nasked Indian Superintendent Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency,\nto investigate the matter in an effort to ascertain whether\nor not it would be necessary to undertake a major repair job.\nApparently he has made a rough guess that the whole of the roof\nneeds re-covering, and has obtained a price from Panther Oil\nand Grease Manufacturing Company, of Toronto, for 8,663 sq. ft.\nof surface, at a cost of $855.00.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. W.W. Perrie,\nand we are of the opinion that it is quite probable that only\nminor repairs are needed, possibly two or three leaks in the roof,\nand, in any case, ordinary asphalt can be used at a cost consider-\nably less than the quotation Mr. Davis has obtained.\n\nI would recommend that the matter be left in abeyance\nuntil the roads become passable, and the weather more suitable,\nafter which Mr. Perrie be asked to send an engineer to investigate\nthe matter and make a recommendation.\n\nIn the meantime I am instructing Mr. Davis to take\nno further action.\n\nJ.P.B.

Davis,\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6325, file 659-5, part 8)\nRegina, June 30th, 1950.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n304 Post Office Building,\nREGINA,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nOn June 27th, as per your instructions, I visited the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, but was unable to obtain much information due to the absence of the Principal and his Assistant.\n\nI examined the roof of the school building, and found the same to be in need of extensive repair. In my opinion the roof of the main building will have to be entirely recovered, although I feel the wings can be satisfactorily repaired. I would suggest asking contractors for tenders for this job as soon as possible.\n\nThe fire escapes and doors have been repaired or constructed to comply with recommendations outlined by Mr. Tiffin in his report dated June 1st, 1950, although the self-closing doors have not yet been installed on the doors leading to the dormitories from the stairways. This will be done as soon as possible.\n\nI examined the lighting plant and batteries at the school, and find that they have not been properly cared for. This may be due to lack of knowledge on the part of the mechanic. I have, however, instructed him on the proper procedure, care, and operation of this plant and batteries. I was informed by the mechanic that during the winter months they had some trouble with the Fairbanks-Morse Diesel Unit, and for a temporary measure they used an old generator that the school had in its possession, and used the McCormack-Deering tractor to supply the power to drive this generator. The proper control panel for this generator was not available or used, and resulted in too fast an over-charging of the batteries. This will naturally shorten the life of the batteries. However, if the control for the Fairbanks-Morse Diesel engine which ordinarily supplies this power to re-charge these batteries is set properly to start with, they should charge at the rate of 20 amps. As the batteries become charged, and the resistance increases, the amperage naturally is retarded. To overcome this, the mechanic had been increasing the voltage by advancing the Rehostat. This increases the voltage and causes the batteries to heat. I explained the danger this caused to the batteries, to him, and he stated that he had not had too much experience, and no course in maintaining Diesel engines or lighting units, but instructed me to make sure our recommendations. He also informed me that Father St. Pierre, the Principal of the School, tinkered with the machines quite frequently.\n\nThe Diesel engine itself is operating very well, but the electrically controlled shut-off is very sticky. This will require a highly skilled workman to repair it properly, therefore I would recommend that we remove the pumps and solonide and have the same repaired by an expert.\n\nApart from the engine room, the...\nApart from the engine room, the rest of the school appeared tidy and clean. I instructed the caretaker to clean the shavings and rags, etc. off the oil soaked floor of this combination engine room and shop.\n\nThere must be an accompanying letter to explain this. It's all new to me.\n\nC.A.P.C.\n\n12/7\n\nD.H. Morrison,\nSupervisor of Construction, Regina.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a report from Mr. D. N. Morrison, Supervisor of Construction, on an inspection he made to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School on June 27th.\n\n1. It is recommended that local contractors be asked to tender on work of repairing the roof of the school by entirely recovering the roof of the main building and repairing the roofs of the wings of the building.\n\n2. As Mr. Morrison was informed that the self closing fire doors in the stairways will be installed by the school staff, as soon as possible, there is apparently no further action to be taken in this connection.\n\n3. The matter of the care of the lighting plant and batteries was referred to in Department letter dated June 22, 1950, 659-5 (El). I asked that Mr. Morrison give this matter special attention which he has done. He carefully instructed the school mechanic in the care of the plant but unfortunately the Reverend Principal was absent, consequently he did not have the benefit of Mr. Morrison's advice.\n\n4.

It is described as a McLarney's Farmer Boiler, No. 30. From the information I have obtained from different sources this type of boiler was originally made for scalding hogs on the farm. I would suggest that a small boiler be purchased and installed in the furnace room, the steam and hot water be piped to the laundry, and the three formerly mentioned boilers be done away with.\n\nBarn - the repairs to the roof from the fire had been completed but there is evidence of much carelessness in the maintenance of the rest of the building. The doors are sinking and sprung, and no attempt has been made to repair them. One stanchion in the cow barn is broken, and was left lying in the stall, along with other broken material which has not been piled, but more or less thrown into this stall.\n\nA lean-to on the east end of the blacksmith's shop is badly in need of minor repairs and the roof is sinking. It would require very little effort on the part of the Principal to have this roof repaired (jacked and re-braced). All buildings at the school, with the exception of a blacksmith's shop, are in immediate need of minor repairs.\n\nThe school barn yard is generally in an untidy condition\n\nwith bricks and bit of broken....\nwith bricks and bits of broken plank lying here and there. I also found that a roller jack which had apparently been used to jack up the tractor was left lying in the yard where they had finished with it, and the tractor, or whatever machine was being repaired, had been moved away.\n\nOn a visit to this school on July 18th I drew Father St. Pierre's attention to the shavings and rubble lying about the combination work shop and engine room, and pointed out to him the fire hazard this created, but on my visit on the 24th I found there were more shavings and rubble, and no attempt had been made to clean it. It is evident that Father St. Pierre is not too fire conscious, as I also found a two-gallon can partly filled with gasoline, and one of the caps on the can was missing. This can is kept in the engine room in the barn close to the engine used to operate the milking machine. This is the same engine that is supposed to have started the fire in the barn earlier this year. I pointed out these things to Mr. J.A. Davis, Superintendent, Meadow Lake Agency, and he informed me that he had, on several previous occasions, mentioned some of these things to Father St. Pierre, but had received no reply regarding any of them.\n\nI would recommend that another fire proof building of sheet steel or some other fire proof material be built 10 or 12 ft. away from the barn, and the engine that is now in the barn be put in this building.\n\nD.N.

These will be installed as soon as we find time to do so. I wish to assure that special attention will be given to take proper care of them and that we will carry out the recommendations made by the Supervisor of Construction.\n\nAlthough there are a few points for us to be more careful I wish to mention that you have, in some way, been misinformed concerning the use of a McCormack-Deering tractor to supply power to drive the generator for charging batteries, as this has not been done since we have the Fairbanks-Morse Diesel Unit. It is true that we did have some trouble with the generator, but we have been without electricity for two months, using gas and oil lamps for lighting purposes. The only use that was made of the tractor was to operate the laundry machine and dryer by placing a belt directly on the pulley at the end of this machine, so, the tractor had nothing to do with the electric plant.\n\nI have been informed also that the mechanic did increase the voltage by advancing the Rehestat but this was done after the motor starter had been replaced on the Fairbanks-Morse Diesel engine, as we still had trouble with it then, but this will not be done again and besides, this mechanic is not here anymore. A more experienced man has been hired.\n\nThanking you for all consideration given, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. Jules St. Pierre, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Their foreman is of the opinion that some of the lumber under the roof will have to be repaired and they do not care to make an estimate on it until they had stripped the roof.\n\nI interviewed a Mr. Sneider of St. Walburg who does considerable contract work in the way of building schools, etc. He checked over this Residential School and phoned me yesterday stating that he has all the work he can handle this year and is not interested in putting in a bid on that job.\n\nEnclosed please find an offer from E.M. Cleve Construction of Lloydminster, Sask., in the amount of $6,794.00 which you will note he has itemized.\n\nI had heard that Father St. Pierre had interviewed a contractor from North Battleford regarding putting in a bid for this work but the Reverend Father tells me that this is not the case.\n\nWould recommend that the Cleve Construction offer receive your consideration.\n\n(J.A. Davis)\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Onion Lake R.C. Residential School\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 11th instant,\nFile 659-5(El), regarding necessary repairing of the roof of the\nabove mentioned school, Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis has been\nendeavouring to get quotations on the work.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter from Indian Superintendent\nJ.A. Davis and a quotation of E.M. Cleve Construction Company, of\nLloydminster, for an amount of $6,794.00. When comparing the\ncost of the roofing job at the Muscovequan School, this price seems\nmuch too high, and I am asking Mr. Davis to make a further effort\nto get quotations.\n\nJ.P.B.

(No.115-8-10), and your further letter of September 20th. (No.118-8-10) setting forth your understanding of the circumstances under which the two Anglican Indian children, Thomas and Emma Moyah, were admitted to the Roman Catholic Onion Lake School, I beg to state that I have been instructed by our Commission to correct some of the information you have received, and on which the decision set forth in your letter of September 20th appears to have been based.\n\n1. In your letter of September 20th. you state that \"It is found, however, that no children in this family have been baptized since the year 1923...\" This is incorrect, as the Rev. Principal Ellis of our Union Lake School baptized the youngest child in this family, a baby girl seven months old, on October 6th. of this year, when it received the name of Caroline Edna. The other children previously baptized into the Church of England were as follows:\n\nMary baptized January 4th. 1914\nAlice Harriet \" December 5th. 1915\nThomas \" December 7th. 1917\nEmma \" March 16th. 1922\nGladys Reima \" June 9th. 1925\nIsadore \" June 3rd. 1928\n\n2. You also state in your letter of September 20th. that \"the Department has received definite information to the effect that the father is a regular attendant at the Roman Catholic Church, and that the family are now recognized as Roman Catholics.\" As Pierre Moyah the father of the above\nchildren was baptized into the Church of England on December 25th, 1932, and his youngest child \"Caroline Edna\" was likewise baptized on October 6th, 1933, and his daughter Mary married in the Church of England on October 7th, 1933. Our Commission are not convinced that this family is \"now recognized as Roman Catholics.\" As Pierre Moyan appears, from information received by our Commission, to have recently admitted to the local Indian Agent, Dr. J. T. Hill, that the Church of England record with regard to his baptism into our Church on December 25th, 1932, was correct, and that the records with regard to the baptism of his children into our Church on the dates given were also correct, the members can see no justification whatever for the admission of Thomas and Emma Moyan into the Roman Catholic School, and they trust that your Department, with this fuller knowledge of the circumstances before it, may view the matter in the same light and have them transferred to our Society's School where they rightly belong. In expressing this opinion our Commission take the view that your Department's ruling that children of Protestant parents must be admitted to Protestant Schools, and children of Roman Catholic parents must be admitted to Roman Catholic Schools, should be carefully observed, if serious confusion is to be avoided, and anything like stability in the system of administration is to be secured and maintained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 2, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with further reference to the admission of Thomas and Emma Moyah to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of September 20th last, the Department has been definitely informed that Moyah is a regular attendant at the Roman Catholic Church and that the family are now recognized as Roman Catholics. On this understanding, the admission of the children to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School was approved. In taking such action, the Department was adhering strictly to the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act.\n\nI note you are not convinced that the Moyah family are recognized as Roman Catholics. In view of the information given in your letter, I am obtaining a further report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the last paragraph of your No. 99-19 of July 26th last, you stated that Moyah was a regular attendant at the Roman Catholic Church and, as you had approved the application for the admission of his children to the Roman Catholic School, the Department assumed you were satisfied that the Moyah family are now recognized as Roman Catholics.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a letter from Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.O.C., in which he states that he is not convinced this family should be recognized as Roman Catholics. He states that the youngest child of this family was baptized in the Anglican Church on October 6, 1933, and that Moyah's daughter, Mary, was married in the Church of England on October 7, 1933.\n\nI would appreciate if you would again make careful enquiry regarding the previous religious affiliations of the Moyah family and advise the Department whether or not, in your opinion, there has been any recent change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nR. C. and C. of E. Indian Residential Schools:\n\nAs a result of an X-Ray Examination of the children in residence at the Indian Residential Schools, by Dr. H. C. Boughton, of the Saskatoon Sanitarium, three children at the R. C. School and four at the C. of E. School, have been found to have such definite tuberculosis of the lungs that they must be considered \"spreaders\". There is little or no clinical evidence in these cases, but they are being discharged. Upon my inspection of the R. C. School on the 27th and the C. of E. School on the 15th, the remaining children were physically fit.\nDivision Fyle No.\n\nRURAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision Sub-Division Detachment\n# Province #/Battleford. #/Battleford.\nSask.

Moyah's daughter Mary married Frank Heathen (Anglican) last October and the Rev. H. Ellis, principal of the C. of E. School, officiated. On the same date, at the request of Mrs. Moyah (Anglican) Mr. Ellis baptized the youngest member of the Moyah family. Moyah claims that he protested against the baptism but was overruled by his wife. Moyah emphatically stated that he is a Roman Catholic and always had been. Moyah's mother, brothers and their families are Roman Catholics. He claims that he is a regular attendant of the R. C. Church and that he does not attend any other. Previous to his marriage he was undoubtedly identified with the R. C. Church.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, July 19, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has not yet received your reply to the Deputy Superintendent General's circular letter of the 15th ultimo. You will note from that circular that the Indian Act requires that, when pupils are being kept in a residential school after they reach the age of sixteen years, permission must be secured. You should, therefore, forward a list of all pupils in the school at the present time who are sixteen years of age and over, and in the case of those whom you consider should be kept for a longer period, permission should be requested, and your reasons given for asking such permission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Indian Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith the names of our Indian children over sixteen years of age:\n\n132 Therese Matchisikak, 20. Orphan no home, no near relatives to take care of her. She goes for a little vacation and comes back immediately. She has been here at the school since she was 5 years old, having been brought here by the police after both her father and mother had died during the Flu Epidemic. Permission already granted last year to keep her until she marries Peter Matchisikak, her same case than Therese his sister.\n\n143 William Maskego, orphan 17. Will probably get married soon desires to stay until he gets married. Has only an aged uncle to look after him.\n\n147 Johnny Paul, orphan no father or mother.\n\n204 Charlie Daniel: Discharged at the end of June\n\n223 Edward Kamiskikitw: 16. Came very late at the school. Only 1/2 year schooling. Knows very little and needs more training.\n\n164 Eliza Maskego, 16. Orphan. Her father remarried and is very sick. Cannot look after her. She is not very strong and needs good care. The Indian agent here advised her to remain at school.\n\n165 Mary Wolfe, 16. Orphan no body to take care of her and stays here during vacation.\n\n184 Anne Angus, 17. Will probably get married late at the Fall. She stays here at the school during vacation having no body to look after her except her aged grandmother who is very poor. I like to keep her until she gets married and by this to keep her out of trouble.\n\n241 Philomene Stanley, 16. Came late to the school and is very late in her studies. Had no yet any chance to get training for house work.\n\n245 M. Rose Whitstone, 16. Same as above name Philomene Stantle.\n\nFor reasons which I name below we have always been desirous of keeping the children until they are eighteen years of age and the Indian Agent...\nL.J.C. & M.I.\n\nis in entire agreement with us.\n\nIn many cases the children do not come until they are nine to twelve years of age, which is late to begin. If possible we keep children steadily at school until they are sixteen years and by this time they have reached Grades VI and VII. Occasionally we have them doing Grade VIII work where they are sufficiently intelligent.\n\nAt sixteen they begin to train for house work and Farming.\n\nNow if the children leave us at sixteen, they cannot possibly be self-supporting; as there has not been time to give them an appreciable amount of training, but if the Department and the Agent are willing to advance further help we will be only too happy to give the children every possible advantage to fit them for an independent future.\n\nSome of them who stay with us marry before they leave the school.\n\nIf my suggestion be supported by the Department it is my intention when the children have reached the age of seventeen to have them go home in the Spring to break land, then have them return to school the following year they can then put in their crop and if they wish to marry they will later have a little money and a home to start with. In this way I consider they will become more ambitious and self-supporting and in a position to live apart from the old people.\n\nFrom experience we find that when the children leave us as early as sixteen nearly all the good work that has been expended on their behalf is of no avail. They are just out for the fun they can get, they become more lazy and irresponsible and by the time they are mature men and women they are no further ahead than were their parents before them. We feel very strongly on this point and trust that the Department will see eye to eye with us in this matter.\n\nYours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 8, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, I beg to say that, in view of the information contained in your communication, the following children may be retained for another year:-\n\nNo. 120 - Peter Hatchisikak,\n147 - Johnny Paul,\n223 - Edward Kamiskitiw,\n0164 - Eliza Maskego,\n0165 - Mary Wolfe,\n0184 - M. Anne Angus,\n0241 - Philomena Stanley\n0245 - M. Rose Whitstone\n\nAs directed in the Deputy Superintendent General's circular of June 15th, you should, at the end of each academic year in future, forward to the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list showing the names and register numbers of the children in the Onion Lake School who are 16 years of age and over. In the case of those who, you consider, should remain for a further period permission should be requested. The Department is prepared to consider representations in this regard, made by the Indian Agent or yourself.\n\nWm. Maskego, No. 143, may remain in the school for a further period, but the Department trusts\n\n- that he\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nthat he will soon find it possible to leave, as it is noted from your letter that he is nearly 18 years of age.\n\nTheresa Watchisikak, No. 0132, is stated to be 20 years of age. It is noted that she is an orphan, and consequently the Department does not desire to force her out of the school. However, in view of her age, it is considered that she should be able to work and that it should not be necessary to allow per capita grant for her.

His wife, whom he married last year, was a widow (non-treaty) with three children aged respectively, 7, 9, and 11 years. Mrs. Pascal has asked me to have these children admitted to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. Should the Department consider this I would be pleased to forward the admission forms duly completed.

T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJ.C. & M.I.\n\nRe: Sam Cook\n\ncome to see you on account of my children. You already know that I have placed two of my children at the C.E. School. With reference to this last boy, he has been away several times, he is still home, he does not like the school. Mr. Ellis came four times before the admission of the boy; he wanted me to sign the boy's admission. The last time he came he promised me $100.00 that is to say, he wanted give me the job to haul wood for the sum of $100.00 this winter. It was tempting; so I signed the admission but telling him that I was not decided to send the boy now, but a little later. I brought wood to school for the sum of $50.00 after which I sent the boy. But the moment the boy had entered the school, Ellis forgot all about his promise. I told him then that I was not selling my boy for the sum, simply I claimed that he would keep his word and would keep mine. So he told me to make ten more cords of wood when this was done he refused to buy them, so the cords are still here. He did not keep his word so I cannot trust him any longer, neither will I believe his teaching. So I told him I was breaking off completely both with him and his teaching so saying I handed him his Bible and books.\n\nRe: to my truant boy, the Agent has urged me to send him to school, I objected that I had no means to go that far, he then offered to take me and the boy in his car. I thanked him and said I really did not to send the boy now. So the agent did not argue any more but a few days later, the Police came and took my boy to school, but in a short time he was back again and he is now home.\n\nI then went to find the Agent and told him, I was breaking off with the Church of England and return to my own religion and that I wanted all my children to do likewise. He objected that I might perhaps have a hard time to do so, as my children were now all enrolled at the C.E. School. I said \"I do not see why I would have trouble since my children have all been baptized in the R.C. Church, and that I was married in the R.C. Church, that I did not belong to that church years ago and my wife likewise is a Catholic and so was my first wife.\"\n\nStill I am willing to have the children finish term of three months but after this I desire that my children will be transferred. The Agent told me he would write to the Indian Dept. to explain the matter and do his best to help me.\n\nSigned\n\nSam Cook\nIndian\n\nWitness Joe Quincy.\nOnion Lake R.C. School,\nOnion Lake, Sask., April 23, 1934.\n\nRe to Mr. Edward Fox & Child.\n\nBeth Mr. and Mrs. Edward Fox are here again this evening, to say that they desire to have their girl admitted in the R.C. School, being Catholics they want their children to be of the same creed.\n\nMr. Edward Fox now admits that he did sign the admission of his girl for both schools, but he added, \"If I did sign for the C.E. School, it was through vexation. I was continually harassed by my father-in-law, Joe Waskahat to send my daughter to the C.E. School.\"\n\nBeth Mr. and Mrs. Fox state that on one occasion, at table a discussion on the child's schooling arose. Mr. J. Waskahat was most imperative in his wish to send the girl to the C.E. school but Mr. Fox refused to comply with his request, when the dispute was at its hottest, Edward left the room saying, \"Take the child wherever you wish,\" this he said, to get rid of the row and have peace. Mrs. Fox, for her part did not want to grieve her parents in going against their wishes so she suggested that the girl should be given to the grandparents. Later she sought the Agent's advice on the matter, Mr. Cameron who was present objected, saying that both father and mother being alive, it was impossible to do so.\n\nSome time after the fact mentioned, Mr. J. Waskahat drove up, he was accompanied by J. Heathen, accountant, both Waskahat and Heathen pressed on Mr. E. Fox to sign the admission of his daughter into the Anglican school, they drove him up to the school and there disregarding his determination not to send the girl to school, Edward signed the admission in order to free himself from his harassing relatives, for he was in no hurry to send his daughter, he declared.\n\nLasee said he, \"I met the Indian Agent who inquired where I intended to send my boy. I replied, I did not want to be bothered with the question, but if ever I decide to send him to school I'll send him wherever I please.\" My wife added, \"It is alright for him to be a Roman Catholic. To this the Indian Agent replied, \"See here, I do not favour one school more than the other, I simply want these children where they belong, any way, by the time you will be ready to send your boy to school, I'll perhaps not be an Indian Agent then.\"\n\nBeth the Indian Agent and Mrs. Ellis are notified that the boy will be placed in the R.C. School.\nRegarding the baptism of Marie Ann (my first born). It is a fact that the child was baptized in the R.C. Church two days after her birth; the mother herself took the baby to church accompanied by the godmother, Mrs. Joe Little Wolf, who is here present. This took place the 6th of May 1936. Later when the child was over a year old, Rev. O. Ahnakee re-baptized her. It happened that Rev. Ahnakee was at Onion Lake and was leaving for Lloydminster with Mrs. Jankinhat; the latter sent his daughter Mrs. E. Fox to see Mr. Ahnakee, she did so, and he asked her to baptize the baby; he offered a blanket in return, she accepted.\n\nAs a proof that both adhere to the Roman Catholic Church, seven children born from their union have been baptized in the R.C. Church and five of these have been attended by the R.C. priest at their burial.\n\nEd Fox\n\nJoe Little Wolf\n\nMrs. Fox\n\nMrs. J. Little Wolf\nOctober 16th 1934\n\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nIndian Dept.  \nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTwo applications for Admission to our School of two Catholics Children were made one at beginning of June and the other by the 20th of Aug. and duly signed by the parents and were refused by the Dept according to letters received by our Indian Agent Dr. Hill. These children are Simon Cooke and the other Maurice Fox.\n\nThese children are catholics and are of age to be admitted to the school. Will you be kind enough to see that their admission be accepted by the Dept. Their parents are anxious to have them here at the school and also are of good health.\n\nI am sending you the testimony of their parents regarding their will towards their children. They come often to see me about their children and I always refer them to the Indian Agent. Today I just send you a word about them and with their testimony.\n\nI will be very glad to see this question settled with justice and according to the parents' wishes.\n\nYour very sincerely,\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Father J.E. Pratt, M.I.  \nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 31st, 1934.\n\nDear Father Pratt,\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to applications for the admission of certain children to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nWe do not appear to have had any correspondence with reference to Maurice Fox. Is this boy a brother of Maria Ann Fox? If so, I would refer you to official letter of February 13th, last, addressed to the former Principal, Rev. Jos. Fortier, O.M.I.\n\nWith reference to Sam Cook, we have had considerable correspondence regarding his children. Four members of Sam Cook's family are stated to have been in the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School since 1910 and two of them are attending the C.E. School at the present time. We have no record of any previous protest against the admission of Cook's children to the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School. The statement made by Cook does not indicate any reason why, if he is a Roman Catholic, he has, for the last twenty-four years, been placing his children in the Onion Lake C.E. School.\n\nLet me assure you that cases such as this receive our very careful consideration and we endeavour to be fair to all parties concerned but I think you will realise that it is rather difficult, without more definite information, to accept Cook's statement at its face value now in view of his actions during the past twenty-four years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nOttawa, October 31st, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn checking the September quarter return of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, it is noted that the names of the under-mentioned pupils were shown on the June quarter return but do not appear on the September quarter return, although no application has been received for their discharge:\n\nNo. 158 - Tommy Badger\nNo. 163 - John Jimmy\nNo. 176 - Vital Nachatis\nNo. 232 - Gustave Gadeis\nNo. 0214 - Caroline Wolf\nNo. 0254 - Madeleine Blackfox\nNo. 0250 - Madeleine Blackman\nNo. 0252 - Esther Grandbeis\nNo. 234 - Pierre Serrepay\n\nPlease advise regarding the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease let me know if Mrs. Pascal's first husband was an Indian or a White man. Since she married Pascal, has she been living the Indian mode of life on a reserve? Where did she and her children reside previous to her marriage to Pascal?\n\nFrom the information given in your letter, it is doubtful if these children can be considered our wards.

Cooke, declare before witnesses and under oath, that we are Roman Catholics by faith and wish to remain in that faith; therefore we want our children be placed in the Catholic School, Onion-Lake Catholic Residential School.\n\nWe declare solemnly also that we are not Anglican, we are Catholics and wish to be recognised as Catholics before the Indian Dept.\n\nTo-day, we are making application for the admission of two of our children to the Catholic Indian Residential School Onion-Lake and expect from the Dept. that the said application be accepted.\n\nDated Jan 31/35\n\nSam Cooke\nMarie Dancer\n\nWitnesses: Jos Lorrain\nRoy Kennedy\n\nCertified copy from the original\nFr. J.E. Pratt o.m.i. Principal\nMarch 8th 1935\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter dated Oct. 21 last hoping that a settlement would be reached in the meantime concerning the Cooke's children to be admitted here at this school.\n\nThese people are Catholics but unfortunately have been for a number of years not faithful Catholics. For over two years they are regular to assist at Mass and come regularly to perform their religious duties as Catholics.\n\nThey have one boy admitted at the Anglican School and for this boy I am not concerned because he is legally admitted there. They have two other children who have been baptised in infancy and not yet been in school. I have made in due form and in good faith their applications for admission and I hear from the Indian Agency that they are refused from Ottawa.\n\nThe young boy Simon has been here three months last year and I had let him go because he was not admitted yet. The mother comes every Sunday with her children to leave them here at the school and always tell her to wait till the question with the Indian Dept be settled. Already four applications have been made and always the same answer not admitted by Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan I am not asking any favor but only justice. These two children are Catholics and their parents are both Catholics and all parties concerned are Catholics. It is only fair and just that the children be given the right to be raised Catholic and receive an instruction in a Catholic school.\n\nI ask you, Dear Mr. Phelan, to consider the question with justice and obtain from the Dept. the permission to take in this school these two children.\n\nTo prove that the parents are sincere I am inclosing a copy of an \"Affidavit given sometimes ago\" which Affidavit was asked for to prove that they are really Catholics and wish to remain and consider always as Catholics.\n\nAs you say in your letter you are ready to give to this case a very careful consideration and be fair to all. It is why I ask you for the sole benefit of the children the permission to admit them here in this school.\n\nI repeat what I have said before in some of my letters to the Dept. I will not try to make any trouble or difficulty to the Dept. but only when a case needs explanation, to take the liberty to lay down openly the facts as truly known to me.\n\nHoping to receive from the Dept. a favorable reply.\n\nI remain Yours very truly\n\nST.

Sam Cook's wife and James Cook's wife are active members of the Women's Auxiliary in connection with the C. of E., and were in attendance at a meeting on the 17th instant. The records show that all the children of Sam Cook's family were baptized by Anglican curates.\n\nThe R. C. records show that Sam Cook and his wife are attending at present and have been for more than a year. Simon Cook, born on August 20th, 1927, was baptized by a Rev. Father on the same date. Sarah Cook, born on December 27th, 1929, was baptized a mother on January 27th, 1930. James Cook and wife were married again by the Rev. Father Pratt on July 3rd, 1934. James Cook's daughter, born March 24th, 1935, was baptized by the Rev. Father Pratt on the same date.\n\nSam Cook and his family have always been recognized as Anglicans. Just over a year ago Sam had a dispute with Rev. Mr. Ellis about some wood that he was delivered at the C. of E. School, although Mr. Ellis had allowed him more wood than he was entitled to; he still requested more and was refused. Immediately after, Sam severed his connection with the Anglican Church. Interviewed personally by me this week, through the interpreter he definitely told me that he was now a Roman Catholic and desired to have his two remaining children educated in the R. C. School. The two children in question are Simon and Sarah. Simon is seven years old and should enter school this year. Sarah is not yet of school age.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 99-19 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the religion of Sam Cook, who has applied for the admission of his two youngest children to the Onion Lake R.

Phelan  \nIndian Dept.  \nOttawa:\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI would like to keep in this school for the next scholar year the following Indian Pupils over 16 years of age, and for the special reasons mentioned:\n\n# 160 Gabriel Lewis 16 only, only starting to make good here, and needs more complete manual training.\n\n# 164 Johnny Badger 16 only, for same reason as #160.\n\n# 188 David John 16, doing very well at the school, needs a more complete manual training, and I intend to start him up good reserve when leaving the school or discharge.\n\n# 216 Edward Cardinal 15 has been at the school only 3 years.\n\n# Louis Harper 15. His father wants his badly to stay at the school. He is doing very good at the school, has strong capacities for mechanic and I give him with the farm training a mechanic training. Like very much to keep him up to 16 as he is well disposed.\n\n# 0164 Eliza *askego* 17. Has been delayed in her manual training through her Grand Father's illness, but is doing very good. She strongly desires to stay one more year with us and also intends to marry before leaving the school.\n\n# 0165 Mary Wolfe 17. Needs a more manual training and also has no proper place to go if leaving the school this coming Summer. She always stays at the school every vacation.\n\n# 0175 Nora Chocan 17. Has no proper home to go she is an adopted child will get married at the school before leaving. She is a very good child and deserves consideration.\n\n# 0177 Josephine Dion 15. Needs a more complete training, has no father or mother but only an aged Grand Mother very old. I desire to keep her here in school up to 16. Needs much supervising and a longer formation.\n\n# 0184 Mary Ann Angue 18, desires to come back, and desires also to get married during the year. She has a good party in sight, an ex pupil from this school, a very good boy but he is not ready to get married. Would like to keep this girl until she gets married. She is very good girl good worker intelligent but has no close relatives and if discharge now will have to go to some far relatives and most probably will lose in a short time all her formation and good qualities acquired during her time at the school. Please grant me the permission to keep her on the roll until she gets married during the year and for the very good of this girl.\n\n# 0191 Mary Ann *askego* 17. For more complete manual formation\n\n# 0223 Isabelle Lepoide 17, has come late at the school, and not very strong she requires a good manual training with a very close mental attention. She has stayed at the school during vacation during the last three years, no mother to look after her.\n\n# 0229 Annie Stick 15, has to go home quite often to look after her sick mother, and by the fact she is late in her studies.\n\n# 0241 Philomene Stanley 17. Having come to school only at 13 she is just starting seriously her manual training which is needed badly.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nDear Mr. Phelan, I hope that you will grant the permission to keep for a further period these children and for the reasons mentioned.\n\nMy intention is to establish the school children when leaving the school both boys and girls and by this to see a practical result of the work of our school.\n\nWith the cooperation of the Indian Dept., the local Indian Agent, or Farmer Instructor we can easily obtain a fair good result. On my part, those to be discharged next year, e.g. the boys, this Summer will break some land on the reserve V.G. 10 acres and next spring the school will be supplied with enough cattle and milk to keep these boys at the Fall will something immediately to pass the Winter and if possible to get married and have immediately a good home. By keeping them away from the old folks they will better keep the good formation received at the school. It is my greatest desire to help the ex pupils and to establish them on the reserve. Also for the girls getting married at the school I give them a stove a table a bed chairs and necessary dishes for a little home. If the children are allowed to go home too soon they look only for fun cause trouble on the reserve because they have nothing to interest them. They go here and there with no definite object. Also the big girls are easy victims if not properly looked after.\n\nHoping Dear Mr. Phelan, that the Dept. is prepared to help in every way to continue the very good work of these Boarding schools and the children will be allowed to stay here at the school as requested and for the reasons mentioned in this letter.\n\nWith sincere thanks\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.B. Revising the Roll and checking the ages of each pupil.\n\nI find that #168 - Gabriel Lewis, #164 - Johnny Badger are really only 15 years old. I have on hand their baptismal and birth certificates. Will the Dept allow me to correct this and have the proper ages put on the Roll.

Furthermore he has been baptised under the name of Henry Half.\n\nThe boy's father died two or three years ago at St. Paul's Hospital, and before dying called for but unfortunately being late in the Fall and the roads being bad I could not answer the call, when I was ready to go he was dead. Perhaps it was to speak to me about his son.\n\nThe boy's mother died this last Spring, leaving this boy without any person reliable to take care of the boy except the aged grandmother. As she is very poor and also unable to support herself she brought the boy to my school and in such a case I could not refuse to turn down her request to take the boy especially knowing that the boy was an illegitimate Indian boy. I still have the boy at the school and I apply to you to have his application accepted by the Dept. and if it is possible to have him registered as a Treaty Indian.\n\nHe has here also another brother, also an illegitimate child and his application has been accepted.\n\nIf I turn down this boy to his grandmother, who is unable to take care of herself, no body practically will look after this boy and sure he will have to go from one place to another without fixed abode.\n\nThis boy practically passed all his life on the Frog Lake Indian Reserve and his mother died there last Spring.\n\nHoping Dear Sir, that you will do your very best to have this application accepted by the Indian Dept., and also to have this boy allowed to be considered as a Treaty Indian.\n\nWith sincere thanks and best wishes\n\nYours very truly\n\nMy best regards to Mrs Gullion, family and friends\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In regard to this case, I might say that Rev., Father Pratt, Principal, called here recently and during the course of our conversation, he mentioned this case and informed me that he had taken the boy in as the child had no home. I had not received any information previous to this regarding this child. As he wished to have the boy admitted to the school, Father Pratt stated that this was one of the items he wished to discuss with me and not having had any previous information, I requested him to write me on his return to the school, setting forth full particulars. He has now written and I am attaching his letter in which he claims that the boy is a child of an Indian Lawrence Half, deceased, and a woman, one Genevieve Patenaude, non-treaty, also deceased. I have no information in the matter other than that contained in Father Pratt's letter. I might mention that Lawrence Half was a member of James Seenum's Band, this agency.

This took place on the fourth instant. Mr. Hill requested that I make the necessary investigation and bring this child back to school.\n2. This same day I patrolled per the above to the Frog Lake Indian reserve, and found the parents of this child. The mother admitted taking the child from school and also gave me anti-discrimination reasons. She had also sent the child away with some other Indians to seek services on the island. I asked the child if I had to travel further into the reserve, where I located another Indian with a suitable house to own from the shore to the island to bring the girl back. This was done and the girl taken into custody by me.\n\nInvestigated by: Mr. J. Hill, M.A., Indian Agent\n\nForwarded O.C. Sub. Dist.: \u2014 Forwarded O.C.

Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nThe Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Oct.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn or about the 16th day of August last, Rickey P. Shiflet from C.M. C. Mission, Onow Lake, called at our tent and asked for my daughter, test and asked for my daughter, Maggie, aged 11 years, to attend the school at that point. She having attended the boarding school here prior to this, and after much persuasion I allowed her to go on approval, meaning that were she lonely and not satisfied I would be permitted to bring her back. After being there about ten days she wrote home asking us...\nCome for her which we did on\nthe 5th morning at the mission at\nabout half past six, when the Chief\nof Chiefs got me talking her\nbut I was sick and went my child.\nNext morning we called upon Dr.\nHill, the Agent, explained our troubles\nand he told us we could take her\nright away. We did so. On Sat-\nurday, the 7th, Capt., the police\ncame up here and took myself,\nmyself and child away to Owen Lake\nwhere we had a trial in the presence\nof Dr. Hill and the police, when he\ngave me eleven dollars and fifty cents\nwhich, if I do not pay them\nwithin 30 days, I am to be sent\nto jail. This fine was imposed for\nmy having taken my child from the\nschool. Dr. Hill explained this to me.\nnot know that she had been enrolled when he told me I could take her home until the Pisher had found that my husband had signed for her to remain in school and he does not understand English and did not know what he signed.\n\nI would like to know why as a parent can't have the handling of my own child and send her to the school where our home is, also why was it not necessary for Pisher to sign for the child. Where and how long I get the money to pay this fine, and if I have to be jailed for this offense, what is to become of my other two children.\n\nPlease advise me at once as to how to pay this fine by the 6th of October.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Pierre Cadaw.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-10, of the 16th instant, with an enclosure from Mrs. Pierre Gadwa, and in reply.\n\nMrs. Gadwa interviewed me on the 5th instant regarding her daughter Margaret whom she said was at the R. C. Indian Residential School \"on probation\". She explained that she had arranged with the Sisters to have the girl remain with them for a week in the school, and if she adapted herself and liked it, she would apply for her admission; if not, the child would be taken back to Frog Lake to attend the day school there. She said she had received a letter from Margaret stating that she did not like the school and wanted to return to Frog Lake, and that she had come for her. I told her I was agreeable providing she had not committed herself further to the Principal of the School, and cautioned her not to remove the girl without his knowledge and permission. She said she would not, but in spite of this she proceeded to the school, and, in the Principal's absence, took her by force from the Sisters and returned to our office on the following day, September 6th. While in the office I looked up the R. C. School file and found that Margaret Gadwa, 9\u00bd years, the girl in question, was officially admitted into the school on authority of the Department's 115-8-10, of July 3rd, as the result of an application signed by the girl's father on June 16th. I then told Mrs. Gadwa she had misrepresented the case to me and that the child would have to be returned at once to the R. C. School. She refused. I tried moral suasion but it was no use. I then warned her that she was committing an indictible offense and that if she returned to Frog Lake with the child that I would send for them both, and would prosecute her. She went back to Frog Lake and I sent the R. C. M. P. for her and Margaret on the 7th. I had Margaret returned to the school and I fined Mrs. Gadwa $2.00 and costs or ten days in jail. It was my intention...\nintention to extend the period for payment of fine and costs if necessary. Mrs. Gadwa is a bad actor generally and was especially defiant on this occasion.

This boy Jos Heathen has been legally and properly admitted.\n\nHis mother for whom I had written Mr. Gullion Indian Agent at Saddle Lake had been united but not married to Lawrence Half from Saddle-Lake Band who died not long ago at St. Paul's Hospital. The mother died some few months ago and the boy being from a Treaty Indian was brought to my school and having nobody to look after him except his aged grandmother. It was impossible for me to refuse the boy and before taking any definite step I consulted our local Indian Agent who advised to take the boy and send a letter to Mr. Gullion \"Indian Agent at Saddle-Lake\" with the proper admission paper.\n\nHoping that this explanation will prove clearly enough the present case and believing that the Dept. will see no difficulty in admitting this young boy \"Really an Indian Boy\" and who has nobody to look after him.\n\nI remain\n\nST.

McGUILE:\n\nWith the return of the attached letter from Bishop Prud'homme re the transfer of the Cook children from the Anglican School to the St. Anthony's School, Onion Lake, Sask., will you kindly furnish draft reply.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nDecember 13, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nI attach, for your signature, a letter to His Lordship Bishop Prud'homme, regarding his request that two children of Sam Cook, an Indian of the Onion Lake Band, be transferred from the Church of England Indian Residential School to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Onion Lake.\n\nFor your information, the facts in connection with this case are: Sam Cook, previous to about 18 months ago, was a member of the Anglican Church. He, himself, is an ex-pupil of the Anglican School. He had a dispute with the Principal of the Anglican School over the delivery of a quantity of wood. In consequence, he left the Anglican Church and has now become a member of the Roman Catholic Church. His two eldest children are at present in the Anglican School, having been placed there at his own request, during the time he was a member of the Anglican Church.\n\nIt is now requested, as Sam Cook has joined the Catholic Church, that his two children be removed from the Anglican School and placed in the Onion Lake Catholic School.\n\nThe Department, in the past, has had similar requests, following a change of religion on the part of a parent. In such cases, it is the practice not to consent to the removal of the child to another school, on any grounds. At present, while Sam Cook is a Roman Catholic,\n\n- there is no\nthere is no guarantee that he may not again return to\nthe Anglican Church; when he would request that his\nchildren be taken out of the Catholic School and placed\nin an Anglican School. Frequent changes of religion\non the part of an Indian have occurred in the past.\n\nYou will see the difficulty occasioned\nif transfers of pupils from one school to another were\nmade. When persistent demand is made on the part of the\nparent or the church authorities, to have a child re-\nmoved from a school, the Department, in such case, grants\nthe discharge and returns the child to the parent but\nrefuses to allow the child's entrance to a school of\nanother religious denomination.\n\nThese religious cases are most difficult\nto decide and have given the Department much concern\nand trouble. When application is made for the admission\nof a child to a school and claim is made by two different\ndenominations, the Department refuses to grant admission\nand the child remains at home. It has been found, in\nmany cases, that when this action is taken, the religious\ndifficulties adjust themselves.\n\nAs requested, I return herewith Bishop\nPrud'homme's letter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 13, 1895.\n\nDear Bishop Prud'homme:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the request for the transfer of the two children of Sam Cook, who are at present in residence at the Church of England Indian Residential School, to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Onion Lake.\n\nIn this connection I am informed that Catherine Cook was admitted to the Church of England School in May, 1930, and Edmund Cook, in February, 1934. At that time the father was a member of the Anglican Church and signed the applications requesting their admission to the Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nSome 18 months ago, the father became a member of the Roman Catholic Church and requested that two younger children be admitted to the Roman Catholic School. The Department ascertained that Sam Cook is now recognized as a Catholic, and, consequently, approval was given for the admission of these two younger children to the Roman Catholic School.\n\nMight I point out that the eldest child has been in the Anglican school for a period of over five years and the second eldest, for approximately two years. It is the practice of the Department, when a child has been admitted to a residential school at the request of a parent, not to transfer such child for religious reasons to a school of another religious denomination.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith submit the attached statement received from Sam Cook who called here on the 7th instant with his wife.\n\nYesterday, (Sunday) immediately after lunch, Sam Cook together with his wife called again and brought Simon their younger son to School. I admitted him, pending the decision of the Department as the application of this boy was duly signed by the father and submitted to the Department last June.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School, that their admission to the R.C. School has been approved by the Department.\n\nWhen Sam was notified he requested that his two children in residence at the C.of E. School be transferred to the R.C. School, as he wanted all his children to be together. I replied to the effect that this could not be done and told him to take Simon to the R.C. School - Sarah will not be seven until late in December, consequently not eligible as a grant earning pupil until January. Instead of doing as I instructed he took Simon to the C.of E. School and left him there.\n\nI am enclosing a statement signed by Sam Cook on the 7th instant, which was forwarded by the Principal of the C.of E. School.

December 13, 1935\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed by the Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of our Onion Lake School, that your Department has authorized the admission of Simon and Sarah Cook, children of Anglican Indian parents, to the Roman Catholic School on the Onion Lake Reserve, and I shall be obliged if you will advise me of any specific reason which prompted you to take this action.\n\nMr. Ellis states that Sam Cook, the father of these children, signed the application for their admission to our Society's school last June. He has also furnished me with a statement signed by this man on the 7th inst., expressing his wish to have his two children enter the Anglican Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. A copy of the statement is enclosed herewith.\n\nFor your further information I am sending you here-with a copy of a statement supplied by the Rev. Principal Ellis, embodying facts relating to the baptism of Sam Cook and his wife Mary and their children, as well as particulars concerning the children who have attended our Society's School and those now in residence.\n\nAs the decision of your Department, if it has been made in the way I have been informed, will be a very definite departure from your official ruling that children of Protestant parents are to be admitted to a school under Protestant auspices, I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with any specific reason for this departure.\nIn the light of the information before me, and embodied in this letter I can only suggest that the application for the admission of the two children in question be reconsidered, and that their admission to our Society's School be immediately authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 3, 1936.\n\nRev.

It is noted that this man now wishes his two children placed in the Onion Lake C. E. School, while only a short time ago he was insisting on their being placed in the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School.\n\nIn view of the conflicting reports that have been received regarding Sam Cook's religion, it has been decided not to approve the admission of these children to any Indian residential school for a few months. You should, therefore, inform the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. School to return Simon Cook to his father at once and no action should be taken towards placing Sarah Cook in any school.\n\nThese children should remain at home for the next few months, and you might again communicate with the Department about the first of April stating what religion Sam Cook and his family are recognized as professing at that time and also under what religious auspices he wishes his two children educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Sharpe,\nChief.\nSt. Anthony's School\nJan. 11-1936\n\nAfter being notified by the Agent Mr. Hill that my children had been admitted to St. Anthony's School, Mr. Ellis, Principal of the R.F. School called to my home saying that he had come for the baby, but I refused to lend him that day. Then he came twice afterwards and my wife said he had a very odd look. Under pressure to cure the evil he told my wife to take the baby to R.F. School which she did. I accompanied her.\n\nMr. Ellis came along with a piece of paper and asked me to sign it but stating what was written on it. On my inquiry for explanation he urged me to sign saying it was nothing now that my children are at the R.F. School. I am determined to leave them there, and in case where I will be obliged to withdraw them they shall never enter another school.\nThe paper I signed was given to Archie Puddy to be taken to the Agency. I ask you as a favor to read the contents of the letter I signed. I now see what a mistake I have made in signing this paper, not knowing how to read nor write. As to my religion I am a Roman Catholic, and will remain so to the end of my days.\n\n[Signature]\n\n1907\nJanuary 14th 1936\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI was very pleased to receive your very kind answer to our Xmas greetings. This letter is a great encouragement to myself, staff and children. Also we appreciate what the Dept. has done during the past year for this school, all these improvements are very valuable to us all, especially the Fire Protection Engine. In the very same building I have transferred the Bakery which was always to me a source of worries for fire. The building in which the Engine rests is practically fire proof. Our local Indian Agent, Dr. Hill has inspected everything and he is very pleased with the work and the Bakery.\n\nFor all this, Dear Mr. Sutherland, accepts my most sincere and heartfelt thanks.\n\nDec. 6th 1936, I received from our local Indian Agency, the following letter:\n\nOnion-Lake Sask.\nDec. 3, 1935\n\nDear Father Pratt,\n\nThe Department has requested me to inform you that the admission of the following children to the Onion-Lake R.C. Indian Residential School is approved:\n\nSimon Cook\nSarah Cook\nTommy Harper\n\nYours very truly,\nJ.T. Hill\nIndian Agent.\n\nNow, Dear Mr. Sutherland, last Saturday, Jan 10th, Dr. Hill, our Agent, came along and told me he had received from you a letter stating that the Cook's Children's admission has been suspended until April, because a contradictory letter from Mr. Cook himself had reached you in the meantime.\n\nAs I have been notified officially of the admission of these children to this R.C. Onion-Lake Residential School and the children having been brought here by their parents themselves and only January the 6th, it is impossible for me to turn them back to their parents after having acted only after an official notification and with no rush. Therefore, Mr. Sutherland, I will wait upon the return of your reply to act.\n\nAs soon as Dr. Hill, notified me of your last letter concerning these children, I called in their parents, and told them what news has been received from Ottawa, and also about their supposed letter written by them. The answer is their own letter which I inclose and I say that no pressure has been made to induce them to tell what it is in their letter. More than that, I had an Indian to take their statement in written and after being written was read to them and they explicitly said it was according to the true facts.\n\nThe principal of the other Residential School knew perfectly well that these children had been officially admitted here, why did he go and induce the parents to act the way they did?\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 1)\nDear Mr. Sutherland, I have accepted the Cook's children only after they had been officially admitted by your Dept., and over a month after the official notification.\n\nI cannot be blamed to induce the parents to have their children here or even to have acted rushly.\n\nI have tried to submit myself to the limit of the Dept. wishes and now as everything seemed settled for good comes this bad news.\n\nWhat shall I do? As the children are and brought here in good faith and after being admitted officially, it is pretty hard for me to let the children go. This case had given enough trouble for the past year I thought it was all over.\n\nThe letter enclosed speaks by itself?\n\nI am, for nothing, himself had an Indian to write it and had the same letter read and explained to him.\n\nDr. Hill, our Indian Agent has certainly observed a very strict neutrality in this present case, and his views met the approbation of the Indians of this Reserve.\n\nHoping Dear Mr. Sutherland that this letter will receive your most kind and favorable consideration\n\nWith my sincere thanks for all you have done for this school and which we appreciate very greatly and with the hope that the present letter will bring a definite solution according to justice.\n\nI remain Yours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nI know the two Cooks, \"Father\" and \"Mother\", that I make no special provision for help, but only they will get their share like the other Indians of the Reserve, 13 days x 2 meals, & Meat\u2014\n\nand this was said plainly before witnesses\u2014\n\nI could not ever meet family than this,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, January 29, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with further reference to the Cook children.\n\nThe reason for the Department informing Mr. Agent Hill that these children were not to be placed in any school for some time was that, on December 7th, Cook had forwarded a statement expressing his desire to have his children placed in the Onion Lake C. E. School, although he had previously requested that they be placed in the Onion Lake R. C. School. He was changing his mind so often that it was difficult for the Department to decide what really was his religion and in which school he really wished the children placed. It now appears from his letter of the 11th instant, which you forwarded, that he has definitely decided that he wishes the children placed in the Onion Lake R. C. School and it is noted, also, that he states he is a Roman Catholic.\n\nThe information contained in your letter and in that of Cook is being forwarded to Mr. Agent Hill.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Indian Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nOttawa, January 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 3rd instant and previous correspondence, with reference to the request of Sam Cook for the admission of his children to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of the 10th ultimo, you stated that Sam Cook had placed his son, Simon, in the Church of England School. You also forwarded a statement from Sam Cook to the effect that he wishes his children placed in the Onion Lake C. E. School.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. School, dated the 14th instant, in which he states that Sam Cook recently brought his two children and left them at the Onion Lake R. C. School. I enclose, for your information, copies of letters recently forwarded to the Department.\n\nFrom the last letter received from Cook and the further fact that he has now taken the children to the Onion Lake R. C. School, it would appear that it is his desire to have them educated in that school. However, I would appreciate hearing from you whether or not you believe this matter can now be considered settled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Dec. 13th last, I furnished you with information that I had received from the Rev. Principal Ellis of our Onion Lake School, that your Department had authorized the admission of Simon and Sarah Cook, children of Anglican Indian parents, to the Roman Catholic School on the Onion Lake Reserve.\n\nIn your reply on the 3rd instant, number 115-8-10, you stated that, conflicting reports having been received with reference to the religion of the Father (Sam Cook), it had been decided not to admit his two children to any Indian Residential School during the next few months.\n\nIn a further letter received from the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's School, and dated Jan. 24th, he informs me that your ruling in this particular case is not being respected; that he had been informed, and that he had investigated the matter, and found it to be true that both Simon and Sarah Cook have already been admitted to, and were, at the time he wrote his letter, in residence at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic School.\n\nAs two other children of the man, Sam Cook, are in residence in our Society's School, namely, Katherine, admitted in May, 1930, and Edwin, admitted Jan. 1934, it will be appreciated if you will inform me of the source of the conflicting reports you have received with reference to the religion of this man at the present time. It will also be appreciated if your Department will take such steps as you may deem\nadvisable to see that your ruling, as set forth in your letter of the 3rd instant, is carried out. As you state that your representative, the local Indian Agent, Mr. Hill, was informed of the ruling, I am quite at a loss to understand how it could be disregarded. As it seems to me that such action, if allowed to pass without question, may have serious consequences, I beg to recommend that you request your representative to furnish a full explanation in connexion with the same. So far as I learn from the information I have received to date the Roman Catholic Church has no claim whatever on the Indian Sam Cook and his children, so I feel that it would be only fair to our Church to have the two children in question, namely Simon and Sarah Cook, transferred immediately to our Society's School.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Simon and Sarah Cook, children of Sam Cook, on the Onion Lake Reserve, Sask. I have been informed by the Principal of our Onion Lake School, that these children, despite the decision set forth in your letter of January 3rd, mentioned above, are still in residence in the Roman Catholic School on the Onion Lake Reserve. If the information I have received is founded on fact, and I haven't the slightest reason to doubt it, it would appear that your decision is being ignored.\n\nFrom the information set forth in my letters mentioned above, I am unable to see that the Roman Catholic Church has any claim whatever on the children in question, and it will be appreciated if you will advise me of any information you may have received which alters the situation as set forth in those communications.\n\nWith regard to the declaration of Sam Cook, the father of the children in question, made on December 7th, 1935, and forwarded to you with my letter of December 13th last, the Principal of our Onion Lake School, has written to me as follows:\n\n\"When Sam and his wife called at the School last December on a Saturday morning, he stated to me voluntarily, that he wanted his boy to come to our School and the girl next year; also, that he did not want his children to be separated, seeing that two of his children were now in residence here. I called in Ida Vandall, a grade nine pupil, who...\"\nwas in the next room practising on the piano. I then took down his declaration, which Ida read over to him and he signed it in her presence. I sent a copy to you and the other I gave to the Indian Agent who sent it to the Department.\"\n\nThe Reverend Principal also furnishes the following information bearing on this case:\n\n\"Sam Cook has been Baptized, confirmed and married in the Anglican Faith.\n\nMary, his wife has been baptized in our Church.\n\nAll their children of school age have received their tuition under Anglican auspices.\n\nSix of their children are buried in our cemetery.\n\nNone have ever entered the R.C. School before.\"\n\nFrom the above information you will understand the difficulty confronting our Society in allowing this case to stand where it does at present.\n\nIn your letter of February 5th you kindly furnished me with a copy of a letter dated January 13th, 1936, and signed P. Harper, Chief. This Indian is known to me personally, and as the Principal of our Onion Lake School states that the Chief is supposed to have written his letter at the R.C. School and it was addressed to the Department from there. The Indian Agent had no knowledge of it, I am quite unable to attach any importance to it, and wish that the voluntary declaration made by the Indian father on December 7th last should be accepted as expressing his sincere desire to have his children Simon and Sarah admitted to our Society's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ellis does not speak the Cree language but he produced the interpreter who officiated at this meeting with Sam. She is Ida Vandal, a Grade 9 pupil in residence at the C. of E. School. She states positively that Sam requested Mr. Ellis to take Simon and Sarah into his school, and she confirmed everything in the statement that Sam had signed which was forwarded to the Department with my letter of December 10th. I am satisfied that this girl was telling the truth. I am quite sure that the Reverend Father Pratt has not tried to influence the Cooks. Sam Cook who had always sent his children to the C. of E. School, when he was apparently satisfied with the treatment they were getting, had a dispute with Mr. Ellis about two years ago over some cord work he was supplying to the school, and immediately after he changed his religion and requested the Reverend Father Pratt to accept his children as pupils. I confronted Sam today regarding his signed statement and he told me he wouldn't talk about it. He reiterated that he was a Roman Catholic and wanted his children to attend that school. I have found him to be unreliable and vacillating. My own opinion, which was confirmed by Chief Harper today, is that Sam is a Pagan and has no religious convictions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

Despite the information you have quoted from the Indian Agent's letter that the father had changed his religion on account of a dispute which he had with the Principal of our Society's School over some cord wood he was supplying to the School, the Rev. Principal Ellis affirms that this Indian is not a Roman Catholic, and I support this affirmation. I would remind you that on the 7th of December last Sam Cook made a statement which was forwarded to you with my letter of Dec. 13th and in which he stated that it was his express wish to have his two children admitted to our Society's School at Onion Lake. In your letter of Jan. 3rd, No. 115-8-10, you inform me it had been decided not to admit these two children to any Indian Residential School during the next few months. As the children were admitted to the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake and are still, according to the information I have, in residence at that School, it seems to be quite clear that your decision has not been respected. So far as our Society is concerned the information set forth in my letter to you on March 2nd last, furnishes convincing proof that this Indian is a member of the Anglican Church, and it will be a matter of very keen regret to us if their admission to any Roman School is authorized by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the children of Sam Cook. I note that you have information stating that these children are in the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. If so, no grant is being allowed for them.\n\nIn view of the report received from the Indian Agent and forwarded to you in official letter of March 20th, the Department is not yet prepared to make a final decision regarding the religious auspices under which these children should be educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note that the Department requests you to see Cook. It is not necessary for you to consult anyone else. We want to know the father's wishes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nHarold H. Mitchell, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nAlberta, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI bring a lonely Indian but married\nto a half-breed and residing on the Frog Lake\nReserve, and writing to obtain permission to\nplace my four boys in the St. Anthony's\nSchool at Brant Lake as we are seven\nmiles distant from the day school which\nis too far for them to walk. Their respective\nages are 14, 11, 8 and 6 years. My husband\nis an old man, and being in the present\nhard times, is unable to support his\nfamily of ten persons, eight being children.\nI wrote to the Rev. J.E. Pratt, O.M.I., and he\nsaid he could not take them without your\nconsent, but would be willing to send them\nwhen permission is given. I kindly advise me if I\ncan send this letter and stage. Yours truly, Mrs. A. Collins.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Collins with reference to the admission of her children to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease report fully regarding this woman's letter, stating whether or not her children come within the ruling of the Department regarding the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nENG.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nI, the undersigned, wish my children a boy and a girl who attended the Anglican School to be transferred to the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake.\n\nI wish more than ever to have them raised and taught in the religion I follow which is the Roman Catholic.\n\nI have already placed the two younger ones in this R.C. School and want them to remain until I hope to be discharged.\n\nI would greatly appreciate if you would grant the transfer of the two to R.C. School.\n\nHoping this letter will receive prompt attention.\n\nSigned\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nPer A. Cardinal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-10, of the 14th instant, with reference to Sam Cook and his two children, Simon and Sarah.\n\nI interviewed Sam today and he stated positively that he desired his children to be educated in the R.C. Indian Residential School, Onion Lake.\n\nHe also expressed a wish to have the two in residence in the C. of E. School transferred to the R.C. School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School that the admission of Simon and Sarah Cook is approved.\n\nThe two children of Sam Cook who are at present in the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School were regularly admitted when the father, Sam Cook, was recognized as a member of the Church of England. When a pupil has been regularly admitted to a residential school it has not been the practice of the Department to transfer such children to another residential school conducted under different religious auspices. You should, therefore, inform Cook that the Department is not prepared to transfer his two children at present in the Onion Lake C. E. School to the Onion Lake R. C. School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 25th, last, the Department has received another report from the Indian Agent at Onion Lake. He again interviewed Sam Cook who stated positively that he desires his two children, Simon and Sarah Cook, to be educated in the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School. The Department has also been informed that Cook has been recognized as a Roman Catholic for the past two years.\n\nIt has, therefore, been decided to approve the admission of Simon and Sarah Cook to the Onion Lake R.

I have spoken to our local Indian Agent before writing this letter and again I read it to him after and he strongly approves all what I have said about each case.\n\nI do my very best to help all the Ex-Pupils and I try also to marry them as soon as they leave school especially the girls and this to keep them away from the habit of the old folke. In every case when a big girl from the school marries here I do my share to help her by buying what is necessary to start home.\n\nTherefore I will be pleased and will appreciate very sincerely if all those whom I apply to keep will be granted.\n\nUnclese to say that you are always welcome here in our school and I will be glad that you see by yourself the work done in behalf of the Indian children of the surrounding Indian Reserves.\n\nWith the hope of receiving a favorable reply\n\nI am Yours very truly\n\nST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMy very best regards to Dr. McGill\nCOPY SENT TO DR. HILL.\n\nOttawa, June 22, 1936.\n\nRev.

It is noted that you expect all three will be married shortly.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Indian Agent, and, in future, the Department would appreciate if you would forward your recommendations regarding pupils through Dr. Hill's office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake Indian Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-10, of the 18th ultimo, with reference to the admission of Mrs. A. Collin's children to the R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note by the last returns that there are 153 enrolled at this school while its capacity is but 120. The Collins children are breeds as stated, their mother being a treaty Indian. At present there are 15 breeds enrolled and in residence at the R. C. School. The Collins family have been living for some months on the Frog Lake reserve, but are really trespassers, and are sending their children to the Indian Day School there, where they are the envy of the Indian children owing to their good wearing apparel, having been outfitted by the Alberta Government.\n\nThese people are provincial charges and are getting relief from the province. They have no fixed abode, simply transients. The Frog Lake Indians have requested me to have the Collins removed from their reserve. If the present rate of breed admission to this school continues it will only be a matter of time before the Indian children will be crowded out.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nWe are telling you what Father Pratt said when he tried to get our kids to his school. It was a very cold day last winter when Father Pratt said to us to send a letter to Ottawa. He told us to write our names and say we are Roman Catholics. That time this old man got frozen so we went on foot. It is the Justin St. Raphael that wrote all the false letters to Ottawa. We did not willingly put those children in that school. They forced us to put them there. They said if you put these two right now it will be easy to get the others. And those things he said did not come true. I'll say he's a hypocrite the priest. About five times he said the letters away. And if you can get those children I will be glad. But I don't want the little girl to go there right now just the boy but she will go late in the spring. Try all you can. And when you send a letter to Ottawa tell them the Father Pratt told us today we are...\nSilver-haired Sweetheart\n\nI'm writing this letter dear mother of mine\nI long for you sweetheart for mother\nThese long weary days that I had been away\nI'm so blue and lonely and if it were I'd say.\n\nLittle silver-haired sweetheart\nI'm calling to you\nMy little silver-haired sweetheart\nYour words were so through\nWhen I was a baby\nAnd held on your knees\nYou taught me all the pleasures\nThat first for me\nOur first will be brighter other\nAnd since away\nWhen grey dawn is breaking\nI'll be by my way.\nKeep a light at shining\nAnd it shines through the pain\nLittle silver-haired Sweetheart\nSweet Mother of mine.\nPlease kindly let my children come home, I'm not satisfied the way Sister Wilkie said to me. She gave me a good scolding last Thursday on account of me telling the Agent about the girl's shoes which were no good. That's why she started to scold. She told me she didn't want my children to go back to school. And you wanted them to go there and that's all your fault. I told her that she should give the little girl a sweater. And she told me that I wanted my children to be treated like princesses in school when they're in school. She told me to go to hell, that nobody's fault if you go to hell. I've talked to you like this on purpose. This is what the sister said to me. I never thought she should say such things to me.\nI cannot understand what Roman Catholic Church is and I was never a Roman Catholic. I want all my children to be all in Anglican School. I don't want them to be in two schools. Rev. Father Pratt said he would get all my children in his school but he can't also he promised to help me. He told me lie and I am not glad at all. I want them to be all in the same school.\n\nSam Cook\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRev Mr Ellis,\n\nI want you to send a letter to Ottawa right away that I want all my children to be here all in the same school. Father Pratt said he could get all those children in his school and he cannot do it, but you try. I don't want to walk to two schools. I am tired walking to the both schools. Tell these news to Ottawa.\n\nMrs Mary Cook\n\nSeptember 25, 1936\nSt. Barnabas' School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n25th September 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Res. School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish you to refer to the Department's letter No. 115-8-10, dated the 3rd of June regarding their decision of the two Cook children.\n\nThe parents brought these two children here yesterday morning and asked me (before a witness) to have them admitted into our school, stating that they wanted them to be with Edwin and Katherine, their brother and sister who are in residence here.\n\nI refused to admit them, chiefly because of the letter above, stating that Sam had informed the Department through the Indian Agent that he was a Roman Catholic. He said that he was not, and could never be. I, therefore, advised him to tell the Department so, through the Indian Agent, but he stated he was afraid that the Indian Agent would not do it.\n\nI then left for Lloydminster to get some engine repairs from the railway station. When I arrived back that evening, the two letters attached were left for me at the house.\n\nUnder the following dates - 24th Jan., 3rd and 30th of March last letters of protest regarding their admittance into the R.C. School were sent to you.\n\nOn the 4th and 9th of December last, letters and statements were sent to prove without a shadow of doubt that the Cooks have and were always recognised as Anglicans. As recently as 6th April last I was called upon to bury a granddaughter of the Cooks.\n\nMr. Craven of Turtleford baptized a Cook child less than a month ago, on the Thunderchild's Reserve where the Cooks were visiting.\n\nIn view of the letters received, I would ask that the whole question be considered again by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Henry Ellis. Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe children of Sam and Mary Cook, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of March 2nd last, and your reply to the same on March 10th, March 20th, May 14th, and June 3rd, all numbered 115-8-10, re the above, I beg to state that I have received the enclosed communications in this connection, and desire to endorse the request made by the Rev. Principal Ellis in the closing part of his letter of Sept. 28th, copy of which is forwarded herewith. As you will have on file the affidavit made by Sam Cook on Dec. 7th, 1935, forwarded to you with my letter of Dec. 13th, 1936; and as you will also have on file my letter of Jan. 29th, 1936, in addition to those of March 2nd, 1936, and April 25th, 1936, all dealing with this question, you will be able to understand why I consider it but fair and just to our Society, and to the management of our Society's school at Onion Lake, that this question should receive your further consideration, and that the earnest request of the parents as set forth in the statements enclosed herewith that their two children be admitted to our Onion Lake School be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclos.\n\nTBRW/JO\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 1)\nOttawa, November 10th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., in which he enclosed copy of a letter, dated September 25th, 1936, from Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C.H. Indian Residential School, with regard to the two Cook children. The letter from Mr. Ellis reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The parents brought these two children here yesterday morning and asked me (before a witness) to have them admitted into our school, stating that they wanted them to be with Edwin and Katherine, their brother and sister, who are in residence here.\n\n\"I refused to admit them, chiefly because of the letter above, stating that Sam had informed the Department through the Indian Agent that he was a Roman Catholic. He said that he could not and could never be. I, therefore, advised him to tell the Department so through the Indian Agent, but he stated he was afraid that the Indian Agent would not do it.\"\n\nIt is presumed that the letter refers to Simon and Sarah Cook, whose admission to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School was approved by official letter of June 3rd last. In consideration of quarterly return of the Onion Lake R.C. School, it is noted that the Principal requested and received grant for each of these children for the full September quarter. It is, therefore, understood that they were present in that school during that quarter. Under these circumstances, the Department cannot understand the statement made in Reverend Mr. Ellis' letter that the parents brought the two children to the Onion Lake C.H. School on September 24th.\n\nPlease let me have an immediate report regarding these children, stating whether or not they are, at present, in the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is very poor and I am aware of his condition, for having employed him here at Mission Goff, commonly known as Cold Lake Indian Reserve, and for having visited him often.\n\nHe is married to a full-blooded Montagnaise Indian. He has 11 children, 10 of whom are living at home. All have been born on Cold Lake Indian Reserve, and until the last few years, lived on the Reserve when he bought a patented homestead out of his hard work. However, even with his homestead, which is only a quarter of a mile square, he has to work outside to try and get a living for his family. He has not been able to do so, and this is why I hired him to help him. He is on relief, and even with his relief, he has not enough to provide clothing for his family and he has to seek Government assistance.\n\nThe purpose of my letter is as follows: He intends sending at least four of his children to the Indian School of Lac d'Oignon, St. Anthony's School, Onion Lake, Via Hoydminster, Sask., as none of his children have received any education. He cannot afford to pay school taxes. The school nearest to his home is 5\u00bd miles and, naturally, much too far for the children to attend. Besides, as all those children were born on the Reserve and have lived almost all their lives on the Reserve and have been brought up as Indians and are without education, there is no reason why they should be refused. The Bonnyville police, at my request, is supposed to have sent a strong recommendation on my behalf to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa and in Saskatchewan. As we have not received any reply from either Government, I write to you directly asking you to admit to the Catholic school of St. Anthony, Lac d'Oignon, as they are Catholics. We have no reason to refuse them since they have a right to receive some education like the others and cannot go anywhere else.\nIf you wish to admit them to the school you can do it, if you do not want to, this is another thing, and they shall remain without education. I am asking you to accept them as soon as possible. In any event, I ask for an immediate reply advising me of their admission. I ask for such reply because I know you to be in a position to give it to me. You will find below the names and dates of birth of these four children whom I am recommending to be admitted to St. Anthony's School, Onion Lake, via Hoydminster, Sask.\n\nAlice Paquette, April 10, 1924,\nCharles, Jan. 6, 1926,\nBertha, August 15, 1928,\nMarie Albertine, May 10, 1930.\n\nIn the hope that I shall receive an immediate reply, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Thomas Pelletier, missionary,\nGoff, Alberta.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the children of Mr. Arthur Paquette.\n\nMr. Paquette's case is, no doubt, a very deserving one but, at the same time, I would point out that his children cannot be considered wards of this Department. Under these circumstances, we are not prepared to approve their admission to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIf Mr. Paquette is unable to provide the necessary funds for the education of his children, responsibility for their education would appear to rest with the provincial authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRev. Thomas Pelletier,\nMissionary,\nLe Goff, Alta.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA letter was recently received from Rev. Thomas Pelletier, missionary, Le Goff, Alta., requesting the admission of four children of Arthur Paquette, of Grand Centre, Cold Lake, Alta., to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of our reply to Reverend Father Pelletier, and you should convey the contents of this letter to the Principal of the Onion Lake R.

Indian Residential School. Inquiry showed that older children of this man had been educated in the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School. At the time he applied for the admission of the two children to the Onion Lake R.C. School, Cook claimed to be a member of the Roman Catholic Church. There was considerable correspondence with Mr. Agent Hill and it was not until June, 1936, that the Department decided to accede to Cook's wishes and approve the admission of his two children to the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nLast Fall, during the absence of the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School, the mother went to the school and was allowed to take the two children out for the day. She took them to the Onion Lake C.E. School and told the Principal of that school that she wanted them educated there. He communicated with Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., who has written to the Department urging that the children be taken out of the Onion Lake R.C. School and placed in the Onion Lake C.E. School. This is another case of disagreement regarding the religious auspices under which these children should be educated. A similar case is being brought to your attention in another letter and a brief outline has been given regarding the information that has to be obtained and the facts that have to be kept in mind before a definite decision can be given.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Onion Lake Agency, the Department wishes you to interview all parties concerned and report fully whatever information you obtain, in order to assist us in making a final decision regarding the school in which the Cook children should be educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, SASK.\nMarch 31st 1937\n\nDear [Name],\n\nPlease request the Dept to have the following children discharged:\n\n179 ---- Joseph Janvier ....

Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRef.#115-8-10-Sam Cook's children\nOnion Lake School\n\nI interviewed Dan Vanesse, interpreter, Onion Lake Agency; Dr. Hill, Agent; Mr. and Mrs. S. Cook and Mrs. Fox with reference to the above matter.\n\nThe interpreter stated that the reason Cook applied to have his children educated in the Roman Catholic school was that his, Cook's, wife was a Roman Catholic and that Cook had been a Roman Catholic until about 1900 when Mr. Matheson went to Onion Lake. At that time Cook, along with other Indians, went over to the Church of England.\n\nHe said that Cook remained with the Church of England and his family were educated in that school until 1935 when he returned to the Roman Catholic church and wanted to have his children educated in that church. At that time there were two of his children in the Church of England school.\n\nVanesse stated that Mrs. Cook had always been a Roman Catholic although she like others had joined the Church of England auxiliary, that Cook did not wish to return to the Roman Catholic church until he had a violent quarrel with Mr. Ellis, principal of the Church of England school about wood, at which time he took his bible back to Ellis and told him that he did not wish to have anything more to do with him.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMr. Cook stated that he wants to stay with the Church of England now but that the other church is bothering him a lot. He said the reason he left the Church of England was that Mr. Ellis used to send the police for his children which he did not like. He states that he wants his children educated in the Church of England school as he and his wife intend to stay with that church and that he wants them all together. He at the same time stated that one of his reasons for wanting the children taken out of the Roman Catholic church was because his wife had had a quarrel with one of the sisters.\n\nMrs. Cook stated that she is now a member of the Church of England that she took communion with the Church of England at Onion Lake last fall at confirmation service. This was confirmed by both Dr. Hill and Mrs. Fox. She also stated that she intends to stay with the Church of England and wants the children educated there.\n\nDr. Hill confirms the statements made by Vanesse that prior to 1900 Cook was a Catholic, went over with others to the Church of England when Mr. Matheson came to Onion Lake and remained with the Church of England until he had the quarrel with Mr. Ellis when he again returned to the Roman Catholic church but is now attending the Church of England. He also confirms Mrs. Cook's statement that she, Mrs. Cook, took communion with the Church of England last fall. Dr. Hill at the same time points out that Cook in 1935 was just as positive that he would remain with the Roman Catholic as he is today that he will remain with the Church of England. The doctor also states that there was no attempt made to have the children removed from the Roman Catholic school until Mrs. Cook had the quarrel with one of the sisters and the principal.\n\nThis is in my opinion not a case of any deep religious convictions. I do not believe that it actually means anything to either Mr. or Mrs. Cook as to which school their children are educated in, except that they object having their children in a school with which they happen to be at odds at the time.\n\nCook places two of his children in the Church of England school, he then decided to go back to the Roman Catholic and placed two others there. Today he decides to go back to the Church of England and wants his children educated there. Tomorrow what?\n\nIt...........\nIt appears to me that not religious convictions but petty quarrels and over zeal, not in the interest of christianity but of denominationalism on the part of the churches has drawn the Department into a quarrel in which we should not be involved, and that the interests of all would be best served by leaving matters as they are, two children in the Church of England school and two children in the Roman Catholic school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nBattleford, Sask.\nNovember 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of St. Anthony's R.C. Boarding School at Union Lake reports that Isabel Child, of Thunderchild Band who was admitted in the regular manner some years ago, has not returned since the summer vacation. I took the matter up with Mr. Cockburn asking that she return, and he reports as follows:\n\n\"This girl is a daughter of Alex. Tswekenew and has been attending the day school regularly since it opened this summer. They have a little boy going to school and they keep the girl to take the boy along and attend school together.\"\n\nI wish you would give me your ruling when such cases arise when a child is admitted into a Boarding School if the parents can take said child out whenever they feel like it. By having a definite ruling I would then be in a position to advise principals accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.J. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Macdonald re Mabel Child.\n\nMr. Cockburn, Farming Instructor, reports that this girl is attending school regularly and that she has been kept at home in order that she might accompany the little boy to day school.\n\nI would judge from this that they consider the boy too young to go alone and if the girl was not there the boy would also be sent to residential school.\n\nIt would appear to me that Mr. Macdonald in asking a definite ruling covering all such cases is not giving much consideration to the wishes of the parents or the expenditure of the Department. In cases where there are no day schools and the child is not being educated I do not think there should be any hesitation about insisting the child go to residential school, where there is a day school and the parents wish to send the child there, I believe they should be given sympathetic consideration.\n\nIn the present case this girl is attending day school and receiving her education at one-third of the cost to the Department, and personally I believe she should be left there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nYour file 302-11 ARG\n\nOttawa, December 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 26, enclosing letter received from Indian Agent Macdonald regarding Mabel Child. You should make further enquiries and ascertain if it is necessary to have the girl accompany her younger brother to the day school. If so, she may remain at home and you can inform the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School that her discharge is approved.\n\nCases such as this have to be considered on their own individual merits. You should inform Indian Agent Macdonald that the Department is not prepared to give any special ruling as, strictly speaking, children should not be discharged from residential schools without first receiving our approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThos. Robertson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-S-10, of the 10th ultimo, with reference to Edward Saloy.\n\nEdward's father was a French half-breed who was living in the vicinity of Le Goff, Alberta, at the time of his death.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

It is also noted that the boy for the past two years has been living the Indian mode of life on the Reserve.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it has been decided to approve his admission to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, provided he is in good health. The necessary application form and certificate of health should be forwarded for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDecember 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Robertson's report regarding his recent visit to the Onion Lake Indian Agency, at which time he made enquiries regarding the religious auspices under which Sam Cook's children should be educated.\n\nAt the present time, the Department understands that two of this man's children are in the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School and two of them in the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. We further understand that both this man and his wife now state definitely that they are members of the Church of England.\n\nIt has been decided that the two children at present in the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School should continue there.\n\nAs regards the two children in the Onion Lake R.C. School, they should be returned to their parents at the earliest possible date and you should so inform the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nNext July you should write the Department, stating if Cook is still recognized as a member of the Church of England and, if so, we will be prepared to approve the admission of......\nadmission of the children to the Onion Lake Church of England School for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Residential School, providing they are in good health. The necessary forms should be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nIn official letter of December 17, 1937, you were instructed to have the above mentioned two children returned to their parents from the Onion Lake R.C. School. Apparently this was done, because no grant has been requested at the Onion Lake R. C. School since that time. However, it is noted that they are still carrying the names of these children on the Return as Simon Cook, No. 272, and Sarah Cook, No. 0292. The names of both these children should not appear on the future Returns of the Onion Lake R. C. School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nJ. T.

He further points out that\nas the father \"was ill suffering with heart trouble\nand the mother was not capable of looking after the\nchild\", the father was anxious that this boy should\nbe placed in our Society's School with his two brothers.\nThe local Indian Agent thought that the boy was too\nyoung for admission to any School, but subsequently\nhe allowed him to be placed, for the time being, in\nthe Roman Catholic School, but informed the Principal\nof our Society's School \"that he would not sign the\napplication when presented by the Roman Catholic\nSchool authorities. Application has now been presented\nto Ottawa and I wish to protest the lad's admission\ninto the Roman Catholic School\".\n\nAs the Principal states that the Indian\nAgent informed him at the time this boy was admitted\nto the Roman Catholic School that he would see that he\nwas, in due course, returned to his home, no protest\nwas lodged with your Branch of Government at that time.\nAs an official application for his admission on a grant-\nearning basis to the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nnow appears to have been forwarded to your Department I am writing for the specific purpose of requesting that the protest of the Principal of our School be sympathetically considered, and that this boy be transferred to our School where he rightly belongs. In support of this request I desire to lay before you the following copy of a letter which the Principal of our Society's School addressed to the local Indian Agent on Feb. 29th, 1936:\n\n\"Dr. J.T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have to protest against Joseph Lloyd Dillon, a child of the Anglican faith, age four years, the son of Douglas and Margaret Dillon, being admitted into the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake. You will recall that the father was anxious to have this boy in our school about three months ago, to be with his two brothers. Because of this, I advised Douglas to take this matter up with you. You will also remember, that I also spoke to you and suggested that the boy could be taken into our school as a supernumerary pupil, but this suggestion did not meet with your approval on account of the tender age of the boy. As it is now the intention of the Roman Catholic authorities here to keep this boy in their school for three years, before making an official application, I have to protest against the boy being in residence at that institution. Should it be found that the boy is being neglected, then I beg to suggest that he be placed in the school where he rightly belongs with his two brothers. ........\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Henry Ellis\n\nPrincipal.\"\n\nAs a very definite ruling has been laid down in the Indian Act with regard to the admission of Protestant Indian children to Protestant Schools and of Roman Catholic Indian children to Roman Catholic Schools, it is quite clear to me and to our Commission that endless confusion and discord can only be\navoided through the most careful observation on the part of all Indian Agents of that ruling.\n\nIn the case in question it seems quite clear from the information set forth in the letter of our Principal to the local Indian Agent, quoted above, that the boy should never have been admitted to the Roman Catholic School, and as a matter of common justice I beg to request that his immediate transfer to our Society's School be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/XH\nOttawa, October 20th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to a request that you have received for the admission of Lloyd Dillon to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that this boy is only four years of age and, under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to approve his admission to any Indian residential school at the present time. If he is at present in the Onion Lake R.C. School, you should arrange with the Principal to have him returned to his parents immediately.\n\nPlease let me know when these instructions have been carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, October 20th, 1938.\n\nReverend Sirs:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, protesting against the proposed admission of Joseph Lloyd Dillon to the Onion Lake R.C.

On this date Dr. J.T. Hill, Indian Agent, Onion Lake Agency, informed me that three Indian boys, viz.

As these boys had run away on previous occasion and had been returned by the school authorities were of the opinion they would experience greater difficulty in finding them on this occasion, I was requested by Dr. HILL that I make arrangements to accompany one of the school employees on the following day to Frog Lake and Long Lake and bring these boys back.

You might communicate with this office regarding this boy in about 6 months time and at that time you should state in what school the father wishes him to be placed.\n\nAs you are aware from the contents of the circular letter forwarded to you some months ago the Department is averse to admitting halfbreed children to Indian residential schools. In the case of Joseph Peepeekoot it is noted that he was taken at birth by Chief Peepeekoot and it would, therefore, appear that the latter has adopted the boy. Under these circumstances it has been decided to approve the boy's admission to the Onion Lake R.C. school. However, it is felt that consideration should be given to having him admitted as a member of the Band. Such recommendation, of course, must be the subject of a separate communication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to ask the transfer of Charlie Paul from the Blue Quill school, St Paul, Alta., to the St Anthony school, Onion Lake.\n\nHis Guardians being closer to Onion Lake have asked this transfer. I wrote to the Principal of Blue Quill school, who is in favor of it too, on account of the difficulty of getting back the boy home after vacation.\n\nHope you will favourably grant my request.\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSt. Anthony School, November 8, 1936.\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith a letter from the Reverend Father Pascal, Principal of St. Anthony's school, Onion Lake, in which he requests the transfer of Charlie Paul from the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school to St. Anthony's school at Onion Lake.\n\nI interviewed Reverend Father Balter at the Blue Quill's school regarding the matter and he is agreeable to the transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gallion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn October 15th, 1938, I wrote to the Secretary of your Branch of Government regarding the Anglican Indian boy Joseph Lloyd Dillon, who had been admitted to the Roman Catholic School on the Onion Lake Reserve, and requested that he be transferred to our Society's School on the same Reserve.\n\nIn your reply on Oct. 20th, 1938, No. 115-8-10, you stated that you had advised the Indian Agent that you were not prepared to approve the admission of this boy to any Indian Residential School at that time, as he was only four years of age.\n\nI have just received a letter from the Principal of our Onion Lake School, written on the 11th instant, in which he states that this Indian boy is still in the Roman Catholic School, and that any instructions you may have issued to the local Indian Agent regarding his return to his home have not been carried out.\n\nAs there does not appear to be any doubt whatever about the parents of this child being Anglican, and seeing that his two brothers are in our Society's School, (Miles being admitted in January, 1933, and John in December, 1934) I trust that, in fairness to our Society, the boy Joseph Lloyd Dillon may now be placed there also.\nIn previous communications I have endeavoured to point out the disadvantage at which our Society is placed in its Indian educational work, especially in the northern part of the province of Saskatchewan, through the lack of adequate number of residential school buildings. That disadvantage is still very keenly felt by our Commission and the members cannot but view with very serious concern any flagrant violation of the Indian Act as in the case of the Indian boy mentioned above and the apparent failure of your local representative to carry out your instructions concerning him.\n\nI would respectfully ask, therefore, that prompt and decisive steps be taken to have this boy removed from the Roman Catholic School and transferred to our Society's School, where he rightly belongs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTHRW/KH\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo the Department approves the transfer of Charlie Paul from the Blue Quills Indian Residential School to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. Please inform both Principals accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W. E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of October 20, 1938, and Mr. Phelan's letter of November 24, 1939, regarding Lloyd Wilfrid Dillon.\n\nIt was intimated to you in both these letters that the eligibility of this boy for admission to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School was doubtful on religious grounds.\n\nI am today informed that he is still in the Onion Lake R.C. School. If so, you should inform the Principal that it is the Department's desire that this boy be returned to his parents immediately. Please let me know when action has been taken in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant regarding Joseph Lloyd Dillon.\n\nAs we have not allowed any grant for him the Department was under the impression that he had been returned to his parents.\n\nHowever, in view of the information contained in your recent letter Indian Agent Hill is being requested to arrange at once for the return of the boy to his parents if he is still in the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

Indian Residential School shows the following pupils over the age of 16:\n\nNo. 0187 Mary R. Dion No. 0228 Bella Waskewitch\n\" 0205 Rosa Janvier \" 192 Rodrick Badger\n\" 0217 Mary L. Chozen\n\nNo application for retaining these children in your school appears to have been received and in this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. E. Pascal, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-10, of December 22nd, 1939, regarding Lloyd Wilfrid Dillon.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of October 20, 1938, I conveyed your request to the Principal, who assured me it would be complied with. Later, when Mr. Phelan's letter of November 24, 1939, reached us, he was back again in the school pending admission, as he was of school age (7) and his application had been forwarded. However, as his application was unsuccessful, he was returned to his parents in January.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSt. Anthony School, Onion Lake,\nMarch 1st, 1939.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to yours of February 23rd, and received today I wish to state that the discharges of:\n0187 Marie Rose Dion\n0217 Mary L. Cheon\n0205 Rosa Janvier\n192 Redrick Badger\n\nhave been already received and their names will not appear in the March Quarter return.\n\nAs for Halle Waskewitch who was accepted as a pupil in August 1930 and who was discharged in 1933 after the report given by Dr. A.B. Simms, Medical Superintendent, Cumberland Indian Health Unit who found her active Pulmonary lesions,\n\nFeeling perfectly well, she came back last year and was readmitted although she was 16 years of age. The child wishes to continue to make up the time lost by illness. Hope you will meet with your approval.\n\nHB 0235 Edna Carlson who is a little over 16 and who has practically no home would also like to prolong her stay with your approbation;\n\nHoping that the statements above will meet with your demand I remain,\n\nThankfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant and note that pupils 0187, 0205, 0217 and 192 are being discharged.\n\nWith regard to Bella Waskewitch, No. 0228, and Edna Carlson, No. 0235, they may remain in the Onion Lake R.C. School until the end of June next. At that time you should communicate with the Department again recommending what action you consider should be taken in their regard during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of the 23rd ultimo the Department realizes that there may be reasons for keeping some children after 16 years of age but it is only in exceptional cases that such action should be taken and when you desire to do so formal permission of the Department should be obtained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Letter No. 115-8-10, of November 24, 1939, in reply to Dr. Hill's letter of November 9, 1939, even number. Father Pascal, Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School, has again forwarded an application for the admission of Lloyd Wilfred Dillon, age 7 1/2 to his school. I have interviewed Douglas Dillon, the father of this boy, today, and he stated that he wished Lloyd placed in the R.C. School.\n\nI would be pleased to be instructed by the Department in this matter, before submitting the application. The facts are the same as stated in Dr. Hill's letter, except that Lloyd is the only child Douglas Dillon wishes placed in the R.C. School. It appears the Sisters took this boy when he was three years old, and cared for him for over three years, while Douglas was ill, and he promised to have Lloyd educated at the R.C. School, and brought up in that faith. There are three younger children at home.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

School, has made application for the admission of Agnes and Bruce Naistus, age 5 1/2 and 4 years, respectively. The mother, Mrs. Joe Naistus, of No. 140, Keeheewin Band, is a widow. She has left her reserve and is living with relatives on the Onion Lake Reserve. Besides the two children in question, she has two younger ones with her, and she would find it practically impossible to maintain a home and care for all four children.\n\nI would be pleased to have instruction from the Department before signing and forwarding the applications.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nClerk in Charge.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the application for the admission of Agnes and Bruce Naistus to the Onion Lake R.C. School. In view of the age of these children the Department hesitates to admit them to a residential school. It is considered that the mother should be able to care for them for at least another year.\n\nWith regard to your other letter of the 25th ultimo in connection with the application for the admission of Lloyd Wilfred Dillon please let me know if the father of this boy is a white man or an Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.

Indian Residential School.\n\nShe is the daughter of Arsene Cardinal, Indian Interpreter at the Agency, and Mr. Cardinal has requested permission to place his daughter in the Onion Lake Private School here this term. He has the permission of the School Board to do so, and Rev. E. Pascal, Principal of the R.C. Residential School, is willing to have the girl discharged from his school in order that she may attend the private school as the parents wish. I would be pleased to receive instruction from the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

The girl is back at the R.C. School again, (pupil No. 0316) and I trust will be allowed to remain a pupil there, as her parents cannot possibly undertake her education themselves.

In that letter I stated in error that Hermann (now Pupil No. 350, at the R. C. School) was the only remaining member of this family not yet admitted to the School. However, last treaty payments, when at Loon Lake, Chief Peepeekoot presented Roland to me with the request that I strive to have him admitted to School also. The Chief assured me that Roland is the youngest member of his daughter's (and Pete Dufresne) family, and that he returned to the Loon Lake Reserve when his brother Hermann did, but went to live another Indian of that band instead of with his grandfather.\n\nI would strongly recommend that Roland be admitted to the R. C. School to be with his sister and two brothers.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

I have reviewed the previous correspondence regarding Herman (Dufresne) Peepoekoot and from the information given at that time we felt that he was entitled to special consideration due to the fact that you stated that he had resided, from early childhood, with his grandfather. The same reason does not exist in the case of Roland and after carefully considering the various circumstances, the Department is not prepared to approve his admission as a grant-earning pupil to any Indian residential school.\n\nThe admission of the following children is approved:\n\nGenevieve Ennow\nMary Gladu\nRosalie Chocon\n\nFrank Jimmy Charland\nCharlie Grandbois\nRoland Allan Dufresne\n\nYou may also advise the Principal that the Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNo. 245\n\" 252\n\" 253\n\" 280\n\" 342\n\nR.A.

These children have lived on the Cold Lake Indian Reserve all their lives and have four brothers already enrolled in this School - Thomas, Pupil No.280, Adelard, No.281, Ernest No.282 and Jimmy, No.326. For this reason I would recommend that their applications be approved.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may inform the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School that the admission of Louis Bruce Naistus is approved. In regard to the applications for the admission of Florence and Agnes Swan, I have reviewed the previous correspondence with reference to the admission of other children of this family to the Onion Lake School and it is evident that, in view of the last ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds, these children are not eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to an Indian residential school. In your letter of October 28, 1940, forwarding the application for the admission of Jimmy Swan, you stated that the father was dying and that the children had lived the Indian mode of life with their grandfather. The application form at that time was signed by the grandfather. The application forms for the two girls are signed by Harry Janise and your recent letter states that they have lived on the reserve all their lives. Is the father of these children dead? Is the mother actually living on the reserve, or is she simply passing off the children to various Indians in order to secure their admission to an Indian residential school? As intimated previously, we are really not responsible for the education of these children and, although we have dealt very generously with them in the past, I am inclined to feel that the time has now arrived when further favourable consideration cannot be given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDecember 23rd., 1942.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your 115-8-10, of the 10th., instant, with reference to the applications for the admission of Florence and Agnes Swan to the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, and to submit the following additional information in regard to their plight.\n\nThe father is still living although apparently at the point of death all the time. All the children (and the mother as well) live with their grandfather, Gabriel Desjarlais, No. 126, Chipewyan Band, and perhaps he should have signed the applications for Florence & Agnes. However, the applications were signed by Harry Janvier, Chief of the Band, evidently in the belief that he was helping to secure their admission to School.\n\nFor the above reasons I would again respectfully request favourable consideration for the admission of Florence and Agnes to School, along with their brothers.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 2, 1945.\n\nMr. D.H.

He does not state whether she died at the school, at hospital or at home and according to our records we have not yet received the memorandum of inquiry form in the event that she died at the school. Please let me know regarding this girl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1943.\n\nMr. D.H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 30 and official reply of December 9 with reference to the application for the admission of Roland Allan (Dufrane) Peepeshoot to the Onion Lake R.C. School. We have recently been requested to review the correspondence and I understand from your letter of November 30 that this is the last member of this particular family who will apply for educational advantages. In view of the fact that the other members of the family have been placed in the Onion Lake School, the Department is inclined to reverse our previous decision but, before doing so, we would like another definite assurance that we will have no further applications from this family. Incidentally you might let me know if the father has contributed in any manner toward the support of the children.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOnion Lake, Sask.,\nJanuary 26th., 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\n\nReplying to your letter No.115-8-10, of the 12th., instant, I wish to say that Pupil No.0327, Josephine Canepotato, was taken home from the Onion Lake R.C.School on November 23rd., and died at her home on December 12th., 1942, of pneumonia.\n\nDonald H.

From the information given on the application form when he was first admitted, this boy is now 20 years of age. We have already granted permission for him to remain to the end of June and certainly we will be unable to pay any grant for him after that date. As a matter of fact he should be able to secure work immediately, due to the scarcity of labour.\n\nEric Carlson, No. 238, is shown on the March quarter return as 15\u00bd and Louis Janvier, No. 243, is shown as 15\u00bd. From the information contained on the application forms for both these boys, the age of the former is now 17 and the age of the latter 19\u00bd. As stated above, there is no reason why these boys should not be able to secure work at the present time and the Principal should arrange for their immediate discharge.\n\nPupils 0272, 0282 and 0292 are over 16 years of age. The Principal should apply for their discharge at the end of June or, if he wishes to keep them for a further period, special application should be made to this office stating definitely the reasons for desiring them to remain.\n\nThe pupils numbered as follows are shown on the quarterly returns but no grant has been requested for them for several quarters:\n\n| No. | 238 | 287 | 308 | 331 | 0278 | 0320 | 0332 |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|\n|     | 268 | 292 | 318 | 337 | 0297 | 0322 | 0333 |\n|     | 270 | 303 | 324 | 339 | 0298 | 0330 | 0334 |\n|     | 283 | 304 | 327 | 0268 | 0315 | 0331 | 0346 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School that the discharge of pupils numbered 307, 309 and 0349 is approved.\n\nI regret that your letter of May 5 was overlooked and consequently no reply was sent to you. Pupil No. 288, Eric Carlson, is 17 years of age, and last year we approved his remaining until the end of June this year. On reviewing the returns, we find his attendance marked as follows:\n\n| Quarter       | No. of days for which grant was requested | No. of days in attendance |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| March, 1942   | 30                                       | 0                         |\n| June, 1942    | 18                                       | 0                         |\n| September, 1942| 92                                       | 0                         |\n| December, 1942| 22                                       | 0                         |\n| March, 1943   | 0                                        | 0                         |\n| June, 1943    | 10                                       | 0                         |\n\nIt is noted that he is marked as attending high school, although we have no record of having authorized him to attend a high school. The Department cannot see any reason for his remaining in the Onion Lake R. C. School for a further period.\n\nPupil No. 0282, Genevieve Stanley, is over 18 years of age. Consequently, the Principal should apply for her discharge.\n\nPupils Nos. 0272 and 0292 are 17 years of age or over. We have already allowed them an extension of one\nyear, and, from the information submitted to us so far, we cannot see any reason for their remaining for another year.\n\nWe expect to hear from you regarding the above named pupils as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Joseph Edmond Waskewitch\nAge 13\nName of Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid (133)\nFather's full name and No. Thomas Waskewitch, No. 133\nMother's full name and No.\nParents living or dead\nState of child's health good\nReligion\nDoes applicant speak English?

They are the sons of Mrs. A. Photographer, No. 64, Island Lake Band, and Archie Masson, half-breed. Their grandmother and guardian is Mrs. Canepotato, No. 29, Onion Lake Band, with whom they have made their home on the Onion Lake Reserve all their lives. I do not know of any other way for these two boys to get a little education, and a sister, Clara Masson, is already in the School, authority Department Letter No. 115-8-10, dated January 29, 1944.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1944.\n\nMr. D.H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Onion Lake R.C. School:\n\nSarah Martial          Mathilda Waskewitch\nAgnes Choan            Margaret Jane Lewis\n\nWe also approve the discharge of pupils numbered 0285 and 0329. Pupils numbered 236 and 0272 may remain in the school for another year.\n\nWe have carefully noted the information you supply regarding Joseph Lawrence Masson and Wilfrid Masson. This is exactly the same information that you gave in your letter of January 21 last regarding Clara Masson. In reviewing these applications the Department feels that these two boys are not eligible for admission and we further feel that a mistake was made in approving the admission of the girl last January. However, you might let me have some further information. Are all three of these children legitimate or illegitimate? It is impossible to tell from your letter. Has the children's father made any provision for them during the past few years? We are prepared to consider further information but, as stated above, we are not satisfied that their status entitles them to admission to a residential school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, File No. 115-8-10, with reference to the application for admission of Joseph Lawrence Masson and Wilfrid Masson, brothers of Clara Masson, pupil No. 0364.\n\nAll three children were illegitimate but on June 14th, 1943, the parents were married. The father of these children works around the country as a labourer and no doubt contributes to their living, but he is in no position whatever to make provision for any education for them. The children live on the Onion Lake reserve with their grandmother and I do not know of any other way for them to get a little education than by being admitted to the Residential school as grant-earning pupils.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1944.\n\nMr. D.H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with further reference to the children of Archie Masson. Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letters of January 21, 1944, and July 27, 1944. It is evident that this family cannot be considered Indians as defined by the Indian Act and consequently the children are not eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to any Indian residential school.\n\nYou should, therefore, inform the Principal of the Onion Lake R.C. School that no further grant will be paid for Clara Masson and that the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of Joseph Lawrence Masson and Wilfrid Masson to any Indian residential school.\n\nR.A.

It is evident that you have not carefully reviewed Circular Letter of December 29th, 1944, nor has any attention been given to the column on the right hand side of the Return.\n\nThe name of Joseph Jimmy, No. 372 was shown on your September Quarter Return but no grant was requested for him during that Quarter. On the December Return you asked for a grant for 92 days but on Form I.A. 411, which accompanied the Return, you state that this boy entered the school on October 15th, 1945. If the latter date is correct you are only entitled to a grant from October 15th to the end of December. On the Return you show that Joseph Jimmy entered the school on 21st May, 1945. You will note that the information given regarding this boy is not consistent.\n\nWhat has been stated regarding the difference between the information given on the Return and the information given on the Form I.A. 411 in the case of Joseph Jimmy, applies also to pupils No. 373, 374 and 375.\n\nOn Form 411 and on the Return you state that pupils 0375, and 0376 entered the school on October 15th. This entitles you to a grant from that date to the end of the Quarter which is 77 days instead of 92 days as requested.\n\nPupil 0377 is shown both on the Return and Form I.A. 411 as having entered the school on October 27th. If this information is correct you should only be entitled grant from that date to the end of December and not for 92 days.\n\nIn the case of pupils 0384 and 0389 it appears both from the Return and Form I.A. 411 that these girls entered the school on the same date in December although you do not give the exact date but in each case you requested 92 days. Again may I point out that if the date of admission is correct, you are only entitled to a grant from that date to the end of the Quarter.\n\nAll these returns are being very carefully scrutinized by the Auditor General at this time and we simply must have them correct. The information on the form I.A. 411 should coincide exactly with the information on the return. In view of the errors we are sending back the return for correction. Arrangements will be made to allow you part-payment on the December Quarter grants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6326, file 650-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 115-8-10 dated December 20th last regarding Gordon Thunderchild whose application for admission to the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School I forwarded to you and later learned that his parents were Anglicans, I am enclosing herewith copy of letters received from Mrs. Philip Thunderchild and from Mr. Cockburn, our Farming Instructor on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nI will await your instructions regarding the disposition of this case, as to whether Gordon Thunderchild should be allowed to remain at Onion Lake or whether he should be sent to St. Alban's Indian Residential School at Prince Albert.\n\nI have no record here, other than the statement Mrs. Thunderchild makes in her letter, that she has changed her religion.\n\nIf Philip Thunderchild had assaulted his wife, as she claims in her letter, she should have reported the case either to Mr. Cockburn or to the R.C.M.P. and action would have been taken at that time.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Gordon should be in boarding school as his parents apparently are in no position to take care of him properly.\n\nC. S. Bell\nActing Indian Agent\nOnion Lake,\nSask. Dec. 17/48\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the School told me of your letter regarding to Gordon Thunderchild.\n\nI thought I had some right to put him in that school as he has already change his religion and I am the only one that has ever clothe him with the help of my children here.\n\nBecause I separated from Philip Thunderchild five months before Gordon was born. Because he nearly killed me knocking me down and then kicking me some of the people of Thunderchild saw the condition I was and when I got here the lumps on my head could still be felt and seen. I was here in Onion Lake when Gordon was born and I stayed here for 4 years and then I went back to Philip Thunderchild. I stayed with him for 1 year and then got sick for lack of warm clothing and good food. I went to Prince Albert Sanitorium. I stayed there for 2 years. I left Gordon there at Thunderchild. I used to send them clothing that I have made up for the two boys from the money I had receive from my children here and made some of the money from my sewing, and when I got back to Thunderchild from the Hospital they still had the clothing I had send them no other clothing for them to change. And when I got there I was surprised at the grub they had only bannak and lard. I still stayed for 3 mos. eating the same food nor getting any clothing for me and the boys. The farmer Instructor came to coax him to work but he just laid around so I left him again with my boy Gordon, and one thing too we did not get any of our treaty money not even John George MacDonald's money.\n\nHe has never clothe nor given any money to Gordon so I believe I am the one to see Gordon in the best school I know off.\n\nSo I would like you to let him remain where he is without further interference. I have been staying with my daughter and got them to write for me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMrs. Edith Thunderchild\nPhilip\nThunderchild Reserve,\nJanuary 7th, 1946\n\nC.S. Bell Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Thunderchild\n\nI discussed this problem with the Father of the above noted child and he states that he does not want the child to go to the Anglican School at Prince Albert. He would rather see the child left at the School at Onion Lake until the summer holidays. His desire is that he have the child with him on the Reserve.\n\nWith regard to the question asked by Mr. Whelan of the Training Division as to who has been maintaining the child, I would say that the honours are fairly evenly divided. During the year that she lived with her husband after the child Gordon was born and during her stay in the San he was maintained by the Father. Since she left and went to live at Onion Lake the Mother has maintained the child. Apparently we are back where we started from.

(RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nJanuary 24, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter #115-8-10 dated January 16, 1946, along with the Quarterly Return of September 30th to December 31st, 1945.\n\nRegarding Joseph Jimmy No. 372 and 374 Johnny Carter, we wish to state that the date on the Return marked May 21st, 1945 is an error on the part of the secretary using the repetition sign \";\", it would otherwise have been marked as 10-15-45 which was written corresponding No. 374 and 12-15-45 for No. 373. We wish to state that these dates are those of the admission as received from Ottawa through the agency #115-8-10. As we understand the date of the pupils' arrival at school as stated in the admission form No. 1-A-406, is the date of entrance to School. Therefore the date of entrance of 372 is September 21, 1945. That of 373 is September 30th, 1945. The 92 day grant requested is thus correct.\n\nThe error in typing the two above pupils' dates as 10-15-45 naturally makes Richard Chocon No. He. 374, was meant to be registered as 12-15-45 that is referring to letter #115-8-10 from Ottawa. Date of admission from Ottawa was received from Onion Lake Agency by telephone as delivery of mail was not possible before a week. The exact day, the 19th, as you noticed was left out, the Agent inserted it on Form No. 1-A-411. However the date of entrance of 374 as on form No. 1-A-406 is Oct. 22, 1945, thus allowing 70 days grant.\n\nThe date of entrance of Samuel Moyah No. 375 is November 24th, 1945. This entitles us to 89 days grant. The same error was made about his admission date.\n\nReferring to dates marked on Form 411 and on the Return of pupils 0375 Agnes Jimmy and 0376 Susan Jimmy the same error of taking admission dates from Ottawa are to be noticed. The entrance dates of both No. 0375 and 0376, is September 11th, 1945. They are therefore entitled to full grant of 92 days.\n\nPupil 0377 shown both on the Return and Form 1-A-411 as 10-27-45, is subject to the same explanation as above, date received from Onion Lake was used. The exact date of her entrance as shown on Form No. 1-A-406 is September 4th, 1945 and thus entitles to 92 days grant.\nWe notice with regret that even an error was made in inserting the Nos.of Julia Fatehegan and Edna Harper. To follow suite it should be 0379 instead of 0354 and that of Edna Harper 0379 instead of 0389. This will be corrected.\n\nThe same mistake as mentioned above was made in stating 10-27-45 for 0376 Julia Fatehegan. Her entrance was on October 22nd, 1945 and thus allows her 70 days.\n\nThat of Edna Harper 0379 is October 27th, 1945 and entitles to 66 days grant.\n\nThe long interval between dates of entrance and of admission by the Department is due to the forced delay in having the children examined by the doctor. We are frequently cut off from communication. The roads become impassable by mud and water in spring and summer, while in winter snow drifts barricade. The river cannot be crossed for long periods in spring and autumn. We trust that you will understand our handicaps.\n\nWe fully realize the mistakes made and humbly beg pardon for errors both in dates and days requested for Nos. 374, 375, 0378, 0379.\n\nThe Return and Form No.1/A-4 all corrected in red ink above each error is returned herewith, trusting that you will allow us the grant entitled.\n\nOnce more may we state that we will follow our Returns more closely to give you full satisfaction. Although it may appear to be so, no fraud was meant.\n\nThanking you for your kind cooperation on this matter, I remain,\n\nDevotedly yours,\n\nRev. E. Pascal, c.m.i.\n\nSt. Anthony Indian Res.

As no grant was given this pupil for\nthe days in residence in the March Quarter, and if the\nchild attends the full June quarter, grant can be asked\nfor the eight days of the March Quarter, and the full\ngrant of 91 days for June Quarter, making a total of 99\ndays.

Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.,\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, a few discrepancies have been noted and it is requested that they be drawn to the Principal's attention:\n\n1. Pupil # 347 should have been shown on the December No. 411 as re-admitted.\n\n2. Harrle Skeenan number is 458 instead of 459 as shown on the return.\n\n3. The number of pupils having been absent for two or more quarters and who are not expected to return should be discharged and their names removed from the return. If at a later date they return to the school, they should be re-admitted and the Department advised.\n\n4. Pupils who enter hospitals are allowed up to thirty days grant. This applies to # 373 Johnny Carter who went to the Sanitorium on December 20th and for whom eighty-two days grant was requested.\n\n5. New pupils # 379 and 380 should have been shown on the December Quarter No. 411.\nThe above remarks are not meant as a criticism but are intended as a guide for future returns that may be corrected easily and therefore aid in the speedy dispatch of the Quarterly Grant cheque.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 1, 1947.\n\nMr. D.H.

Besides this two boys ran away and were brought back by their own father the following morning. Their reason was that of a quarrel with an older boy. The matter was settled and everybody was satisfied.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays three girls ran away because they envied their companions at home on the reserve. We hardly could blame them for this.\n\nThree or four others went away for no special reasons and were brought back inside of a few days.\n\nWe do our best to treat the children very kindly. Every possible means are taken to make the children understand their duties without the use of severe punishment. This method has proven very satisfactory.\n\nNaturally, we have to do with Indian children and parents, who do not always understand the importance and need of an education and these problems therefore repeat themselves occasionally.\n\nWe hope that this is satisfactory explanation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Bell,\nSuptl of Indian Agency,\nBattleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Bell,\n\nAs an answer to your letter asking for more information concerning the recommendation for the discharge of Sandy Standinghorn and David Jimmy I would say that the main reason for their leaving the school is their love for freedom. Seeing that their parents will not do anything about it, they feel they can stay away from school as long as they wish.\n\nMr. Jimmy has told me himself that his son just did not want to come to school.\n\nFor Sandy Standinghorn in particular, we have many proofs showing that he is a menace to the school. His misbehavior is a cause of scandal and bad example for others.\n\nThe boys have reported that Sandy has told them in plain words \"I have set the fire in the other school (meaning Delmas) and I will set it here too.\" He has already made two attempts to set the fire here since. The fact that he did not succeed does not mean that there is nothing to it, I believe.\n\nHe has left school three times already and was picked up twice. The third time he left, he has stolen articles from a store in Paradise Hill and tried to sell them to people afterwards for less than their value. Complaints were brought to us by the store owner himself. A lady had tried to take care of him, but he escaped from there the first chance he had, leaving his rubbers behind, this proving that he was from here, and who he was.\n\nNow Mr. Bell, I hope these informations will\nbe judged sufficient to make his discharge possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"Rev. Jules T. Pierre\"\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJanuary 12, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nReplying to your letter No. 659-10(E.1) of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Sandy Standinghorn and David Jimmy, Jr., who have absconded on several occasions from St. Anthony's Indian Residential School, Onion Lake. I am enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal regarding these children, and await your further instructions.\n\nThese boys apparently will not settle down to study, no doubt if sent back to school would abscond at first opportunity. If they should during severe weather there is the danger of freezing to death if exposed for any great length of time. While parents appear to be indifferent about insisting children remain in school, they would be the first to make a howl if anything should happen to cause suffering.\n\nAt first opportunity I will interview Sandy Standinghorn about remarks he apparently has made to others; \"I have set the fire in the other school (meaning Delmas) and I will set it here too\". I am doubtful as his name was never mentioned during the investigation of the Delmas fire.\n\nC.S. Bell\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n18th January, 1949.\n\nMr. C.S.

Davis,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies,\nMeadow Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your last letter, concerning Emma Cardinal, who is over age and not in the class room, I am sorry to say that this was overlooked, as I was sure that it was arranged on time.\n\nEmma has a step-mother and had asked to remain in the school for manual training all day, especially for sewing, knitting, etc. She has talent for that kind of work and we encouraged and taught her as much of it as she wanted.\n\nI have just spoken to her father and he insists that she return again for another year to continue this training.\n\nAnother reason why she had made this request for manual training was due to her being hard of hearing, and the Dr. seems practically unable to be able to help her at all.\n\nHer father wants her to take up cooking also this year.\n\nI hope this will answer all the information needed and trust all will be made clear for this case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSt. Anthony's School\nPer: Rev. Jules St. Pierre, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMeadow Lake, Sask.,\nJuly 12th, 1949.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIn connection with Emma Cardinal who has been receiving manual training at the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, and who is now seventeen years of age:\n\nWe requested a full report on this case from Father St. Pierre which we have just received. This report which fully explains the case and requests permission to retain Emma for at least another year, is attached (copy).\n\nMay we please have your views on this subject before taking the matter up with Ottawa, and your instructions.\n\n(signed) T.E. Graham\nFor J.A. Davis,\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\n\n/G att:1\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nMr. J.A. Davis, Indian Superintendent, Meadow Lake Agency recently discovered that an Indian girl, seventeen years of age is still on the roll of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter received from Superintendent Davis and a copy of a letter he received from Father St. Pierre, the Principal of the school in connection with this girl.\n\nWhether or not it is advisable to keep the girl at the school as a grant-earning pupil is very doubtful. Apparently she is deaf, but is learning some sewing and knitting and her father wishes her to take up cooking in the next term. However as a continuation of her attendance at the school as a grant-earning pupil is not entirely in order, I am submitting the matter to the Department for consideration, and I may say that I do not recommend it.\n\nJ.P.B.

It is considered, accordingly, that steps should be taken to arrange for the attendance at appropriate residential schools of those children whose homes are beyond the legal limit for pupil-travel. The attendance of those within a reasonable radius of the Day school should be enforced in the usual way.\n\nThere may be still accommodation for Roman Catholic pupils at the Onion Lake Residential school. For children of other denominations it is possible that accommodation still exists at the Edmonton residential school.

The Principal should be requested to show at the top of Form I.A. 1069 where \"Agency\" appears the name of the agency from which the child comes, rather than the agency in which the school is located. A copy of the form should be sent to each of the Indian Superintendents concerned, after completion of columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and, if possible, 5. The Indian Superintendents on receipt of their copy of the form will complete the last three columns and forward to the Regional Director for action.\n\nThe above procedure ensures that each Superintendent with children attending this school receives prompt advice of the admission and discharge of such children and can then relay this information to the Regional Director for the necessary adjustments in Family Allowances payments.\nYour co-operation in ensuring that the Principal of the Onion Lake School is fully aware of the procedure to be followed in using this form, particularly in regard to children attending from the Saddle Lake Agency, will be very much appreciated.\n\nPlease forward a brief report of the interview with the School Principal at your convenience.\n\nH.
