Dewdney\nSup't Sect' of Ind Affairs\n\"cost double what the\nDept. wishes be asked to\npay\". The Commissioner\nreports that the building\nas completed is worth\nabout $500; and he\nrecommends that, in\nconsideration of this fact,\nthe Dept. authorize the\ngranting of $200 instead\nof $100 as previously\nintended. The contribution\nof the Dept. towards the\nmaintenance of pupils\nat the institution will\nconsist of rations, clothing\netc., most of which, the\nCommissioner states, the\npupils would otherwise\nreceive even if they\nwere not lodged at the\nschool.\n\nThe undersigned begs\nto state that the project\nof establishing a boarding\nschool, to replace the\ntwo day schools, on the\nSarcee Reserve is deserving of encouragement, as the latter have never been successful; and the Indians promise that if a boarding school is established, they will permit their children to lodge thereat and be educated. From present appearances it would seem that there will be funds at the credit of the appropriation for schools in Manitoba and the N.W.Territories to admit of giving a grant of $200 towards the building of the boarding school as recommended by the Commissioner.\n\nH. Macdonald\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo Dy Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Jan 21st 1892\n\nSo far as it is possible to judge at the present time there will be funds available to permit of the giving of the grant recommended by the Council to the Boarding School on the Sarcee Reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Acct.\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo relative to the Boarding School being erected on the Lance Reserve and to state in reply that at the two Lance day schools there has always been a difficulty in securing any thing like a satisfactory attendance, and a desire having been expressed on the part of the Church Authorities to endeavour to overcome this difficulty by establishing a Boarding School, and closing one of our two day schools, the Indians promised that in the event of provision being made for their children as boarders a number would attend.\n\nThis appeared to be the only\n\nThe Deputy\nof the Dept General\nof Indian Affairs\nmeans of overcoming their prejudices.\n\nI was asked if in the event of a suitable building being erected to keep the children as boarders whether a grant might be expected, and I promised that on the completion of a suitable building the Department would contribute \u00a3100 towards the cost of the erection provided it cost double what the Department would be called to pay. The building is now finished and is worth about \u00a3300.\n\nThe nice to be given to ensure the maintenance of the children will be pictures and clothing etc., most of which they would otherwise require even if not otherwise attending school.\n\nThe building being such a good one and the authorities anxious by enlarging it, I would ask the Dept to authorize a grant of \u00a3200 instead of \u00a3100, as it will I think be more particularly well expended.\n\nThe general vote will be able to stand the amount even through special provision.\nhas not been made for it.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\nnecessity for the enlargement of the building could be seen, an expenditure would, if funds available, be authorized for the coming Spring.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\nIndian Agent's Office Sarcee Agency\nNovember 15th 1893\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No 044 dated the 1st instant, I beg to inform you that eight parents or guardians have signed an agreement to give up their children for an indefinite time.\n\nSix girls and two boys are now ready to attend the boarding school when school room is provided and the rest of the children can be obtained without much difficulty.

A.\nImmediate Memorandum\n\n26th April 1893\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nI have examined the plans and specifications of the proposed additions to the Sarcee Indian Residential Boarding School. These additions consist of a main addition one and a half stories high 24' x 30' - a lean-to 12' x 22' and a cellar 20' x 10'. The total cost including \u00a3194.50 property chargeable to the original building was \u00a31364.10.\n\nThe plan, specifications and cost appear to be quite satisfactory. It is not evident whether the whole of the additions mentioned in connection with the enlargement of the Mission house are included in the work for which is stated to have cost \u00a3241.95.

J. Jackson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta., N.W.T.\nCopy of Messrs. Child & Wilson's report on present school building & proposed accommodation for 30 or more children, Sarcee Reserve.\n\n\"Child & Wilson, Architects\"\nOffice of Town Engineer,\nCalgary N.W.T.\nOct 12th 1893\n\nOn School Building\nSarcee Indian Reserve, Alta N.W.T.\n\n\"Agreeably to instructions we have surveyed the above building and beg to report as follows:\nThis building was erected 7 years ago; it is built of logs with shingled roof; inside, the internally, the walls & ceiling are lined with beaded tongue, & grooved wainscoting.\nThe building is by no means proof against cold air, the window frames are poor & out of repair, the chinking between the logs is defective in many places & the logs themselves are full of snake, also the roof is not tight at the wall plates, consequently it is not surprising that the building proves to be very cold in winter. The bottom bays & cills are more or less rotten & decayed.\nThe building is quite unsuitable for school purposes, being very low & narrow - at 4'5\" to each child's cubic capacity for only eight persons. This includes the small recess at end. The floor space of school room at 10' x 16' ft. to each, would accommodate 32 persons, but the width of the building being only 16'0\", this could not be readily accomplished done. 16'0\" is altogether too narrow for a school room & the capacity of the room...\"\ndecreased by book-closet, store &c.\n\nThe School-room is rather dark, the windows which are two in number, and consist of 8 panes each of 10 x 12\" glass; they are on one side of the room. The tops of their sills are only 15\" above the floor, and consequently much useful light is lost, being obstructed by desks &c. We are given to understand that it is proposed with a view of enlarging this school room, to bring bodily from a distance of 5 miles a log building similar in all respects to the building in question & adding it on to the same; this will prove to be a very costly & difficult undertaking; the country being very hilly. On the other hand should the said building be pulled down instead, with a view of utilizing the old materials, we would point out that in stripping off the \"wainscoting\" on walls & ceiling, the tongues & grooves would be more or less split off and destroyed, thereby destroying the usefulness of same in a great measure. Whichever of these plans is adopted it will prove more costly and less satisfactory than making use of new materials for a new addition or enlargement; but whatever is done the roof of the present building should be raised to increased the cubic capacity to something like what it should be. This will also apply to any new addition.\n\nWe are of opinion that the most satisfactory plan, and the most economical to adopt, is to erect an entirely new building of lumber with concrete or stone foundations.\nConstruct same in accordance with the regulations of the department. Such a building to accommodate between 30 & 40 children would cost about $600; and perhaps a little less if part of the work was done by the staff on the Reserve.\n\nEnclosed is a rough sketch plan and section which will give an idea of what the present building is like.\n\nYour obedient servants\n\n(Sig.) Child & Wilson\n\nThe building has no ventilation whatever to speak of beyond a hole in the ceiling through which the air escapes into the roof to take its chance of escape through what chinks & cracks it may find.\n\nC.W.\nSt. Barnabas' Mission,\nSarcee Reserve.\nCalgary & W.T. 18th April 1894\n\nTo the Indian Agent,\nSarcee Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI reply to a letter from the office of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, addressed to yourself, a copy of which is before me. I beg to remark that my first communication with the Department on the subject of the need of larger accommodation for the children under our care, was through your office on or about the 25th September last. A few days later in a letter dated 2nd October 1893 addressed to the Indian Commissioner direct, I wrote (inter alia) as follows\u2014\u201cIn view of a larger number of children, I have made application through the Agent for the enlargement of the school building, and have suggested the use of the Wet Bung School house for the purpose.\u201d\n\nThis letter was duly acknowledged on the 6th of the same month, when I was informed that the Agent had been communicated with, and instructed in the matter. In consequence of this last communication, I thought the proper course would be for me to get the best advice on this matter I could, and therefore wrote immediately to Mr. H. Wilson, of Calgary, who have been architects for much of the buildings on our four Reserves, and knew also the views of the Commissioners on the subject of ventilation etc. I asked his advice as to the most economical and satisfactory course to pursue. His original report dated 12th October 1893 was forwarded to the Department.\nthrough your office, a copy of which I enclose. It has been stated in your circular, from this report it will be seen that the proposal I at first made would not be at all satisfactory.\n\nBoth buildings\u2014viz., the one adjacent to the boarding school, and that still at the West Campus, are not large enough for our purposes. They are equal to one another in size and taken together cubic capacity for not more than sixteen children. We have already 25 children (17 boys and 8 girls) in our house, and expect at least 5 more before the end of the present fiscal year. We are willing and indeed anxious to do our utmost to curtail the cost of a new building, and if you are able to help in the way you kindly suggested in October last, I think there can be no doubt that a very suitable frame building can be erected for $600. A further perusal of the Architect's report will, I feel sure, show the wisdom of putting up a new building in the place of the pathetic plan I first proposed. A building 20' x 30' ft. and a 16' foot ceiling will give the required accommodation I believe. I shall be happy to furnish full particulars of a suitable structure if requested to do so.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.W.

I believe the Government inspectors to say nothing of yourself or myself. It is condemned as being quite unfit for the present use, being large enough for only 6 or 7 children.\n\nIt was suggested that the West Camp School should be brought down and make use of its space today along with the present building. First of all the two schools together.\nas the Architect's Report below shows, will not be large enough for our present number, so any addition of five more the two schools together would have only sufficient cubic feet of air for 15 children. Then again if the building were brought down, it could not be properly utilized with the present school so as to form our house, on account of the condition of the logs (see Architect's report) and if not so utilized, we should have two teachers, and leave too few for the purpose, nor do we see the wisdom of paying for an extra teacher in order to provide the expense of a new building.\n\nDuring the past 4 weeks since the hot weather began, several of our children have been unwell, and some are unwell as I write this letter.\n\nIf they are to continue to attend school under present circumstances, I fear the consequences, and the Department must be prepared to meet them, and will not be able to disclaim a knowledge\nof the facts. One of our littlest brightest and healthiest lads and one of the most attentive and promising of our pupils (Bobby Murray Brown) is carrying an considerable anxiety on the grounds of ill health.\n\nPerhaps the worst course will be either to close the school or to send back to the camp at least half the children.\n\nI have no doubt of such a course, and I am quite sure that all interested in the Indians would evince generally any such progressive movement, but I for my part, will certainly prefer to send these backs to camp rather than run the risks of anything approaching an epidemic amongst them.\n\nIndians naturally require more fresh air than white people.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

As I did not consider the scheme of using the West Camp School building here practicable\u2014even if the material was on the ground\u2014and was supported in my views by the Rev. Principal Mr. Stocken and the Architects, Messrs.

At cost $506 and the Department increased the grant to $200. In 1893 the building was enlarged making the total cost $1364.10, and the Dept. made a further grant of $400. Since that time there appears to have been a further expenditure on it making the cost now $1593.19. Of this the Dept. has paid $600.\n\nPaid from Church Sources: $76.87\n\nLeaving a balance due on the building: $716.32 which consists of unpaid aps for labour and material.\n\nThere are no funds available from current year's vote.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nOttawa, June 11th, 1894.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of copy of two letters, dated 29th ultimo, from Mr. Agent Lucas, and of communication from Rev. Mr. Gibbon Stocken, referred to in one of them, and relating to increase of school class room accommodation, and in reply to say that there does not appear to be anything to add to what has already been communicated to you on the subject, viz., that there are no funds to provide the new building asked for, and therefore the best possible use must be made of the existing accommodation and available means for increasing it, and no more children than can be accommodated consistently with due regard to their health.\n\nMr. Stocken's remarks, that there has been plenty of time to have made provision in the Estimates, or that such can yet be made, or failing that that it is possible to use the miscellaneous grants, are noted, but it does not appear to have occurred to his mind that there is something more required than time in order to provide in the Estimates, and that is to make Estimates which must necessarily be limited, go over all Indian requirements to the best advantage, nor can he possibly be in a position to know how the miscellaneous vote stands, or offer any suggestion as\n\nA. E. Forget, Esq.,\nAsst Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nas to how it should be disposed of. There exists a strong disposition on the part of individuals to think that local requirements are all important, and to entirely lose sight of the claims and necessities of other places, and the Department's difficulty in meeting all, and in this connection it may be observed that if Mr. Stocken would represent his views through the Bishop of his Diocese, His Lordship, who knows what demands are being made, at any rate in his own Church, in other parts of the country, would be in a better position than himself to judge as to the reasonableness of his requests.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nThe Right Reverend\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan\nSt. Calgary\nBishop's Court\nCalgary\n\nOttawa 17 June 1894\n\nMy lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Lordship's letter of 29th ultimo enclosing one from Mr. H. Holcomb Stockton regarding further assistance being given by the Department to the building fund of the Boys' Home on the Sarcee Reserve, and in reply to inform you that when it was first proposed to erect this building the Dept. promised a grant of assistance to the total of $100, but as it was subsequently shown to have cost\nfive hundred and sixty dollars.\n\nThe grant was increased to two hundred dollars.\n\nIn 1893 the building was enlarged at an additional cost of $558.10 and the Dept. gave a further grant of $400, and since that time there has been apparently a further expenditure of $279.97, making the total cost $1593.09, of which the Dept. has subscribed $600 and only $279.97 has been paid from church sources, leaving a balance of $716.32 still due.\n\nWhen the first grant was made it was on the understanding that building was to cost double the amount thereof, and the Dept. confidently expected that it would be used at least halfway in any future.\nfuture expenditure on the building.\n\nUnder these circumstances I trust your lordship will excuse me for saying that it appears rather unfair of Mr. Stockton to ask the Dept. just at this time, when the funds at its disposal for the current year are nearly exhausted and when it is too late to add anything to the Estimates for the next fiscal year, to acquire the Debt on this building; and I regret to have to inform your lordship that so far as can be seen at present, it does not appear likely that the Dept. will have funds available for the purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour lordship's obedient servant,\nOttawa, July 14th, 1894.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that notwithstanding the desire of the Department to aid Mr. Stocken in the matter of the Boys' Home at the Sarcee Reserve it is feared that the available funds at its disposal will not enable it to do so.\n\nIt would now appear from a statement submitted by Mr. Stocken that the Department has expended $600.00 as against $270.57 contributed from other sources, whereas it was fully understood by the Department that such contributions were to, at least, equal the Department's expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant\n\nThe Right Reverend\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan\nand Calgary\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary,\nN.W.T.\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nAs the application sent by Rev.

GUSHING'S FACTORY.\n\nCalgary, Alta., Aug. 9th, 1894\n\nTo. H. W. F. Stocken Esq.,\nSarcee Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI will hereby agree to execute all work and find all material for New School according to Plan marked A at the St. Barnabas Mission at the Sarcee Reserve near Calgary for the sum of three hundred dollars ($300.00) all together to be handed by you from Calgary free of charge.\n\nYours respectfully,\nH. Underwood\nContractor\nCalgary\nOttawa, August 18th, 1894.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 9th instant, transmitting memoranda from the Rev. Mr. Stocken relative to the necessity for and cost of an addition to the Boys' Home, and in reply to inform you as follows.\n\nWhen the Department enters into any educational undertaking on the understanding that it is on a certain scale, it causes it no small amount of embarrassment to have unforeseen and unexpected demands made upon it in connection with the same, and can only meet them by cramping itself in other directions, and endangering other interests.\n\nIn the case in point this has been felt so strongly, on account of calls in other directions, that Mr. Stocken has already been told that there seemed no other way out of the difficulty than to keep the number of pupils to within the limit justified by the available accommodation.\n\nIn Mr. Stocken's case, however, the Department would stretch a point in a way it would do for a very few, because it has always recognised an endeavour on his part to assist its Agents in carrying out the Department's policy, and a readiness to defend such policy when attacked by people who apparently did\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary,\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary,\n\nW. W. T.\ndid not themselves understand it, or desired to present it in an improper light to the public.\n\nIn recognition, therefore, of such services, the Department has been searching for some means by which to meet Mr. Stocken's desire, and although unable to find funds directly in the school appropriation, the following plan has occurred to it as feasible.\n\nThere is a moderate appropriation for hospital building for the benefit of the Blackfoot, and if the old school building which Mr. Stocken considers so insufficient for class room purpose can be made to serve for a Hospital for the Reserve, then the sum of $300, which might otherwise be expended in providing such a building, might without impropriety be devoted to providing the new class rooms asked for. This need not interfere with proceeding with the erection of the Hospital at the Blackfoot Reserve, if Your Lordship be prepared to proceed with that matter, but it will not be forgotten that the Hospital is only authorized on the understanding already reached, that it is to be conducted without any call upon the Department for any further contribution than that for the first cost of building and furnishing.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMy Lord,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) [signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nCalgary, Alberta, B.W.T., Augst 13th 1896\n\nMr. H.

(written from Regina) long before this, but have been anxious to send you a sketch of proposed Girl's Home & an Estimate by Underwood for the same, that you might be in possession of such particulars as you would need in case money should be available for such a purpose. You will notice that the lowest figure that Underwood can do it for is $675. I have had figures from two other men & think that $25 might be saved on Underwood's estimate, but not more. This does not include Cellar & fence & outhouse, which I could undertake myself. I should indeed be grateful if you could see your way by & try to grant me this amount of Contract (not exceeding $675). I shall tell you what a boon such a building would be to us in our work, & to myself personally.\n\nI hope to commence my Hospital in the Spring & to build it without a delay for any funds from Department. For this writing\nDear Mr. Stocken,\n\nReplying to your note of the 20th instant, first let me wish you the compliments of the season and that the New Year may be one of brightness and success to you.\n\nI cannot really state whether you will get funds for the building during the present fiscal year. This can only be known later on when we find out what the Government has passed my estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. H.W. Gibbon Stocken,\nCalgary, N.W.T.\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI have to thank you for your very kind letter of the 1st inst. for the assurance that you will do all within your power, when opportunity offers, to put up a suitable house for us. I thank you the more for this assurance as it is given under difficult circumstances. Some notice of the rapidly falling revenue appeared in a recent newspaper.\nMay I ask - without in\nthe least committing yourself-\nif you would mind telling\nme whether you think there\nis any possibility of our getting\nthe grant during the current\nfiscal year?\n\nWith kind regards & best\nwishes for the Christmas Season\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nH.W.

If this can be done, then we hope that the work will\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nMay I, without unduly encroaching upon your time, ask you whether it will be in your power to let me know definitely about the proposed Girls' Home for this Reserve, within the next 4 weeks? The reason I ask is that the excessive heat in Japan after the middle of July necessitates my leaving here by the last of May, returning by 30th July. Under these circumstances I am naturally very anxious about my Mission house, which of course I shall need by the end of July. Underwood tells me he could complete the Girls' Home in a very satisfactory manner in about 5 weeks. I am also expecting a grant from our Missionary Society to repair the Mission House which will take about a fortnight or so, so that time, as you will see, is very precious to me. If you are in a position to help us therefore sometime soon you know how grateful I shall be.\n\nI am, My dear Mr. Reed,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nH.W. Gibbon Stockham\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nI am in somewhat of a dilemma\u2014If you are not able to find funds out of the current fiscal year's savings\u2014have you made any provision for the Girls Home in the Estimates for the New Year? My position is just this, that I have nowhere else but the Mission Office where I could accommodate the girls, although I have the same room as now available as a dormitory, if necessary, I have no separate quarters for their general dining room\u2014or any separate kitchen\u2014which must serve, as means whatever of accommodating the Matrons. Should you therefore find it impossible to provide funds, I think it wise to advise me to let the girls go back to the Camp (which would be a thousand pities). I ought to know at once as the Matrons will require a long notice. It is unfortunate that I am obliged to start for Japan so early (36th inst.) but it is unavoidable. Am I lacking too much in a telegram of advice? The Matrons want to know before I leave.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nH.W.

These sums are as follows:\n\n- $150 Sarcee Boarding School, Well and Windmill.\n- $350 Old Sun Boarding School, Painting and plastering Girls' Home.\n- $100 Old Sun Boarding School, repairs to out-buildings and fences.\n- $350 White Eagle Boarding School, Painting and fencing.\n- $600 St. Paul's Home, Blood Reserve, Plastering.\n- $150 St. Paul's Home, Windmill and Water Supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 21st August, 1899\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant relative to certain amounts in the current year's estimates for various purposes in connection with the public schools (Church of England) in the districts of Kennebecasis and Selkirk; and in reply I beg to state that the various amounts quoted by you for each school are now available and may be expended for the purposes for which they were voted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J.W. Tims, Sarses Boarding School.\n\n(Copy)\n\nSarses Boarding School\nSarses Reserve,\nCalgary 18th, Dec. 96.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nSir,\n\nI have forwarded through the Indian Agent account for windmill, etc., for $150.00, which I believe was the amount granted by the Department for this purpose.\n\nAt the same time that it was erected we had pipes laid underground from the well to the school buildings, which gives us summer or winter a supply of water useful not only for ordinary purposes, but also in case of fire. I have asked the Agent to send the account for this with the other account to you. It is $70.00. If you can see any way of meeting this extra expense out of the unclaimed money for pupils or from any other source, it will be a great help to us. The school is small in numbers and therefore it is more difficult for us to undertake extra work of this nature, than it would be for schools where there are...\n192867\n\n-2-\n\nare more pupils receiving Govt. grants; but it was so important to have water in case of fire, that when the work was in progress and the men at hand it seemed a good opportunity to get it done.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner\n\nfor Manitoba and the North-West Territories.\n\nWinnipeg, Dec. 22nd, 1897.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 31st August last, I beg to enclose herewith voucher No. 22 in favor of the Massey Harris Co., amounting to $50.00 for well and windmill for the Garden Boarding School.\n\nI am also in receipt of another account (herewith enclosed) in favor of the same firm amounting to $70.00, for water connection from the well to the school, to furnish a plentiful supply of water for ordinary purposes, as well as for fire protection.\n\nI have not certified to the account, as there appears to be no authority for this expenditure, but I have herein enclosed for your consideration an extract of letter from the A.J. Pettingal, begging to say that in view of the usefulness of this improvement, I would recommend payment of the account, if funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n116951/5\n\n128/67\n\nOttawa 29th December, 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd instant, I beg to inform you that a cheque for $150.00 will be issued in favour of the Massey Harris Company in payment of Voucher No 192, for a well pump, tank, derrick and windmill furnished for the Sarsa Boarding School. But with reference to the account from the Company, which amounts to $70.00 for \"water connection from well to house,\" I beg to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General states that he cannot approve of payment as the expenditure incurred was unauthorized.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 29th December last, kindly inform me when the cheque for $150.00 mentioned therein in favour of the Massey-Harris Company, Calgary, was issued in payment of voucher No. 192, as the Company have lately written the Reverend Principal of the School stating that cheque has not yet been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 7th May, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo,\nI regret to say that payment of the Hon. Harris\nvote account (No. 198) amounting to $50.00 for a well-\npump, tank derrick and windmill for the Saugeen Boarding\nSchool, was overlooked, but a cheque has now been issued\nin payment of the same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon.

They read well and understandingly, with a clear enunciation, (not slurring the words as is too often the case with a long one particularly).\n\nTheir spelling was rather surprising by its accuracy.\n\nThey were up in Tables and have made good progress in arithmetic according to each standard.\nIn Geography they have a wide general knowledge with some specific knowledge as regards this country. I saw that the Teacher had gone outside Schoolroom routine in giving them \"talks\" on general subjects, and that the pupils have taken a good deal of it in - a form of teaching in addition to routine - that should be more general than it is, as Indian children neither learn from their parents or from each other like White children and are dependant upon their teachers entirely for instruction and when this is limited strictly to school-room work, their progress in common sense knowledge (I may call it) is very slow indeed.\n\nSchool-room.\n\nThrough a rearrangement of the offices of the building the school-room is now a well lighted building of sufficient size to accommodate comfortably all the pupils.\n\nIt is furnished with patent seats, blackboards, maps, lesson cards, teachers chair and table; also an organ.\n\nDormitories.\n\nThese are large, clean, well ventilated, and furnished with single iron cots - they were neatly made up with clean linen and clean bed clothing, with colored counter-pane.\n\n--Lavatories--\n\nThese are on the lower floor, they were\nwere clean and in order.\n\n-Clothing Closets-\n\nA large one for the boys contained quantities of new clothing - such as suits, shirts and underclothing.\n\nWhile another one for the girls contained dresses, petticoats and underclothing.\n\nI understand that most of this clothing was donated, it shows that this school has large hearted and liberal friends.\n\nThose friends had not forgotten the little girls for there were dolls of all descriptions which had been thoughtfully sent for their amusement as well as instruction, for there is a lot of instruction in dressing and undressing a modern doll.\n\nThe girls matron had large quantities of the girls handiwork to show me - well knitted stockings, hemming new underclothing, darning, &c., they also do their share in general housework, cooking and kitchen work.\n\nThe boys and girls are all well clothed and look healthy and well nourished.\n\nBy a reference to my list of names you will observe that one of the pupils has been more than a year at school, 3 over two years, 1 over 4 years, 7 over five years, and 2 over six years, and 2 may be called new pupils having been there only one quarter.\n\nThe head boy has just been promoted to\nthe Calgary Industrial School to learn a trade.\n\nIf they were White children the larger number after so many years at School would be fit for graduation, but Sarcee children have even more to contend against than other Indian children, not the least being their native dialect and peculiar disposition.\n\n-Fire extinguishing appliances-\n\nThe fire buckets were filled with water in the dormitories, the fire axes were in convenient places, and hand grenades were distributed about.\n\nA Windmill for pumping purposes has been added to the establishment since my last visit to this school.\n\nThey have a large and productive vegetable garden, it is a great fight to keep down the gophers which are numerous and very destructive. The boys and Teacher have done all the work therein.\n\n-Building-\n\nMy attention was directed to the sinking of the foundation of the main and original building, caused by the caving in of the cellar which was never properly constructed, a few hundred dollars, say $250.00, would set this matter right now; while if it is not attended to will soon end in the destruction of the buildings.\n\nAll\nAll the buildings require to be repainted, outside as well as inside. The fences are in good repair, and the whole establishment presents a creditable appearance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd) T.P. Wadsworth.\nInsp. Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to that paragraph of Mr. Inspector Wadsworth's report upon the Saree Boarding School respecting the sinking of the foundation of the main building, and to say that the Supplementary Estimates include $180.00 for painting inside and renovating exterior, and $150.00 for lining cellar, and would suggest that it would be better if these were applied towards fixing up the foundation, rather than the object these are provided for, and thus not allow the building to collapse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 21st July, 1903.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant calling attention to the sinking of the foundation of the main building of the Cariboo Boarding School as reported by Mr Inspector Macintosh, he suggesting that it would be better if the amount voted in the Supplementary Estimates for painting and lining the cellar were applied towards putting the foundation into proper repair.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the amount voted in the Supplementary Estimates for painting, renovating and repairing is \u00a3200.00, and this sum may be used as you suggest.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

We are requesting Dr. Murray, the local Indian Agent, to give Mr. Gibney every assistance he can in his work and in obtaining a regular attendance of the pupils.\n\nWe are also requesting him to inform the Department regarding the redecorating required in the classroom and the approximate cost of any work which he recommends be carried out.

In this connection I have to request that you will inform the Department regarding the work required to be carried out, and you should also state the approximate cost. I say that our funds this present fiscal year are limited and unless there is urgent need to have the redecorating done at the present time it will have to stand over until next year. The Department will await your report as to the work to be done and the cost involved, when consideration will then be given as to whether it can be authorized at the present time or not. Your early reply giving the information asked for is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nThos. F.

These desks and seats are required for two extra pupils at our Day School. These pupils are Roman Catholics and it was the original intention of the parents to send them away to school at Cluny. As a consequence I made no seating provision for them, but as they will be now regular attendants I would respectfully ask the Department to grant authority for the additional equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, October 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, requesting authority to purchase two desks for use in the Sarose Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the last order for desks for this school was placed with the Western School Supply Limited, 1402 Rose St., Regina, per authority of official letter to you dated November 28th, 1924. As it will be necessary to have uniformity in the seating equipment, it is considered that the two desks asked for should be of the same type as those at present in the school. You may, therefore, place an order with the above firm to supply two single school desks of the size required, or with F. E. Osborne, Calgary, if you are satisfied that the single desks handled by him would match the desks at present in the school. The price charged should be F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in duplicate, covering the cost, and when the desks are received, if in a satisfactory condition, you should certify the account in the usual manner and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You should inform them definitely as to the sizes of the desks for which the rear and front seat are required. This information will, no doubt, be stamped in the castings of the desks.\n\nAfter the front and rear seats have been obtained, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThos. F. Murray, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nCalgary, Alta.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM THOS. F. MURRAY, INDIAN AGENT, CALGARY, ALTA., dated September 2, 1931, submitting Estimates for fiscal year 1932-33.\n\nOrig. on 1932E-1.\n\nThe enlargement of the schoolroom has been recommended by School Inspector McGregor, who states that we have not sufficient square feet in the schoolroom for the children in attendance. To enlarge this schoolroom there are two inside walls that can be torn down. A new floor can then be laid over stair wells. The foundation on both sides would have to be completed to take care of this floor. The outside wall could then be cut through and double doors put in. From the floor level to the ground is a distance of eight feet. A wide set of stairs, with balustrade, would have to be built from the floor level to the ground. A platform holding an outside porch (6' x 6'), with double doors, would be necessary. Two windows on each side of the door would have to be cut in the wall. To take care of the heating of this additional space, two new radiators would have to be installed. I am submitting this Estimate in order to conform with the School Inspector's recommendation.\n**WESTERN SCHOOL SUPPLY LIMITED**\n\n**SCHOOL EQUIPPERS**\n\nAGENTS FOR\n\nTHE PRESTON BALL BEARING DESKS, ALSO HYLOPLATE BLACKBOARD GLOBES, MAPS AND KINDERGARTEN SUPPLIES\n\n---\n\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Single Adj.

It is not a very good escape for small children. I would suggest that the Department builds a new fire escape as follows:\n\nHave a door cut through the end window with a 4ft by 3ft platform. This platform to have a 3ft railing with balustrades 3\" apart. Have steps leading to another platform 12ft below up against the side of the building. This second platform to be 3ft square. Then have steps leading to the ground at right angles to this platform. The steps should be made of 2x10 planking and the risers of 1x8 square edge. The entire steps from top to bottom should have a 3ft railing with the balustrades 3\" apart. The first platform would be supported from the ground below by 6x6 timber, spliced. In addition there should be three iron rods of 1\" diameter going through the building and being caught inside by a 2x4. The second platform could be supported by 4x4 timber. Every 4th step should have a \u00bd\" iron bar to ensure against any buckling. The door should open out on to the platform and the upper half should have four lights of glass. A mortise lock and a barrel bolt would be necessary for securing the door. The supporting timber could in its turn be supported and secured by 2x6 timber.\n\nFebruary 12th, 1938.\nSarcee Agency, Calgary.\nFebruary 12th, 1938.\n\nThe entire cost to build this fire escape would be $110.00. The lumber, nails and miscellaneous hardware and blacksmith material would cost $80.00; and the labour would cost $30.00.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFrom the school room to the ground, the distance is 24 feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJho. T. Murray\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the fire escape from the class room in the Sarcee Day School.\n\nYou may arrange for the erection of a new fire escape in the manner suggested in your letter. It is noted that the total cost of material and labour will not exceed $110.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. T. F.

Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\n597 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit price for installing Hot air Pipe Furnace in Building at Sarcee School. The work to be done in a first class and satisfactory manner for the sum of Two Hundred and Thirty Two ($232.00) Dollars.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 120-1-1 of the 5th instant re Installing of Hot Air Furnace in the Sarcee Reserve Schoolhouse. I was out to the building on the 9th with Mr. P. J. Kennedy of Calgary to look into the matter and beg to enclose herewith his quotation for installing the furnace which is to be an 18,000 cu.ft. capacity coal burning hot air furnace. I would not recommend a smaller size.\n\nThe building (class room) is 24' x 32' with 14' ceiling. The basement is full size with 10' ceiling. It is my intention to board off part of this basement as a furnace room and coal bin. The balance of the space will be used as a storage room for the hospital. There is an underground passage between both buildings.\n\nThe cost of material and labour for boarding the furnace room and coal bin; repairing the two entrances which have several steps (short staircases); one new door; two new sash; several panes of glass; renovating the interior (painting walls and floors); moving of blackboards and pupils desks back to the class room from the hospital building where they now are and the making of two outside toilets, etc. will be approximately $220.00. I am enclosing herewith lists handed to me this day by Dr. T. F. Murray, the Agent. These were prepared by Mr. Phos. H. Varcoe, the handyman and carpenter at the Agency. I would recommend purchasing the material and having Mr. Varcoe do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 15, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to re-opening the classroom on the Sarcee Reserve.\n\nInstallation of a new hot air furnace is approved. It is noted that you have secured a price of $338.00 from P. Kennedy, Calgary, Alta. The Purchasing Branch here suggests that, if you have not already done so, you should also obtain a quotation from J.A. McLean, c/o Bell & Morris, Calgary. The business should be placed with the firm quoting the lowest price for a furnace that will adequately heat the building.\n\nPurchase from local sources of the material required for repairs is also approved. It is noted that the total cost of this material will be approximately $158.35.\n\nYou state that the cost of labour will be $59.20 but in the last part of your letter you mention that Thos. H. Varcoe can do the work. If he does the work I presume that there will be no expenditure for labour.\n\nI trust you will find it possible to have the work done at the earliest possible date and the new classroom put in use when the repairs are completed and the furnace installed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRe employment of Mr. Thos. H. Varcoe, I regret that I did not make myself clear on this point, and that I confused you somewhat in the matter, by referring to him as \"carpenter and handy-man at the Agency.\" Mr. Varcoe is not in our service, or a member of our Staff: The following is an abstract from my inspection report dated May 29th, 1941, Page 5:\n\n\"Mr. Thos. H. Varcoe - Fireman-Engineer-Handy-man. While not a salaried employee, this man makes his home at the hospital, where he does the work of fireman-labourer, handyman and chore boy, for his board and room. He is a fair mechanic and engineer, and a good farm carpenter. From information I got in conversation, he came to the reserve in 1934, with the Department's approval, to work on Indian buildings (houses) for which he was paid from Band Funds. In between times, he did odd jobs at the Agency and hospital, for which he made no charge. He remained and has now become a living part of the institution. His doing so for his board and room saves us the cash salary of a fireman-engineer. He is a good worker, well behaved, unassuming, does not interfere, and would be missed by everyone on the reserve were he to leave. When there is any carpenter work to be done on the reserve for the Indians, or the Department, he is employed to do so, and is paid -- from Band Funds or Appropriation, as the case may be. He appears to be well satisfied with his lot, and wishes to remain where he is and carry on as he has been doing for the past seven or eight years.\"\n\nThis will explain how he came to the Agency, where he has remained.\n\nAs will be noted, Mr. Varcoe has submitted a quotation for each piece of work to be done, and he now informs me that this was based on an hourly rate of 40\u00a2. He has his own tools. I would recommend giving him the work, which I feel certain he will do most carefully and satisfactorily. I do not believe that we could get an outsider to go to the Reserve and do the work for 40\u00a2 per hour.\n\nI have asked Dr. Murray to obtain quotations on the material required, and to have same delivered at the Agency as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nCalgary, January 19, 1942\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 120-1-1 of the 15th instant, approving of the installation of a hot air furnace at the Sarcee Indian Reserve Day School.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter, I immediately got in touch with Messrs. Bell and Morris, of Calgary, who informed me that Mr. (Major) J.A. McLean had joined the Army, and was not now in the furnace business, and that they (Bell and Morris) did not handle hot air furnaces. They recommended Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company (Mr. Wm. Anderson), or the Chesney Hardware Company. Both of these firms are on the preferred list.\n\nI then got in touch with Mr. Wm. Anderson, who stated his firm did not handle hot air furnaces.\n\nI then contacted the Chesney Hardware Company, and Mr. C.L. Chesney drove out to the Reserve with me on Saturday, the 17th instant. He has now handed me his quotation, which I enclose herewith, together with cut and specifications.\n\nI have also asked Mr. P.J. Kennedy to give more details re the furnace on which he had quoted: (Ref. my No. 408-11A of the 12th instant, forwarding his quotation). I asked him to give the name of the manufacturer, and state whether the furnace was an all-cast, heavy duty. Mr. Kennedy has this day handed me the Beach Foundry Ltd. illustrated pamphlet, which I am attaching hereto, stating that he was quoting on a No. 519 furnace, which I have marked on the pamphlet, in red.\n\nI presume that the Department can decide from these, which is the best value, and I beg to ask for instructions, by radio, please, as the furnace will have to be ordered from Edmonton or Winnipeg.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to installing a hot air furnace in the Sarcee Reserve Day School.\n\nAs I advised you in my letter of the 15th instant, you are authorized to place the business with the firm quoting the lowest price for a furnace that would adequately heat the building. I feel that you are in a good position to decide which of the two offers you have received is more suitable. Besides, you should take into consideration the necessity of having the furnace installed in the immediate future and, therefore, it would appear desirable to deal with the firm that can give you the quickest delivery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.P.

We have discussed fixing up a couple of balcony rooms to look after about eight patients, and fixing the whole building, so I am not quite clear just what your statement covers.\n\nPlease reply by return air mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

The Medical Branch requires this building for a hospital and it is, therefore, necessary for this Division to repair the former day school which has not been used for some years. Authority was given to Mr. C.F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, for the following expenditures:\n\nRevelstoke Sawmill Co. Ltd.\n\nLumber for repairing the school and erecting toilets ............. $189.30\n\nP. Kennedy\n\nNew furnace ......................... $255.00\n\nWith regard to the latter item your Branch suggested that prices be obtained from Messrs. Bell and Morris of Calgary, Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company, Chesney Hardware Company and P. Kennedy, Calgary. Mr. Schmidt ascertained that both Bell and Morris and the Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company are not handling hot air furnaces at the present time. Prices were obtained from the Chesney Hardware Company and P. Kennedy. Each of them quoted the same price, namely, $255.00, and Mr. Schmidt placed the business\nwith P. Kennedy as he was in a position to supply and install the furnace immediately.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase orders so that the above two accounts may be paid.

The Medical Branch requires this building for a hospital and it is, therefore, necessary for this Division to repair the former day school which has not been used for some years. Authority was given to Mr. C.F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, for the following expenditures:\n\nRevelstoke Sawmill Co. Ltd.\n\nLumber for repairing the school and erecting toilets .............$ 189.50\n\nP. Kennedy\n\nNew furnace .........................$ 238.00\n\nWith regard to the latter item your Branch suggested that prices be obtained from Messrs. Bell and Morris of Calgary, Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company, Chesney Hardware Company and P. Kennedy, Calgary. Mr. Schmidt ascertained that both Bell and Morris and the Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company are not handling hot air furnaces at the present time. Prices were obtained from the Chesney Hardware Company and P. Kennedy. Each of them quoted the same price, namely, $238.00, and Mr. Schmidt placed the business\nwith P. Kennedy as he was in a position to supply and install the furnace immediately.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase orders so that the above two accounts may be paid.

Phelan\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have just heard from our teacher at the day-school on the Sarcee Reserve in which Mr. Rowe asks for some assistance in regard to his school. As you know the former Residential School is now being used for hospital purposes and the day-school is carried on in a separate building. Mr. Rowe recovered the use of the basement, which was being used as a workshop by the Caretaker of the hospital. He used it as a playroom as well as a workshop for manual training. He is anxious to have the floor of the class-room repainted and to have the basement redecorated and the porch painted. I understand that your agent is requesting these repairs but desire to add my personal endorsement. Mr. Rowe is working hard under difficult circumstances and I feel he is worthy of any encouragement we can give him.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nHAA/MC\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the Sarsse Day School.

Box 129,\nCalgary.\n\n23rd, November 1945\n\nDr. T.F. Murray,\nAgent,\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt would be of very great help with me, as the teacher at Sarcee Day School, if you will again take up with the proper Authorities the matter of providing a Piano for our School. You are of course aware that since I commenced my duties here I have asked for this most necessary item of School equipment.\n\nIn his Report last year Inspector Wilson, the Provincial Inspector urged that a Piano be obtained. He visited the School again this week and was not happy that we are still without the piano. The singing as we are able to undertake it, without music pleased him, and better work could be done with the assistance of music.\n\nYou will remember that the Piano that used to be in the School when Mr. Gibney was teacher, was his own property, and was sold by his Widow. I am getting to the position where I feel I must do something about the purchase of a Piano, and recently I have been looking for used Pianos at the Eaton Company. Something that will be of good service to us is obtainable from $240 to $260. I am sure that I can get a reduction if I purchase myself. However you will realize that with my little family this means a considerable outlay and the money difficult to find. However I would go ahead, if I had from you or from the Department some assurance that they would give me some assistance, at least.\n\nEatons of Calgary have been kind enough to put a Reserved card on a Williams Upright used Piano and will hold it until they hear from me. The price is $40.00, and as a Clergyman I would get 10% off of that and possibly by seeing the Manager who is a Sarcee Chief (Cut Knife) more consideration could be arranged. Will you therefore kindly take up this matter with the Department by Air Mail so that I may make some decision within the next few days.\n\nI can only add, that I am a fair Judge of instruments and mechanically this one is good\u2014it has defects on the Case which is of no disadvantage for the School.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher-Sarcee Day School.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Reverend L.F. Rowe, teacher of the Sarcee Indian Day School, in which he requests the Department to furnish a Piano for the school-room. This is the first occasion on which Mr. Rowe has asked for a Piano. There is no doubt that a Piano would be of considerable assistance in teaching singing to the Indian school children. However, the request for the Piano was made to me three months after my 1946-47 Estimates were forwarded to Mr. Inspector C.P. Schmidt. Neither was a request made for this Piano before the 1945-46 Estimates were compiled. The amount requested by Reverend Rowe is considerable for a used Piano; but, I am not familiar with the prices required for these instruments. The Department is undoubtedly familiar with the necessity for a Piano in the teaching of Indian children. Consequently, I beg to have the Department's opinion as to the advisability of this purchase.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 10, 1945.\n\nDr. T. F. Murray, Indian Agent,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to purchasing a piano for the Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\nIt is not our general practice to purchase equipment such as this for reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you. In any case, we would not consider allowing the amount mentioned by Mr. Rowe. While the piano which he mentions may be worth the amount requested, there are often possibilities of securing second hand pianos, in reasonably good condition, for a much lower price. Due to the requirements of the Armed Services, second hand pianos have been bought up rather readily during the past few years and consequently there are very few on the market. I am inclined to feel that this condition will change within the next few months and if it is possible to secure a second hand piano at a lower price than that mentioned by Mr. Rowe, you might bring the matter to my attention later.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to give you an extract from a letter received from our present teacher, Rev. I. F. Rowe:\n\n\"The Class-Room. This building adjoins the former Residential School Quarters, now termed Sarcee Hospital. As a room it is fair, being recently redecorated and is fairly well equipped with desks and other necessary articles. There is a very nice cloak room for the girls and ample space for boys. The heating arrangements are poor. During the days of the Residential School this Room was heated by steam from the main plant, and was never apparently very satisfactory, being slow in heating up in the morning. After becoming a Day School a hot air furnace was placed in the school basement. This works well enough during mild weather. While the Furnace has some defects, as all such installations have, the trouble is not the Furnace. To-day, as an illustration, with the Temperature about Zero, the class room was at no time above 55 deg., very draughty and altogether most uncomfortable. On the West wall are two cold air suction grates, placed there with the intention that they induct the cold air from the room into the air jacket of the furnace. During cold times and when there is the least bit of wind they reverse their function sending a cold draft across the teachers back and then upon the children's feet. This adds up to the fact that some insulation is needed around the top of the basement wall and floor of the class room, also the ceiling of the said room. If something could be done to overcome this trouble it would be of great satisfaction to Children and Teacher. Too much time has to be spent by the pupils warming up around the hot air vents. I might add that in Calgary a teacher has the liberty to dismiss her pupils should the class room be under 60 degs.\n\nAs we have asked for the appointment of a lady teacher, Miss Winnifred Timms, from the beginning of the year I trust it may be possible to have your local agent attend to this obvious need. Apparently it is mainly a matter of insulating the building properly so that the heating plant may be able to function.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\"\nOttawa, 28th December, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, I am writing to Indian Agent at Sarcee requesting him to take the necessary action to improve conditions in the classroom at the Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

Murray, Indian Agent, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nThe Secretary of the M.S.C.C. has forwarded to this office a letter he received from Reverend L.F. Rowe regarding the Sarcee Indian Day School. This letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"After becoming a Day School a hot air furnace was placed in the school basement. This works well enough during mild weather.

I understand from Dr. Moore that our staff at Sarcee is upset at the present time, due to the illness of the Indian Agent and the difficulty of obtaining a cook.\n\nBoth Dr. Moore and myself felt that the midday meal for the pupils should be continued if it was possible to secure anyone to do the work.\n\nThe only solution at the present time appears to be to have the teacher arrange for this. Dr. Moore stated that he would be prepared to pay for the cost of the food required, from the Medical Appropriation.\n\nDr. Moore expects to visit the Sarcee Reserve in May and it may be possible to place everything on a more secure running basis.

Murray, Indian Agent, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to requisition of the 24th ultimo, you may purchase the following articles for use at the Sarcee Day School:\n\n- 3 Brooms,\n- 1 Dustpan\n- 1 Small brush,\n- 1 Door mat, large\n- 1 Foodscraper,\n- 25 yds. Cheesecloth,\n- 1 qt. O-Cedar oil,\n- 50 lb. Dustbane,\n- 1 carton Toilet paper,\n- 2 Wash basins,\n- 1 Water cooler with tape, 3 gal. size,\n- 1 case Drinking cups.\n- 18 ft. Skipping rope\n- 1 carton Paper towels.\n\nIn requesting sixteen desks, the teacher used the terms, 1, 2 and 3. The term we use at the present time is large, medium and small. Will it be in order for use to supply four large size, movable desks, eight medium size and four small size?\nIt is extremely difficult to obtain footballs, however, we might be able to secure a football here for $5175. Possibly you could purchase one in Calgary for the same amount. If so, you may do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\n\nAn effort is being made to temporarily improve the above school, to brighten the environment and provide better heating facilities for the coming winter. To accomplish this, the following units will be required:\n\n1. Circulating Oil Heater for the schoolroom, estimated cost from $25.00 to $30.00. If a new school is constructed later on, this heater may be used therein, or traded in on whatever type of heating unit is then installed.\n\n2. A second hand coal range for the basement, to be used to heat the school floor and the basement room where manual training is conducted. Also, to heat soups etc., to augment lunches carried by the pupils who must come too far to warrant their returning home for the noon-day meal. Cost is only an estimate, but a good second hand coal stove could be purchased at around $35 to $40, possibly less.\n\nThe old furnace presently used is not satisfactory. The firebox and jacket are in poor shape, and I am advised by the tinsmith that additional heat take-offs and registers could not be installed. Circulation is poor.\n\nWith minor repairs in addition to the above, the school may be made clean and brighter at a minimum of expense. Enrollment is expected to be in excess of thirty students. This school is bleak and dismal in its present condition, and very cold and draughty in winter. Storm sash must be made for the lower portion of the deep windows, and basement windows must be sealed.\n\n(over)\nAn entirely useless partition is being removed from the basement to allow more room for manual training and for recreational facilities in winter. In addition to the heater and stove, as well as five storm sash at a total cost of approximately $20.00, there will be such items as nails and possibly some small hardware. From two to three days labor on the part of a carpenter will be required, and any lumber or other materials needed can be salvaged on the spot.\n\nThe coal stove can be purchased at any time, but your approval is requested in order that purchase of the oil heater might be protected by placement of an order now. These heaters are very much in demand and are in short supply.\n\nFor your consideration and approval please.\n\nG. H.

A second-hand coal range has been secured for the basement, and arrangements must now be made to have the old furnace removed before the range can be set up.\n\nThe Rev. L. F. Rowe, Anglican Missionary in charge of the St. Barnabas Mission, Sarcee Reserve, has asked if this old furnace might be turned over to him for use in the small Church on the Reserve. The firebox in this furnace is no longer serviceable and the only salvage value rests with the galvanized iron jacket and service pipes. Mr. Rowe proposes to break this furnace down and use the iron to install a heating system in the Church.\n\nThe cost of breaking this old furnace down, removing the pipes and closing the floor outlets, would run around $30.00. Mr. Rowe has offered to have this done at the Mission's expense, and has also offered to set up the range now on hand.\n\nI beg to recommend that this furnace be written off and turned over to Mr. Rowe on the above basis.\n\nG.

I can find no record of this at Sarcee, but I am taking the liberty to forward this requisition.\n\nMiss Tims has a friend who carries on the hobby of molding pottery from clay, a hobby which he developed while in Italy. He has volunteered to demonstrate his ability at the Sarcee School and to instruct the Indian children in this enterprise. For this reason, she is asking for 25 lbs. of pottery clay, which I imagine we can secure from the Medicine Hat Potteries. All of these items listed in this requisition can be secured locally if this is your wish.\n\nR. F. Battle,\nClark in Charge,\nSarcee Indian Agency.\nOttawa, January 31, 1947.\n\nSarcee Indian Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is no record on our files of the supplies which you mention in your letter 120-18-11 of January 27th. You can purchase these supplies locally. I have so approved the requisition form.\n\nThe only item that I would query is that of 25 yards of cheese cloth for dusters. In view of experience at other schools, this amount seems rather excessive. However, we will leave it to your own judgment to decide on the quantity required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWe understand from the Director of Indian Health Services that the demolition of the old Indian hospital building on the Sarcee Reserve can be anticipated. It is our intention to use as much of the lumber as possible in the construction of the proposed new day school on this reserve.\n\nUpon Mr. Connolly's return to Ottawa we will discuss this matter with him and will write you further in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nINDIAN HEALTH SERVICES\n\nCalgary, Alberta, April 29\n1947.\n\nDirector, Indian Health Services,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,- With Mr. C.J. Connelly and local Indian Affairs officers I have gone over the old Sarcee Hospital again. It is universal local opinion, which I think Mr. Connelly will join in, that the building should be torn down while its salvage value is still considerable and before it burns down from causes unknown. I believe that Mr. Connelly will report that its renovation cost would be prohibitive and I cannot conceive of any useful purpose it could serve.\n\nThere is much useful, and more useless, equipment in it. I have directed that:\n\n1. Equipment suitable for a local nursing station be selected and put into safer storage at the Agency. This will include a good chesterfield suite, a good dining room suite and two good beds and dressers; ample kitchen equipment except a range; much good linoleum; a very limited amount of dispensary or clinic room furnishings.\n\n2. Some square yards of linoleum, surplus to local needs, be taken up and sent to the Indian hospitals in southern Alberta for patching or other minor use; other linoleum to be used to cover the floors of two rooms in the Sarcee Agency offices which are being fitted up for a temporary medical clinic.\n\nThis will leave over a lot of miscellaneous articles, the best of which are about 24 good hospital beds without casters and with many defective but repairable springs; a number of good bedside tables; and much kitchen equipment.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inquire whether:\n\n(a) The Department can think of any use for the building or, to put it otherwise, whether it concurs in its being demolished.\n\n(b) It will be in order to invite representatives from Indian hospitals in southern Alberta to come and select what they can use at their hospitals.\n\n(c) Whether it will be in order to turn over what remains to Indian Affairs for free distribution among old and needy Indians.\n\n(d) Whether it will be in order to have the hospital beds repaired. The heads and feet are all good, the spring frames are good, the cable netting is mostly bad. I should say that the cost of repair would be $2 or $3 per bed. They will need 4 inch rubber castors to bring them to standard height.\n\nM.B.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention of the Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nRe: Old Combined Residential School and Hospital Building, Sarcee Agency\n\nAttached hereto please find copy of letter sent to the Director, Indian Health Services, by Dr. E.

The equipment & furnishings can be stored & transferred elsewhere.\nWith reference to your letter of April 29 addressed to the Director concerning the Sarcee Hospital, Dr. Moore states that the Indian Health Services have no further use for this building and that the equipment and furnishings can be stored and transferred elsewhere.\n\nIt is understood that the public health nurse visits Sarcee on certain pre-arranged days and there is some accommodation in the agency residence for her work. It is not felt that we should consider, at this time, providing living accommodation for the nurse right at Sarcee as I believe she also visits Morley and Blackfoot Reserves.\n\nYour suggestions regarding the equipment in the hospital are approved and you may proceed to make the necessary arrangements for storage of such equipment as is not to be used immediately. Any of this equipment that can be used in the hospitals and nursing stations elsewhere should be transferred.\n\nIt is felt that the hospital beds (24) should be repaired and when we have use for them in nursing stations or hospitals they can be moved wherever they are required. Any miscellaneous articles that you feel will not be required by Indian Health Services can be turned over to Indian Affairs as you request in item (a), para. 2 of your letter. I presume that the Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, will take the necessary steps to demolish this building and use the material where they require it.\n\nDr. B. L.

Ltd.\nStony Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alta.\nJuly 17th, 1947.\n\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAlta. Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRE: Demolition of Sarcee Indian Hospital Building\n\nWith reference to the m/n subject and in accordance with instructions received from the Branch, an effort has been made to obtain a quotation on the m/n work.\n\nThe Ziegler Construction Co. of Calgary, Alta., was requested to look over this building in the company of the writer and Mr. M. McLeod, now in charge of the Sarcee Indian Agency. The attached quotation has been received in connection with this work. As will be noted, the quotation appears to be extremely high and in conversation with Mr. A.R. Williamson of this company, we have been advised that it will approximate 2 or 3 months work and will employ one foreman, three experienced whites and 9 to 12 Indians, all of whom, I understand, would have to be paid the minimum wage rate and would necessarily have to be covered by Workmen's Compensation.\n\nThe tender would include the removal of the large heating boiler, piping, radiators, plumbing fixtures and electric light fixtures. All lumber would be de-nailed and piled. All windows and frames stacked and the site levelled, leaving only a lean-to building housing the well and pump which would be used for stock watering purposes on the Agency premises.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of salvageable material in this building, as well as the heating plant, radiators with the necessary piping, there are a number of baths, toilets and hand basins.\n\nThe removal of the heating plant in itself would require more or less special equipment, and the heavy water and steam carrying pipes, which in the basement are insulated with asbestos, would also require technical knowledge.\n\nThere is also a considerable quantity of fir flooring which, if taken up, would have salvage value. With all this equipment in mind the writer has wondered if such fixtures as the heating plant, piping and radiators, the plumbing fixtures etc., could be offered as salvage and sold to the highest bidder, leaving such successful bidder to remove same. But in considering this, the writer wonders, if such material were moved out of the building by experienced contractors such as this or some other company, whether a higher bid would not be obtained as salvage over that of offering the same in the building when the successful bidder would have to remove same.\nAs the Branch is aware, this is a fairly large building and is in very bad condition, and if allowed to remain in its present state might leave the Branch open to severe criticism when supplies of this nature are at a premium.\n\nThe writer feels that merely to go in and tear the building down would be the wrong policy, especially in view of the fact that the equipment therein has a certain value. It is suggested that, perhaps, it might be advertised on a basis of taking down the building, salvaging of saleable products and perhaps comparative prices might lower the bid which the writer is now presenting. I do not think we would be justified in merely putting on one or two white men with a number of Indians to tear the buildings down with due consideration to the materials as mentioned above.\n\nA second recourse would be to offer the heating plant, piping and plumbing for sale as and where is, then proceeding to tear down the building.\n\nThe writer would be glad of advice and instructions in the matter.\n\n(John E. Pugh)\nSuperintendent,\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Demolition of Sarcee Indian Hospital Building\n\nReference is made to your letters, file 120-1-5 (WT1) and 120-1-1 (WT).\n\nThe demolition of this building has been given considerable attention locally. Attached hereto you will please find a copy of the tender supplied by the Zeigler Construction Company of Calgary, and copy of a report by Superintendent Pugh.\n\nIt will be noted that the construction company offer to do this work at a cost plus five per cent basis and the company estimates the cost will total $9,200.00. It might easily exceed that amount, and after it is all finished it is difficult to say what value will be received for it. The building was erected in 1912, I believe, and has been chopped and added on to from time to time. It is equipped with some old obsolete plant and some new. It is very likely that considerable of the lumber and timbers that went into it will be of value, but there is bound to be considerable of little or no value except for kindling.\n\nIt is our considered opinion that the building should be considered surplus to our requirements on that Reserve, and turned over to the War Assets Corporation for disposal. Aside from some work that the Indians might get in tearing it down, it is not believed that our Branch is justified in carrying out this work in the hope of retrieving plant and material which may be used again.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nI convey in Mr. Borden's regard my attention.\n\nR. 3338\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, August 2, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nDemolition of Sarcee Indian Hospital Building.\n\nReference your 120-4E-2.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter and recommendation concerning the above building, the matter was referred to the Indian Health Services.\n\nDoctor Proctor has now advised me that he concurs in your recommendation that this building be declared surplus to our requirements on the Sarcee Reserve and turned over to the War Assets Corporation for disposal.\n\nWe are, therefore, today advising our Departmental Purchasing Agent of this decision. It is likely that Officials of the War Assets Corporation will later be contacting you in this regard. It will be in order for you to turn this building over to them at a time and date to be mutually settled.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. G.H.

The Indian Health Services concur in my recommendation.\n\nTherefore, could the necessary action be taken to have this building turned over to War Assets Corporation for disposal.\n\nOur records show the building was constructed in 1893 of log and frame building materials.

Pugh, Supt., Stony - Sarcee Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School & Teacherage.\nZiegler Const' & Manf' Co Ltd.\nFinal Statement.\n\nEnclosed herewith, please find final Progress Report on the marginally noted buildings constructed by The Ziegler Construction & Manufacturing Co Ltd., of Calgary, Alberta, under PB # 4459, dated 5/10/48.\n\nIn connection with the rendering of this statement it is desired to state that we have had some difficulty in getting these final figures and such have only just come to hand as will be noted from the date of Oct 5th 1949, and our comments are as follows:\n\n1. We note that the Company did not allow for the cement supplied by the branch, and in our statement we have made this deduction.\n\n2. Statement of change in material cost is attached, the Contractor using the escalator clause in their tender.\n\n3. The writer authorized the lining of the ceiling joists with Gyproc wall board, being of the opinion that open joists are dust collectors and a fire hazard, and we trust we did not exceed our authority in so authorizing.\n\n4. Bolting of screens was considered necessary by the inspector of engineering services, and this recommendation was carried out.\n\n5. Window screens have not as yet been placed on the school, it being impossible to obtain Galvanized wire as per specifications. We have authorized these screens in green wire.\n\n6. Levelling of grounds was carried out to our satisfaction and a little more done by the Contractor in this respect but no charge made for the additional work of levelling.\n\n7. We have not drawn up any instrument to cover the guarantee of workmanship and materials on this building, as laid down in the Specifications, and for this the occupation date we presume should result as at the opening of the School on September 6th 1949, although the teacherage was occupied by a teacher during the month of June 1949. Will the Branch provide this guarantee instrument?\n\n8. Additional works to this building have been dealt with and include \"Wiring of Building\", \"Floor Painting or Varnish work\", accounts having been cleared for the above.\n\n9. The writer is satisfied with the building as \"In Charge\" of construction, and recommends the attached final progress estimates for payment.\n\nWe presume that the Branch will provide for the protection or for the supply of the window screens as not having been supplied at this date. We will advise as soon as such are delivered.\n\nWe would recommend the payment of the outstanding accounts against this building as shown in our statement, unless such cheques if approved can be made payable to the firms concerned direct.\n\nJohn R. Pugh, Supt.,\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agency.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sarcee Day School\n\nFurther to our Army Message of September 28, attached you will find copy of Mr. Pugh's letter of October 10, together with progress payment claim No. 5 in favour of the Ziegler Construction and Manufacturing Co. duly completed.\n\nApparently this claim was sent to the Department of National Defence by Mr. Williamson and subsequently returned to Mr. Pugh. According to Superintendent Pugh's calculation the sum of $4,224.00 was still owed to the Ziegler Construction Co. The firm itself owes $4,598.60 to sub-contractors for work done on the Sarcee School.\n\nThese sub-contractors are continually phoning this office inquiring about their outstanding accounts. We have referred them to Mr. Williamson without success; their accounts still remain unpaid.\n\nIt is recommended that the sum still owed to the Ziegler Construction Co. be distributed among the three sub-contractors in amounts in proportion to the size of their accounts still owed them. It would be appreciated if these payments could be made to the Ziegler Construction Co. in three separate cheques and the cheques sent in care of Mr. Pugh so that they can be endorsed over to the sub-contractors.\n\nG.

As a result, we submit the following statement:\n\nContract Price........................................$32,430.00\nLess amount already paid..........................30,350.00\nBalance due on Contract.............................2,080.00\nLess payment for cement............................642.71\n\nNet amount due firm on original Contract...$1,437.29\n\nWe also owe the firm an amount of $937.80 for the erection of the toilets. This was an extra Contract and was approved by the Deputy Minister.\n\nMay I point out that the tender of the Ziegler Construction Company as contained in their letter of July 30th, 1948, was a firm tender in the amount of $32,430.00. This was the sum approved by P.C. 4459 dated October 5th, 1948. In view of this, we cannot understand the extras as shown on the attached statement, in an amount of $1,849.69.\nWe cannot find any record of having authorized the extras which the firm mentions on their account. If Items 1, 2 and 3 on the firm's statement were authorized by either Mr. Pugh or yourself, we would like to have a statement to that effect, giving the reasons for doing so. We will then be prepared to pay these items.\n\nWe are not prepared to consider paying the following:\n\n(a) 245 hours labour @ 7\u00a2 per hour increase in carpenters' rates as from April 1st, 1949........................................$ 17.15\n\n(b) Administration, use of equipment,\nPublic Liability Insurance and profit @ 10%.............................................$ 39.46\n\n(c) Difference in material costs as per statement attached..........................$1347.01\n\n(d) Extra on Stewart & Phillips invoice attached...........................................$ 68.60\n\nThere was no escalator clause in the original tender submitted by the Ziegler Construction Company.\n\nIn Mr. Pugh's letter he requested that three cheques be drawn, payable as follows:\n\nStewart & Phillips (Alberta) Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nWm. Sigalat Company, Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nApplicators Limited, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nIn connection with this request, I would refer you to official letter of May 31st, 1949, giving the decision of the Treasury Branch regarding the manner in which payments can be made when a situation arises as in the present instance. Consequently, we are forwarding to you two cheques, one for $1,437.29 and the other for $937.80, and you can handle them in the same manner as was done when you received a cheque for $5,350.00 with our letter of May 31st, 1949.\n\nPP/ST\n\ncc Supt.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\nYour file 701-5 (E) of Jan. 14/50\n\nWhen your letter of November 30th was received, Mr. Pugh and I interviewed Mr. Williamson of the Ziegler Construction Company. He maintained that the Company's original tender contained an escalator clause. Under cover of our letter of August 9th, file 120-6-3, we mailed you the original of the Ziegler Construction Company's offer and the copy we have on file contains the following notation below the signature of Mr. Williamson: \"N.B.- labour and materials costs subject to any increase after date of quoting\".\n\nHowever, we advised Mr. Williamson that we were prepared to recommend payment for the following extras mentioned in the first paragraph of the second page of your letter of November 3rd:\n\n| Item 1 and 2 | - $21.80 |\n| Item 3       | - $555.67 |\n\n$377.47.\n\nPayment for these extras had been previously recommended by Mr. Pugh and his reasons were outlined in his letter of October 10th, 1949, file 120-6-3. Items 1 and 2 were completed on the recommendation of the Inspecting Engineer and Item 3 was authorized by Mr. Pugh because he considered that the open joists on the basement ceiling constituted a fire hazard and dust collector.\n\nWe also advised Mr. Williamson that we would ask you to reconsider the following items.\n\n(1) Administration, use of equipment, Public liability Insurance and Profit @ 10%........ $39.46\n(2) Extra on Stewart & Phillips invoice........... $68.60\n   (for heating)\n\nTotal...........$108.06\n\nHowever, we gave the firm no assurance that these last two items would be paid. Mr. Ziegler stated that item 1 is standard procedure with Construction Companies and we asked him for statement to this effect, as well as a statement indicating the difference in cost of materials used in the heating installation which created the extra $68.60 under Item 2. Apparently the heating contractor could not obtain galvanized iron and was forced to use aluminum sheeting in carrying out the furnace work.\n\nMr. Williamson, on behalf of the Company, accepted the two cheques, one for $937.80 and the other for $1,437.20.\n\n(continued)\nThese were deposited and Mr. Williamson drew separate cheques and issued them to the sub-contractors as follows:\n\nWm. Sigalet Company Ltd........ $1100.00\nApplicators Limited............. 750.00\nStewart & Phillips .............. 484.00\nB.H. Sands and Son Ltd.......... 40.00\n\nTotal.......$2374.00\n\nAll this took place on December 5th. To date we have not received the information requested from the firm. Mr. Pugh has been in contact with them and wrote them as late as January 16th, again requesting the information.\n\nAlthough a cheque could be issued for the first three items totalling $377.47, we think this should be delayed until we have heard further from Mr. Williamson because I am of the opinion that if another payment is made to this firm, it should be definitely the final and last payment.\n\nIf Mr. Pugh does not hear from Mr. Williamson very soon we shall endeavor to contact him personally.\n\nG.

Gooderham Esq., Reg. Supr' Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alta.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRet: Sarcee Day School\nYour file 701 - 5\n\nFrom the minutes of a recent meeting of the Council of the Indian Association of Alberta, you will note there is a resolution asking that electric power be made available to the new school before the September term. In speaking to the resolution, the Chief of the Band stated that the school is three miles from the power line and it is intimated that the power line be extended to the school.\n\nIt is known that the Calgary Power has so large a demand on the available electric energy that it is not anxious for new business at present. The cost of running a line for three miles would, I believe, be greater than is justified.\n\nIf sufficient funds were still available, I would recommend that an electric unit be installed. The school is wired and the expenditure would be confined almost entirely to the cost of the unit.\n\nDuring a visit to this school this week with Mr. Blair Fraser, Ottawa Editor of Maclean's Magazine, electrification of the building came up for discussion. The principal of the school stated there is always a danger of using lamps and at the same time the light is poor. Everybody agreed that that was so and it was further agreed that it was poor business to put in a small 32-Volt plant. It is suggested that a 110-Volt automatic set, capable of producing 2000 watts would answer the purpose. It is estimated that the total cost of plant and installation should not exceed $750.00.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find requisition for a lighting plant for the Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\nQuotations were received from Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. and Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, and their quotations are enclosed.\n\nMr. Pugh was here yesterday and on going over the quotations received from the two firms it was considered that the 1750 watt with A.C. 110 volt and 32 volts D.C. would be the unit more suitable for this school for efficient operation, in that the teacherage can use the 32 volt battery line of the plant, and if in full operation for school and teacherage, the full capacity of 110 volts can be utilized.\n\nThe Bruce Robinson Electric Limited will install the plant, but the Branch will have to provide a concrete base. The cost of this is estimated at $10.00 for material and $15.00 for labour.\n\nThe building was wired for electric current at the time of construction, but no fixtures for lighting has been provided. It is impossible at the present time, due to snow blocked roads, to get a quotation on this, but it is estimated that $100.00 will cover, approximately, this expenditure.\n\nBruce Robinson Electric Limited have one of these plants in stock and will be ready to install it on receipt of the order.\n\nM.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nFurther to my letter of February 24th, and your reply of the 2nd, file 701-5 (E), Superintendent Pugh and Assistant Agent MacLeod went to a number of wholesalers, including C.G.E., Electric Wholesales Limited, Ashdowns Limited, Fairbanks-Morse Company Limited, and Bruce Robinson Electric Limited, to inspect what lighting units they might have to offer. Only the two latter companies had any unit to offer which was at all suitable. The other firms could not quote.\n\nMr. MacLeod has submitted a covering letter, with quotations from these two latter companies. Requisitions and copy of letter attached hereto.\n\nFollowing the suggestion that was made in my letter of the 24th, Bruce Robinson Electric's offer of a special combination unit is our choice for the reasons set out in Mr. MacLeod's letter.\n\nIf you refer to the Fairbanks-Morse quotations, the 2000 Watt, 115 Volt A.C. Automatic would be continually in operation while there is light, and this is not desirable. If power is being used only in the teacherage, there is no need for the full plant being operated. The 32 Volt D.C. Electric requires batteries and the total cost of this plant is not justified.\n\nIt is our firm conclusion that the Bruce Robinson's offer to supply a 1750 BAS plant, with a set of battery cells is the suitable plant, and it is hoped that the Purchasing Agent can see his way clear to purchase it. It is available for immediate delivery. If the plant is supplied, the fixtures can be installed in April.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\nYour File 119-6-1-3\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of January 18th and previous correspondence with regard to the settlement of the claim of the Ziegler Construction Company. Subsequently we received Superintendent Pugh's letter of March 6th with which he forwarded Vouchers 202, 203, 204 and 205.\n\nWe paid Vouchers 202, 203 and 205, but did not pay Voucher 204 (Increase in wage rate for carpenters $17.15), as there was no escalator clause in the original contract. Under cover of your letter of October 11th, 1949, you enclosed Superintendent Pugh's letter of October 10th to which was attached a list of the payments which the firm requested us to pay over and above their contract.\n\nOne of the items mentioned in that letter was the enclosed statement amounting to $1,347.01, and the company requested we pay this account, due to the fact that certain articles which presumably had to be purchased in the United States, cost more when the construction began than at the time the contract was awarded.\n\nA representative of the company visited us recently, and he admitted that there was no escalator clause in the contract. However, on compassionate grounds he requested that we reconsider our previous decision not to pay the enclosed account.\nBefore submitting the matter to the Minister's office for his consideration, we would appreciate having your comments. At the same time, you should return the statement which we are enclosing with this letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\ncc Superintendent J.E. Pugh\nApril 27, 1950.\n\nMr. J. W. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHorseshoe Bay, Alberta.\n\nSarcee Day School - Janitor Services\n\nWe have noted the comments of Mr. Crow Child as reported in the Minutes of the meeting of the Sarcee Band Council held on March 27, 1950.\n\nDepartmental policy is clearly outlined in a recent circular letter on caretaking in Indian day schools. Our educational expenses have risen rapidly and we feel that the least Indian parents and children can do is to assist to keep their day schools clean and orderly. This is done in most rural schools throughout Canada and we have never had any objection previously from the Indians to the children assisting the teacher in keeping the school clean. I feel that this matter should be raised at the next meeting of the Sarcee Band Council and that it should be explained to the council members that the Department is paying all expenses in connection with the operation of the Sarcee School. We have built them a very fine school, have equipped it with the latest educational materials and have provided two good teachers. Surely they should not object to their children helping to keep this new school clean and orderly as is done in small provincial schools.\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\n701-5 (El) of May 1st.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh included the account of $1,347.01 with his submission of October 10th last and I recommended payment at that time. I am satisfied that the Ziegler Construction Company felt that the increase in the price of materials was covered by an escalator clause although the company now realizes there was no escalator clause in the contract.\n\nThis company did a good job on the Sarcee School and they completed their work at a time when there was not only a shortage of materials but also costs were increasing. I am returning the account herewith and I recommend that the company's application for payment on compassionate grounds be given favourable consideration.\n\nG. H.

Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMorley P.O., Alta.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\nYour File 6-3-120\n\nWe have received your letter of the 24th ultimo and have noted the contents of the letter which you have written to Messrs. Middleton & Tait. You should forward the account on this contract as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPPST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention, Col: B.F Neary.\n\nUnder date of August 17th, Your File No 701-5 (E), addressed to G.H. Gooderham, sq., reg: Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta., we have been requested to complete the attached questionnaire, and report upon the progress of the Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is advised that no action was taken during the writer's vacation, and upon our return we contacted Mr Williamson, Manager of the Ziegler Construction & Manf Co Ltd, in connection with winding up this work.\n\nIn doing so, we pointed out that three Calgary firms had billed us for work performed under his Contract, stating that they had not received payment; these are:\n\nStewart & Phillips. Furnace ........................................ $993.60\nW. Sieglet & Co Ltd. Painting ........................................ $2200.00\nApplicator's Ltd. Roofing ........................................ $1400.00\n\nThese accounts were drawn to the company's manager with the request that he attend to the payments prior to our being off duty, and again after our return, but as yet not paid. In view of this we requested Mr Williamson to render his accounts in full on the project, indicating those accounts not paid, which we are advised are only the above, no other parties making any claim to-date to this he has agreed, and at the time of our interview with him, he advised that he had asked the Royalumber Lards Ltd, to supply him with \"Difference in Price Statement\" as between Contract Tender and Delivery\", indicating that the escalator clause in the Contract was applicable. We then asked for the complete accounting set-up, based on the contract and the above clause in order to submit the matter to the Branch, at the same time asking that he provide us with an order to the effect, that, under the contract, and providing there was sufficient funds from the project to their credit, we be authorized to either pay the above outstanding accounts, or that he would in the presence of a Field Officer, endorse such cheques that may issue to the respective firms, to which Mr Williamson agreed. We advised him to make the necessary deductions for cement provided by us, and to complete his accounts with all possible speed. The writer has now been advised by Mr Williamson that he is\nis in Vancouver, B.C., until the end of the month, but has requested a supply of forms to complete the accounting requested.\n\nThe building in question is completed to our satisfaction, except that the window screens have not been provided, due to the fact that Galvanized wire screening was specified, and this cannot be obtained, such information being given to us by The Royal Timber Yards Ltd., we therefore instructed Mr. Williamson to procure Black wire screens. Should this not meet with the approval of the Branch, may we so advised by return mail.\n\nThe question of occupancy does arise while the accounting is pending, and we advised Mr. Williamson of the fact that we desired to commence school on the 6th of September, and it is apparent, that we shall not have the matter cleared up at that time. Would our occupation of the building at the above date render the branch liable under the Contract?\n\nThe guarantee on the building for one year was also brought to Mr. Williamson's attention, and he was asked to provide this. Is there a special form for this purpose, if so may we be provided with same?\n\nIn reply to the questionnaire form provided by the firm of Middleton and Tait, we have answered this advisedly, and are attaching the complete file for your perusal, this action being taken in view of the existing conditions surrounding this Contract. May we be advised if concurred in as to the data provided on the above form.\n\nWe will forward the accounting on this Contract as soon as we are in receipt of same, and we regret very much that our powers of direction in this matter have been of so little avail, in spite of giving our full attention at all times.\n\nIn fairness to all concerned, we might add that construction of this type in winter months when remotely removed as to road conditions makes it a difficult task, and Mr. Williamson advises that this feature has entailed a loss. We feel that we should also mention the fact that this Company have been doing work for The Department of National Defence, and he informs us that they have a very substantial amount outstanding with that Department, hence their inability to meet the accounts quoted above.\n\nAdvise in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nJohn E.

Ltd. for painting and an amount of $1000.00 to the Roof Contractors (Sub.), Applicator's Ltd. in the latter case $400.00 being held, pending further inspection of the roof work.\n\nAs intimated to you the Branch cannot accept orders on your Contract, and we would suggest to you that the accounts be met by your firm, and receipts provided this office for such payment hereon made, as evidence of good faith.\n\nWe observed your remarks that your Company is in good financial standing, but that monies due in the amount of approximately $43,000.00 outstanding, chiefly with the Department of National Defence has occurred some delay in payment of your commitments. We trust that you will bear with us in our anxiety to close out our transaction with your Company in an earnest manner. We also observed that you are anticipating a settlement with The Royal Lumber Yards Ltd. covering the cost of lumber and materials as provided in the escalator clause in your contract as to prices at time of tender, and that this may be in the proximity of $900.00. When you have this matter in hand, we would appreciate your statement in full, please.\n\nThanking you for your attention,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn E.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\nYour File No. 120-6-3\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to accounts which have not been paid by the Ziegler Construction and Manufacturing Company. When Progress Payment No. 5 is being forwarded, these two accounts should be brought to our attention, if they have not been paid in the meantime.\n\nThe Supervising Engineer, Mr. Snelson, visited the Sarcee School on May 9th and attached information and list of items which he said were not completed on the date of his visit. Possibly they have been completed since that time and if not, arrangements should be made with the Company to have them carried out before final payment is made. We would also be interested in knowing when the building will be finally completed. In Mr. Pugh's letter of April 5th, he informed us that he expected the contract would be completed at the end of the first week in April.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nP.McN\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\n\nExtracts from Report of Supervising Engineer J.H. Snelson who Inspected this School on May 9, 1949.\n\nBuilding Outside:\nThe outside of the building is covered with brick imitation asphalt siding. This looks O.K. The roof is covered with asphalt shingles; many show a slight turning up and should be fastened down. The peak of the roof is not on the same level throughout, having a variation above and below the correct level, possibly \u00bd inch. It looks slightly wavey.\n\nPlaster on outside of concrete basement wall was carried down to present ground level only. When site is levelled or when fill around building settles, a ragged line showing lower extent of plaster will be exposed. Plaster should be carried down well below finished grade.\n\nAluminum flashing around water-table at bottom of asphalt siding should be painted. At present it shines and is not in harmony with siding.\n\nBuilding Inside:\nAll inside work in the classrooms and in other rooms is satisfactory with two exceptions:\n\n(a) Most doors have expanded due to moisture absorption and painting. Doors should be planed to fit.\n\n(b) Blackboards have absorbed moisture and bulged in centre as much as \u00bc\". Mould around edges should be removed, blackboards thoroughly dried out and cemented to wall underneath. When set, boards to be trimmed to fit replaced or renewed moulding.\n\nGeneral:\n(1) Basement floors were painted before concrete was thoroughly cured, hence paint did not all stick and floors will need repainting.\n\n(2) A metal sheathed door for the coal bin is yet to come.\n(3) The outdoor toilets have been finished and equipped with catch cans that must be emptied. Door catches are too close to jamb and will have to be reset.\n\n(4) Grounds are to be cleaned up.\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nDominion of Canada,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nZiegler Construction & Manufacturing Co.

Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Sarcee Mission - C. of E.\n\nAt a recent meeting of the M.S.C.C. Executive a motion was passed transferring responsibility for the operation of the Sarcee Mission from the I.S.A. to the Diocese of Calgary.\n\nIn the light of the above the Priest-in-Charge has been instructed to make out the monthly voucher for rental of the school house in favor of the Diocese of Calgary instead of I.S.A. commencing the first of June.\n\nThis information is given in the hope that confusion will not arise in your office over the voucher change.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook.\n\nHGC: MMA  \nSuperintendent.\nOTTAWA May 17, 1949.\n\nRe: Two Room Indian Day School,\nSarcee Reserve,\nStoney-Sarcee Agency, Alta.\n\nOn April 26th under your file 701-5, you asked us to secure an inspection report on the above project. This was done by J.H. Mitchell, our Supervising Engineer at Banff, and a copy of his report is attached hereto.\n\nThe necessary replacements and repairs mentioned, should be carried out before the building is accepted on behalf of the Department, or final payment made.\n\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nD.M. Mackay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n165 Sparks Street,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nBanff, Alberta.\nMay 12th, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Two Room Indian Day School,\nSarcee Reserve,\nStony-Sarcee Agency, Alta.\n\nIn compliance with your request of April 30th,\nMr. Snelson inspected this school on the 9th instant,\naccompanied by Mr. Pugh.\n\nWell\nA drilled well, at present equipped with a\nhand pump, 164 feet in depth, supplies 3\nbarrels of water (135 gallons) per hour.\nWater was struck at a depth of 96 feet.\nDrilling 70 feet deeper through slate fur-\nnished no additional supply.\n\nBuilding Outside\nThe outside of the building is covered with\nbrick imitation asphalt siding. This looks\no.k. The roof is covered with asphalt shingles;\nmany show a slight turning up and should be fas-\ntened down. The peak of the roof is not on the\nsame level throughout, having a variation above\nand below the correct level, possibly 1/2 inch.\nIt looks slightly wavey.\n\nPlaster on outside of concrete basement wall was\ncarried down to present ground level only. When\nsite is levelled or when fill around building\nsettles, a ragged line showing lower extent of\nplaster will be exposed. Plaster should be\ncarried down well below finished grade.\n\nAluminum flashing placed around water-table at\nbottom of asphalt siding should be painted. At\npresent it shines and is not in harmony with\nsiding.\n\nBuilding Inside\nAll inside work in the classrooms and in other\nrooms is satisfactory with two exceptions:-\n\n(a) Most doors have expanded due to moisture\nabsorption and painting. Doors should be\nplaned to fit.\n\n(b) Blackboards have absorbed moisture and\nbulged in centre as much as 4\". Mould\naround edges should be removed; black-\nboards thoroughly dried and cemented to\nwall underneath. When set, boards to be\ntrimmed to fit replaced or renewed mould-\ning.\n\nWalls are Gyprock wall board on studs strap-\nped and painted, good job.\n\nFloors are excellent, good edgegrain fir;\nwell laid, sanded and finished.\nGeneral\n\nBuilt up beams in basement, four 4\" x 10\" are rather loosely spiked together but are to be bolted, also every 3 feet.\n\nSome additional cementing was necessary around basement windows. This will need repainting.\n\nA large Good Cheer hot air furnace and necessary hot and cold air ducts have been installed.\n\nAll necessary conduits and outlet boxes have been built in.\n\nA full quota of storm windows have been made and painted. Screens have not yet arrived.\n\nAll conduit pipe is aluminum.\n\nBasement floors were painted before concrete was thoroughly cured, hence paint did not all stick and floors will need repainting.\n\nA metal sheathed door for the coal bin is yet to come.\n\nThe outdoor toilets have been finished and equipped with catch cans that must be emptied. Door catches are too close to jamb and will have to be reset.\n\nGrounds are to be cleaned up.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) J.H. Mitchell,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nper:\n\nT S Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Div'n.,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMay 31st, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nAs I understand, you are aware that Superintendent Pugh, under cover of a letter dated May 14th, forwarded a request for us to issue a cheque for $5,350.00 in favour of the Royal Lumber Yards Limited, and to charge same to the payments made to the Ziegler Construction Company. A letter from that Company was also enclosed approving the transaction.\n\nWe submitted a Voucher to the Treasury Branch, but they refused to issue a cheque, as they pointed out that it is contrary to Government practice to accept and act on Assignment of Accounts. They further pointed out as follows:\n\n\"There are two things you can do in the matter:\n\n1. I am enclosing three copies of C.T. 127, the usual Government Power of Attorney forms for completion by an incorporated company, and if the Ziegler Construction Company is willing to execute such a Power of Attorney in favour of Royal Lumber Yards Limited, we shall be governed accordingly.\n\n2. If you care to re-apply for the cheque in favour of the Ziegler Construction Company Limited, in the same manner as previous Progress Payments, we will\n\n.....2\nsee that the remittance is sent to your office who in turn could send it to Mr. G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor at Calgary. It would be an easy matter for him and of course would establish good faith if he got the Ziegler Construction Company to endorse the cheque \"Pay to the order of Royal Lumber Yards Limited.\"\n\nIn view of the above, I enclose cheque for $5,350.00 issued in favor of the Ziegler Construction Company. It is felt that if we sent the Power of Attorney forms, there would be considerably more delay in making payment.\n\nPP/ST\nEnc.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nRe:- Contract Sarcee Day School Accounts.\n\nEnclosed herewith, please find an Order issued by\nThe Ziegler Construction & Manufacturing Co Ltd of Calgary,\nAlta., contractors for the above school building.\n\nIn this connection, it is advised that the Royal\nLumber Yards advised our Calgary Office that the balance\nof their account had not been met by the above construction\nCompany, indications being that the bank had refused payment\non two cheques issued by the Company.\n\nMr G.H. Gooderham, then contacted the writer who\narranged an interview with the managers of both concerns,\nand in order to satisfy the Royal Lumber Yards Ltd as to the\naccount, Mr A. R. Williamson issued the attached order\nagainst his contract, which action on our part we trust will\nmeet with the concurrence of the Branch, and that the order\nwill be honoured against the balance due to this construction\nCompany.\n\nWe have drawn this up in the form of a Progress\nReport, which deemed advisable, and is payable to the Royal\nLumber Yards Ltd of Calgary. Original order is attached with\ncopy of letter to the writer covering the transaction.\n\nWe may add that the building has now been inspected\nby Mr Snelson of the Banff National Park Engineering Services,\nand his report may possibly be in your hands at this time.\n\nWe recommend this payment being made as above, as\nthis represents the balance due to this firm for the supply\nof all materials by this lumber yard.\n\nJohn E.

Original order is attached with copy of letter to the writer covering the transaction.\n\nWe may add that the building has now been inspected by Mr. Snelson of the Banff National Park Engineering Services, and his report may possibly be in your hands at this time.\nWe recommend this payment being made as above, as this represents the balance due to this firm for the supply of all materials by this lumber yard.\n\n(sgd) John E.

You will recall that I have written to you under separate cover concerning the teachers.\n\nWith regard to the official opening, the Department is encouraging such ceremonies in order to impress upon the Indians the responsibility which is theirs in ensuring that their children attend the new school regularly. I would suggest that you officially open the school on behalf of the Department and that you arrange for other speakers representing the Chief and Council, the Provincial Department of Education and other officials. I would naturally suggest also that a church representative be approached to speak.\n\nWe are arranging to order the teachers' furniture but this may take some time to arrive.

This has been in the hands of the undersigned. It is not known whether there is a new appointee at Banff in the engineering staff for our work, and therefore the writer has to suggest that we obtain either the architect or one of the engineers of the Dominion Public Works Department at Calgary to pass upon this building as noted above.\n\nShould the school be completed as anticipated by approximately April 9th next, would you recommend that we move into the school for teaching purposes after the Easter holidays, providing that the equipment in the line of desks and the procurement of the teachers is concluded by that time. The Chief, David Crowchild, has requested that the school be opened formally, asking that the Regional Supervisor, the Superintendent Stony-Sarcee Agency and other guests be invited to the opening.\n\nWe have referred to you a letter pertaining to the procurement of equipment for this school, and we trust that the requisition, which we asked the branch to complete, will be in the process of purchase and delivery.\n\nYour reply airmail will be appreciated.\n\nJ.

E. Pugh.\nRe: Two Outside Toilets - Schoolhouse & Teacherages.\nSarcee Indian Reserve, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWith further reference to our Tender submitted in the sum of $1057.80 for the construction of Two Outside Toilets as per plan and specification and our recent conversation regarding the cost of same we have to advise that when these were estimated for we allowed for the installation of a new 6' - 6\" Porcelain Urinal as from past experience of Plumbers as well as Building Contractors metal lined urinals do not stand up.\n\nWe have carefully re-estimated on these toilets and find that the only possible way we can reduce our figure is by supplying a Used Porcelain Urinal. The used Urinal would be in perfect condition, having been dismantled from a former Royal Canadian Air Force Training Station. This would reduce the Tender by $120.00 making our figure NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS ($977.80).\n\nWe trust this revised price will meet with your approval and will be glad to hear from you in due course.\n\nThanking you,\n\nWe are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nZiegler Construction & Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,\n\nPer A.

As the difference in cost between the used porcelain type and the metal lined is small compared to the formers durability and sanitary features, it is recommended that the used porcelain fixture be accepted in lieu of the metal lined.\n\nAssuming that the porcelain type fixture is acceptable to Indian Affairs, we consider the sum of $937.80 is fair and reasonable for the construction of the two separate buildings and the installation of fixtures as specified. The Ziegler tender is returned herewith for return to Indian Affairs.\n\nR.A.

E. Pugh asked the Ziegler Construction and Manufacturing Company to reconsider their tender on construction of 2 outside toilets at this school. In their original tender the company quoted on the basis of supplying a new porcelain Urinal for the boys toilet. These are quite expensive and though they could have reduced the cost by supplying a metal Urinal, it is understood that these have been found unsatisfactory because they are usually completely rusted within a year. The company are now able to obtain a used porcelain Urinal and accordingly have reduced their tender from the original figure of $1057.80 to $937.80 for the 2 toilets.\n\nAttached is copy of their new tender and we trust the new price is more satisfactory. If their new tender is accepted, will you please supply additional 2 copies of plan #837?\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRF8/MG Enos.\nZIEGLER CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING CO.

Pugh.\nRe:- Two Outside Toilets - Schoolhouse and Teacherages, Sarcee Indian Reserve,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWith further reference to our Tender submitted in the sum of $1057.80 for the construction of Two Outside Toilets as per plan and specification and our recent conversation regarding the cost of same we have to advise that when these were estimated for we allowed for the installation of a new 6' - 6\" Porcelain Urinal as from past experience of Plumbers as well as Building Contractors metal lined Urinals do not stand up.\n\nWe have carefully re-estimated on these toilets and find that the only possible way we can reduce our figure is by supplying a Used Porcelain Urinal. The used Urinal would be in perfect condition, having been dismantled from a former Royal Canadian Air Force Training Station. This would reduce the Tender by $120.00 making our figure NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS ($937.80).\n\nWe trust this revised price will meet with your approval and will be glad to hear from you in due course.\n\nThanking you, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nZiegler Construction & Manufacturing Co.\n(Per) A.R.

The plan is actually designed to allow southern lighting but we note that this fact was never brought to your attention. Your report is quite satisfactory to all concerned but would you please check this point in future building of all one and two-room schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCALGARY, November 19, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n\nRe: Sarcee Indian Day School\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your Army Message of November 19, in which you ask for a complete report indicating on whose authority the building was so constructed that the class room faces north instead of south.\n\nBefore construction of the school was begun at Sarcee, Mr. Ziegler and Mr. Williamson, of the construction company, met with Mr. J. E. Pugh and myself in this office. Among other matters discussed was the orientation of the building. Neither the plans or the specifications, so far as we could determine, made any mention of this in a way to indicate that the classrooms were to face south. Those of us who favored a northern exposure, based our stand on the fact that northern light is more evenly distributed throughout the room and is therefor steadier; that the direct approach of the sun's rays through windows facing south tends to cause considerable glare within the room so much so, that the blinds are usually drawn to cut out these rays. It had been fairly well agreed that a northern exposure should be used but to be more certain that we were correct in our choice, I called in Mr. Berton, who is an architect employed in the office of the District Resident Architect. He stated that if he were constructing the building, the classroom windows would be oriented to the north. He outlined briefly the reasons for this and his advice was given quite unofficially.\n\nWe therefor decided on a northern exposure, and the contractor marked the plan accordingly. It is not the purpose of this letter to argue against a southern exposure. Indeed, had we known the plan was designed to allow southern lighting, the matter would not even have been discussed.\n\nI quite casually mentioned the location of the school to Mr. Clark when I met him at Gleichen last Tuesday. The following day he wired me at Gleichen, and wired and phoned this office, recommending that the necessary structural changes be carried out. Neither I nor Mr. Pugh suspected for a moment that we were acting contrary to any specific Departmental instructions in this matter.\n\nThis is all I have to report on the subject.\n\nG. H.

Contract Agreement (in triplicate) duly signed.\n\n$10,000.00 Contract Bond #4504, Fidelity Insurance Company of Canada.\n\n3. Tender of Nov. 5/48 - $648.00 for electric wiring.\n\n4. Tender of Nov. 5/48 - $1,057.80 for outdoor toilets.\n\nAs soon as the contract and agreement are signed, we presume you will forward two copies to Mr. Pugh, one for his file and the other for the Ziegler Construction Company.\n\nBelieving that this building should be wired while it is under construction, we asked the Ziegler Construction Company to submit a tender on this. It will be unfortunate if we do not take this opportunity to wire the building even though electricity is not available immediately. The Calgary Power line runs about three miles from the building, and, if we were eventually able to tap into this line, power would be supplied at city rates. There is also the possibility that we might eventually purchase a local power unit.\n\nIf the funds are available, I recommend that the Ziegler Company's tender for the wiring be accepted. Building is proceeding rapidly, as they are now ready to run the concrete, and, if the wiring will be done, the firm should be advised as soon as possible.\n\nG. H.

Pugh, Indian Superintendent, Norley, he can obtain the necessary detail.\n\nActing Director.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Pugh\nAIRMAIL\n\nOctober 29, 1948.\n\nMr. John E. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nSavesc Day School and Combined Residence.\n\nPlease find attached, in triplicate, contract forms and labour conditions for completion by the Ziegler Construction Company. When the necessary bond has been obtained, you can have the signed contract and the bond returned here together.\n\nTOILETS\n\nA separate tender can be submitted for the cost of the toilets required. These can be the same as for the standard one-room Indian Day School. You can obtain a set of these plans in Mr. Gooderham's office and you will find the toilets outlined on the last sheet.\n\nINSPECTION\n\nThe primary inspection of this work will be carried out by yourself and the Progress Payment forms will be signed by you. However, we are requesting the Lands and Development Services Branch to have one of their engineers visit the project every fortnight or so and to advise you concerning the progress being made. The primary responsibility rests with this Branch as we have issued the contract. Due to pressure of work, our engineers are only undertaking the erection of residential schools, four classroom schools, and other large repair and construction projects.\n\nPROGRESS REPORT\n\nPlease find attached the forms used by the Department. The P.C. authority to be quoted is No. 4459 of October 5, 1948. Mr. Williamson signs the certificate of contractor and you can sign the certificate of engineer. Progress claims can\nbe made as follows:\n\n(1) Payment of $5,000.00 when main floor joists are in position.\n\n(2) Payment of $10,000.00 when the balance of framing is completed and the walls and roof are sheathed.\n\n(3) Further payment of $10,000.00 when the interior work has been completed.\n\nFinal payment will be made on completion of the entire work and on full performance of the covenants and clauses of the specifications.\n\nWhen submitting the progress reports, it will be necessary to provide the receipted accounts for materials and the time sheets covering labour. We will accept a certified affidavit as to the amount of material provided and labour performed.\n\nCEMENT\n\nThe cost of the cement provided will naturally be deducted from the total amount of the tender. Our records here indicate that we have received the yellow copy of the purchase order but that we have not yet received a voucher covering the cost of the cement. In view of the fact that the purchase order was issued by this Department, it will be necessary for the account to be paid by us.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F.

It was hoped that the Bonding Company would supply the bond immediately. As the nature of the contract was not known, this could not be arranged. I, therefore, concur in Mr. Pugh's request.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agency\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nOctober 15th, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sarcee Day School and Combined Residence\n\nWith reference to the construction of the above mentioned building, it is advised that we have today met Mr. Ziegler and Mr. Williamson of the Ziegler Construction Company in connection with the erection of this school and discussed the following points:\n\n1. Contract - Terms and Conditions\n\nWill this contract be available as soon as possible, as it is the intention of this company to commence work Monday the next, October 15th? The Construction Company cannot obtain the $10,000.00 bond until the issuing company views a copy of the contract. It is suggested that the contract be sent to me; I shall see that the bond is obtained and forwarded to Ottawa together with the signed contract.\n\n2. This tender does not include the provision of outside toilets, no plans or specifications being available at the time the tender was asked. It is estimated the additional cost would be approximately $350.00 to $500.00 per toilet. It is understood that two toilets must be provided, one for girls and one for boys.\n\n3. Inspection\n\nMay we be advised if the inspection of this work will be carried out by a Field Officer or by an officer appointed by the Indian Affairs Branch independent of your field service?\n\n4. May we be provided with the necessary Progress Reports, as we understand that this company will be making application for funds from time to time based upon progress of work at this school.\n\nIn connection with the above, may we ask if in support of the progress report, when rendered, would it be necessary to provide the receipted accounts for materials supplied and time sheets covering labor, or certified affidavit as to the amount of material provided and labour performed? It is possible that the Branch may have a specific rule in regard to the rendering of these on the basis of weekly, semi-monthly, monthly or on demand from the contractor.\n\nWith reference to the amount of cement provided - $25 sacks at a cost of $658.71, if advantage was taken of the discount, plus haulage charges of $74.00, totalling $642.71, which will be assumed by the Ziegler Construction Company in as much as they are now providing all the material and labour in their tender. May we be advised by airmail, in view of the fact that this company is commencing construction on Monday.\n\nJohn E. Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, October 18, 1948.\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request of October 14, we enclose labour conditions for insertion in the proposed contract for the construction of a two room Indian Day School at Sarcee's Indian Reserve, Alta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Industrial Relations.\n(M.M.

I. PB (the next page)\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision; failure by the Contractor shall fall so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed therefore by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification of the various classes of workmen employed, and directs the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officer of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of said contract until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting by statutory declaration showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with and that no claim has been made by the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the amounts claimed as aforesaid upon the execution of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfied to the Minister, the Minister shall pay out of such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payment for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the same rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained therefor, and that in all cases to which the terms of conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be assigned to the workmen.\n\nAll workmen employed upon the work contemplated in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Originally, it was planned to erect two one-room schools on this reserve, but when our Educational Survey Officer finished his inspection of the reserve, he recommended the erection of a two-room school at a central point.\n\nMr. Gooderham has indicated his willingness to have funds transferred from other projects so that a two-room school can be erected at Sarcee.\n\nMr. Gooderham has approached various contractors in and around Calgary but was only able to obtain two definite tenders. One of these is from the Watson Construction Company and the other, from the Ziegler Construction Company. This matter was referred to the Lands and Development Services Branch and I enclose a copy of their appreciation of the two tenders. You will note that they recommend the acceptance of the lump sum tender as submitted by the Ziegler Construction and Manufacturing Company, Limited.\n\nA submission to Council has, accordingly, been prepared.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 7, 1948.\n\nRe: Two-Room Indian Day School, Sarcee Reserve,\nStoney Indian Agency, Alta.\n\nWe have examined your file 120-1-5 Vol. 3 insofar as tenders for the above are concerned, and it is noted that Regional Supervisor Gooderham has had considerable difficulty in attracting contractors to submit tenders.\n\nYou will recall that this school was designed for erection by contract, and that specifications rather than a bill of material were furnished with working drawings. Unless the material is purchased and supplied through the Department, bills of materials are the responsibility of the Contractor.\n\nWe note that only two bona-fide tenders have been obtained by Indian Affairs namely:\n\n(a) From the Watson Construction Co., General Contractors, Calgary, Alberta, dated August 20th, 1948, on the basis of cost, plus 10%.\n\nTheir estimated cost is .................. $35,500.00\n\n(b) From the Zeigler Construction and Manufacturing Co., Ltd., of Calgary, Alberta, dated July 30th, 1948, giving three alternatives as follows:\n\n(i) Firm tender amounting to ............. $32,430.00\n\n(ii) To supply labour, sand and gravel only, with balance of materials supplied by the Department .......... $19,516.00\n\n(iii) With all materials supplied by the Department to carry out the work for a fee of 10% of the total cost or 12% of their established labour costs.\n\n(iv) Estimating the cost of labour and materials to be $27,350.00.00, to carry out the work for a fixed fee of $2,560.00.\n\nCommenting on (a), the Watson tender, we may say that the estimated cost is high, and that after providing for the cost of supervision, and any contingencies that might arise, after a straight fee of 10% had been allowed, the total cost to the Department would be in the neighbourhood of $43,000.00. This cost is not justified.\n\nRegarding (b), the tender from the Zeigler Co., it is noted that the tender under any alternative is subject to increase due to any rise in the cost of labour or material during construction.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, 165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nNotwithstanding, it is felt that the interests of the Department would best be served if the lump sum tender amounting to $32,430.00 was accepted by Indian Affairs, provided that assurance is obtained that the firm is of good reputation and financial standing. Authority from Council to accept the tender should provide an additional amount of approximately 10% to cover possible contingencies. A security deposit should be obtained from the Zeigler Co., before a contract agreement is signed.\n\nThe only other alternative of this firm that merits consideration is alternative (iv). This would require the preparation of a bill of materials by this Division as the basis for the purchase of materials by the Department. It is understood that the time involved precludes this action. It is pointed out in this connection however, that when an amount of 10% is provided for contingencies in addition to the fixed fee of $2,560.00, the total funds required will be in the neighbourhood of $33,000.00\n\nYour file 120-1-5 is returned herewith.\n\nT S.

As an alternative to the above \"Fixed Price\" the project could be undertaken on a \"Cost Plus\" 10% basis or total cost or a \"Cost Plus\" 15% basis provided your department purchased all materials.\n\n(D.) As a further alternative to the above quotations we would be willing to undertake this project on an \"ESTIMATED COST\" basis of TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED & EIGHTY DOLLARS ($27,380.00) for which our fixed fee would be TWO THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED & SIXTY DOLLARS ($2,560.00).\n\nThis work could be undertaken by us immediately and would be brought to a successful conclusion within approximately fourteen (14) weeks provided the contract was let immediately and thus allow for the rough work being completed before freeze-up.\n\nWe thank you for the opportunity of quoting and assure you of our very best attention should you favour us with this business.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nZiegler Construction & Manufacturing Co.

Mr. Lord, the new Anglican Missionary for the Sarcee Reserve, called at this office today. In view of the fact that the Sarcee Day School teacher, Mrs. Watson, is occupying a residence belonging to the M.S.C.O., he wondered if something could not be done about obtaining a reasonable rental for this building from the Department.\n\nSince it is the policy of the Department to provide living quarters for day school teachers, I feel that we should pay some rental for the use of this house.\n\nIt is my understanding that the building was formerly a Mission Hall, but that it was made over into a residence for the use of the late Miss Timms. Though we have no record of this on file, I am of the opinion that the Department either paid for these alterations or contributed a portion of the cost.\n\nIt is known that the Mission is short of funds, and I would suggest that we pay a nominal rental of say $15.00 per month for the use of the building until such time as the new school and teacherage is completed. It is understood that the residence would revert to its former use when vacated by the present teacher, The Rev. Mr. Lord is writing the M.S.C.O. in this regard. If the Department approves of the rental, it should be paid from September first.\n\nG. H.

Both companies have a considerable amount of work to do and the Ziegler Construction Company in particular are anxious to be informed with regard to their tender as soon as possible in order that they might arrange their work accordingly.\n\nOur school building program is proceeding very slowly with actually no new day schools under construction as yet. The point is conceded that the estimates on the Sarcee school are high but your letter, file 120-1-1 (e) of June 2nd, indicates that this was expected.\n\nThe Superintendents have had considerable difficulty in even obtaining firms interested in tendering, and it is my recommendation that we at least construct those schools for which we have tenders, though the costs will be higher than expected.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRFB:RM\nenc.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug. 17 | To Hauling by truck 852 sacks cement from Calgary to Sarcee Agency for the new Sarcee Indian Day School as per statement attached. | $74.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The account for this was paid by the Missionery, Rev. L.F. Rowe, in the past, but Mr. Rowe left here the 1st of April and the electric power was shut off from the Mission house, leaving the teacherage and school without water. I approached the Electric light Department and asked them to have this power turned on again to enable us to have water for these buildings assuring them that we would assume the payment for the current used.\n\nRev. Mr. Rowe approached me before he left stating that it would be expected that the Indian Affairs Branch should be expected to pay part of this electric light account in future, and as a new Minister has taken over the Mission house from June 1st I anticipate this will be brought up. As the only current used during the month mentioned was used pumping water for the teacherage and school I would suggest that this amount, $1.95 per month, be taken as a basis and the occupant of the Mission house re-imburse monthly to this amount.\n\nM.

You will see that there are at present 34 Indian children in the Indian hospital requiring school instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.\nActing Supt. Indian Health Services.\nOttawa, April 15, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Stone:\n\nYour letter of March 16, addressed to Dr. Moore, has been referred to me. I discussed your letter with the Director several days ago, and as I informed you verbally before you left Ottawa, the Training Division is prepared to pay the salary of a teacher, on the understanding that the Hospital will provide living accommodation and board.\n\nWhen a teacher is engaged, it is felt that she should not be required to perform any other duties than teaching. The number of hours per day during which she carries out her duties would of course be subject to your direction.\n\nPlease make enquiries with a view to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher, and when you are successful let me know her name and qualifications. At the same time you should make a recommendation regarding the monthly salary which we should allow her.\n\nAt the Coqualeetza Hospital we have been employing two teachers, one Catholic and one non-Catholic. I discussed this phase of the matter with the Director the other day, and he agreed with me that similar procedure should be adopted at the Edmonton Hospital. Possibly two teachers are not absolutely necessary at the present time, but no doubt the number of your patients will increase and subsequently two teachers will be required. You are in the best position to judge whether a Catholic or a non-Catholic teacher should first be employed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nE. L. Stone, Esq., M.B.,\nMedical Director,\nDept. of National Health & Welfare,\nIndian Health Services Hospital,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\nIndian Health Services Hospital\nEdmonton, Alta.\n24 April 1946.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your recent letter, the Archbishop of Edmonton has nominated a Mrs. Kernes as Roman Catholic School teacher at this hospital. This lady is the wife of a disabled war veteran, lives very near the hospital, has a permanent Alberta teaching certificate up to Grade 9, and has taught Grade 10. She has good inspector's reports, and seems suitable in every respect.\n\nShe expects to be paid the minimum salary of a qualified teacher in Edmonton which is $1500 per year for 10 months. She agrees, at this salary, to work a Civil Service year if so required, or with such holidays as the Medical Director may prescribe for the sick pupils. She will not expect maintenance.\n\nIt is recommended:\n\n1. That you authorize engagement of Mrs. Kernes on the terms set out above.\n\n2. That you authorize purchase of such Alberta text-books as she may prescribe, with scribblers, pencils, etc., or make provision for such supplies as you ordinarily do.\n\nIt would be a good thing to have the school started as soon as possible. Mrs. Kernes is ready to come on at anytime.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director\nIndian Health Services Hospital, Edmonton.\nOttawa, May 3, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the establishment of an Indian Day School at the Edmonton Indian Hospital.\n\nI discussed the contents of your letter with the Director and we are prepared to allow the teacher $120.00 a teaching month, plus bonus of $18.42 a month.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, we have to obtain an Order-in-Council for the establishment of a day school in the Edmonton Hospital before we can pay salary to the teacher. The necessary steps are being taken to obtain this Order-in-Council, which we expect will be passed in the near future. Mrs. Kerns may be allowed to begin duties at any time. I enclose the necessary forms which she should complete and return.\n\nYou may purchase approximately Fifty Dollars' worth of books to permit her to start at once, but additional books and classroom supplies should be ordered on requisition, in order to permit us to supply them through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\n\nH. Meltzer, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nIndian Health Services Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nMay 3, 1946.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are thirty-three (33) Indian children of school age in the Edmonton Indian Hospital, Province of Alberta, for whom educational facilities are required; and\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 182, 1946-47, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established at the Edmonton Indian Hospital, Province of Alberta, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, to be known as \"The Edmonton Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nMay 3, 1946.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\n\nEstablishment of the Edmonton Indian Day School,\nProvince of Alberta.\n\nOne copy of Order-in-Council is required.\nOttawa, May 3, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nEnclosed is Memorandum to Council requesting the establishment of an Indian Day School at the Edmonton Indian Hospital.

He strongly recommends the establishment of a day school, as was done at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital (see P.C. 1518, dated February 27, 1942).\n\nDirector,\n\nEncl.\n\nPP\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nFRIDAY, the 10th day of MAY, 1946.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there are thirty-three (33) Indian children of school age in the Edmonton Indian Hospital, Province of Alberta, for whom educational facilities are required; and\n\nThat funds are available in Vote 182, 1946-47, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children;\n\nTHEREFORE His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98/1927, is pleased to establish and doth hereby establish a day school at the Edmonton Indian Hospital, Province of Alberta, to be known as \"The Edmonton Indian Day School\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, May 21, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of May 3, with reference to the establishment of an Indian day school at the Edmonton Indian Hospital.\n\nWe have now secured the necessary Order-in-Council and are in a position to pay the salary of the teacher and other necessary expenses. Please let me know if Mrs. Kerns has begun duties and, if so, she should sign and return the forms which I previously forwarded to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nH. Meltzer, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nIndian Health Services Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nIndian Health Services Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\nJuly 3rd, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDr. Stone forwarded to Mr. Hoey's letter authorizing this hospital to employ a second teacher, in the person of Mrs. Grantham.\n\nIn the few weeks that Mrs. Kerans, our present teacher, has functioned, we have nothing but praise for her efforts, and are agreeably surprised at the excellent response on the part of the patients. Both young and old have shown a desire to do school work, and with this number being well above the number that one teacher could reasonably handle, we are looking forward to the early arrival of the second teacher. She has already been notified, and I am quite sure will be available here very shortly.\n\nWe are enclosing a brief report on the school work covering a period of six (6) weeks. We hope that this report will give you some idea of the response that Mrs. Kerans has found in her work.\n\nIn the treatment of Tuberculosis, the occupation of the patients apart from their rest periods, is very important. The educational facilities serve a dual purpose. Firstly, to advance the educational level of our Indians, and secondly, to keep their minds occupied so there is less tendency to run around, or want to go home. This latter tendency is one of our major problems.\n\nWe would therefore like to express our sincere thanks for the efforts of your Department in making available these educational facilities.\n\nH. Melitzer, M.B.,\nMedical Director.\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was interested in receiving your letter of July 3, with reference to the work being carried out by the teacher at the Edmonton hospital. With the appointment of a second teacher, you will, no doubt, be able to give even better service to the patients.\n\nThe items requested on requisition of May 27 have been ordered from the Government Stationery Office. However, it is possible that some of them have not yet reached the hospital, as some books are difficult to obtain at the present time.\n\nIf any additional supplies are necessary for the coming year, the teacher should forward another requisition as soon as possible, so as to give us an opportunity of securing what is required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nH.

It will give you some idea of the present situation.\n\nWe do appreciate all the efforts your Department has put forth in furthering the educational facilities at this hospital. I must say that the response of the patients, both young and old, has been gratifying beyond my original expectations.\n\nWe hope to keep you further informed as to our progress.\n\nH.

This is mainly due to the shortage of paper and to various books being out of stock at the present time.\n\nI have received an application from Miss Ellen Thomas of Fort William, Ontario. She has had previous experience teaching Indian children while she was employed as a teacher at the Fort William Sanatorium. She has written in, informing us that she would be interested in taking a year off her provincial teaching in order to teach in one of our hospital schools. She is particularly interested in teaching Indian adults. She would be willing to take this employment beginning September, 1947.\n\nI am passing this application to you for consideration in the event that one of your present teachers might contemplate leaving before that time. If you are not interested, please return the application as I would like to refer it to our other schools in Indian hospitals.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Mrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham,\nTeachers.\n\nMrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham who have been acting in the capacity of School Teachers at this Hospital have raised one or two questions which require clarification.\n\nThey have asked first whether their positions could be considered as Civil Service Positions, and whether they might in future expect to be put on permanent staff.\n\nSecondly they have inquired as to whether they might expect to receive an annual salary increment as do most Civil Servants, whether on temporary or permanent staff. They have also raised the question as to whether there was a maximum salary attached to their positions. The present basis of salary appears to be $147 per teaching month, which as they are teaching during twelve months of the year will give a yearly salary of $1764.\n\nMrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham have proved very satisfactory, and have been doing excellent work with the patients in this Hospital. It would be greatly appreciated if you would explain to us exactly under what conditions Hospital Teachers are employed.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nOttawa, April 26th, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital Day School\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 17th on file 12-2.\n\nIn the April issue of the Bulletin which will be sent out next week, you will find details of our salary schedule which will be taken into effect on 1st September, 1947.\n\nIn June, all teachers of Indian Day Schools will receive a circular letter specifying conditions under which they may classify as permanent Civil Servants for the purposes of superannuation. If Mrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham can qualify under these regulations, then they can submit applications for such standing.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Feary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nBFN/MGD\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nApril 24th, 1947.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will please find a brief report submitted by Mrs. Kerans, one of our two school teachers, on the work which has been carried out by Mrs. Grantham and herself during the past four months.\n\nThe work has gone on very well in spite of the difficulties which are always encountered in a hospital. The patients must adhere to rest periods, which means that the teachers have to try to adapt their teaching times to suit the medical routine of the patients. We have had the utmost co-operation from both teachers, and are very happy with their work.\n\nThe remarks at the end of the report, suggesting supplementary reading matter, are endorsed by myself. I might say that we have had voluntary donations from various people, which have helped to some extent. We fully appreciate the efforts and co-operation of your Department.\n\nH. Weltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nCopy: Director, Indian Health Services, Ottawa.\n\nM/B\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nJune 6, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOnce again the question of the status of our two teachers, Mrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham requires some clearing up. An examination of the Indian School Bulletin of April 10 would lead us to believe that these two teachers should be classed as Grade 3 Day School Teachers, and according to their experience they would have a salary of approximately $1800 per annum. However, this salary is based on a ten-month school year, and it is our desire to have the classes carried on in this Hospital for the full twelve months of each year. In this case the teachers should be eligible for payment of twelve times the monthly salary of the Grade 3 Teacher, which in the case of these two positions would amount to approximately twelve times $150.00.\n\nThere appears to be no schedule arranged for schools of the type required in this and perhaps other Indian Hospitals. It may be that the June Edition of the Bulletin will give further enlightenment, but we are rather anxious to have the matter cleared up before the end of June. Last summer there was some difficulty in getting Mrs. Kerans' salary adjusted so as to include the months of July and August, and we would like very much to have the matter settled before going into the months of July and August.\n\nJUN 10 1947\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nAIRMALL\n\nOttawa, June 28, 1947.\n\nCharles Gamsell Indian Hospital Day School\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter of June 6, but we have had such a heavy flood of mail in connection with our new teachers' salary schedule.\n\nThe situation regarding hospital teachers is that they can be classified as welfare teachers and carried on your strength for the full 12 months of the year. They will be eligible for the usual 18 days' civil service holidays. In order to set their salaries accurately, it will be necessary for Mrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grentham to submit the application form attached to the April issue of the Bulletin. We will give these applications immediate attention and inform them of the salaries to which they are entitled, based upon their experience and qualifications.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Meltzer, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nCharles Gamsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nOttawa, June 30, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nPlease find attached copies of letters or notification of classification on our Indian school teachers' salary schedule for Mrs. Kerans and Mrs. Grantham.\n\nAfter writing you on June 28 we received their application forms. In both instances they requested classification at $1,944.00 per annum. However, I have been unable to decide how they arrived at this figure, as it does not appear anywhere on our teachers' salary scale.\n\nEach one is entitled to 5 years' credit for her provincial teaching experience plus one year's credit for Indian teaching experience, which means that they both begin the 1947-48 academic year at the seventh year position of the Grade III welfare teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH.

Grantham and Mrs. J. E. Kerans, have been appointed as teachers, Indian Welfare, Grade III.

You will no doubt change\ntheir classifications to that of Grade 3 Welfare Teacher.\nIt would appear from their qualifications and experience,\nthat they are eligible for a salary of $1860 per annum for\nthe coming year.\n\nH.

She is suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and will likely not be fit to resume her teaching duties during the present year. After that we hope that she can carry on with her duties, which were so ably performed by her until her illness.\n\nWe have been in touch with Miss Zella Ferguson of Edmonton, who is at present taking her Bachelor of Education course at the University of Alberta. She expects to graduate in April of this year. She had previously taught for 13 years -- Grades 1 to 9. She is quite willing and anxious to give us part-time service, reporting two afternoons a week from 2.30 to 5.30 P.M. -- a total of 6 hours per week until the end of April; she would probably be available after that date for full-time work until Mrs. Kerans would be fit to carry on.\n\nWould you be agreeable to have her work part-time, at a suggested rate of $1.00 per hour while on a part-time basis, and then take her on at the end of April on the full-time basis as suggested above?\n\nMrs. Grantham is doing excellent work by herself, but she is snowed under, and cannot possibly cover the hospital properly. At this time we have 270 Indian patients.\npatients, and you can easily see that it would be well beyond the ability of one teacher to handle this number.\n\nYour reaction to the above proposal will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

She is suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and will likely not be fit to resume her teaching duties during the present year. After that we hope that she can carry on with her duties, which were so ably performed by her until her illness.\n\nWe have been in touch with Miss Zella Ferguson of Edmonton, who is at present taking her Bachelor of Education course at the University of Alberta. She expects to graduate in April of this year. She had previously taught for 13 years -- Grades 1 to 9. She is quite willing and anxious to give us part-time service, reporting two afternoons a week from 2:30 to 5:30 P.M. -- a total of 6 hours per week until the end of April; she would probably be available after that date for full-time work until Mrs. Kerans would be fit to carry on.\n\nWould you be agreeable to have her work part-time, at a suggested rate of $1.00 per hour while on a part-time basis, and then take her on at the end of April on the full-time basis as suggested above?\n\nMrs. Grantham is doing excellent work by herself, but she is snowed under, and cannot possibly cover the hospital properly. At this time we have 270 Indian\n\n- patients -\npatients, and you can easily see that it would be well beyond the ability of one teacher to handle this number.\n\nYour reaction to the above proposal will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nCopy: Dr. P.E. Moore, D.P.H., Director, Indian Health Services, OTTAWA.\n\nM/B\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n22 January, 1948.\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nRe: Treaty Indian Wm. Nelson\n\nI am the Education Officer for D.V.A. at the Charles Camsell Hospital in a part time capacity. I am also a senior student for the B. Ed degree in the Faculty of Education University of Alberta and have several years teaching experience.\n\nI was approached by Mr. Bruce through D.V.A. with regard to the above Nelson. After interviewing Mr. Nelson I find him a young man of fine personality, keen intellect, and lots of ambition. Working with Mr. Yates of the Correspondence School Branch we have recommended that Nelson register in Algebra I and French III to start with. I am going to administer some diagnostic tests in English and we will start him at the grade level indicated by the tests. When his plans are settled we will expand his course to include the required sciences and social studies. Because of his age, if he can handle the French III course he will be given credit in French I and II by the Dept. of Education in Alberta. Similarly with English, Social Studies, and Biology. This will save him considerable time.\n\nHere is a little problem. He expects to be discharged from the hospital within a month or six weeks. Have arrangements been completed for him to become a resident of the Indian Residential School near Edmonton as you suggested to Col. B.F. Neary in your letter of 25 Oct., 1947?\n\nAfter discussing his case we felt he could make much faster progress in correspondence courses than he could if\nhe went to school. I am quite willing to give him whatever assistance I can if he stays in or near the city. I feel he should be able to enter the Faculty of Education a year from this coming fall and so graduate in the spring of 1950 with an Elementary and Intermediate Certificate. I intend to do post graduate work here next year.\n\nWould you please let me or Nelson know at your earliest convenience what will be done for him.\n\nThank you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd. E. Lester Inman\nEducation Officer D.V.A.\nCharles Camsell Hospital.\nOTTAWA, January 29, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Booth Building, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Treaty Indian William Nelson\n\nPlease find enclosed a copy of letter from\nE.L. Inman, Education Officer for the D.V.A. at the Charles\nCamsell Hospital at Edmonton.\n\nI have written to Mr. G.F. Bruce, Director\nof the Correspondence School Branch, requesting that one of\nhis staff call on Nelson and determine his educational\nstanding. Our Administration is providing Nelson with the\ncorrespondence lessons and books, and apparently it is felt\nthat he would progress more rapidly by taking the correspondence\ncourses under supervision.\n\nIt is expected that Nelson will be discharged\nfrom the hospital within a month, so he wants to know if\narrangements can be made for him to become a resident of the\nUnited Church Indian Residential School at Edmonton, where\nhe would remain in residence and take the correspondence\ncourse under the direct supervision of Mr. Inman of the D.V.A.\n\nJAN 30 1948\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Schools.\nMr. Philan:\n\nRe. William Nelson:\n\nThis man has not come to Major Paton's previous attention. Some of the correspondence is difficult to find.\n\nThere is on file (Nov 8, 1947) a letter from Agent Robertson saying he is a very sick man at that date, and that Dr. Milligan would give the word when Nelson is able to study. The letters below omit any reference to Dr. Milligan!\n\nC.A.R.C.\n6 Feb 48\nFebruary 9, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nPlease find attached a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Schools for the Northwest Territories Administration of our Department.\n\nMr. Nelson is a Treaty Indian from the Yellowknife district and is anxious to continue his higher education and to become a teacher. He is now a patient in the Charles Gassell Hospital and is due for discharge within the next month. You will note it has been suggested by Mr. McKinnon that Mr. Nelson reside at your school and take correspondence courses in order that he can enter the Faculty of Education at the University of Alberta a year from this coming Fall.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your comments on this suggestion. Mr. Robertson has interviewed the young man and it is suggested that you also see him before advising us as to the feasibility of Mr. McKinnon's suggestion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nReverend E. J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. E. A.

It is presumed now that she is teaching only part time and that she should not be paid at the full rate. If we could be advised as to how many days she taught during the month of March, it might be possible to make adjustments in her April cheque to account for the shortages in working hours during the months of February and March.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Ferguson\n\nWe have your letter of March 25th, File 110-10-1 advising that Miss Ferguson will receive a cheque for $156.00 for the month of March and stating that a possible adjustment might be made on the April cheque.\n\nAs Miss Ferguson is only substituting on an average of two half days each week, it would seem impossible to make any adjustment on the April cheque which would satisfactorily settle her account. At $1.00 an hour for the months of January, February and March she has earned a total of only $54.00. We are, therefore, submitting the attached voucher #1267 covering the three months above mentioned. It would appear, from this end, that this is the most satisfactory means of paying Miss Ferguson. Miss Ferguson will turn over to us any cheque which she receives in payment of salary on a monthly basis and we will return this to you.\n\nIf this is satisfactory, another voucher will be sent for the month of April. However, Miss Ferguson advises that she expects to be able to put in full time duties starting on May 1st and continuing through to September, at which time it is possible that Mrs. Kerans will be fit to resume her duties.\n\nH.

Ferguson has returned to full time duty and consequently she should be paid salary at the rate of $156.00 a month for the months of June, July and August, 1948.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nPP/MDG\nColonel Neary:\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital\u2014Education:\n\nWith Mr. Supt. Robertson I discussed educational activities with the only teacher on duty, Mrs. Grantham. Her associate, Miss Ferguson, had been given special leave because of a bereavement in her family.\n\nOccupational therapy has not been conducted since February when Miss Oakden left to take employment elsewhere. There is prospect that another appointment may be made in July.\n\nBecause of the absence of Mrs. Kerans, Mrs. Grantham has not been able to conduct motion pictures, although the National Film Board, in answer to your request, has been in correspondence with her.\n\nWork with adults is to be resumed when Miss Ferguson returns. This is a department in which the teachers are very pleased with the progress which patients make. Some formerly illiterate adults can now write.\n\nPatients who are eligible are being encouraged to take correspondence courses in high school subjects.\n\nI suggested to Mrs. Grantham that she investigate the possibilities of educational radio broadcasts.\n\nMrs. Grantham requests consideration of the following suggestion: as it is difficult for bed-patients to write in scribblers, may an exception be made in their case and may they be permitted to write the words in the spaces provided in the work-books?\n\nDr. Meltzer has moved the teachers' office to a room where a washroom adjoins. There seems no need as yet for a classroom as the ambulant groups are very small. In lieu of the book-wagon previously suggested, a wheel-chair is\nsometimes used.\n\nNo registers have been issued to these teachers. The work done is, of course, more important than the keeping of statistics on it, but we might consider further how best to keep the records of what is being done.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopies to Regional Supervisor\nSupt., Edmonton Agency.\nJune 22, 1946.\n\nCharles Gamsell Indian Hospital\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nWe have received a copy of Major Clark's report upon his recent visit to your hospital and school.\n\nIt is to be hoped that an adult educational program can be carried out along the lines mentioned in his report and that every encouragement will be given to patients to carry on their education.\n\nAuthority is given for the patients at your hospital school to write in their workbooks, due to the difficulty of bed patients writing in scribblers. Under separate cover we are sending you two registers for use at the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nH.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI regret very much that I was unable to find time during my short visit to Ottawa, to discuss our educational problems with you in person.\n\nYou may recall that I pointed out, that with our patient population increasing steadily, two teachers could not possibly handle the amount of work which should be done. At the present time we have 330 patients, and of these over 200 will require some tuition. I therefore urge that we be given permission to take on a third teacher.\n\nMrs. Kerans, who was our original teacher when we started, is doing very well from a health standpoint, and we hope to have her back on our staff by the fall. We have a Miss Ferguson who is acting in a temporary capacity until Mrs. Kerans is fit to return to her work; if we are allowed a third teaching position, I would think that Miss Ferguson should be seriously considered for this position. Mrs. Grahtham, who is our second teacher, has carried on very satisfactorily since Mrs. Kerans took sick.\n\nYou pointed out in our short talk, that if we have 3 positions, we are then entitled to appoint one of the teachers as Principal. If so, I would suggest that Mrs. Kerans be considered for this particular appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Melzer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nM/B\nAIRMAL\n\nJuly 19, 1948.\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital School.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nWe are quite prepared to provide a third teacher at this school, in view of the information supplied in your letter of July 12.\n\nWe have already been corresponding with one of our Indian day school teachers concerning this position but have yet to reach a position in the correspondence in which we can definitely advise you as to whether she will be sent to the hospital.\n\nIn the event that this teacher does not accept, we would be only too glad to consider Miss Ferguson for this position. We are also prepared to consider an application from Mrs. Kerans for the position of Principal at your hospital. It is expected that we will hear further from you when Mrs. Kerans returns to duty.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nH.

As a result of this it was found necessary for Mrs. Grantham to discontinue some of the established activities. Individual teaching of adults was temporarily stopped; but approximately twenty patients who were particularly keen carried on their work alone with the help of assignments and checking. Visual education was halted from January till May, 1948.\n\nThe time available was devoted chiefly to the instruction of the children of school age. The newly-aroused interest in reading for pleasure amongst adults was kept up and library books were distributed regularly. Two adult patients, admitted during this period, were enrolled in Correspondence Courses, one in Grade XII and one in Business English. Assistance and supervision were given them when necessary. The publication of \"The Arrow\" was continued with the circulation increasing to 350.\n\nOn May 1, Miss Z. Ferguson joined the staff as substitute and adult and visual education were again resumed.\n\nThe suggestions offered by Mr. C.A.F. Clark, Educational Survey Officer of Ottawa, on his visits were found very helpful. Acting upon one of these the National Film Board was contacted and since May, 1948, their films have been used regularly in our visual educational program.\n\nOn October 1 Mrs. Kerans resumed her duties and Miss H. Kammrath joined the staff. The work has been divided by wards. Because of the variance in grading, background, and physical condition of the patients, individual teaching has been found the most practical method. All activities have been resumed and the patients are showing interest and making progress.\nTo date we have listed 1744 books, including text books and supplementary books. Most of the fictional books have been donated by interested city organizations. As can be easily understood books, pencils, crayons, etc., have a very short life in an institution such as this. So the promptness of the Department in forwarding materials and books has been very encouraging.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nHilda M.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nEnclosed you will find a brief report\nfor the year, 1948, on the activities at the\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital Day School.\n\nOur teaching staff is now much more\nsettled and with the three members now available\nthe work is proceeding at a much more efficient\nlevel.\n\nWe now have 325 Indian and Eskimo\npatients. This is an increase of practically 100\nduring the past year. It will be readily seen\nthat even with the increase of our staff to three\nteachers the work is very heavy as practically\nall the teaching is individual rather than to a\ngroup.\n\nYou will see from the report that\nthere have been 276 patients taught during the year;\nsome of these were discharged reducing the final\nnumber to 216. This is a very large number when\nyou realize that Mrs. Grantham carried on single\nhanded for a few months. Since the 1st October,\n1948, our staff has been better able to cope with\nthe large assignment noted above.\n\nQuite apart from the actual numbers being taught the quality of the work has been very good and we feel that quite a number of the people have shown more response in their school work here than they have shown in a much longer period at various schools elsewhere. We are very proud of this latter fact.\n\nDuring our discussion in May, 1943, you mentioned that we could elect one of our teachers to be a principal. We have not forgotten this fact but we felt we would wait a longer period before making our decision.\n\nThe work of all three teachers at the present time is very satisfactory and I certainly feel we are fortunate in the quality of our teaching staff.\n\nWe appreciate very much the real co-operation shown by yourself and your Department in furthering the educational work at this hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director.\n\nEnc.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\nCharles Camseil Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n11th February, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nMrs. J. Kerans, one of our teachers, handed me your letter regarding two patients who are under treatment in this hospital, Mary Johnson, age 15 and Theresa Larocque, age 12.\n\nAs Mrs. Kerans has no control over patients unless we refer them to her I felt that I should answer your enquiry.\n\nFirst of all these two children are not blind. Mary Johnson has moderately good vision but is suffering from trachoma. We are pleased to say that this condition is now under control and that she will be fit to carry on out of hospital very shortly. While she was on active treatment it was impossible to have her receive any tuition as the condition is contagious and besides rest to the eyes is important during the active phase of the disease.\n\nTheresa Larocque is also much improved and has regained a fair percentage of vision.\nShe has a chronic eye condition which we now feel may have a Tuberculous basis. She has been treated with the new drug streptomycin with definite improvement. Here again we refrained from giving her any school work while we are actively treating her eye condition. We hope shortly that this girl can also carry on out of hospital.\n\nBoth children when they leave hospital can return to ordinary schools for their education as we do not feel they have sufficient loss of vision to class them in a special group.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director.\n\nM/M\nc.c. to Mr. H. N. Woodsworth, Robbema.\nto Mrs. Kerans.\nFebruary 14, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMajor MacKay\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital.\n\nPlease find attached the annual report on the Indians receiving education from teachers employed by the Indian Affairs Branch at the above hospital.\n\nI would suggest that this report be passed to Dr. Moore for his information. I intend to pass this report through your hands to the Deputy Minister at the time of rendering the next quarterly report of this Division. This will help him to appreciate the work being done by the welfare teachers employed in the Indian hospital schools. You will note that 94 children and 276 adults have received instruction of some kind during the past year.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 26, 1949.\n\nDear Dr. Meltzer:\n\nReport of Activities -\nCharles Camseil Indian Hospital School.\n\nI was very pleased to receive the Annual Report of the teachers of your school and have passed it to our Director for his information.\n\nWould you please extend my thanks to the teachers and your staff for the work which they are doing and the obvious interest that show in furthering the educational progress of the patients.\n\nI would also like to thank you for the co-operation received from you and other members of your staff in assisting these teachers with their educational activities.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou may recall when I was in Ottawa recently that I felt we could use another teacher, preferably a man, as we had a great increase in our patient population during the past year.\n\nI also mentioned at that time that I had a young teacher in mind who had worked at the hospital under the Department of Veterans' Affairs and who would be an excellent type for our work.\n\nThis man is Frederick Nelson Dew, age 34 - he is married and has three children. He completed his Senior Matriculation (Grade XII) in 1932. He completed Normal School in Calgary in 1935. He served in the Canadian Army for one year and then attended the University of Alberta, completing his Bachelor of Education course in September, 1948. In all, he has had approximately twelve to thirteen years of teaching experience.\n\nI know this man personally and I feel that he is a very conscientious, sincere person. He is really interested in the Indians and I feel that he could do a good deal among the male patients.\n\nI would suggest that you contact him by letter and have him complete an application form. He would not be available for employment until early in August, but from our standpoint, that would not be detriment.\n\n(p.t.o.)\nHe is very anxious to know what classification he might come under and I told him that you could only arrive at that after having all the pertinent information about his training and experience.\n\nThis man lives at 10949 - 76th Avenue, Edmonton.\n\nI would appreciate if you could do something in this matter.\n\nHM: AP\n\nH. MELTZER, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nMay 18, 1949.\n\nH. Meltzer, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nI was pleased to receive your letter of May 12 and to note that you have interested a man in teaching duties at this hospital school. In view of his experience with D. V. A., he should prove a valuable addition to your staff.\n\nI doubt very much whether Inspector Davey will be able to get to your hospital this summer. We are very heavily involved in a building program in British Columbia and I think his duties will keep him there.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter which I have sent to Mr. Dew today and I will arrange to forward also to you copies of further correspondence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am enclosing a further report prepared by our teachers. It covers the period from December 31st, 1948 to the present time.\n\nAs you will notice, the table indicates an increase of 46 pupils since December 31st. This brings up the average of patients per teacher to 90. This is our main reason for asking your Department for more help in the teaching department. Our present staff of three are doing an excellent piece of work and I have no doubt that the addition of a fourth teacher will make our teaching staff a very efficient unit.\n\nI know that in the past you have been most helpful and I am sure I can count on your continued keen interest and valuable assistance.\n\nWith very best wishes,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. MELTZER, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\nREPORT ON EDUCATION OF INDIANS AND ESKIMOS\nAT CHARLES CAMSELL INDIAN HOSPITAL DAY SCHOOL\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\nMAY 15, 1949\n\nThe following table shows the age and grade distribution of those who received instruction since December 31, 1948.\n\n| Grade   | Under 15 years | Adults | Total |\n|---------|----------------|--------|-------|\n|         | Male Female    | Male Female |       |\n| Grade I | 31 35          | 26 17  | 109   |\n| Grade II| 22 10          | 10 4   | 26    |\n| Grade III| 5 6           | 9 7   | 16    |\n| Grade IV| 2 4            | 6 4   | 16    |\n| Grade V | 2 9            | 12 14 | 37    |\n| Grade VI| 1              | 5 11  | 17    |\n| Grade VII| 2             | 4 3   | 5     |\n| Grade VIII| 2            | 2 1   | 3     |\n| High School Library | 11 22 | 33 |\n| Total   | 73 64          | 87 35  | 279   |\n\nDeceased and Discharged\n\n|        | Male Female |\n|--------|-------------|\n|        | 1 8         |\n|        | 72 50       |\n|        | 82 82       |\n|        | 262         |\n\nThe above table shows that there is a net increase of 46 in the number receiving instruction as compared to that of December 31, 1948. This averages approximately 90 patients per teacher. Since individual teaching is the only satisfactory procedure, it is felt that more progress could be made and opportunities for welfare work could be taken advantage of, if the available time per patient were not so limited. The appointment of a fourth member to the teaching staff would help a great deal to alleviate the present situation.\n\nThe help and ready response of the Department in the past has been greatly appreciated.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nMadge L.

They think that there is an element of unfairness that day school teachers get a bonus for degrees whereas welfare teachers get no recognition for \"education\" degrees. I told them that their qualifications are considered in making the original classification, and that, to my mind, there is considerable difference in the duties of welfare teachers in hospitals and welfare teachers on reserves where the social science aspects are emphasized. Hospital duty emphasizes pedagogy in the fullest American sense. Within the walls the social worker has little scope for her talents, and of course, it is true, as these teachers say, that social workers don't seek teaching jobs. And so, once again, I opine that perhaps hospital teachers may have to be classified apart from welfare teachers on reserves.\n\nSupplies: For bed-patients the teachers would like to have E.H. Reid's Arithmetic Work Books\n\nTo accompany the Highlands readers above Grade 3 they would like the \"My Literature Book\" work-books.\n\nMr. Dew is an enthusiast for testing, especially in the aptitude field. I reminded him of the special considerations attaching to the testing of Indians. A few individuals for clerical or typing aptitude testing were all that are likely to be approved for some time yet. Perhaps one or two prospects for training as departmental employees may be found.\n\nC.A. Clark\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Calgary.\n\nSept., Edmonton Agency.\nNovember 7, 1949.\n\nH. Meltzer, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Director,\nCharles Camell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 4 which arrived during my absence on a recent inspection trip.\n\nI will try to have Major Clark visit the hospital school and assist with a recommendation as to who should be classified as principal. I do not intend to make any recommendation in this regard this year as additional funds were required in the payment of a fourth teacher.\n\nIn other words, if a principal is appointed the title would be purely nominal and no extra salary would be paid at the present time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nCharles Cannell Hospital Indian Day School\nNo. 703\nNR - IAR - 703 - 3000\n\nEffective September 1, 1949, the Department has reclassified Mrs. J.E.

Agnes Willier is trying her best to keep from looking out of the window, and trying not to be lazy. I have resolved not to \"sneak\" out of bed, and I have given up candies. This is a real sacrifice for me as I love candies and could eat a whole box in one day.\n\nSo friends, try to make some sacrifice during Lent, no matter how small it may be.\n\nElizabeth Bugle\n\nWARD I D\n\nI appreciate very much the opportunity of writing in the Arrow once more. All of us in Ward I D are doing well. One of our patients, who had been here for three weeks, went home yesterday. I hope we'll all go home soon.\n\nMy son, Maurice, came to the hospital on the eighth of January for an operation. He left for home again last week and I do hope that he does not have to come back to the hospital again.\n\n(Mrs.) Harriet Buffalo\n\nWARD I E\n\nWe have no news for the paper,\nWe haven't been out for days -\nWe know not of the fashions\nNor any worldly ways.\n\nWe didn't get our letters\nAnd visitors were \"taboo\" -\nQuarantined for days and days!\nEnough to make us blue.\n\nKept to ourselves in old Ward E -\nAnd all in the dark like weasels -\nBecause that Mary Murphy\nShe up and got the MEASLES!\nWARD NEWS (Continued)\n\nWARD I F\n\nI take this opportunity of letting you know the news from our ward. We are feeling fine. We were in quarantine for measles for the past couple of weeks. We were allowed no visitors.\n\nMy husband came to visit me last month for the first time since I have been in the hospital. It was a big surprise for me.\n\nWe are sewing for our sewing teacher. We get paid for our work and it is nice to earn the odd bit of spending money.\n\nAll the girls in this ward are on Routine 1. We are trying to behave ourselves and get well. We wish to thank the doctors and nurses who are in charge of us. We hope and pray that you will all continue towards a speedy recovery.\n\nGeorgina Young\n\nWARD I G\n\nWard I G has been invaded and taken over by the girls from Dawson City. They were flown here after the fire in the hospital there. Bessie Ellis, Rosalie Allen and Mary Shorty are all enjoying getting acquainted with the ways of the Gamsell; and although they come from so far North, are looking forward to meeting their first Eskimo in the hospital here.\n\nWARD I H\n\nEverything is fine in our ward. Our main recreation is playing the guitar and singing. We think we are better than \"Them Tennessee Cowboys\" \u2014 especially ward sister Mary Shortman. You should hear her when she starts singing \"Best in the West\". Everything in the ward stops to listen \u2014 even the curtains stop rustling.\n\nFrom Maggie and Bella\n(Please don't sign our last names, Thanks.)\n\nWARD II A\n\nOne time Doris Beaulieu was wishing that she had a hundred dollars to her name.

We are glad, too, to see Mrs. Grantham again and happy to be back at our school lessons.\n\nWe send a special \"Hello\" up to Elise, our former ward-mate, who has been moved upstairs for her operation. We hope you are feeling fine and are looking forward to the time when you will be back with us again. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.\n\nRose Calihoo\n\nWe miss Celine Piche, who was discharged on the 27th of January, from Ward G. We also miss Violet Currie who went home this month.\n\nOne night Elsie Letendre wakened us all by calling in her sleep \"Sally Black Socks! Sally Black Socks!\" meaning, we suppose Sally Black Jack.\n\nOne afternoon Adeline Jackson and Bertha Quinn were ironing together. Bertha picked up one handkerchief and hastily ran the iron over it and handed it to Adeline. But to her surprise Adeline handed it back. It was not hers. It was Bertha's own. So Bertha was seen quietly slipping back to the ironing board and ironing the handkerchief VERY CAREFULLY on both sides and in all the corners!\n\nLast month we spent in Ward II D \u2014\n\nDon't ask the reason why \u2014\n\nBut now we're back in G again \u2014\n\nAnd aren't we GOOD \u2014 O-O-H MY!\n\nThe girls in Ward II G\n\nHappy Easter\nWARD NEWS (Continued)\n\nWARD II D to I\n\nWe are glad to have Jessie Yellowbird and Gladys Willier from Ward VII in Ward Two I, and Shirley Geddes from Ward V B in Two H. We are glad to welcome, too, Louise Hoka Nocza from Hay River.\n\nWARD III D\n\nFirst of all we wish to say 'Hello' to all our local friends. As we are in quarantine at this time we cannot answer our mail. But just as soon as the sign is taken down we promise to write.\n\nBella Boysis had her operation and is now in a cast.\n\nWe think that Vivian Davidson is going to have a hard time packing all she has collected during her stay here. She expects to leave for Miller Bay at the end of the month. Has anyone an extra trunk to help her out?\n\nFlorence Johnson, Marie Metikassus, Beatrice Callihoo and Rema Bull are still the same as ever.\n\nWe are all hoping for an early cure, aren't you? Bea\n\nOnce an old lady went shopping. She couldn't speak English very well so her daughter made out a shopping list for her. Just as the old lady was leaving in the wagon her daughter ran out, \"Chaskowa,(Wait), Please get two mantles for the gas lamp and a generator. I'll write it down for you.\"\n\n\"Namoia,(No), I'll remember.\" called the old lady.\n\nSo all the way to the store she kept repeating,\" Two mantles for the gas lamp and one generator!\"\n\nBut somewhere along the way she got mixed up and so when, at the end of her shopping list, the clerk said,\"Anything more?\" the old lady answered,\"Oh, yes, I want two gas bags and oh yes\u2014one generation.\"\n\nWARD III E\n\nAt last we have a chance to express our thanks to the doctors and nurses and the rest of the staff for all the work they did to give the patients an enjoyable Christmas. Everyone had such a lovely time.\n\nFlorence --(Pressing at the ironing board)\n\nFlora -- Florence, my curiosity is getting the better of me,\n\nWhat are you ironing?\n\nFlorence -- I am pressing the wrinkles out of my Grandpa's face \u2014 I mean his picture.\nWARD NEWS (Continued)\n\nWARD III E\n\nFlorence White Quills is worrying about her toy dog. She thinks it should be X-rayed, given a gastric wash and sent down for a rib operation. My opinion is that the dog has T.B. of the tail -- for he can't wiggle it.\n\n- Lilly Many Bears\n\nWe all miss Mrs. Mary Many Chiefs. We miss her cheerful jokes and hope she will soon be back with us after her operation. We wish her and Mrs. Maryanne Many Fires a speedy recovery.\n\nFrom Lilly Many Bears\n\nP.S. Please excuse the many \"Many\"s.\n\nFor the first time Grandma Waghey had been weighed. She asked Lilly how much she weighed. Lilly explained \"...100 lbs. flour, 20 lbs. rolled oats, 5 lbs. sugar and 1 lb. margarine. You catch 'em, Waghey?\"\n\n\"I catch 'em!\" smiled Grandma Waghey.\n\nOne night we were all very frightened and upset when we saw three lights north of our ward. When the nurse answered our bell she told us to get back into bed; that they were only fog lights.\n\nWARD IV A\n\nHere we are again to say a few words about our ward. First there are three of us in the P.O. ward: Max Wood, Marcel Mercredi, Jerry Chalifoux; Peter Nanda David Koomyak and Paul Gladu are in the private ward. Paul Gladu has just had his operation and is doing fine. We have wonderful nurses and ward aids who are doing their best for us.\n\nI would like to thank all the doctors, especially Dr. Meltzer, who is doing his best for us. I thank the nurses, too. I never will forget what they are doing for us. Remember always, my friends, what good doctors and nurses and staff we have looking after us!\n\nJerry Chalifoux\n\nWARD IV C\n\nWe certainly miss Olive Creighton, who has gone up for her operation. She is the \"cheerer upper\" of Ward IV C. Good luck, Olive, and don't have too many ribs out.\nWARD IV E\n\nHELLO!\n\nWe girls from Ward IV E would like to express our thanks to all the staff for their trouble and work in giving us such a wonderful Christmas. We surely did enjoy ourselves, but at the same time we felt sad, thinking about the Christmas back home.\n\nBut we know that we are here for our own good, so we pray and hope that we won't have to spend another Christmas in bed.\n\nHi Friends, We thank the doctors and nurses for trying to make us well and the teachers for showing us the shows\u2014(we hope to have them often) and for providing lessons and books for us to read.\n\nMrs. Dolly Chief, sitting by the fire smoking her pipe, took the cure the \"chicken\" way! She tells us that if we take her advice and follow her way, we will get better soon\u2014but we don't know what her advice is.\n\nWe are glad that we have had no measles in Ward IV, so far. (Touch wood, Ward IV.)\n\nLorraine usually gives us all the news from her paper. One day when she was reading her newspaper, she told us that British immigrants were coming to Canada. She said, \"I always give you girls the important news. You should buy my candy. I spend all my money on newspapers and have no money left for candy.\"\n\nWARD IV F\n\nSo far we are all still breathing and everyone doing well. Vicky S. is expecting to go up for her operation soon.\n\nMargie is anxious to visit Dr. Meltzer once again\u2014that means that she is anxious to have her operation.\n\nWe never seem to have much to say for the Arrow\u2014but anyway you'll be hearing from us again in the next issue. Good Luck!\n\nFrom the N.W. Girls\n\nWARD IV G\n\nThere are seven of us here in this ward\u2014five Eskimos, and two Indians from down south. We are quite a happy crowd. We had a movie on January 25 which was called \"Hot Ice\"\u2014it was a very exciting hockey game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers.\nWARD IV G (Continued)\n\nBell \u2014 Tuberculosis is a very bad sickness, isn't it?\nDot \u2014 Yes, of course, it is, and what do you think you have?\nBell \u2014 Oh, I've got T.B.\nDot \u2014 Well, T.B. is just short for Tuberculosis and you have it!\nBell \u2014 (In surprise) Oh-hi! I thought that this Tuberculosis that they talk about over the radio was another kind of sickness much worse than T.B. And so I have this Tuberculosis!\nNever mind, Bell, don't worry, you are doing fine! With the help of the doctors and nurses you will soon be well. We send a special thanks to our kind nurse, Miss Bentley.\n\nWARD IV I\n\nWe welcome Martha back to our ward. We are all happy for her, now that she has completed her operations. Soon she expects to leave us and go back to Miller Bay Hospital. We shall miss her.\n\nWe can never express, too often, our gratitude to all the doctors and nurses for helping us to get better and to all those who have helped to keep us happy through our illness. Good luck to everyone in the hospital and a speedy recovery to every patient.\n\nFrom the Happy Gang in Ward IV I\n\nMartha Lewis has been taking lessons on how to sing Indian songs. One evening she had been singing so much that she sang in her sleep\u2014but the song she sang in her sleep was so wild and spooky that it scared some of the patients. So now Martha has given up singing lessons and is learning to talk Cree instead!\n\nHubba Hubba Hubba!\nWho wants to join the Hubba Club?\nInterview the President,\nNo line-up yet, except Eva and Lillian.\n(They say it's lots of fun.)\nRules are simple.\n\nWARD IV Sunporch\n\nThere is not much to relate here in the sunporch. Jane Moses and Louisa Wakheeniw are learning to yodel. It is their main pastime these days.\n\nWhen the windows are open we often lie in bed and listen to the merry shouts and laughter of the children and adults, skating on the open-air rink just below our window. How we wish we could get up and watch them and find out what all the merry shouts of fun are about!\nWARD NEWS (Continued)\n\nWARD V A\n\nGreetings Everyone, We hope that everyone is feeling as fine as we are. We were moved down to this ward in January and we like it as well as any of the other wards in which we have been. Mrs. Alice Monias, Anne Athanas and Mary Martel came from Ward I. Mrs. Nora Young, Moya Esumbo, Lucy Thomas, Paulette Anrodiluk and Bessie Jim came from Ward I Sunporch. Harriet Dennehy, a former patient, joined our number and a month ago Mrs. May Craft, from White Horse arrived after having been in the University hospital for a while. Bessie Jim and all the rest of us are happy to have her with us. We are sure she must be doing well because she is always laughing and joking. We all keep ourselves busy and have no time to be lonely.\n\nLucy Thomas got out of her cast a week ago. She will be put into a jacket after a while. We are looking forward to the time (which we hope won't be too long) when we shall \"emerge from the chrysalis stage\".\n\nA special big 'Hello' to all the staff in Ward I and to all the patients, \"Be of good courage.\"\n\nWARD V C\n\nLet us introduce the occupants of Ward V C: We'll start off with Henry \"Carlson\" Collinson, our salesman, who sells everything from safety-pins to greetings cards. Being such a high-pressure salesman, he once even sold some headache tablets to a nurse.\n\nIn the next bed we find Luke \"Duke\" Brown. He tickles the ivories like Duke Ellington -- hence the name. How about a boogie?\n\nTurning around we find Horace \"Slap Happy\" Herron. \"Happy\" was a boxer before he landed in here and should have been a semi-pro by now. Tough luck, Happy, but keep your chin up-- you may be a promoter some day.\n\nNext we come face to face with \"Trigger Happy\" Hodgson. He is also a disc jockey but is never happy unless he is pulling the trigger on his little \"hip\" shooter that Santa gave him last year. At present he is out of ammunition.\n\nOn the other side of the partition we find Jimmy \"Scratch\" Johnson-- \"Scratch\" because he is always scratching on his guitar.\n\n(Continued)\nWARD V C (Continued)\n\nBut don't make any mistake about this -- it is not all scratching -- he plays anything from Boogie to Hank Snow's \"Two-Timer Woman\".\n\nNext is an old friend, Jean Marie \"Wolf\" Cardinal \u2014 \"Wolf\" because he is a mighty hunter. He has hunted bears, mooses (or is it moose?) and deer (both the four-legged and the two-legged kind).\n\nThen we come to Peter \"Checker Champ\" Mountain \u2014 the undefeated Checker Champ of Cassell.\n\nNow meet Jimmie \"Hot Lips\" Ominyak. He is striving to play the trumpet better than Harry James \u2014 hence the name. He says, \"Harry James can play 'The Flight of the Bumble Bee' so I am going to learn to play 'The Flight of Two Bumble Bees.'\" Good luck, \"Hot Lips\" every time I hear a bee \u2014 I'll think of you.\n\nNext in line for introduction is William \"Howdy Doo\" Sewi \u2014 he never fails to say \"Howdy Doo\" to the gals every time he goes by the window.\n\nAnd now the last in the bed is Jimmy \"Take the Cure\" Thompson. I guess you have something there alright, Jimmy. We should follow your fine example.\n\nSo there they are \u2014 the finest \"bunch\" of fellows that could be found all in one ward. A great big 'hello' from all of us to all you fellow patients wherever you may be. Keep smiling and always remember to keep your face to the sun and you'll reach your goal.\n\n\u2014 Harry Gray\n\nWARD V R\n\nWe are only little girls and all of us are in casts but we are happy and try to be good. Mary Tomenguk left us two weeks ago. She has gone to Edmonton Indian Residential School. Last week Ann Jonas went home to Dawson City. Esther Powderface has no radio just now and we miss it. Florence Drybones, Elizabeth Ilaiyak, Elsie Mercereau, and Rose Dumas are learning to speak English and chatter all the time. Annie Jackson, Annie Moosewah, Augustine Bless\u00e9 and Thelma D'Or are doing well in their school work.\n\nOne day the dinner trays had just been passed. It was a lovely dinner. There were spare ribs! Suddenly one of the little girls squealed with delight, \"OH-H-H-H GOODY. BONES!\"\nWARD VI A\n\nOnce again it is my privilege to write a message for the Camsell Arrow \u2014 a special 'thank-you' to the doctors and staff who are doing all they can in every way to get us well again. We were transferred over here to Ward VI A not very long ago. We like our new home very much. Don't expect very much from us, as all of us, except three, are in casts. Before closing we would like to wish all the Arrow readers a happy and prosperous 1950.\n\nFrom the Boys of Ward VI A\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nOn the eve of my discharge from the hospital I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the acts of kindness from the doctors, nurses, teachers and everyone on this staff. You have all been wonderful to me during my long stay in the hospital. It is grand, for me, after having been sick for so many years to be able to be on my feet again and looking forward to going home to see all my loved ones again. Best of luck to you all, boys, as I go, and remember, all of you, try your best to do what you are asked to do, so that you, like I, may get better soon. Thanks.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Laboucon\n\nWARD V I B\n\nThis is the first time that I have written for the Arrow and I have not much to say except to offer my thanks, too, to the doctors and the staff who are helping us get well.\n\nOur teacher, Miss Kammerath, brings picture shows every week to Ward VII and VIII. We enjoy them very much indeed.\n\nHenry Rusk\n\nWARD IX A\n\nFred Cleary, our violinist, gave a demonstration of his ability the other night. This was well-appreciated by his fellow room-mates. The applause brought an encore, \"The Devil's Dream\" with guitar accompaniment by Isadore Gladu and Buzzie (Baptiste Abraham).\n\nMr. Burnstick enquired of me, one day, if the thermometer was used each day as part of the cure for T.B. I told him it was. So, since then, Mr. Burnstick has been taking his own temperature four and five times a day.\n\n(Continued)\nWARD IX A (Continued) Wash Time in Our Ward\n\nBig Crow \u2014 Fred, which hand do you use to brush your teeth with?\nGleary \u2014 I use my right hand.\nBig Crow \u2014 Oh, do you? I use a toothbrush.\n\nWARD IX B\n\nJim Collison\n\nWe wish to welcome a new patient, Fred Marcel, who seems to be getting along well.\n\nLouis Henault is getting to be quite a guitar player and singer. He also is an expert radio mechanic \u2014 so if any of you have a radio that needs fixing just send it along to Ward IX and Louis will fix it for you. Charges are moderate.\n\nJohn Tannery is busy writing to his pen pal.\n\nWe want to thank the doctors and staff for the lovely Christmas we had. We also wish to give a special 'thank you' to the Catholic Women's League for the gifts they sent.\n\nLet's co-operate with the doctors toward our recovery and we'll be home sooner.\n\nBirch Many Guns.\n\nWARD IX C\n\nIt is a pleasure for me to be writing for the Camsell Arrow. On behalf of the boys here, I want to wish everyone a speedy recovery in the year 1950.\n\nThere have been a great many changes in our ward recently. Most of us have been transferred to this ward from Ward V C. We miss the old ward and the boys. Keep up the good work in taking care of yourselves. We are doing fine and hope that if we keep on improving, we may be heading home by spring.\n\nI shall have been here three years on the eleventh of June. During that time I have had one set-back; that was four months after I came in. No one knew whether I would pull through or not; but with the help of the doctors and nurses I did. I often recall those days. To think I was once a hopeless case makes me feel that almost anyone can get well again if he co-operates and follows the rules that are given him by the doctor in charge. So now that I am feeling quite well again I would like very much to express my feeling of gratitude to the doctors and nurses who have helped me in a lot of my difficulties in these past few years. (Continued)\nWARD IX C (Continued)\n\nI have a great deal to thank them for and it seems that words cannot quite adequately express my feeling of gratitude. Hoping that you will all understand what I mean and wishing you all a very prosperous future and success in your work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Pascal.\n\nWe were glad to receive Christmas greetings from Ernie Horseman, a former IX C patient.\n\nWARD X A\n\nWe welcome to our ward, Joseph Mason from Dawson City, Yukon,- Henry Standing Alone from Cardston, Alta. (who has been transferred from another ward),- Jonas Saddleback from Hobbema,- James Blake from Fort McPherson, N.W.T. and J.M. Ward from Winterburn.\n\nHenry Standing Alone expects to leave for the main building soon where he will undergo \"repairs\" which will speed up his recovery. Henry Rowan also expects to pack up for his operation in the near future. Sam Rowan expects to move to Ward IX C any time now.\n\nBy the way I appreciate very much the kind works of the doctors and nurses who are trying to arrest our enemy. So until next time here's wishing you all the best and may you all get well soon.\n\nHarry Francis\n\nWARD X B\n\nRecently we had a show about a hockey game. It was a real treat as many of us had never seen a real hockey game. \"Chimp the Fireman\" caused a great deal of merriment. We wonder what Chimp will be up to next?\n\nNoel Bouvier, our one-man band, assisted by Harry Kigiona, gives us some old-time music while John Bearhead does the calls. Everyone else seems to be feeling O.K. Joe Peters is still keeping himself as busy as ever making photo albums. Tommy Analvick has been moved to the private with a bad cold and we all hope that he is feeling much better by now.\n\nKootenay\n\nJoe and Emil Tsonghako came a few weeks ago and are doing fine. Peter Soupy and Frank Metuituk are busy telling each other stories. \"Hit 'em again\" is the favourite phrase of William Freeman when anything falls with a crash. The \"silent one\", Joel Noel,\n\n(Continued)\nWARD X.B (Continued)\n\nis doing fine after having a tooth pulled.\n\nWell, we'll be seeing you again by way of the Arrow next time,\nso till then\n\nKEEP SMILING!\n\nWARD X.C\n\nI am going to start my letter this month with my thank-you's to\nthe doctors, nurses, and the Staff for what they have done for us,\nespecially for the wonderful Christmas we had this year.\n\nI am very glad to say everyone is doing fine in our \"nut house\".\nWe have had six new-comers from the other wards; Louis Courtoeille\n(whom they call \"Lucy\"), Johnny Pat, Jimmie Abraham, Jimmy Klobozee,\nJohn (Squashwa) Boucher and John Lane. The old gang are: (Big)\nBen Adams, Moses Jimmy John, Buddy Onespott, Tom (Ugh!)

We hope to have a new doctor for Fort Rae before many months and he will then run the hospital in the same way as the one at Resolution. There is a great deal of Tuberculosis at Fort Rae and Resolution but I think that with the two hospitals it will not be many years before it is under control if the Indians will co-operate with us in our efforts to give them better health.\n\nThose of you who are in Cassell hospital whose homes are in the Resolution Agency can help us and your relatives and friends a great deal. You know what Tuberculosis means, how many months it takes to get better, how you need to rest and eat. While you are here you can write home and tell your people all this and ask them to understand it. When you go home cured you must talk to those you meet and tell them about Tuberculosis. If you will do this you will make it much easier for the doctors and nurses who are working so hard to wipe out the disease and you will be helping your people towards the day when they need no longer fear Tuberculosis as all of us do now.\n\nEskimo Girl Guides Practice For a Visit\n\nTwo hundred miles inside the Arctic Circle, the world's most northern company of Girl Guides is preparing for an inspection visit from Beth Riddoch of Edmonton, field Secretary for Alberta.\n\nDorothy L. Robinson, formerly of Ottawa, - school teacher - is the leader of the Girl Guides and Brownies. She has 20 little Eskimo and Indian girls practising their calls, knots and songs for the visit next month.\n\nMost Guides and Brownies in the Territories are native Eskimo and Indian children but gradually white people are moving in. They are bringing their Guide traditions with them and the companies are growing.\n\nThe young girls follow the same rules as the other 68,000 Guides throughout the country with a few interesting variations of their own. They wear the same blue uniform as the Canadian Guides but add a fur-lined parka and a flowered cotton outer dress, gay with color over the parka.\nVOLUME IV\nEDITION IV\n\nCHARLES CAMSELL\nINDIAN HOSPITAL\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nJANUARY FEBRUARY\n1950\n\nFIRST MESSAGE FROM DR.

Grantham\n(Editors)\nTo the Patients and Staff of the Charles Camsell Hospital,\n\nWith the advent of the New Year the Superintendency of the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital became my responsibility. I wish to assure you that my first concern will be for your comfort and better health and I will do all in my power to maintain the high standard and reputation already gained for the Hospital.\n\nDr. Meltzer has been in charge of this Hospital since its inception as a treatment unit under the Indian Health Services of the Department of National Health and Welfare. His professional ability as a surgeon has been recognized for years; his good judgment in the administration of the Hospital has been well demonstrated; his devoted service in organizing and establishing the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, as a treatment centre for tuberculosis that can be compared favourably with any in Canada, is well-known to you all. We are extremely fortunate in that Dr. Meltzer will continue as consultant and surgeon in the services of this Hospital. I trust that this institution will continue to flourish at its present high standard as long as it is required in the treatment of Tuberculosis, as a tribute to his work.\n\nI solicit the loyal support and co-operation of both staff and patients so that the function and duties of this great institution will be well and ably accomplished.\n\nSo at the beginning of this new year I would like to close my first message in the Arrow with my best wishes for both your happiness and improved health for the future.\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.,\nMedical Director\nIN APPRECIATION\n\nEditor, Bulletin - We wish to publicly thank and gratefully acknowledge the kindness shown to our Indian, Eskimo and D.V.A. patients at this hospital during the past year and especially during the Christmas season.\n\nAn exceedingly happy holiday season was enjoyed by all those who were confined to their beds and away from their homes and families. This Christmas cheer was made possible by numerous organizations and individuals, who generously contributed financial aid, gifts, time and energy.\n\nIn particular we wish to specify: Hospital Recreation Council, The T.Eaton Co. Ltd., Elks' Club, Canadian Legion, Rotary Club, Catholic Women's League, Fort Vermilion Merchants, I.O.D.E. (Provincial Chapter), Kinsmen Club, Lions' Club, Kinette Club, Gyrette Club, Cosmopals, Daughters of the Midnight Sun, Tuesday Night Club, Ladies' Auxiliary of Fraternal Order of Eagles and many others too numerous to mention.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\n\nChristmas, 1949\n\nAs this is the first issue of the Camsell Arrow since Christmas we feel that it is still not too late to express our most sincere thanks to all the organizations and private persons who made such generous donations of money, gifts and time to help make our fourth Christmas the best yet. A hearty 'thank you' is also due to the staff of all departments of the hospital - without whose co-operation we could never have had such a successful Christmas season.\n\nWe felt very badly about the measles quarantine at Christmas but think that Ward 2 patients fared very well despite their handicap and hope for better luck for Christmas 1950.\n\nF.E. Taylor, R.N.,\nMatron\nWELCOME DR. FALCONER\n\nOn behalf of the patients and staff the \"Arrow\" extends a hearty welcome to Dr. Falconer and his family. Dr. Falconer has devoted many years to bettering the health of our Indians and Eskimos. We are very fortunate to have his services as Medical Superintendent. Already he has shown keen interest in the welfare and progress of our patients. His presence at the staff conferences, his frequent visits to the wards and his desire to acquaint himself with every patient by name, history and progress are proof of his genuine concern.\n\nOur superintendent's first task is to make available for each patient the best and surest cure for his disease. Secondly, he must try to make each patient's stay in the hospital as happy and as comfortable as possible. To these ends we will all give him our best efforts.\n\nWe hope that Dr. Falconer, Mrs. Falconer, Janet and David will spend many happy years here.\n\nWilliam R. Barclay, M.D.\n\nGAMSELL PATIENTS WIN IN ESSAY CONTEST\n\nCongratulations are in order for six of our Gamsell patients for winning second prize in the recent Tuberculosis Essay Contest sponsored by the Alberta Tuberculosis Association. Two essays were entered, one in the High School division, written by Thomas Aneroluk, and one in the Intermediate division, written by Beatrice Callhoo, Minnie Sankey, Vivian Davidson, John Pascal and Harry Gray. These essays were judged in competition with other Indian schools. Because our hospital conditions are not like ordinary classroom conditions, it was decided by the Association that it would be fairest if the marks on the two essays were averaged and that mark taken. This plan gave us second prize.\n\nThough this represents the first attempt of our patients to engage in such competition, we hope that many more opportunities will present themselves either for individual patients or for groups of patients.\n\nThe first Eskimo baby to be born in Alberta, the wee daughter of Mrs. Milly Apolotuk, (a patient in the hospital) was christened \"Mary Margaret\" by the Right Reverend Bishop Barfoot assisted by Archdeacon Clough in the chapel on Thursday, March 2. Doris Kikpak, patient, and Mrs. Edwardson, daughter of the Archdeacon were the godparents.\nCAMSHELL HOSPITAL CHIEF SEES BIG YEARS AHEAD\n\nBy Stanley Burke\nBulletin Staff Writer\n\nIndians of Alberta and the North West Territories have a death rate from tuberculosis sixteen times as high as that of the general Canadian public - but quiet, greying Dr. W.L. Falconer predicts that in five years the incidence of this scourge should be halved in the Indian population.\n\nFor Dr. Falconer, his new job as Medical Director of the Charles Camsell hospital represents the achievement of an ambition.\n\nAs a young doctor in the mining fields of northern Manitoba in the late 20's, he was shocked to see the conditions under which the native population lived and died. He did what little he could to aid them but it was a hopeless task.\n\n\"I remember a time when twenty out of a band of a hundred died of whooping cough. It makes a powerful impression when you see five or six children, all with tuberculosis, lying on the floor of a shack under a single, dirty, old blanket in forty below weather,\" said Dr. Falconer.\n\nIn 1938 he was able to do more effective work when he became medical superintendent at The Pas for the Indian Health Services; but it was still a near-hopeless task. His patients were almost always dying before they arrived for treatment.\n\nIn 1945, he came to Edmonton as assistant to the director of Indian Health Services, to make a report on the buildings for the proposed Camsell hospital. The new hospital would be the largest of its kind in Canada, serving 21,000 Indians and Eskimos in Alberta, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\n\n\"I've wanted this job ever since I first saw the place,\" he said. \"It has everything. The University is nearby for teaching purposes. We have good transportation by rail and air to get the patients in to the hospital. We have everything we need here to do a real job.\"\n\nDr. Falconer succeeds Dr. Herbert Meltzer, under whose direction the hospital has already made almost startling progress. Last summer 20,000 chest X-rays were made so that now records are available\n\n(Continued)\nCAMSELL HOSPITAL CHIEF SEES BIG YEARS AHEAD (Continued)\n\nfor almost every Indian and Eskimo in the hospital's territory, something which has never been achieved with a similar group in the white population.\n\nSince 1944 the incidence of tuberculosis in the Indian population of Alberta has been almost halved.\n\nDr. Meltzer, a noted tuberculosis specialist and surgeon, is returning to private practice. He will continue surgery at the hospital.\n\n\"It has been a hard struggle to win the Indians' confidence but we are making excellent progress now,\" said Dr. Falconer. \"You've got to start them going back cured to the reserves. That's the important thing. The Indians used to say, 'Our people go to your hospitals and we never see them again.'\"\n\nPOLYGLOT RADIO BROADCAST\n\nBefore Christmas I visited CHFA, the French radio station in Edmonton, to meet the manager Mr. Gareau, and we had a little chat about the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital. I expressed the wish for a few minutes over the air, so that the patients could send their wishes to their folks in their own language. Mr. Gareau replied, \"Well, Father, we will give you a half-hour programme on New Year's Day at 2 P.M. for the patients of Charles Camsell.\" Next day I was very pleased. So back to the hospital I went spoke to Dr. Meltzer and Dr. Falconer about it, and started to organize the programme.\n\nA few days before New Year's Day Mr. Bouvier, of the National Film Board, came with machines to record our programme. We first had a word of introduction from Mr. Gareau. He stated that it was a pleasure for him to give the patients this opportunity to speak to their folks. In Doctor Meltzer's office we recorded messages from Dr. Meltzer, Dr. Falconer, Miss Taylor (Matron), Mr. Capel (Accountant) and Mrs. Kerana (Teacher). Archdeacon Clough was absent so his message had to be recorded.\n\nFrom the doctor's office we moved around the wards to pick up the messages of the patients. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to broadcast all the messages taken as we were limited to the half-hour. We first heard messages in Eskimo for Coppermine and Aklavit; in Selkirk, Carmak, Clinket and other languages for Yukon; in Loucheux, Hareskin, Slave, Beaver and Dogrib for the North West Territories; and in Chipewyan, Cree, Stoney, Sarcee and Blackfoot for the Alberta Indians.\n\nWe also had on our programme a lady, Dr. Demchenko, who spoke in Ukrainian and, too, a young girl, Christiana MatwieJozyk, who spoke in Polish.\n\nLet us hope that in the near future we will again have the opportunity to organize another polyglot programme.\n\n(Continued)\nDr. Meltzer:\nI am very pleased to have this opportunity of saying \"Hello\" to the many friends of this hospital in the North. I am particularly anxious to speak to our many ex-patients scattered from Fort Smith to the Arctic and through the Yukon Territory. To you ex-patients I say: Take good care of yourselves and all will be well. For 1950 I wish you all good health, happiness and prosperity. This same wish carries to our many friends as well.\n\nWe in the Camsell Hospital will always be ready and anxious to serve the northern population of our wonderful country - Canada. I will say again \"au revoir\" and Best Wishes for the New Year!\n\nDr. Faloon:\nFather Rheaume has very kindly given me this opportunity to say a few words to you in way of greeting. I am assuming the Directorship of the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital the first of the year, taking over from our good friend, Dr. Meltzer. I trust the good work he so ably started and has carried on so well during the past four years will be continued.\n\nIt has been recognized that this Hospital is filling a long-needed requirement. Tuberculosis is still taking a tremendous toll on the health and lives of the first citizens of Canada, and increasing effort with the co-operation of all concerned, is necessary to gain control of the disease and to decrease the death rate. Your co-operation in attending surveys and seeking treatment when it is indicated, is needed to reduce the rampage of this dread disease.\n\nNow on behalf of The Honourable Minister Mr. Paul Martin; the Director of Indian Health Services Dr. P.E. Moore and the Staff of the Hospital, who are all vitally concerned in your health and welfare, I wish you a Happy and Healthy New Year.\n\nMiss Taylor:\nOn behalf of the nursing staff I would like to wish you all a very happy New Year and the best for 1950. I hope that this year will see many more of your friends and relatives restored to health and back home with you. The nurses join us in sending greetings and best wishes to all of our ex-patients. Happy New Year!\n\nMr. Capel:\nI have been asked to convey to all our friends in the North, Best Wishes for the New Year on behalf of the staff of the Camsell Hospital.\n\nHaving been received into many of the homes in Dawson City, Whitehorse and all other Yukon Territory points, as well as in the North West Territories -- in particular Fort Simpson, Fort Resolution, Hay River, Fort Smith and Fort Chipewyan-- I wish to assure you all that your brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, are being excellently cared for here, and everything possible is being done for them. They are very happy and contented and we hope that they will soon be home with you again.\n\nMrs. Kerans:\nOn behalf of the teaching staff I wish to extend our best wishes at this festive season to all the ex-patients and friends of the hospital.\n\nWe miss you but are pleased that you are able to be at home with your family, relatives and friends. We had the usual Christmas activities -- decorations, parties, Santa Claus parade on Christmas Eve and a special dinner on Christmas day.\n\nWe are always glad to hear from you and thank you for your letters which we have received from time to time.\n\nMay you enjoy health, happiness and prosperity in the New Year.\n\nE. Rheaume, O.M.I.\nThe following is an account of a trip by air from Edmonton, Alta., to Cambridge Bay, N.W.T., for the purpose of examining a little Eskimo boy who had received an injury to his eye. We left the Edmonton airport around noon on Dec. 13 in an RCAF Dakota aircraft, with our immediate destination being the town of Fort Nelson, B.C. There is an Air Force station at this port, which we reached uneventfully after about four hours' flying. There we spent the night as guests of the RCAF.\n\nTake-off was at 5:30 the following morning, while the post was still in darkness. Our next stop was at a small landing strip on the shores of Great Bear Lake at a place called Sawmill Bay. We landed on the snow-packed runway there at about 10:00 a.m., and had a cup of coffee while our aircraft was re-fuelled. Then we took off on the last lap of the journey to Cambridge.\n\nShortly beyond Sawmill we could see that the trees below us, which had formerly been packed tightly over the land, were now beginning to thin out. As we continued on to the north they became still smaller and farther apart, and eventually disappeared altogether. We had passed the tree-line and were now in the Arctic.\n\nThe country below us now could scarcely be called country at all, or at least it appeared from the air. That land there was was low, smooth, covered and featureless, so that it was difficult to tell which was land and which was sea. One of the members of the crew quoted a phrase which described pretty well this portion of terrain. He described it as consisting of \"endless miles of absolutely nothing, spread very thinly, over an exceedingly large area\". No one argued with him.\n\nWe reached Cambridge Bay at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of Dec. 14th, and the midnight sun, which is as much light as one gets in that part of the country at this time of the year. The salt-ice of the bay was not yet thick enough to permit a landing to be made there, so the men at the station had prepared a landing strip on a small lake about two miles beyond the settlement. We landed on this runway, between the two pairs of rows of glowing flare-pots which marked its boundaries. As we looked out of the window into the semi-darkness we could see the Eskimo children dressed in their deerskins playing in the snow.\n\nIt was only 20 below at Cambridge on that particular day, but there was a cold north wind blowing. We stayed there an hour and had a good meal while the aircraft was again re-fuelled, then we loaded our little patient aboard and took off for home.\n\nIt was now quite dark, and was to remain so for the remainder of the trip. We came down at Sawmill again about 10:00 o'clock that night to pick up some more gas, and then flew on to Edmonton. We arrived at about 3:00 o'clock in the morning. It had been a long day and we were all ready for a good sleep.\n\"I WENT NORTH.\"\n\n-- Dr. J. T. Orford\n\nEdmonton was only 30 below zero in January so I went North where it was more comfortable at 40 below. This was my first trip into the western side of sub-Arctic Canada. I expected to see something quite different to what I had known in the East. It was a surprise, but not a disappointment, to find that the people were just the same types as in the James and Hudson Bay areas. They live in similar houses and tents, hunt and trap in much the same manner and eat the same foods.\n\nMy first stop was Fort Resolution which is quite a settlement. There is a new hospital here, which can handle eighty cases of Tuberculosis. Dr. Greenidge, the doctor at Resolution, is very enthusiastic about his big job of helping to stamp out this disease. The hospital is run along the same rules as the Camsell. Dr. Greenidge does pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum treatment and has Streptomycin which he uses upon advice from here. The purpose of the hospital is, first of all, to cure Tuberculosis. It is planned to use the hospital for admission of all local cases of T.B. Full treatment will be carried out there, whenever possible; but when a patient needs surgery, he or she will be brought to the Camsell where that part of the treatment will be taken care of.\n\nThere is a beautiful new Public School at Resolution. It was built by Indian Affairs Branch and will probably be opened this summer. It is modern in every respect and is just as well equipped as any school in Edmonton. It is heated by huge oil furnaces, has electric light and running water. I must say it makes one envious -- I wish I were a boy again and could start school all over. The school I attended was a little stone building in the country with a big wood stove in the centre, a coal oil lamp and outside \"conveniences\". That was in well-populated southern Ontario -- and to think that nowadays such a wonderful building can be built at such a northern spot as Fort Resolution. The Indian boys and girls should be \"tickled pink\" to go to school there.\n\nI also visited Fort Rae. This is a much smaller village than Resolution but there are many more Indians in the surrounding hunting grounds. There is a hospital at Fort Rae also of (Continued)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital\n\nPlease find attached the magazine published by our teachers at the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta.

In August, 1949, a fourth teacher joined the staff which made it possible to assume the heavier patient load.\n\nMany adults and children admitted to hospital learn to read while here. These patients require additional instructional time. Over the last year the child population has remained fairly stationary while the adult population has increased by one-third. There are also a number of youngsters between five and six years of age who will be ready for school work by September 1, 1950.\n\nThe average patient population per teacher is 85, which is above the number most educational authorities consider that one teacher can properly handle.\n\nPrior to September 1 each ward had one show per month. At the request of the medical staff, since then, the program in the boys' wards was increased to one a week. This overall program entails 31 showings per month. The films are of an educational and recreational nature and are obtained from the National Film Board in Edmonton, and the University of Alberta Extension Department.\n\nThe Camsell Arrow, the hospital paper, is now being published six times annually with a special pictorial review in the first issue of each year. Copies reach the agencies (the superintendents report that the agency copies posted on the bulletin board are well-thumbed before the arrival of the next issue), field stations, other sanatoria, residential schools as well as many individuals in Canada and U.S.A., and organizations who have become interested in this hospital. One organization uses the Arrow as part of its campaign toward Tuberculosis control. Many patients after reading the copies send them home where they help to build goodwill between the relatives and the hospital. The circulation of the paper has doubled in the past two years. The Arrow is serving many purposes as far as the patients are concerned: it is instructional, it improves their written expression and serves as a means of communication between patients.\n\nThe supplementary library now contains about 2000 books, the majority of which have been donated. The interest in reading is increasing steadily. Every patient above grade two level is encouraged to begin reading for pleasure. All available dictionaries are distributed among the patients who use them intensively in an effort to improve their pronunciation and interpretation. Many become so interested that they buy a dictionary of their own, so that they may take it home. It is felt that more dictionaries than those required for hospital use, should be provided in order to help the less fortunate patients who are unable to buy their own, so that they, too, may have one to take home, to help keep alive the interest in reading aroused while in hospital.\n\nIn December 1949, two entries from groups of patients were submitted in the Alberta Tuberculosis Health Essay contest. They were awarded second prize in the Indian Schools' competition. This was the first in a series of such annual competitions.\nAs part of the welfare program, encouragement and assistance in writing letters home are given to all. Many children have to have the letters written for them. This is done to improve the parent-patient relationship and to make the patient feel that he is still a part of the family group.\n\nSince all instruction is individual bedside teaching, and in view of the foregoing and other welfare activities, it is felt that in order to fulfill the needs of these patients, further additions in teaching staff are required.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nApril 25, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to:\n\nMajor C.A.F. CLARK,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nHospital Schools -\n\nAs you are aware from your own inspections, the results achieved at these schools vary considerably.\n\nIt is my intention to secure a report at the end of each month from the teachers at these schools in order that we might have a more careful check on their activities. I am not at all satisfied with the Nanaimo Hospital nor with the Brandon Hospital, where I feel the teachers are engaged primarily in handicraft activities rather than in the teaching of the language arts, which should form the basic programme for these hospital schools.\n\nI feel that every patient confined for any length of time should leave the hospital with a sound knowledge of spoken and written English.\n\nWould you please therefore prepare a report form to be submitted every month (or every quarter if you wish) on the Indian hospital schools.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nHospital Schools - Records and Reports\n\nIt seems to me that a beginning could be made by the use of records that would give a more objective appraisal of each individual who is receiving or who is expected to receive the hospital teacher's attention. I have discussed this with teachers in various hospitals inviting them to make suggestions as to how this can be done. I have put forward the suggestion that for each case the approach might well be clinical. The individual differences to be considered seem to compel the use of a cumulative record card and a folder file for each individual. On this record would appear the appraisal of the pupil's initial educational state i.e., a diagnosis in the pedagogical field, the tentative plans of the teacher adjusted to the pupils' needs, interests and hospital routines. It might help if we could have a description of the routines in vogue at each hospital with the Medical Superintendent's opinion as to what mental and physical activity is allowable for each routine. I mention this because I am not sure that the routines are standardized for all the sanatoria in which schools are operated. For example, the Government of Canada operates the Charles Camsell Hospital, but the Government of Manitoba operates those within that Province.\n\nI anticipate that the Medical Superintendents may have misgivings if the proportion of diversional therapy is reduced by the intrusion of mental disciplines in the earlier stages of hospitalization, and some of the teachers, just as they do in some classrooms, would rather keep the pupils busy with handwork than attempt the task of making them literate, because such teachers are not expert in the techniques of teaching reading.\nOn the basis of such individual records we could evolve a report form summarizing the statistics which we think are significant and thus leave out a great deal of paper work which Mr. Dew in his faithful attempts to report the situation in his hospital school has thought proper to forward. For example a summarized report, rather than giving the Grade of each pupil might rather give the number of pupils receiving instruction in subjects in the various Grades as the individual profile is scarcely likely in many cases to be suited to the work of all subjects in one Grade.\n\nC.A.F.

Moore, D.P.H.,\nDirector, Indian Health Services,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Moore:\n\nRe: Educational Work and Occupational Therapy at\nthe Charles Camsell Indian Hospital.\n\nThe above-mentioned departments in this hospital are doing a great deal of work, but in my opinion this could be better organized. The teachers are conscientious and work hard in the time available to them; they have nearly 300 patients taking courses. They apparently receive sufficient supplies, but the necessity of individual instruction, and the curtailed period in which this instruction may be given, due to rest periods, limits the amount of teaching the staff can carry out -- even by working Saturday mornings.\n\nOccupational Therapy is still more limited in that we have only one full-time therapist, and she has far too much to do. When this department was organized, an allotment of funds on a revolving basis was made, and it was considered that this department should be self-supporting from the sale of the various articles made. As a result, the work has been confined to too narrow limits: Patients have been led to believe that they will be paid for whatever they do, and the standard of some of the work is actually below market demands. Supplies are limited to purchases which can be made from funds realized from sales. We have no special place that can be allotted as a work shop where the patients on higher routines could work at prescribed hours.\n\nBoth Occupational Therapy and ordinary school work in themselves are of great value, provided the patient is kept interested and contented. When they become a monotonous drudgery they lose their value as therapy. Our patients are in hospital for relatively long periods of time, and when they are discharged they are usually on restricted activity for years, if not for the rest of their lives.\nOur aim should be not only to give them a good general education, but to interest and prepare them for some form of activity by which they can hope to make a living when they return home.\n\nIn my opinion, the Occupational Therapy and Education branches should be organized under one chief who had special training which fits him to evaluate the talents and abilities \u2014 particularly of the adult patients \u2014 in much the same way as vocational advisers in high schools.\n\nI do not intend this as a criticism to the present educational staff, but do feel that some improvement can and should be made. I had a long discussion recently with Mr. Dew, the head of our Education Branch, Miss Hopkins, the Occupational Therapist, Miss Taylor, the Matron and Mr. Horns, the Business Manager, and the consensus of opinion is that a more adequate program is required and could be devised. It is felt that some person especially interested in this type of education should visit the hospital, investigate the matter and make recommendations. I feel that Col. Neary is well fitted for this task and we would appreciate a visit from him at the first opportunity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nCopies: Col. B.F.

Goodman\nMr. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nAccording to the Indian School Bulletin issued last September welfare teachers are required to have a degree in social service work in order to receive salary allowances for university training. Inquiries that we have made indicate that such a degree is obtainable only by attending winter sessions at certain universities.\n\nTwo members of the hospital school staff now hold degrees, one a Bachelor of Arts from McMaster University and the other a Bachelor of Education from the University of Alberta. The other two members are working toward a Bachelor of Education and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Alberta.\n\nDuring the winter session courses are offered to Edmonton teachers after school hours or on Saturday mornings by the University of Alberta toward these degrees. The members of this hospital school staff would like to avail themselves of this opportunity to complete undergraduate degrees or to work toward post-graduate degrees, if arrangements could be made. As the hospital school hours are longer, due to required rest periods, than regular day school hours and as we work Saturday mornings, it precludes attendance at these lectures. As welfare teachers we can only attend Summer School every three years, which makes it difficult to complete a degree within a reasonable time.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, is it possible that arrangements might be made whereby at least a part of the staff could attend these Saturday morning lectures and that credit would be given for degrees other than Social Service degrees?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAugust 17, 1950.\n\nMr. Fred N. Dew,\nCharles Cassell Indian Hospital School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Dew:\n\nI have received your letter of July 25, and we are quite prepared to permit certain of the teachers to not conduct Saturday classes in order that they might attend sessions at the University of Alberta.\n\nI regret, however, that there can be no change with regard to the credit for Social Service degrees. The classification of welfare teacher was set up primarily for teachers on isolated Indian reserves who could do welfare work in addition to their normal teaching duties. I could not recommend exceptions for hospital teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6339)\n\nFile 705-1, part 1  Edmonton - Michel School. 1918\nFile 705-3, part 1  Edmonton - Michel School - Salaries. 1947\nFile 705-5, part 1  Edmonton - Michel School - Building Equipment and Accounts. 1947 - 1949\nFile 706-1, part 1 (missing) Stony Plain Day School. 1947 - 1949\nFile 706-5, part 1  Stony Plain Day School. 1947 - 1949\nFile 707-3, part 1  Atikameg Day School - Salaries. 1948\nFile 707-5, part 1  Atikameg Day School - Buildings & Accounts. 1947 - 1949\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nEdmonton\n\nGeneral Correspondence\nMichel School\nI beg to inform the Department that the Indians at the north end of the Michel Reserve have asked me for a day school for their children saying that they have 19 of school age ready to attend the school (10 of these are already in the St. Albert S school but they want them to leave to attend the day school). The farthest and the most of the children reside with their parents about one and a half mile from where the school site is proposed to be and others are a mile and a quarter. I have explained to them the unreasonableness of the application but they were very determined that I should write the Department on the matter. The cost of building and maintaining the school and paying a school teacher would be wholly inadequate for the results to be obtained. It is however for the Department to make decision in the matter and not for me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nJuly 4, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you inform the Department that the Indians at the north end of the Michel Reserve have asked for a day school for their children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot comply with the request of these Indians, as it has no funds available at the present time for the erection of new school buildings. You will be good enough to inform the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo. H.

In view of his reports it has been decided to build a one-room school and residence at this reserve rather than at Saddle Lake. Therefore, would you delete Saddle Lake from our list and substitute Stony Plain.\n\nThese two reserves are located some forty miles apart and are only twenty-five miles from Edmonton. Therefore, one contractor may be interested in obtaining the bids for both buildings. Would you please arrange to have one of your officials in Edmonton contact Mr. Robertson our Indian Agent there and visit these sites as soon as possible.\nIt is understood that you have completed now the plans and specifications for a standard one-room day school and teacher's residence which we intend to construct this year. Therefore, if you would air mail them to Edmonton, we hope the advertisement to appear in the Edmonton newspapers by May 15th. We are most anxious that these constructions be advertised for as soon as possible, as we understand from Mr. Gooderham that there is an opportunity of having bids entered if we advertise early enough in the Spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\nBFN/HM.\nExtracts from letter from Indian Agent E.A. Robertson. Letter dated on May 17, 1947 - Original on file 110-6-1\n\nThe location chosen at Michel Reserve is in the South-east corner or the S.E. \u00bc, 25-54-27-W4M. At Stony Plain Reserve, the site chosen is approximately one half (S.W.\u00bc Sec. 22) mile west of the Agency and two hundred yards south of the road. Both of these locations were inspected and approved by Mr. McNair and Mrs. Peatfield, of the Engineering Branch, Banff, on May 13th and 14th.\n\nAt Michel Reserve the site is covered with light poplar and it will be necessary to brush and level about 400 feet square. At this reserve they do not have much trouble in securing a supply of water at about 35 to 40 feet, and I would suggest that a bored well, 3 ft. hole, well into the gravel, would give a sufficient supply, and I would request that when the school site is located on the property by the Architect, that I be given authority to bore a well as close to the building as possible.\n\nThe cost of boring a three foot hole at Michel would be $2.00 a foot, estimated depth 40 feet. The well driller suggests that the most permanent type of casing would be regular wooden casing in the bottom with about 12 feet of cement casing on the top. The wooden casing costs $1.00 per foot and the cement casing $3.00 per foot.\n\nThe cost of drilling a deep well is about $1.25 per foot and the cost of 6\" casing is $1.50 per foot. The well would probably have to be drilled to a depth of about 400 feet.\nCalgary, Alberta,\nMay 27th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Neary\n\nRe: Day Schools - Michel and Stony Plain Reserves, Edmonton Indian Agency\n\nAttached hereto is copy of Mr. Robertson's letter of May 17th re the above, which is self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note that the proposed locations for these two schools have been inspected and approved by officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Banff. The problem now is to obtain water on the sites chosen, and it is recommended that Mr. Robertson's estimates, as covered in his letter, be approved.\n\nOnce water is obtained, the building construction work must be started, as we are already getting into summer, and it is hoped that this program will be completed in time for the fall opening.\n\n(Signed) G.H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nBanff, Alberta.\nMay 27th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMichel Indian Reserve.\n\nActing upon instructions, the writer, accompanied by the Indian Agent of the above Reserve, Mr. E.A. Robertson, inspected several prospective sites for a combined one room school and teacherage for the above mentioned Reserve.\n\nA site was finally chosen on the S.E.\u00bc of Sec. 26, Tp. 54, Rg. 27, West of the 4th Meridian, situated in the extreme southeast corner of this quarter. The area chosen (2.05 Acres) lies on level land, all thickly covered with scrub willow and poplar 2\" - 3\" in diameter. The soil in the area is a rich chocolate loam, some 18\" thick, sandy clay 18\" to 36\" down, subsoil is a light clay from 36\" down. No stones or gravel were encountered.\n\nIn regard to the water supply, from local information it appears that an abundant supply of good water can usually be obtained at a depth of 30' - 40'.\n\nThere are no electrical lines anywhere near the selected site the nearest being some eight miles to the east. No approaches are needed for this area, other than a small ditch crossing, and the area is fenced (2 wires) on the south and east sides.\n\nAttached hereto is a plan of the proposed school site.\n\n(Sgd.)

I then located a Mr. Jas. Briede, who had bored wells for us on Wabamun Reserve on several occasions and he agreed to bore both wells. He started in on the Michel Reserve well and after getting down about 40 feet ran into a sand formation which he was unable to handle with his machine and has abandoned the job. He will not expect any pay for the work done.\n\nYesterday, I located a Mr. Philip Sharest, at Beaumont, Alta., an experienced well man, and he is of the opinion that he can handle the sand without difficulty. His charges, however, are $2.50 per foot for the 3 ft. hole, being 50\u00a2s per foot higher than the former price. He is working at present on a well at a school in the Cooking Lake District but will be able to start on a well at Michel on Friday or Saturday of this week and do Stony Plain Reserve next week.\n\nThere are wells on adjoining quarters on the East, North and West of the present school site, and I would recommend that another attempt be made to secure water on this location.\n\nIf it is decided to change the site, I would recommend a site one half mile directly East of the present site. This is a good level site but is cultivated land and it would be\nnecessary to purchase the improvements and pay for the crop now on it, possibly around $100.00. This site would be only about 200 yards from the residence of Sol. T. Callihoo, who has a good well at his house, 38 feet deep.\n\nUnless I hear from you to the contrary, I will have Mr. Sharest go ahead with another well on the present site at the earliest date he can make it as the cement should be received any day now and the contractors will be ready to make a start.\n\nWith further reference to my wire of August 19th, requesting five more copies of plans and specifications, would advise that the Contractors state the one set of plans sent do not comply with the specifications, the plans evidently being for a school being built in Quebec and showing some differences, particularly in shingles and siding.\n\nE.A.

From the plan, I would understand that the living quarters portion of the school would be considered the front and should face South. However, this would bring the main lighting in the school room from the East, which is not the most desirable. Under the circumstances, would it be permissible to change the five main windows of the classroom from the East to the West side and the blackboard and two small windows from the West side to the East side.\n\nBy reversing the seating arrangement as shown on the plan, this would bring the West light over left shoulder of the pupils.\n\nA reply by air mail or wire would be appreciated.\n\nE.

This was planed cribbing and was a little more expensive than that purchased at Spruce Grove.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 25th, in connection with new day schools at Michel and Stony Plain Reserves.\n\nIt has not been necessary to change the site of the Michel school. The well at the original site was completed yesterday and the well borer was successful in getting a three foot hole down 54 feet, 3 feet into the gravel where a good supply of water is found in this district. This should provide sufficient water supply for Michel school for the life of the casing.\n\nWe have also been successful in securing water at the Stony Plain Reserve site. This well hit the water bearing quicksand at 45 feet and is three feet into the strata, giving about four feet of water in the three foot hole. We have found that the quicksand wells will eventually fill in with sand but in the meantime it should provide sufficient water for a few years.\n\nThe cement work for the basement of the Stony Plain school has now been completed and the contractors are at present working on the basement for the Michel School in an endeavor to finish all the cement work before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe road in to the Stony Plain school, approximately 200 yards, has also been put through but will require a little more grading when the bulldozer is finishing up the levelling of the site.\n\nE.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEncl.\nRe: Day Schools - Edmonton Agency\n\nI inspected the schools under construction on the Michel and Stony Plains reserves on October 24th and 25th, and was very favorably impressed with the location and type of construction.\n\nAt both places wells had been put down. Mr. Robertson informed me that the Michel well was very good indeed, but that there is apparently a limited supply of water in the well at the other school.\n\nIt was disquieting to be informed that no arrangements had yet been made to install electric light and water facilities at either of these schools. At both places this should be done while the buildings are being constructed, if it is going to be done at all.\n\nThere is no power line near the Michel school site, but it would not cost a very great deal to put in a small combination light and water pressure unit. In this day and age you cannot expect to get a reliable teacher to go out and live there and use only a pump for water and a coal oil lamp for light. The cost of a small unit should not exceed $600.00 or $700.00 at the most.\n\nThe Stony Plains school is only a few hundred yards from a power line. If the necessary conduits and outlets were placed and made in the building during construction, the cost of light installation would be very little extra. A water pressure unit could be installed at a small cost. The total cost for the two places, eliminating perhaps bath fixtures, should not exceed $1,500.00 at the outset, and possibly some fixtures could even be included at that cost.\n\nI seriously recommend that these facilities be added to these buildings, not only for the use of the teachers and pupils, but in order that the buildings may be used as Community Centers in the evenings. A large part of their value, in my opinion, is as community centers, and it is hoped that there will be no objection to using them as such.\n\nThis letter is written in the belief that Mr. Robertson has already carried out my instructions and asked for the facilities, and to support anything he may have said.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nOttawa, October 16, 1947.\n\nMr. H. A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWainwright, Alberta.\n\nRe: Schools - Michel and Stoney Plain\n\nThree new sets of plans were forwarded to you, as requested in your letter of October 15, 1947.\n\nWe are not in a position yet to advise if funds will be available to the extent of the $3,500.00 required to install electricity and running water at the Stoney Plain Day School.\n\nThe specifications and blue-prints for the standard one-room school do not call for electrical wiring. However, we have had this school wired elsewhere during the course of construction. We are quite prepared to leave this matter for decision between the contractor and yourselves. It would be appreciated if we could be informed as to the approximate cost of having this school wired suitably. It may be possible that we could have it wired this year and then arrange for the installation of the pole line next year, when funds are available.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

The Poole Construction have quoted a price of $180.00 per school for the installation of all rough wiring and outlets, including materials, and I have asked them to have this work done.

Gooderham, Regional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of November 5th and also a letter from Indian Agent Robertson dated November 26th in connection with the proposed installation of electric light and water facilities at the Michel and Stony Plain Schools.\n\nIf the Stony Plain School is located close to a power line, we are prepared to approve an expenditure not exceeding $711.00 which amount includes the spur line from present power line to the school; supply and install all rough wiring and outlets; supply and place standard bowl fixtures to residence and class room and porcelain receptacles to all other outlets.\n\nAs there is no power line near the Michel School, we are not prepared to purchase the Delco light plant which it is stated will cost approximately $711.00.\n\nThe Department has had experience in a few other places with such installations. These plants may appear simple to operate but we have found there is seldom anyone around a day school who is familiar with their operation and as a consequence the equipment is either out of order or we are continually being requested to expend money for maintenance and repairs.\nRegarding the installation of water facilities, it is noted that the estimated price is $340.89 at the Stony Plain School and $366.49 at the Michel School. Are we to understand that if these installations were approved it would require electricity to operate the pump?\n\nWe are aware that you are widely acquainted with conditions in the province of Alberta and we would like to know the approximate percentage of white schools located in country districts in Alberta that have electricity and water facilities of the type recommended in your letter.\n\nBernard F.

This will acknowledge yours of the 27th instant. I am pleased to know that you agree to the installation of electric energy, etc., at the Stony Plains School.\n\nIn regard to the Michel School, which is not on a power line, it is regretted that at the time of writing you were not prepared to purchase a lighting plant. It is agreed here that some of these plants do give trouble from time to time, but it is to be said that there has been considerable advancement in the types and durability of such units and many are now so constructed that little can go wrong. Furthermore, they are well serviced by the selling company.\n\nMost companies can supply a combination unit, which supplies energy and pumps water by motor. It was this sort of combination unit that was suggested for these two schools. There is a very good well at the Michel School. If electric energy was supplied here, it would be a simple matter to add a pump jack, small motor and pressure tank in the basement of the school to supply the necessary water to be used in the residence. The same combination plant would be adaptable at both schools, but it must be admitted that the well at the Stony Plains school is not very good. Until such time as there is a guaranteed supply, it is not wise to install a pumping plant.\n\nIt is our firm conviction that there will be a demand for combination units at these schools. It is very much cheaper to install them during construction than at a later date.\n\nYou state that I must be fully acquainted with conditions in Alberta and the approximate percentage of white schools that have facilities of the type recommended. I must admit I do not know what percentage of rural schools in this province have these facilities. It would be my guess, however, that there are very few. Most of the rural schools have been closed for two reasons:\n\n1. School boards could not get teachers who were prepared to live under such conditions and in such isolated spots.\n2. The large school divisional unit has replaced these small rural units. Invariably these larger units have every facility.\nIndian Affairs Branch - 2 - Nov. 29/47\n\nReverting to consideration of the Michel school. Would you not be prepared to have this building wired while it is being constructed? The cost will not be great, and I hope approval will be given. You may never be prepared to go further than that, but I think the Indians of the Michel Band will at least want electric light in the building.\n\nAs stated in my letter to you of the 5th instant, this place should not only be a school but a community center. If I am correct, would it be in order for the Michel Band to pay for the installation of a power plant from their Band funds, if they so desire? It has never been discussed with them and will not be discussed, if you do not agree that the place should also be a community center. I am convinced that there will be a strong demand at sometime in the future for electric energy and possibly a water and septic system. Please consider seriously the request for wiring the building now. If you agree, please advise Indian Agent Robertson direct, and send a copy to this office.\n\nG. H.

Ltd., for 2nd Progress Payment in connection with the construction of the above school, amount $4,242.76.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Day Schools Michel and Stony Plain Indian Reserves.\n\nI am advised by the Sister Superior, Youville School, St. Albert, that they have 40 surplus desks on hand, the property of the Department, which are in good condition and available for use in the new schools if desired.\n\nIn connection with these new schools, would advise that the contractors expect to have them all completed in from six weeks to two months. Will you please advise if it is the intention of the Department to open them when they are completed. The parents at both Reserves are very anxious to get the children home from the residential schools but my own opinion is that they are better off where they are for the balance of the school year. We would, no doubt, also experience considerable difficulty in securing qualified teachers during the midst of a school year.\n\nE. A. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 26, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant in which you advise that there are forty desks on hand at the Youville School. You may arrange to have these transferred to either the Michel or Stony Plain Schools when the buildings are completed. You should also advise us the number of additional desks that will be necessary at your school. Desks are made in three sizes, large, medium and small and you should state the number in each size. You should also give shipping instructions.\n\nChildren enrolled at the residential schools should remain in these schools until the end of June, 1948. As you state in your letter, it is extremely unlikely that we will be able to secure teachers for these schools until the start of the academic year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F.

These should be approximately the same but through an error in billing from one of the lumber sub-contractors, some lumber delivered to Michel School was billed as delivered to Stoney Plain School. Adjustment will be made on the next progress report.\n\nIf road conditions would permit both schools could be finished up in about one week but all roads are blocked with snow at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.

These could be sanded and varnished in Edmonton at a cost of approximately $3.00 per desk.\n\nThe assortment as to sizes will work out O.K. for one school and I would suggest that they be placed in the Michel school. The desks are of the type as shown on the attached cut.\n\nThe Stony Plain School will require 40 desks, 10 small, 20 medium, and 10 large.\n\nJUN 9\n\nA.M.\n\nRobertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEARskt Encl.\n\nPRESTON BALL BEARING SINGLE DESK\n\nNon Adjustable, Open Book Shelf Type\n\nAluminum Standards Tough and Sturdy\n\nWith this Desk Preston have built a much improved single stationary.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nPP/MGD\nColonel Neary:\n\nThis school is approaching completion. It is much superior to neighbouring Alberta one-room schools, and will, no doubt, attract some white pupils, thus facilitating the exchange of pupils which is dealt with in a separate memorandum.\n\nThe fact that there are already some accidental breakages in the asbestos shingles bears out the criticism that this outer covering should be avoided.\n\nThe window screens already show signs of rusting and should receive early treatment.\n\nIt is planned to install an electrical plant, and the wiring and wall fixtures are already in place. I would urge, however, re-consideration of the type of electrical plant projected. A 32-volt system has been mentioned as the likely installation. I suggest a change even if the original installation should cost a few hundred dollars more. Aside from the likelihood of trouble with the numerous batteries, anyone who moves into the teacherage is going to be frustrated at discovering that any standard electric iron, toaster, shaver, hot-plate, percolator, blanket, mixer, etc., is useless in this \"electrically-equipped\" establishment. And the usual radio or movie projector would never work satisfactorily even with a transformer.\n\nIf the Wikwemikong plant is proving satisfactory, I suggest a similar plant for Michel. That would provide the usual 60 cycle 110-volt alternating current.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopies to Regional supervisor Supt., Edmonton Agency\nJune 19, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nMr. Clark has forwarded to us a letter dated June 15th in connection with the Michel School. I note that he has sent a copy of this letter to you.\n\nThe Michel School will cost us considerably more than we anticipated and as a matter of fact, more than the cost of similar buildings in other parts of the Dominion.\n\nWe have no funds available for making the change that Mr. Clark suggests in the electric installation. You are aware that authority for placing electricity in this school was given in our letter of December 1st, 1947, and the amounts mentioned in that letter should not be exceeded.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nc/o to E.A. Robertson.\n\nPP/MGD\nJune 22, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alta.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the shipping of desks for the Stony Plain School.\n\nWe do not understand the request that you make in the second paragraph of your letter.

Robertson.\n\nLABOUR AND LABOUR CHARGES - $5959.10\n\nPayroll charges aggregating $5959.10 are distributed as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Labour                       | $5527.68 |\n| Holiday Pay                  | 165.53   |\n| Workmen's Compensation       | 221.85   |\n| Public Liability & Property  |          |\n| Damage                       | 18.43    |\n| Unemployment Insurance       | 27.31    |\n| **Total**                    | **$5959.10** |\n\nPayrolls have been examined in detail and compared with original paysheets. Daily time records were not available for examination, as these are destroyed once they have been transferred to and balanced with paysheets.\n\nThe rates of pay observed on the job were in accordance with those approved in the agreement and based on a 44 hour week, with overtime at time and a half. Travelling time was paid at the regular rate and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\nSuperintendent $1.67\u00bd per hour\n(based on fixed salary of $75.00 per week, 40 hr. week)\nCarpenter foreman 1.40 per hour\nCarpenters 1.25 - 1.35\nLabour foreman .90\nLabour .80\nCement finisher 1.45\nIndian Labour .55 & .75\n(Approved by Indian Agent)\n\nOn Payroll # 43 for the week ending October 30/47, an error of $3.15 has been noted in the computation of J.D., Taylor's wages which should be $56.70 instead of $59.85. The error has been brought to the Contractor's attention and the necessary adjustment will be reflected on the final claim.\nOn Payroll #45 for the week ending November 15th, a total of 24 hours has been charged as overtime in error. This was adjusted on Payroll #46, by deleting 4 hours on November 15th, for each of the men involved.\n\nSeveral small adjustments were made in connection with Indian labourers to bring their earnings up to minimum wage rates.\n\nHOLIDAY PAY has been computed throughout at the rate of 3% of the payrolls and covers all employees including Indians. The contracting firm considered the rate of 3% as a fair average, but are prepared to adjust on their final claim any discrepancy which a detailed computation might disclose at the completion of the project. In most instances, Holiday Pay was not added to the payrolls for purposes of computing Workmen's Compensation and Public Liability and Property Damage. The latter charges will also require minor adjustments on the final claim.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION charges have been calculated at 4% of payrolls. Adjustments arising out of assessments on individual earnings over $2000 will be credited on the final claim.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE - The Contractor is fully covered in this respect by a Policy which is in good standing. Charges applicable to this project were calculated at .31% of the gross payrolls from the commencement of the project to Payroll #2 for the period ending January 15th 1948, and at .250% on the remaining payrolls included to date. The current year's rate has since been established at .228% and the required adjustment will be credited on the final claim.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE contributions have been deducted from all employees except Superintendent H.C. Ellenwood, who receives a fixed salary of $75.00 a week. Employer's portion has been charged on basis on 75% of employees contributions.\n\nINCOME TAX - The Contractor's records were examined for compliance with Income Tax regulations and evidence of deductions and remittances was produced to the examiner's satisfaction.\n\nFIRE INSURANCE ON the project is contained in Policy #7859 for $11,000 with the Aetna Insurance Co. and is in the names of the Department of Indian Affairs and Poole Construction Co. Ltd. The original policy has been lodged with the Department through the Indian Agent. The duplicate copy of the Policy has been examined and payment of premium verified.\n\nMATERIALS - $5027.79\n\nInvoices for materials, small tools, either purchased by Contractor or supplied from their own stock, have been checked to purchase orders and requisitions, and have been certified by the Indian Agent. Proof of payment has also been verified.\n\nTransfers of materials to this project from the Winterburn project or vice versa, and items distributed between the two schools, were found to be in order.\nSMALL TOOLS\n\nA joint inventory of small tools purchased and charged to the Michel and Winterburn Schools has been set up.\n\nTRAVELLING EXPENSES\n\nTravelling expenses have been paid to G.J. See, job foreman, who provided transportation for the man in his own car at the rate of $2.00 per round trip, each representing approximately 36 miles. Evidence of payment has been established and the number of trips checked with the number of days worked during each period.\n\nHIRED EQUIPMENT - $414.25\n\nCharges amounting to $175.50 were paid to L.& R. Calahoo for the services of man and team at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\nPayment of $70.00 to the Municipal District of Morinville No. 31, has been approved for digging basement with Crawler Tractor.\n\nHauling of gravel from a pit on the reservation was carried out by H.J. Marks, at the rate of $2.50 per hour at a total cost of $168.75.\n\nTRUCKING - $549.00\n\nTotal charges recorded under this caption were for Contractor's equipment used for hauling materials, at the rate of $3.00 per hour, including operator. Daily time cards were checked to the invoices submitted and found in order and have been approved by the Indian Agent.\n\nSUB/CONTRACTS\n\nMillwork - W.H. Clark Lumber Co. have agreed to supply millwork at an estimated price of $1829.00. This has been found acceptable by the Indian Agent. Invoices submitted to date amount to $1594.36.\n\nPainting & Decorating - The firm of Jack Mason was the only party interested in the job and has agreed to complete painting and decorating for $1050.00. To date accounts covering 80% of the job have been submitted amounting to $787.50.\n\nElectrical - Al's Electric, 12130 - 95A Street, have been authorized to supply and install electrical wiring and outlets at the cost of $315, and to supply and install standard fixtures in the classroom and residence for $195. Accounts have so far been rendered for $490.40.\n\nPlumbing & Heating - This phase of the project has been carried out on a cost of labour and material basis, as no firm appeared interested in submitting estimates.\n\nThe firm of Dow & Scott have rendered accounts for plumbing amounting to $151.05, including $10.00 for labour.\nThe firm of Freeze & Maxwell have agreed to supply and install the furnace and heating system on the same basis. They have to date submitted accounts for $404.66. Completion of this work is estimated to cost approximately $450 more.\n\nThe General Contractor has a sufficient hold-back against these two firms and on completion of the entire project a detail audit will be carried out.\n\nCOMMISSION OR FEE - $1432.00\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the Poole Construction Company Ltd., have charged a 10% commission or fee on all costs included in Progress Claims 1 to 4, omitting any commission on any earnings of the Company from rentals of their own equipment.\n\nENCLOSURES:\n\nProgress Certificates - 3 copies\nSummary of Charges - 3 copies\nPayrolls, Suppliers' Invoices and Vouchers - 1 copy\nAuditor's Report - 5 copies\n\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nJune 26th, 1948.\n\nApproved:\n\nHAG.

Robertson I visited this school today. Sixteen of the seventeen enrolled Indians were present together with the teacher's two children. She reports having forwarded the age-six-grade return.\n\nThe requisition which she forwarded has not yet been filled but there are no serious lack of school supplies.\n\n(4) Fire extinguishers should be supplied as soon as possible.\n\nA school register is needed.\n\nFoot-scrapers and door mats will be necessary to cope with the gumbo.\n\nMaterial (linoleum) to surface the floor is on order, but for best results should not be applied until the Christmas vacation.\n\nSome desks and shelves for the pupils' books, and some seats need adjustment.\n\nThe furnace room should be equipped with a poker, an axe, and an instrument to break lump coal. The furnace-shaker, used once for the last-named purpose, must be replaced immediately. I think there is too much paper and old card-board in the furnace-room.\n\nThis was my first look at our new one-room school\u2014teaching in operation. I noticed that the outdoor toilet installation had been modified by setting the buildings over pits.\ninstead of using buckets which would be difficult to empty during cold weather.\n\nThere is a lot of furnace and it does not seem sized with a view to ease of firing and ash removal. The carrying out of ashes is another chore that is aggravated by the non-existence of a door from the basement at ground level. Ashes must be brought up to the school entrance and out and down.\n\nChains to the furnace controls should be adjusted so that they do not rub the pipes.\n\nThe lighting fixtures in the classroom are, perhaps, not suited to the low-power lamps usable with a 32-volt system, but the teacher says that no for daytime lighting is not a problem. As of Nov. 1st school hours have been cut to 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM.\n\nThe teacher is in the process of recapturing her former skills. It appears to be one of our easier assignments, but it is an isolated station, and bad weather can make it more so.\n\nThe annual cost per pupil is likely to exceed the average.\n\nThe teacher reports that the pupils bring adequate lunches and beverages and that supplementary issues are not needed. The pupils did, indeed, look well-fed and well-clothed.\n\nC.A.

Robertson,\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Desks, Indian School\n\nI am enclosing herewith bill for the refinishing of the desks for the above school in the amount of $224.00 which is at the quoted rate of $3.50 per desk.\n\nIn future will you please figure at the rate of $4.50 per desk as we lose money on this job. The actual labor came to $232.00 and the materials to over $25.00. The high labor was occasioned by the necessity of taking the desks apart to finish, and interchanging parts of repaired desks to make complete ones.\n\nHoping that you were satisfied with the work done, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J. McFarlane.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReference to the attached Voucher 419-48\nfor $224.00 in favour of McFarlane Wood Products,\nEdmonton, for refinishing 64 school desks taken\nover from Youville Residential School.\n\nYou will note that McFarlane's have\ncharged $3.50 each for finishing these desks in-\nstead of the $3.00 originally estimated.\n\nI am also attaching a letter from McFar-\nlane's Wood Products from which it would appear\nthat they actually lost money on the work at the\n$3.50 charge and under the circumstances I would\nrecommend that the voucher be paid.\n\nE.A.

Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Day School & Residence -\nMichel Reserve - Edmonton Agency\nPocle Construction Co., Ltd. - Contractors.\n\nProgress Claim #5 - $8,447.33 (final)\n\nThe audit of the final Progress Claim, No. 5, in connection with the above contract has been completed by the undersigned at the Contractors' office in Edmonton, and in conjunction with records and information furnished by the Superintendent of the Edmonton Agency, Mr. E.A. Robertson, and the report thereon follows:\n\nLabor and Labor Charges: $975.07\n\nThis amount represents the balance of payrolls and related charges to the completion of the school, and brings the total labor costs for the project to $6,934.17.\n\nThe payrolls submitted have been examined in detail and calculations have been found correct. Transfers from original time cards to the paysheets were also found in order.\n\nThe scale of wages paid by the Contractor was in accordance with rates that have been approved and set out in the Agreement. The rates observed were on the basis of an 8 hour day, 44 hour week with time and a half for overtime and double time for holiday work. Travelling time was paid at the regular rate and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\nIn compliance with an agreement reached between the Edmonton Builders' Exchange and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners of America which became effective on April 1, 1949, the following rates were paid by the Contractors after that date:\n\n(Cont'd Page 2)\nCarpenter foreman - $1.50 per hour\nCarpenter - 1.40 per hour\nLaborers - .90 per hour\nSuperintendent - 2.00 per hour, based on a fixed salary of $80.00 per week for 40 hour week, with approval of the Edmonton Agency Superintendent.\n\nIndian labor has been paid at 75\u00a2 per hour, with approval of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nAn overpayment of $3.15 to J.D. Taylor on Payroll #43, Progress Claim #8 has been adjusted in the present claim by a credit voucher for $.42 which also takes other payroll charges into account.\n\nHoliday Pay - $23.26\n\nDiscrepancies in the calculation of Holiday Pay in claims #1 to 4 inclusive have been adjusted in this claim by a credit voucher for $.12. The balance of $23.26 claimed in this application has been found correct and in order.\n\nHoliday Pay Books have been examined and proof of payment has been established.\n\nHoliday Pay has been taken into account in the computation of other Payroll charges.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation - $21.98\n\nThe Contractor has been assessed at the rate of 4% of estimated gross payrolls for the years 1947 and 1948 by the Workmen's Compensation Board of Alberta.\n\nThe amount of $21.98 presently claimed is a correct balance of the charges paid by the Contractor to cover employees on this contract, after taking into account a rebate of $21.79 on 1947 payments in connection with employees whose earnings exceeded the maximum assessable amount of $2000.00.\n\nA further examination of the Contractor's records will be made as soon as returns for 1948 have been completed in order to secure any credit that may accrue on 1948 W.C.B. rebates.\n\nThe Poole Construction Co. have obtained the necessary clearance from the Alberta W.C. Board in respect to this contract.\nPublic Liability & Property Damage - $2.10\n\nThe Contractor is sufficiently covered against the above risks and has remained in good standing throughout the contract by prompt payment of premiums which were based on .51% of the estimated gross payroll for 1947 and .228% for 1948.\n\nThe calculations have been reviewed on all claims submitted and the above charge of $2.10 has been found reasonably accurate.\n\nUnemployment Insurance - $3.86\n\nThis amount represents the employer's portion of contributions paid on behalf of employees on the project who were insurable. The Contractor has produced the Unemployment Insurance Books for examination and appears to have complied with the Act.\n\nIncome Tax -\n\nIn compliance with Income Tax Regulations, the Contractor has made deductions from taxable employees and remitted same to the Receiver General regularly.\n\nMaterials - $273.48\n\nInvoices for materials purchased or supplied from the Contractor's stock have been compared with Purchase Orders and requisitions as well as checked for calculations and extensions. Although Delivery slips were not available to prove delivery, of materials, the Indian Superintendent has been able to certify that the materials charged were actually received and used on the project.\n\nMaterials transferred and divided between the Michel and Stony Plain schools have been checked closely and found reasonably well accounted for.\n\nSmall Tools -\n\nThe small tools that have been charged to the project have been recorded in a joint inventory for both schools. In view of the small amount involved, the adjustment for items retained by the Contractor, which amount to $24.97 has been credited entirely on Claim #8 of the Stony Plain contract.\n\nFire Insurance -\n\nAn Insurance Policy with the Aetna Insurance Company for $11,000.00 on the school while under construction has expired and on advice from the Indian Superintendent was not renewed by the Contractor.\nTravelling Expenses - $30.00\n\nThis amount has been paid to Company employees for providing transportation to the men in their personal cars. The round trip covered some 36 miles and the rate of $2.00 per trip which has been charged, appears fair and reasonable.\n\nSub-Contracts\n\nMillwork - W.H. Clark Lumber Co.\n\nAll invoices for millwork supplied by this subcontractor were included in previous claims 1 to 4. These amounted to $1,594.96 to the completion of the school, although they have not all been listed under sub-contracts. This amount compares favorably with the Company's approved tender for $1,829.00.\n\nThe details of transfer voucher #1439 on claim #4 for $51.59 covering millwork supplied by this Company, have been checked and the adjustments listed found in order as the following invoices disclosed:\n\nThe first item for $19.40 was to adjust Invoice #12096 for $38.80 which was charged to the Stony Plain school on claim #5, whereas one half was applicable to the Michel School.\n\nThe second item for $29.70 was to adjust Invoice #10544 for $59.40 which was also charged entirely to Stony Plain on claim #5, whereas one half applied to the Michel school.\n\nThe third item for $52.79 represents Invoice #90 for the same amount which was charged to Stony Plain on claim #4 whereas it pertained to the Michel School.\n\nThe fourth item for $80.30 represents one half of Invoice #10544 for $100.60 which was charged entirely to Michel whereas one half applied to Stony Plain.\n\nAll millwork and other materials supplied by the W.H. Clark Lumber Co. and included in the invoices submitted, have been paid in full by the prime contractor.\n\nPainting & Decorating - $262.50 - Jack Mason.\n\nThis amount represents the balance of the account for the painting and decorating performed by Jack Mason at the agreed price of $1,050.00 which has been paid in full by the Prime Contractor.\n\nElectrical - Al's Electric - Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThe supply and installation of electrical wiring and fixtures in the school and living quarters have been completed by the above at a total cost of $490.40, which amount is within the estimated price of $510.00, approved by the Indian Affairs Branch.\nAll charges have been submitted in claims 1 to 4 inclusive and have been paid in full by the prime contractor.\n\nThis sub-contractor, although requested to do so, has not furnished a Statutory Declaration. As the owner has performed the work himself, the Contractor, having a sufficient hold back on other projects, is not alarmed over any liability that might arise and feels that the claim need not be held up any longer.\n\nPlumbing - Dow & Scott, Ltd.\n\nThe above firm has supplied and installed the plumbing material and fixtures required at a total cost of $151.05 including $10.00 for labor. This account has been submitted in claims 1 - 4 and has been fully paid by the prime contractor.\n\nHeating - $683.50 - Freeze & Maxwell Co., Ltd.\n\nThe prime contractor was not able to secure competitive bids for the completion of this portion of the work, and consequently had to have the work completed at current market rates.\n\nThe firm of Freeze & Maxwell who agreed to perform the work on this basis have submitted the balance of their charges amounting to $683.50. This amount, in addition to $404.66 submitted in Claims 1 - 4 inclusive, brings the total charges for this sub-contract to $1,088.46, distributed as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Shop Labor            | $172.16  |\n| Job Labor             | $164.45  |\n| 723B Furnace          | $404.66  |\n| Sales tax             | $38.05   |\n| Registers & other materials | $314.14 |\n\n$1,088.46\n\nAn examination of the sub-contractor's records discloses that a mark-up of approximately 40% has been added to the cost price of labor and materials to arrive at the amount charged. Thus the total labor charge has cost the sub-contractor a total of $475.46 for both schools or $2,377.73 for each as compared with $356.61 actually charged for each. The cost of the furnace was $225.75.\n\nAccording to information obtained from the prime contractor (Poole Construction) and the Indian Superintendent, there was no alternative but to award the sub-contract to a firm that would agree to do the work at their regular rates, which the above firm has done in this case.\n\nPrime Contractor's Commission or fee - $225.75\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Agreement the Poole Construction Co., Ltd., have claimed a fee of 10% on the cost of the work completed since the previous claim. The amount of $225.46 claimed in this application is correct and brings the total fee for the contract to $1,654.46.\nThe payrolls and accounts submitted by the Contractor in the present and previous applications have all been checked and proof of payment established for all amounts claimed.\n\nThe Sub-Contractors have likewise received full payment from the prime Contractor and have, with the exception of Al's Electric, furnished Statutory Declarations to the effect that all their accounts pertaining to this contract have been paid.\n\nClearances from the Workmen's Compensation Board of Alberta have been obtained to certify that the Prime Contractor and the Sub-Contractors who had men in their employ on either schools, have complied with the requirements of the Board.\n\nThe Contractor has also produced the necessary statement from the Indian Superintendent to confirm the completion of the school in a satisfactory manner and in accordance with the plans and specifications of the contract.\n\nA Final Inventory of materials certified by the Indian Superintendent discloses that no surplus material of any appreciable value remained to be disposed of on the completion of the schools. The Indian Superintendent has further confirmed that temporary buildings erected and used by the contractor were converted into latrines at the termination of the contract.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, I hereby certify that, in accordance with the provisions of the above contract, I have examined the accounts and records of the Contractor insofar as they pertain to this contract, and I have received all the necessary information and explanations, and the amount of $18,748.35 is the fair cost thereof as shown by the accounts, records and data given to me.\n\nJ.

Nov.10, 1948.\n\nThis is a new one-room school with living quarters for the teacher as part of the building. The building is of modern construction with a basement playroom and an additional storeroom in which is installed a Delco light plant. This room was not closed, but was accessible from the playroom. The volume of the furnace is quite ample to heat the building. The inside measurements of the classroom are 28 feet by 22 feet. There is no provision for a work room.\n\nThe toilets are substantial outdoor buildings.\n\nThe school does not meet the specifications of the School Building Branch, Department of Education, Alberta, in the following respects-\n\n(1) The hot air registers are in the floor.\n(2) Window lighting is not ample in comparison to floor space.\n\nIt is possible that the installation of the Delco plant may not meet the regulations on the Alberta Fire Commissioner. It should not be left accessible to the children under any circumstances.\n\nThe levelling of the playground, and the installation of playground equipment is herein recommended as a project in the near future.\n\nThe building as at present constructed makes no provision for any work other than academic.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nInspector of Schools.\nMarch 26, 1949.\n\nSchool Building Branch,\nDepartment of Education,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have recently completed two new Indian Day Schools near Edmonton. A report submitted by Mr. R. J. Scott, Inspector of Schools, indicates that these schools do not meet the specifications of your Branch because\n\n(1) the hot air registers are in the floor,\n(2) window lighting is not ample, in comparison to floor space.\n\nIt would be appreciated therefore if we could have a list of the specifications which you have prepared for one and two room schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 26, 1949.\n\nMr. H. A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nMichel Indian Day School,\n\nMr. R. J. Scott, Inspector of Schools, has commented on the Daleo plant at this school. He indicates that the installation of the Daleo plant might not meet the regulations of the Alberta Fire Commissioner. He has clearly indicated that it should not be left accessible to the children under any circumstances.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could receive a report as to the location of the Daleo plants at both this school and the Stony Plain School. You should also point out the precautions taken to prevent the children from tampering with these lighting plants.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| Description                  | Unit | Total |\n|------------------------------|------|-------|\n| Shutter                      |      |       |\n| Door - deal                  |      |       |\n| Door - steel                 |      |       |\n| Door - hinging               |      |       |\n| Door - painted               |      |       |\n| Door - anodizing             |      |       |\n| Door (right) unpainted       |      |       |\n| Propet                       |      |       |\n| Washbasin                    |      |       |\n\nSet.

The pump at this school is not in use at present as the pipes between the well and the school have frozen, and they are getting the water with a pail and rope over a pulley. I think the freezing was due to the fact that the pipes were laid too late in the fall and the ground in the trench had no time to properly settle. The pipes are down six feet at the school and eight feet at the well which should be well below the frost line.\n\nThe Stony Plain School has no Delco Plant. They are on Calgary Power. Sketch showing location of their pump is also enclosed.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n8th April, 1949.\n\nMr. R.A.

If this could be done when a machine is working in the neighborhood, the cost would be approximately $40.00 but if it has to be brought in from Edmonton, it would probably cost double that. If authority can be granted for the $40.00 expenditure, I will endeavor to have the first machine working near the school do the work.\n\nE. A.

They are minimum rates only and nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the right of employers to pay higher wages. In cases where, during the course of the work, such higher rates are fixed by provincial legislation, by agreements between employers and employees in the district or by changes in prevailing custom.\n\nWherever provincial legislation, or by agreement or current practice, the working hours of any class of workers are less than 44 per week, such lesser hours shall not be exceeded on this work, except in cases of emergency as may be approved by the Minister of Labour and then only subject to the payment of overtime rates as specified by the Minister of Labour.\n\n(See next page)\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification thereof for the purpose of disputes. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employees or employees for any services performed for any hours or wages at rates set forth in the schedule or fixed hereafter by the Minister of Labour hereunder for overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall be deemed as having been paid to the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of all classes of workmen employed; (2) the classification of the contract; (3) whether any arrears in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time file with the Minister such additional information as may be required by the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of due notice being given of payment of any money owing in respect of wages of the workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to avoid all risk and all liability which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for the strict observance of all instructions given on the part of subcontractors; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work contemplated in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Provisional Amount: Eleven Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($11,000.00), on the building only while in course of construction and unoccupied, to be nine stories in height and to be built of frame and roofed with shingles, and its additions to be built of frame and roofed with shingles, and in contact therewith, foundations (except as hereinafter excluded), landlord's permanent fittings and fixtures attached thereto and forming part thereof, including fences, freestones and plate glass, including materials to enter into and form part of the finished structure therein, or elsewhere on the premises, to be occupied when completed as Indian School.\n\nSituated and being No. on the Michal, Alberta - Indian Reserve side of Street, in the Province of Alberta.\n\nAll the property of the insured or for which the insured is legally responsible.\n\nInsurance map references: Vol. Sheet NOP Block No.\n\nSubject to the following conditions and limitations:\n\n2.

The amount of insurance stated in this policy is provisional. It is a condition of this Builders' Risk Insurance, wherein the rate of premium is based upon an average annual rate for the period of insurance, that the Company shall have the right while this policy is in force, to adjust the amount of insurance thereunder to that proportion of the provisional amount that the actual value of the described property on that date bears to the value at the date of completion, but shall not in any case exceed the provisional amount.\n\n4. In consideration of the rate of premium at which this policy is written, it is a condition of this insurance that in the event of loss, this Company shall be liable for no greater proportion thereof, than the provisional amount of insurance under this policy bears to the value of the described property at date of completion.\n\n5. Permission is given to do such work and to keep and use such materials as are usual in the erection and completion of buildings.\n\n6. In event of loss, the amount of such loss shall be automatically reinstated and in consideration of such reinstatement the insured shall pay this Company an additional premium computed at pro rata of the rate at which this policy is written for the unexpired term of this policy on the amount of loss paid.\n\n7.

It is also made a condition of this contract that in event of loss or damage to the property insured under the provisions hereof, this Company shall be liable only for such proportion of any direct loss or damage by lightning (except as above stated) as the amount hereby insured bears to the whole amount insured thereon, whether such other insurance is with us or elsewhere or not.\n\n9.

They are minimum rates only and nothing herein contained shall be considered as exempting contractors and sub-contractors from the payment of higher rates in any instance where, during the continuance of the work, such higher rates are fixed by provincial legislation, by agreements between employers and employees in the district or by changes in prevailing rates.\n\nWhere, by provincial legislation, or by agreement or current practice, the working hours of any class of workers are less than 44 per week, such lesser hours shall be deemed to be normal hours of emergency as may be approved by the Minister of Labour and then only subject to the payment of overtime rates as specified by the Minister of Labour.\n\nA. I. (See next page)\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purpose of overtime and regular time. Immediately upon receipt of notice from the Minister of Labour hereunder, the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates fixed in the schedule inserted thereto by the Minister of Labour herein, regarding overtime and classified work, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes be between the Contractor and the Government and no action shall be taken to be brought against the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed or occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen employed and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether the conditions in respect of the said work and labour remain in accordance with (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information as may be required by the Minister to decide whether or not such claim that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in the payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is made to the satisfaction of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) All contracts shall extend only to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuse which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trade concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all such conditions on the part of subcontractors; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available, or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

POWER TO TAKE WORK FROM CONTRACTOR\n\nIn case the Contractor shall make default or delay in commencing, or in diligently executing any of the work or portions thereof to be performed, or that may be ordered under the contract, to the satisfaction of the Indian Agent, the Indian Agent may give a general notice to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, and should such default or delay continue for six days after such notice shall have been given by the Indian Agent to the contractor, or should the Contractor make default in the completion of the work, or any portion thereof, within the time limited with respect thereto in or under this contract, or should the Contractor become insolvent or abandon the work or make an assignment of this contract without the consent required or otherwise fail to observe and perform any of the provisions of the contract, then and in any of such cases, the Minister, for and on behalf of His Majesty, and without any further authorization, may take all the work out of the Contractor's hands and may employ such means as he may see fit to complete the work, and in such cases the Contractor shall have no claim for any further payment on account of the fee stipulated to be payable to the Contractor or in respect of work performed, but shall be chargeable with, and shall remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by His Majesty by reason or such default, or delay, or the non-completion by the Contractor of the work, and all horses, machinery, tools, plant and equipment, and all rights proprietary or otherwise, licences, powers and privileges, whether relating to or affecting real estate or personal property, acquired, possessed or provided by the Contractor for the purposes of the work, or by the Indian Agent under the provision of the contract may be used, exercised and enjoyed by His Majesty, for the purpose of carrying out the work as fully to all intents and purposes as they might theretofore have been used, exercised and enjoyed by the Contractor.\n\n13. INSURANCE\n\n(a) The Contractor, unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, shall insure all materials, equipment and Contractor's plant during transit and at all times during the construction and until the final acceptance of the work and shall keep the same and all buildings and structures being constructed and/or erected insured against loss by fire, in such insurance company or companies and in such amount or amounts as may be approved of by the Indian Agent and the policies of such insurance shall be made payable at the interests of the Contractor and His Majesty, may, respectively, appear, and the original policies together with certified copies thereof shall be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch; provided that such buildings or structures need not be insured by the Contractor from and after the date of the occupation thereof by His Majesty.\n\n(b) The Contractor shall maintain such insurance as will protect him from claims under Workmen's Compensation Acts and from any other claims for damages for personal injury, including death, which may arise from his operations under the Contract. Certificates of such insurance shall be forwarded to the Indian Affairs branch and shall be subject to their approval as to adequacy of protection; and the Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless His Majesty from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made brought or prosecuted in any manner based upon, occasioned by, or attributable to any such death, or injury, or any damage to, or infringement of, any property or right.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata":
