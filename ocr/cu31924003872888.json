Nicholson, on pages 66 and 67 of his report on the Palaeontology of Ontario for 1875, as follows:\n\n\"The Guelph Limestones contain in abundance a species of coral, which I am unable to refer with certainty to its proper genus. Some specimens have the form of detached cylindrical tubes, irregular in their thickness, but varying in diameter from a line and a half to three lines. These tubes are flexuous, and furnished both with very well developed tabulae, and with marginal septa in the form of strong longitudinal ridges. Examples of this kind present precisely the characters of the genus Amplexus, and I have been under the impression that they were referable to Amplexus laxatus, of Billings, a form which is quoted in the \"Geology of Canada,\" as occurring in the Guelph Limestones, but the description of which I have been unable to consult.\"\n\n\"Other specimens, equally or more abundant, consist of numerous closely approximated tubes, similar in their structure to the above, and apparently forming part of a composite mass. This would lead one to separate these specimens from Amplexus, which contains only simple forms; but one would still be left uncertain where to place them. The genus to which such specimens are referable by their general form and mode of growth is Diphyphyllum; but they differ from this genus and agree with Amplexus, in the presence of complete tabulae, (not a mere central tabulate area), and in the rudimentary condition of the septa. The same form occurs in the Corniferous Limestone, but I must at present leave its position unsettled.\"\n\n**Pycnostylus Guelphensis.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 1, figs. 1, 1a & 1b.\n\n?

Billings, 1857: Guelph, R. Bell, 1861: Hespeler, T. C. Weston, 1867: Elora, Mr. D. Boyle, 1880: Durham, Mr. J. Townsend.\n\nA common and characteristic fossil of the Guelph Formation, to\nwhich two manuscript names, unaccompanied by any description or figure, have been applied at different times by Mr. E. Billings. In the Museum of the Survey the species is labelled *Amplexus congregatus*, Billings, by that naturalist himself, the label being not written but printed. The same coral is called *Amplexus laxatus* in the latter part of the twelfth chapter of the \"Geology of Canada.\" As both of these specific names would be singularly inappropriate for this coral as now understood, it is not thought desirable to perpetuate either.\n\nNatural transverse sections of this species, (as in the original of fig. 1b, on plate 1) shew a quadripartite, and more rarely a tripartite division of the corallites. This appearance might be supposed to be the result of fission, rather than of calicular gemmation, but is really due to the coalescence of the inner walls of the corallites immediately after budding,\u2014as in the case of the genus *Diphyphyllum*.\n\n**Pycnostylus elegans.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 1, figs. 2 & 2a.\n\nCorallites attaining to a diameter of from thirteen to seventeen millimetres: increasing by calicular gemmation in such a manner as to divide into six or seven branches on the same plane: external surface regularly and longitudinally ribbed, the ribs alternating with the septa within: all the septa of uniform height and size.\n\nHespeler, T. C. Weston, 1867: Durham, Mr. J. Townsend.\n\nThe only specimen of this coral in which calicular gemmation is plainly visible is presented by figure 2 on plate 1. Part of this specimen is covered with rock, but on the exposed surface five buds are visible, one of which is an inch and a quarter long, while the other four are broken off at their bases. Judging by the diameter of the buds in proportion to that of the calyx from which they spring, it is probable that the entire cycle would consist of either seven or eight.\n\nIt is possible that the specimens for which the above name is provisionally suggested may prove to be portions of the basal extremity of *P. Guelpensis* denuded of their epitheca, but at present no intermediate examples between the two forms have been collected.\n\n**BRACHIPODA.**\n\n*Spirifera plicatella*, Sowerby.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: three single valves.\nATRYPA RETICULARIS, Linn.\n\nHespeler, T. C. Weston, 1871: two specimens of the ordinary form and one small valve with few and distant nodulous ribs, resembling the variety figured by Davidson in the \"Silurian Brachiopoda\" (Pl. xiv., fig. 22,) as \"approaching in character A. aspera.\"\n\nMONOMERELLA OVATA. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 2, fig. 1, & plate 8, figs. 1, 1a, 1b, & 1c.\n\nShell inequivalve, the ventral valve being much larger than the dorsal: outline ovate as viewed laterally, the greatest breadth being a little in advance of the middle: valves regularly convex or with a faint mesial impression on each: maximum thickness through the closed valves in some specimens equal to, and in others slightly exceeding their greatest breadth. Umbo of the ventral valve tumid, gibbous and prominently arched, its beak being curved strongly and abruptly inwards and down to the centre of the posterior margin of the hinge plate: umbo of the dorsal valve smaller than that of the ventral and not nearly so prominent nor so much curved. Surface marked by rather coarse, irregular and concentric lines of growth. Test very thick posteriorly, but gradually becoming much thinner towards the anterior margin.\n\nCharacters of the interior of the dorsal valve unknown. So far as they can be ascertained at present, the markings on the interior of the ventral valve are as follows: The outline of the hinge plate or cardinal area is crescentic or semi-circular, its posterior margin being broadly and convexly rounded and its anterior border correspondingly concave. The hinge itself is very broad, flat, and closely as well as concentrically striated. In some specimens, the breadth of the hinge area in the centre, and as measured from back to front, exceeds half an inch. The deltidium and deltidial slopes are obscurely indicated by a faint depression in the centre of the cardinal area, and by equally faint divaricating, impressed lines.\n\nThe cardinal facet is narrower than the hinge plate: the outer margin of the cardinal facet is concavely and rather deeply emarginated on both sides of the cardinal buttress: the exposed portion of the cardinal buttress extends from the centre of the front margin of the cardinal facet nearly as far as the inner margin of the anterior boundary of the platform, as a narrow and acutely pointed septum, whose altitude as well as breadth diminishes rapidly towards the front: the platform, which is not vaulted, is feebly developed, obscurely defined and scarcely\nraised above the lowest level of the valve posteriorly, and is bounded anteriorly by a moderately prominent, transverse, rounded ridge, which is curved shallowly towards the front margin, in the middle, or bent towards the front at a very obtuse and rounded angle. The muscular impressions are not distinguishable.\n\nLength of the most perfect specimen along the median line, fifty-eight millimetres: maximum breadth, forty-three mm.: greatest thickness through the closed valves, forty-five mm.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: one perfect specimen, with the valves slightly displaced, and four detached ventral valves. Two of these separated valves have the interior completely filled with the matrix, and the others are so much worn or eroded inside that some of the characters of the interior of the ventral valve cannot be satisfactorily ascertained.\n\nIn all the previously described species of Monomerella the ventral valve is more or less flattened, its umbo and beak are erect, and its hinge area is distinctly triangular. The ventral valve of the present species, on the contrary, is remarkably tumid and inflated, its umbo is prominently arched, its beak incurved, and its cardinal area crescentic in outline. When its valves are closed M. ovata looks not at all unlike a Pentamerus of the type of P. oblongus or a large Meristella but the internal character of its ventral or pedicle valve seem to show that it is a true Monomerella.\n\nMonomerella ovata, var. lata.\n\nPlate 2, figs. 2 & 2a, & plate 8, figs. 2 & 2a.\n\nVentral valve (the only one known at present) moderately convex, with or without a mesial depression: outline sub-circular: length and breadth about equal: umbo somewhat prominent, beak slightly incurved: surface concentrically striated: test thick.\n\nHinge area concavely arched in front, obscurely sub-angular in the centre behind: umbo double chambered: umbonal cavities wide and deep: lateral muscular scars of the platform rather large, rhombic ovate, longitudinally striated, and converging anteriorly but without meeting. Other characters as in the type of the species.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: two ventral valves with the test preserved, and a well preserved natural cast of the same valve.\n\nThe best specimens of all the species of Trimerellidae which are described in the present paper have been sent for examination to Thomas Davidson, Esq., F.R.S., to whom the writer is indebted for valuable\nsuggestions in regard to their generic and specific affinities. From their nearly circular form and from other peculiarities, the writer had supposed that the three valves just described might possibly belong to a large form of *Monomerella orbicularis*, Billings, but Mr. Davidson is inclined to think that they should be regarded rather as a variety of *M. ovata*, a conclusion which has therefore been adopted here. Mr. Davidson is also of opinion that the internal markings of the present shell are more like those of *M. prisca*, Billings, than they are like those of *M. orbicularis*.\n\n**RHYNOBOLUS GALTENSIS.** (Billings, Sp.)\n\nPlate 2, fig. 1a, and plate 8, figs. 3 & 3a.\n\n*Obolus Galtensis*, Billings\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20261862, Pal.

S., Vol. XXX., p. 151, Plate 18, fig. 13 & plate 19, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nThis species, which as the above synonymy shews, has been placed in five different genera, has previously been described almost exclusively from casts of the interior of the shell.\n\nThree ventral valves with the whole of the test preserved, and one dorsal valve of a *Rhynobolus* which is probably referable to *R. Galtensis* have recently been collected at Hespeler and Durham. Two of these ventral valves have their interiors completely filled with rock and the third has only the hinge area exposed, on the inner side; but the inside of the dorsal valve is fortunately empty.\n\nThe characters exhibited by these four specimens may be thus expressed: The shell is compressed convex and nearly lenticular in transverse section when the valves are closed: its outline as viewed laterally is ovate, the length is always greater than the breadth, and the maximum breadth is usually (but not invariably) a little in advance of the mid-length. The outer surface of both valves is marked by concentric and somewhat imbricating striae of growth and the test is not very thick.\n\nThe ventral or pedicle valve has an almost erect but somewhat\nobtusely pointed umbo, whose lateral margins are obliquely convex: its beak is small and very slightly incurved, and its hinge area is broad, as measured from its anterior to its posterior margin, and shallowly crescentic.\n\nThe dorsal or brachial valve is about as convex as the ventral, but its cardinal area is comparatively narrow from back to front: the crown of the crescent is regularly arched and parallel with the front margin of the cardinal area, and on each side the crescent terminates in a small subpyriform scar. The platform is scarcely raised above the lowest level of the valve posteriorly, and is bounded at the sides and in front by a V-shaped raised ridge, whose pointed base is directed forwards. The middle muscular scars of the platform are broadly rounded on their inner margins, which latter nearly touch each other in the centre. On their outer margins the middle scars are bounded by the posterior half of the V-shaped ridge which has already been described as forming the lateral and anterior boundary of the platform itself. The anterior muscular scars occupy or are placed upon a small sub-rhomboidal or somewhat lozenge-shaped area on the platform in front of the middle.\n\nAs compared with Messrs. Davidson's & King's figure of the pedicle valve of the \"Trimerella (?) Galtensis\" of their paper,* the umbones and beaks of the ventral valves described above are not so much pointed nor so flatly conical in their lateral outline, and their cardinal areas are crescentic rather than triangular.\n\nThe markings on the interior of the dorsal valve from Durham described above are essentially the same as those on the mould of the brachial valve of the Trimerella Galtensis of Messrs. Davidson's & King's paper, though in the Durham specimen the crown of the crescent seems to be regularly rounded in the middle and not pointed.\n\nThe generic name Rhynobolus (Hall, 1871,) as applied to the present species, is adopted here in accordance with a suggestion to that effect recently made to the writer by Mr. Davidson. In a letter received in November, 1883, Mr. Davidson says:\u2014\"Although with much uncertainty this shell was placed by Prof. King and myself in the genus Trimerella, it is not a true Trimerella and should be removed from that genus. It is more closely allied to Monomerella, and perhaps it would be better to retain Prof. Hall's generic name of Rhynobolus for its reception.\"\n\n* On the Trimerellidae. Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 2, figs. 3, 3a, 3b, & 3c.\n\nShell mytiloid or nearly semi-ovate in lateral outline, transversely elongated, length about twice the maximum height, narrow in front and widening behind, highest a little behind the middle. Valves obliquely sub-carinated or strongly angulated along their centre, the angulation extending in a curved line from the beaks to the posterior end of the base,\u2014very convex and obliquely compressed both above and below the median angle, so that the outline of a transverse section through both when closed would be distinctly rhomboidal. Thickness through the valves, as measured on the median angle, somewhat exceeding their maximum height. Dorsal margin ascending gradually in nearly a straight line from the anterior terminal beaks to the upper portion of the commencement of the posterior end: posterior margin broadly and obliquely rounded or obliquely subtruncated, descending rather abruptly and forming a somewhat angular junction with the basal line below, but rounding evenly to the dorsal margin above. Ventral (or basal) margin nearly straight or slightly concave from the posterior end to a little in advance of the middle, then narrowing rather gradually upwards towards the beaks: umbones narrow, curved, carinated, overhanging the anterior end and extending downwards to the basal margin: beaks hooked, curved inwards and downwards, and margined beneath by a distinct groove.\n\nSurface marked with numerous, closely disposed, fine raised striae of growth, also by a few distant and much coarser concentric sulcations. Test very thick, especially in the umbonal region.\n\nAnterior muscular impression subcircular and deeply excavated: posterior muscular impression more elongated, not excavated, obscurely defined, except above, where it is margined by a narrow and slightly raised ridge. Hinge of the left valve apparently furnished with a longitudinally elongated, raised tooth-like process, which runs nearly parallel to the upper margin of the anterior adductor impression, (which it partly bounds above), and nearly parallel also to the upper and outer edge of the hinge line, from which latter it is separated by a deep groove, which widens gradually behind.\n\nUmbonal cavity (in one specimen at least) strongly concamerated, its cavity being divided off into a number of (at least eight or nine) exceedingly narrow chambers, by thin, successive and concentric laminae of shell.\nLength of the largest specimen known, sixty millimetres; maximum height of the same, thirty mm.\n\nDurham, J. Townsend: five fine specimens with the test preserved. Two casts of a shell which probably belong to this species were collected at Hespeler by T. C. Weston in 1867.\n\n**Megalomus compressus.** (Nicholson & Hinde.)\n\n*Megalomus compressus,* Nicholson & Hinde. Report on the Palaeontology of Ontario, 1875; pp. 68, 69.\n\nThe above species or varietal form was described and figured from mere casts, but Mr. J. Townsend has recently collected fine specimens of it at Durham, with most and in some cases the whole of the shell beautifully preserved. The test of *M. compressus* is rather thick (about five millimetres in thickness on the umbones) especially in the umboinal region, and its outer surface is concentrically striated.\n\n![Diagram](image)\n\nFig. 1. *Megalomus compressus,* Nicholson & Hinde. Outline of left valve of a typical but possibly extreme variety, with most of the test preserved.\n\nThe character most relied upon as a means of distinguishing *M. compressus* from *M. Canadensis* is the lateral compression of the valves of the former. In *M. compressus* the thickness through the closed valves is stated to be \"more than one third of their maximum height,\" whereas in *M. Canadensis* the convexity of the shell is about equal to its great-\nest height. Moreover, in what appears to be a typical, though possibly an extreme form of *M. compressus*, with the test preserved, (an outline of which is represented in wood-cut, fig. 1) the umbo is compressed and comparatively narrow, the beak is curved very slightly downwards, there is no lunule, and the anterior end projects beyond the beaks as a broadly rounded lobe. Fig. 1e, on Plate lxii of the second volume of the Palaeontology of New York, which is described by Prof. Hall as \"a cast of a specimen\" of *M. Canadensis* \"somewhat distorted by pressure which has projected the lower anterior end somewhat beyond the beaks above,\" represents perfectly a normal and undistorted cast of this form of *M. compressus*.\n\nIn the most typical form of the true *M. Canadensis*, when the shell is preserved, the exceedingly broad and tumid umbones are anterior, terminal, and overhang the abrupt downward and backward slope of the lower part of the anterior end. The beaks, too, which in consequence of the enormous breadth of the umbones, are placed two-thirds of the way from the dorsal margin to the base, are recurved and strongly hooked, and under them there is a rather deeply excavated heart-shaped lunule whose width is greater than its height.\n\nFig. 2. Anterior end of left valve of a specimen of a *Megalomus* which is intermediate in character between *M. compressus* and *M. Canadensis*.\n\nBut between these two extremes there occur almost every intermediate gradation, both in the amount of convexity as compared with the height and in the outline of the shell, especially at the anterior end.\nThus, in some much compressed specimens which on that account would be referred to *M. compressus*, the umbones are terminal and overhang the anterior end, and there is a somewhat deeply excavated lunule, as in the typical *M. Canadensis*. The anterior half of a left valve of a *Megalomus* from Durham represented in the wood-cut, fig. 2, on the preceding page, belongs to a specimen which is almost exactly intermediate in its characters between *M. compressus* and *M. Canadensis*.\n\nConnecting links between the two forms are so frequently found as to suggest the conclusion that *M. compressus* is only a variety of *M. Canadensis*, a view which is identical with that expressed in 1852 by Prof. Hall, who after examining a large number of examples of *Megalomus*, states that he is \"unable to find any characters indicating more than a single species.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. R. Bell, the first discoverer of this curious genus was his father, the Rev. Andrew Bell, then of Dundas, who sent specimens of the typical species to Prof. Hall in 1847 or 1848.\n\n**Anodontopsis concinna.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 2, fig. 4, and plate 7, figs. 4 & 4a.\n\nSmall compressed\u2014convex, about one-third longer than high, very inequilateral, outline subtrapezoidal: anterior end short, rounded and rather narrow, posterior end larger and wider, its upper and lower margins being nearly parallel, and its extremity somewhat obliquely truncated: dorsal margin straight and almost parallel behind, sloping rapidly and obliquely downwards in front: ventral margin nearly straight but slightly convex in the middle, rounding upwards very abruptly at the anterior end, and ascending to a much less height and in a very gentle curve to its subangular junction with the basal margin of the posterior extremity. Umbones broad and angulated behind, beaks small, not prominent, directed forwards and situated about half way between the centre of the shell and the outer boundary of the anterior end. Posterior area not distinctly defined, consisting of a very oblique, concave inflection of the valves bounded by a faint angulation which extends from the beaks towards the posterior end of the base, but which becomes nearly obsolete in the lower half of the shell.\n\nSurface markings and hinge dentition unknown.\n\nLength of the largest specimen collected, twenty-five millimetres: maximum height of the same, seventeen mm.\n\nGalt, T. C. Weston, 1867: a cast of a right valve. Durham, Mr. J. Townsend: a perfect cast of both valves, which, however, are both\nopen and slightly displaced in the specimen, so that it is impossible to measure the exact convexity through the closed valves.\n\nThis specimen is very similar in shape to the *Anodontopsis angustifrons* of McCoy,* from the Upper Ludlow rocks of Westmoreland, but its anterior margin is not so narrowly rounded and its dorsal margin is not arched posteriorly.\n\n**Genus ILIONIA, Billings.\u2020 1875.**\n\nCanadian Naturalist, 2nd Series, Vol. viii., p. 301.\n\n\"The above generic name is proposed for such forms as *Tellina prisca* (Hisinger), *Anatina sinuata* (Hall), and the species herein described. All the specimens I have seen are internal casts, and the characters of the hinge line, therefore, cannot be given. The form is irregularly ovate, compressed or sub-lenticular; one extremity larger than the other; beaks turned towards the larger end, which is, therefore, supposed to be anterior. In all the species a concave depression commences on the umbones and extends downwards to the posterior ventral margin. A large sub-ovate muscular impression in the upper half of the posterior extremity.\" Billings.\n\n**ILIONIA CANADENSIS, Billings.**\n\n*Ilionia Canadensis*, Billings. 1875. Can. Nat., N.

Canadensis*.\"\nShell \"transversely irregularly ovate; compressed, sub-lenticular; length about twice the greatest height; umbones situated a little behind the mid-length; ventral margin with a concave notch at about the posterior fourth of the whole length. In front of this notch the margin is uniformly convex, gradually sloping upwards nearly (if not quite) to the hinge line. The dorsal margin is not perfect in the specimen figured, but judging from the direction of the striae on the surface of the cast, it is nearly straight, or at the most only slightly convex in front of the beaks, and nearly parallel with the length of the shell, sloping slightly downwards. Behind the beaks it is gently convex, nearly straight, and slopes downwards to the narrowly rounded angle, the latter situated at about one-third the height of the shell. The margin of the beaks is compressed. Close under the beaks, in front, there appears to have been a short escutcheon.* \"From the umbones backwards for about six lines, a linear groove runs along close to the dorsal edge on each side. This may be related to the ligament.\n\nThe most projecting point of the anterior extremity appears to be situated considerably above the mid-height of the shell, near the hinge line. The posterior angle is below the mid-height.\n\nSurface concentrically striated.\n\nLength, three inches; greatest height a little in front of the mid-length, eighteen lines; greatest depth of both valves, just below the umbones, eight lines.\n\nThe specimen was collected by Sir W. E. Logan in the Upper Silurian rocks at Port Daniel on the Bay of Chaleurs.\" E. Billings.\n\nFive badly preserved casts collected by Mr. T. C. Weston in 1867 from the Guelph limestones at Hespeler, have been identified with this species by Mr. E. Billings. A single specimen from Elora which is also referable to *I. Canadensis*, has been forwarded to the writer by Mr. David Boyle.\n\n* The word \"escutcheon\" appears to be here used inadvertently instead of lunule. J. F. W.\nILIONIA GALTENSIS. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 3, figs. 1. 1a & 1b.\n\nShell compressed, sinuated, most convex in the direction of a line which might be drawn from the beaks to the centre of the ventral margin, behind which faint prominence there is a broad, shallow depression, bounded posteriorly by an oblique and somewhat curved keel or narrow ridge, which extends from the beaks to the posterior end of the ventral margin, and marks out a laterally compressed posterior area. Length about one third (or less than one third) greater than the height; anterior end broader than the posterior, rounded and somewhat expanded at its upper and lower margins: posterior end narrowing above and below, and truncated almost vertically but somewhat concavely at its extremity. Dorsal margin nearly straight or slightly convex, and sloping very gently downwards behind the beaks, concave and somewhat ascending in front of them: ventral margin convex anteriorly, narrowing rather rapidly and concavely upwards posteriorly.\n\nUmbones rather broad, subcentral and carinated behind: beaks small, appressed, not very prominent. Surface concentrically striated.\n\nLength of a specimen from Galt, thirty-one millimetres: height of same, twenty-one mm.: thickness, eight mm. In another example, from Durham, the proportions are not quite the same, the length being twenty-eight mm., the height twenty-one mm. and the thickness eight.\n\nGalt, Dr. R. Bell, 1861: Durham, Mr. Joseph Townsend. A single, nearly perfect but not very well preserved cast, with the mould in the rock from which it was taken,\u2014from each of these localities.\n\nThe Anatina sinuata of Hall, which Mr. E. Billings regarded as the American type of his genus Ilionia, was described from two imperfect specimens in very poor condition. Judging by the figure of the best of these, the broad, non-sinuated and presumably anterior end of I. sinuata is much longer than the abruptly contracted and narrow posterior end, and the beaks, which Prof. Hall says are \"vertical or not perceptibly inclined to either side of the shell,\" are consequently placed at some distance behind the middle. In I. Galtensis, however, the anterior and posterior ends are about equal in length, and the beaks are subcentral and curve forwards.\n\nILIONIA (?) COSTULATA. (N.

Casts of it are of frequent occurrence at Durham, but not more than about a dozen specimens with the test preserved have been seen by the writer, and only one of these is full grown. In this specimen, which must be regarded as the type of the genus, the exact shape of the aperture cannot be ascertained, as the ventral surface of the shell is partly buried in the matrix. Although associated with purely marine organisms and therefore probably itself marine, the dorsal aspect of an adult example of Codonocheilus, with its subfusiform or pupoid spire, its obliquely spreading body-whorl and its expanded lip, is exceedingly similar in a general way to that of several genera of recent operculated land shells, such as Megalomastoma, Cataulus, and Tomocyclus. It is probable that the Cerithium Helmerseni of DeVerneuil, \u2020 from the Upper Silurian rocks, of Russia will prove to belong to this genus, but the body-whorl of that species is not preserved in the specimen figured.\n\nCodonocheilus striatum.

Two large specimens of a *Holopea* with the test preserved, which are almost certainly referable to *H. Gracia*, have recently been collected at Durham by Mr. J. Townsend. These, if correctly identified, shew, (1) that the species attained much larger dimensions than the type now figured; (2) that when the shell is preserved the umbilicus is completely closed; (3) that the surface markings consist of crowded and oblique raised stri\u00e6, which curve somewhat convexly backwards above the middle of the body-whorl, and concavely as well as more abruptly backwards at the base. In one of the Durham specimens, too, the apex of the spire is remarkably obtuse.\n\n**Cyclonema sulcatum,** Hall.\n\nPlate 3, fig. 5.\n\n*Cyclomena sulcata,* Hall. Pal. N. York, Vol. 2, p. 347, pl. 84, figs. 1, 1a\u2013d.\n\nThis species was originally characterized by Prof. Hall from exfoliated casts, but the fine specimen collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham, and represented on Plate 3, has most of the test preserved on the last volution. The lower half of the body-whorl is marked by nine revolving raised ridges which are rather narrower than the spaces between them. These ridges are most prominent around the narrow\nbut deep umbilical depression, and become gradually more faintly marked until the two upper ones are nearly obsolete. Above, and next to the suture, there is a faint revolving and rather wide groove, which is succeeded by a broad smooth band. The whole surface of the body-whorl is also crossed by numerous oblique striae of growth.\n\nAlthough the words \"umbilicus none\" occur in the original definition of the genus Cyclonema,* yet as the C. sulcata is distinctly described by Prof. Hall as having a small umbilicus, it is clear that this generic character will have to be modified so as to include species with a small umbilical perforation which does not expose any part of the inner whorls,\u2014or else that the present species should be removed to some other genus, for which procedure there does not seem to be any sufficiently adequate reason. In the writer's judgment also, the Trochonema pauper of Hall and the Cyclonema sulcata of the same author ought not to be placed in different genera.\n\nTrochonema inornatum. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 3, fig. 7.\n\nShell angularly turbinated, depressed, much broader than high; whorls from three to four, increasing very rapidly in size; spire step-shaped, moderately elevated, occupying rather less than one-half the entire height, its volutions flattened above and obliquely compressed at the sides; body-whorl flattened both above and below nearly at a right angle to the axis of the shell, and compressed laterally and somewhat concavely in the middle,\u2014biangulated, its upper portion being distinctly shouldered, and its basal margin rather less distinctly so; umbilicus very small, or perhaps entirely closed when the whole of the test is preserved; aperture evenly rounded on the inner or columellar side and rather obscurely biangular externally. Test moderately thick; surface nearly smooth but marked by fine transverse lines of growth, which are distinctly insinuated on the superior angle of the body-whorl.\n\nBreadth of the most perfect example collected, twenty-four millimetres; entire height of the same, twenty mm.; height of the spire only, nine mm.\n\nElora: R.

Two specimens, which appear to belong to the same species, were collected by Mr. R. Bell in the Upper Silurian Rocks of the Baie des Chaleurs, in 1862, one at L'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe, and the other at L'Anse \u00e0 la Vieille.\n\nThe types of *Euomphalus macrolineatus* from Wisconsin are described as being \"subdiscoidal, with a depressed convex spire,\" and the under side of its shell is said to be unknown. Not being able to decide positively, from description and figures alone, whether the Canadian specimens were specifically identical with that species or not, the nearly perfect example figured on plate 3 was sent to Prof. Whitfield for examination, who kindly reports on it as follows: \"I can see no real difference between this and *E. macrolineatus*. The ribs are a little more distant, but not enough to be specific. My specimens were both impressions of the exterior, and much flattened, so that I considered it a *Euomphalus*. Your specimens differ from true *Cyclonema* in the aperture and umbilicus.\" To the writer, these latter appear to be exactly congeneric with the *Cyclonema sulcatum* of Hall, which, however, may not be a true *Cyclonema*.\n\nThe characters of well-preserved and undistorted Canadian specimens which are here identified with *E. macrolineatus* on Prof. Whitfield's authority, may be thus defined. Shell turbinate, a little broader than high, composed of about three volutions, which increase very rapidly in size: last whorl but one somewhat depressed above and laterally depressed below the broadly rounded shoulder, in such a manner as to give the shell a rather step-shaped outline: body-whorl occupying two thirds or more than one half the total height,\u2014depressed above, inflated and ventricose below: umbilicus deep but narrow, its width being less than one fourth of the diameter of the base: aperture nearly circular, lip thin and simple. Surface marked by numerous, narrow, elevated revolving ridges, which are crossed by crowded and oblique striae of growth. On the upper and outer part of the body-whorl, the three revolving ridges nearest to the suture are comparatively wide apart, and are separated by shallowly concave grooves about four times as\nwide as the ridges themselves: below this the revolving ridges are much more numerous and closely disposed, their breadth in the lower half of the body-whorl being fully equal to the width of the grooves between them.\n\nApproximate height of the most perfect specimen, thirty-seven millimetres: maximum breadth of the same, forty-four mm.: height of the body-whorl of do., twenty-four mm.\n\nThe amount of elevation of the spire of Canadian examples of this species, as compared with the maximum breadth, varies considerably in different individuals.\n\n**Euomphalus galtensis.**\n\nPlate 3, figs. 9 and 9a.\n\nShell depressed and nearly discoidal, spire sunk slightly below the highest level of the body-whorl, breadth rather more than twice the height: volutions three, increasing very gradually in size, those of the spire shouldered and nearly rectangular: body-whorl biangulated, but with the basal angle somewhat rounded off,\u2014depressed above, especially near the suture, compressed convex below and flattened laterally in the middle: umbilicus about one-third the diameter of the base, deep, step-sided and exposing part of the inner volutions: outer lip more or less acutely insinuated or notched on the superior angle, above and below which its margin is convexly curved, the insinuation being caused by the junction or partial intersection of these two convex curves. Surface markings unknown, with the exception of a few distant lines of growth on the body-whorl, which run parallel with the outer lip.\n\nDimensions of the specimen figured:\u2014breadth, thirty-eight millimetres; height, seventeen mm.; width of umbilicus, about twelve mm.\n\nGalt, E.

Sp.)**\n\nPlate 3, fig. 8, 8a and 8b.\n\nShell turbinate, compressed vertically, height one third less than the maximum breadth, whorls three to four: spire short, about one-third the entire height, somewhat conical, its volutions being obliquely rounded: suture excavated: body-whorl compressed vertically both\nabove and below, ventricose and inflated in the middle; umbilicus about one third the diameter of the base, very deep and exposing all the inner whorls up to the apex; mouth nearly circular but narrower above and very slightly emarginated or indented by the penultimate whorl: outer lip apparently thin and simple, convex above and obliquely convex below. Surface marked by a few narrow and not very prominent spiral ridges, which are crossed obliquely by numerous flexuous crenulated raised ridges or lamell\u00e6. On the outer half of the body-whorl there are about seven or eight of these spiral ridges, four above, and either three or four below the middle. The upper ones, one of which is placed very close to the periphery, are distant and rather clearly defined, but the lower ones are close together and extremely indistinct. These latter, too, are exclusively confined to the outer portion of the base, and disappear altogether before reaching the umbilical margin.* The crenulated raised lines, however, which cross the whorls obliquely, are as strongly marked in and around the umbilicus as they are on the central and upper portions of the body-whorl, and they are much more numerous as well as more closely disposed than the spiral ridges.\n\nMaximum breadth of the largest specimen collected, forty-five millimetres: height of the same, about thirty mm.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: two specimens.\n\nThis shell would probably not be regarded as a true Straparollus by those who follow the nomenclature adopted by D'Orbigny, McCoy, DeKoninck and Stoliczka, but it accords fairly well with the characters of that genus as re-defined by Professors H. A. Nicholson \u2020 and James Hall.\u2021 It seems to be closely allied to and is probably congeneric with the so-called Euomphalus funatus and E. rugosus of Sowerby, from the Wenlock limestone.\n\nPleurotomaria perlata, Hall.\n\nPleurotomaria perlata, Hall. 1852.

Two or three fine specimens with the test preserved have recently been collected at Durham by Mr. J. Townsend, the best of which is represented on plate 4, fig. 1a. These give a good idea of the characters and surface markings of the upper portion of the shell. On the spire the test appears to be nearly or quite smooth, but on the upper half of the last volition the sculpture consists of crowded and rather flexuous transverse striations. The species may be readily known by its depressed-turbinate form, its sub-angular whorls, its prominently and distinctly keeled periphery and its wide open umbilicus.\n\nPleurotomaria cyclostoma. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 3, figs. 12 and 12a.\n\nShell conical, a little broader than high: whorls about five: spire moderately elevated, occupying about one half the entire height, its whorls flattened obliquely: last whorl but one bearing in its centre a narrow spiral band which is bordered on both sides by a thread-like and minute raised ridge: band quite obsolete in the first and second volutions, and nearly so in the third: suture indistinct. Body-whorl with the periphery angulated and carinated, the keel being narrow, acute, simple and prominent: band placed half way between the keel and the suture: base nearly flat, imperforate: aperture circular.\n\nBody-whorl (and perhaps the lower portion of the spire) marked by crowded transverse striae or lines of growth: on the upper part of the body-whorl these striae appear to be insinuated convexly backwards towards and to the band, while on the lower face of the same whorl they radiate concavely backwards: the outer margin of the basal portion of the body-whorl also is marked by two or three faint spiral\ngrooves, one of which forms the anterior boundary of the keel which encircles the periphery.\n\nMaximum height of the most perfect specimen collected, twenty-one millimetres; breadth of the same, twenty-five mm.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: two specimens, both with the test preserved.\n\nOne of the most curious features of this species is the extreme thickening of the shell on the periphery of the last volution, from which it results that although the outer lip is sharply carinated exteriorly, yet the mouth or aperture is almost exactly circular in outline. This peculiar character is seen also in the *Pterocheilos primus* of Moore, from the English Lias, but in that genus the columella is much produced anteriorly, which is by no means the case with the present species.\n\n*P. cyclostoma* appears to differ from *P. bispialis* of Hall, from the Guelph formation, principally in its more obliquely flattened and less ventricose spire, its indistinct suture and its much narrower spiral band.\n\n**Pleurotomaria Durhamensis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 4, fig. 2.\n\nShell turbinate-conical, a little higher than broad; spire moderately elevated, about equal to the body-whorl in height, its upper portion distinctly acuminated; whorls eight or nine, the first five or six increasing very slowly in size and obliquely compressed but not angulated, the next two, which immediately precede the body-whorl, increasing much more rapidly both in height and breadth and rather strongly angulated below the middle: body-whorl angulated a little above the middle and obliquely flattened above the angle; base convex and evenly rounded; umbilicus about one third the diameter of the base and apparently deep. Surface markings unknown.\n\nHeight, twenty-six millimetres; breadth, twenty mm.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend: a single but very perfect cast.\n\nThe general outline of this shell is not at all unlike that of the *Straparollina pelagica* of Billings, from the Quebec Group of Newfoundland, but in the latter species the whorls are said to be only five or six in number and the lower ones are not distinctly angulated.\n\n**Murchisonia Hespelerensis. (N.

C. Weston, 1867: township of Glenelg, J. Townsend, 1883.\n\nA longer and narrower shell than the preceding species, with fewer and more centrally angulated whorls and a narrower umbilicus. It appears to be more nearly allied to the *M. Mylitta* of Billings, from the same formation, of which it may prove to be an extreme variety. The differences between the two are as follows:\u2014In *M. Mylitta* the whorls are four or five, the last whorl, which is the only one that is angulated, is two thirds of the entire length: in *M. Hespelerensis* there are six whorls (or between five and six) the fourth, fifth and sixth of which are distinctly angulated, and the body-whorl is about one half of the entire length.\n\n*Murchisonia constricta.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 4, fig. 4.\n\nShell turreted, spire long and slender, whorls numerous, probably about twelve, increasing slowly in size, the earlier ones flattened or faintly concave, the later ones bearing an obtuse spiral band or faint angulation at a distance of three-fourths their height from the suture above, and concavely constricted above the angulation: suture linear, moderately impressed: last volution short, less than one third the entire length, obtusely angulated a little above the middle, rather strongly concave above the angulation, rounded and ventricose below: base imperforate, but with a distinct groove on the inner and lower side of the thickened basal portion of the columella: aperture subovate, higher than wide and somewhat angular exteriorly: outer lip thin and simple: test rather thin: surface markings unknown.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend. A single specimen, with eight whorls and most of the test preserved, but with its outer surface too much worn to show any of the sculpture.\n\nThis species appears to be most readily distinguishable from *M.

Boylei* the spiral band is described as being situated a \"little above the suture, causing the lower part of each whorl to project over the upper portion of the whorl next below,\"* while in *M. constricta* the spiral band, although situated below the middle, in the later whorls of the spire, is removed from the suture below by a distance equal to at least one-fourth the entire height of the whorl.\n\n**Murchisonia turritiformis**, Hall.\n\nPlate 4, fig. 5.\n\n*Murchisonia turritiformis*, Hall. Pal\u00e6ont. N.Y., Vol. II., p. 347, pl. 61, figs. 6a & 6b\n\nThe original description of this species is as follows: \"Spire elongated, turritiform, composed of numerous flattened volutions: surface unknown; columella small. This species is readily distinguished by its flattened volutions, which, in the cast, present the marks of a carina near or a little below the centre. One specimen preserves five volutions, being imperfect at both extremities: the shell originally had probably not less than fifteen volutions.\" \"Position and locality. In the limestone at Galt, Canada West.\"\n\nThe two imperfect casts upon which this species was based were obviously insufficient to enable its characters to be accurately defined. Much more perfect specimens of a *Murchisonia*, which certainly correspond better to the description and figures of *M. turritiformis* than to those of any other species of the same genus from the Guelph Formation, have since been collected at Galt, Elora, Hespeler and Durham, by Messrs. A. Murray, R. Bell, T. C. Weston, D. Boyle, and J. Townsend. One of these specimens, in the Museum of the Survey, is labelled *M. turritiformis* in the handwriting of Mr. E. Billings, while another and more perfect one is represented by figure 5 of plate 4. In all of these shells the whorls of the spire are encircled near but a little below their middle by a narrow and not very prominent, spiral band or obtuse angulation, which is scarcely strongly marked enough to leave its impress upon the cast. Above the band the whorls are slightly concave, and beneath it as slightly convex. On the outer half of the body-whorl the band is placed a little above the middle, and the base is rather strongly convex. The test seems to have been thin, and near the mouth its surface markings consist of fine and rather crowded\n\n---\n\n* Report upon the Pal\u00e6ontology of the Province of Ontario, 1875, p. 71.\nstriations, which are insinuated convexly backwards both above and below towards and to the band. The shell increases very slowly in breadth; thus, in a specimen three inches and a quarter in length, which has between seven and eight of the whorls preserved, the greatest diameter at the smaller end is eleven millimetres, while that of the larger end, close to the aperture, is only twenty-five.\n\nProf. Whitfield, who has examined the specimens from which figure 5 on plate 4 was drawn, and compared it with Prof. Hall's types, thus expresses his opinion on the former. \"This shell is intermediate between *M. turritiformis* and *M. longispira*, Hall. The apical angle is more acute than that of *M. turritiformis*, while the angle of the volution is here central and on that one is at the base of the volution. Compared with *M. longispira* the rate of increase in the diameter is about the same, also the angle on the whorl, but the length of the volutions in your shell is a little greater than in that species. One or two other specimens would probably unite Hall's two species as one.\"\n\n**Murchisonia conradi**, Hall.\n\nPlate 4, fig. 6.\n\n*Murchisonia Conradi*, Hall. 18th Regents' Report, p. 344, pl. 15 (6.) fig. 19.\n\nThree nearly perfect and well preserved specimens of a *Murchisonia* which should probably be regarded as a mere local variety of the above named species, have been collected at Elora by T. C. Weston and D. Boyle, one of which is represented on plate 4. They differ chiefly from the Wisconsin type of *M. Conradi*, as figured by Prof. Hall, in not being nearly as slender in their proportions, and in the blunter and less prominent carination of their whorls.\n\n**Murchisonia macrospira**, Hall.\n\nPlate 4, figs. 7 and 7a.\n\n*Murchisonia macrospira*, Hall. Palaeont. N. Y., Vol. II., p. 346, pl. 83, fig. 5.\n\nThis species was described from a mould of the interior of the shell obtained at Galt, Ont., a gutta-percha cast of which has been forwarded to the writer by Prof. Whitfield. As stated by Prof. Hall, the type specimen shews \"the impression of four and a part of the fifth volution.\" A similar but in some respects more perfect mould from the same locality, which shews the impress of eight volutions, was collected by Mr. A. Murray in 1857, a gutta-percha cast of which is represented by figure 7 of plate 4. The original of figure 7a on the same plate is a\nsmall specimen of *M. macrospira* collected by Mr. D. Boyle at Elora in 1880, and presented by him to the Museum of the Survey. It consists of three or three and a half whorls and has most of the test beautifully preserved. When perfect the type of the species figured by Prof. Hall must have had one volition more than the larger of the two specimens represented on plate 4.\n\nFrom the two additional specimens figured, taken in connection with the type, it would appear that the shell must have consisted of about nine ventricose whorls, which increase rather rapidly in breadth in proportion to the total length, which latter may be roughly estimated at rather more than twice the greatest breadth of the body-whorl. The band or spiral carina, though distinct and well marked, is broad, rounded and not very prominent. On the earlier whorls of large individuals the band is obsolete: on the lower whorls of the spire it is subcentral, while on the outer half of the body whorl it is placed above the middle. The later whorls of the spire are more swollen and inflated below the band than they are above it. The surface markings consist of fine transverse striations, which are insinuated convexly backwards towards and to the band.\n\n*Murchisonia soluta.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 4, figs. 8 and 8a.\n\nShell elongated, slender, consisting of a spirally twisted calcareous tube which is nearly circular in transverse section, and which increases very slowly in diameter; whorls moderately numerous, free, disconnected and widely separated from the commencement, but very closely and compactly coiled laterally; last volition and last but one bearing a rounded and rather broad but not very prominent band or keel a little above the middle; aperture expanded on the columellar side; surface markings unknown.\n\nGalt, Rev. Andrew Bell, 1846-50. Hespeler, T. C. Weston, 1867: one fragment. Elora, D. Boyle, 1880, and J. Townsend, three specimens. Durham, J. Townsend: four specimens.\n\nAll the specimens of this peculiar shell that have come under the writer's notice are casts which are imperfect either at one extremity or at the other. In the largest and finest example in the Survey collection, which is figured on plate 4 (figure 8), and which has the body whorl and the two preceding volutions preserved, the diameter of the cast of the shelly tube immediately behind the expansion of the aperture is seventeen millimetres, and that of its broken termination above, between\nfive and six. The last two whorls of this specimen are separated by a space equal to more than double the diameter of the thickest unexpanded part of the cast of the tube of which the body-whorl is composed. In another specimen, the original of figure 3a, on plate 4, in which four of the earliest whorls are preserved, the diameter of the cast is five millimetres at the largest and a little more than one millimetre at the smallest end, and the volutions are separated by spaces somewhat wider than the maximum diameter of the cast of the tube. It would appear, therefore, that the entire number of volutions is about seven or eight, and that the later whorls are rather more widely separated proportionately than the earlier ones.\n\nAlthough it has been thought best to give a provisional name to the specimens above described, as a matter of convenience, it is not at all unlikely that they may prove to be monstrosities or abnormally developed individuals of some regularly formed species of *Murchisonia*, to which they may bear the same morphological relationship as the well-known but exceedingly rare scalariform varieties of the living *Helix aspersa* of Muller, figured by Moquin Tandon and Chenu, do to the ordinary form of that species. Of all the species of *Murchisonia* from the Guelph formation known to the writer, these singularly constructed shells seem to come nearest to *M. macrospira*, partly in the number and contour of their volutions, but more especially in the breadth and slight elevation of their rounded spiral band or carina. The fragment represented by figure 9 on plate 4 is a portion of a cast of a shell from Durham, which appears to be intermediate in its characters between *M. soluta* and some normally developed species of *Murchisonia*, perhaps *M. macrospira*. The whorls of this fragment, although free and disconnected, are still somewhat approximated, and its spiral keel is precisely like that of *M. soluta*.\n\nThe *Enomphalus circinalis* of Goldfuss is a good example of an almost completely uncoiled species of that genus, but its apical whorl is represented as being regularly spiral.\n\n*MURCHISONIA TROPIDOPHORA.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 7, figs. 5 and 5a.\n\nThe above name is proposed for a remarkable shell, of which only one imperfect specimen is known to the writer, and for which a new genus may have to be constituted. This specimen has about one-third of the apical or posterior end broken off, and the remaining portion consists of a shelly tube which increases rapidly in diameter, especially near and at the aperture, and which is obliquely, spirally and tightly\ntwisted on itself rather than regularly coiled. The upper half of the volition bears two prominent, acute and distant, spiral keels, which are separated from each other by a broad concave groove. Above the upper keel, which forms a distinct shoulder to the volition, the surface is obliquely flattened or slightly concave, and below the second keel the surface is somewhat convex. At the base of the earlier half of the last volition there is a third keel, but on the later half of the same volition this basal keel is continued as the outer margin or boundary of the mouth on the columellar side, and ultimately becomes confluent with the basal portion of the outer lip. The aperture appears to have been nearly circular, and it is certainly broadly and effusely expanded at its base. In addition to the keels the exterior of the test, which seems to have been rather thick, is marked by very faint, fine and flexuous, transverse stri\u00e6 of growth.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend, 1883: a single specimen, with most of the test preserved but with the apical portion and part of the outer lip broken off,\n\nIt is at present doubtful whether this shell is a *Murchisonia*, allied to but perfectly distinct from the *M. helicteres* of Salter,\u2014a second species of *Codonocheilus*, or, as already suggested, a new generic type. From *M. helicteres* it differs not only in the number and arrangement of its spiral keels, but also in the fact that although much drawn out in the direction of its length, the spiral tube of which it is composed is so tightly twisted on itself that its volutions are in contact throughout on their inner faces and not entirely free and disconnected.\n\nThe aperture of *M. tropidophora*, so far as known, seems very similar to that of *Codonocheilus*, but in the only species of that genus yet described all the volutions but the last are regularly spiral.\n\nThe circumstance that the basal keel at the commencement of the body-whorl in this species is continuous with the raised margin of the mouth on the columellar side and that it finally becomes confluent with the outer lip at the base of the shell, seems to the writer to be a unique feature among gasteropoda and one which strongly favours the idea that the present species may prove to be the type of a new genus.\n\n**Genus Tryblidium**, Lindstr\u00f6m. 1880.\n\n*Fragmenta Silurica* (Stockholm), page 15.\n\n\"Testa e stratis fibrilloso-prismaticis, osculis minutissimis perforatis contexta, modice elevata, apice prope marginem anteriorem posito et plerumque detrito, ita ut strata testae interna deteguntur. Impressiones musculares numeros\u00e6, per sex paria in orbiculo elongate ordinate,\nAs already partially suggested by Mr. Dall,* it seems clear that of the nineteen species provisionally referred by E. Billings to Phillips' genus *Metoptoma*, in the first volume of the \"Palaeozoic Fossils\" of Canada, not one of them really belong to that genus as now understood. As the name implies, in *Metoptoma* proper the widest end of the basal margin, which was supposed by Prof. Phillips to be the anterior end, is distinctly concave or notched, a character which is not possessed by any of the so-called species of *Metoptoma* from the Cambro-Silurian or Silurian rocks. In the writer's judgment *Metoptoma Quebecensis*, Billings, belongs to the genus *Palaeacmaea* of Hall and Whitfield: *M. Niobe*, *M. Nycteis*, *M. Eubule*, *M. Erato*, and *M. Hyrie*, Billings, are typical species of *Tryblidium*, Lindstr\u00f6m: *M. Trentonensis*, *M. Estella*, *M. instabitis* and *M. simplex*, Billings, appear to differ only from the generic characters of *Tryblidium* in that the outline of their basal margins is sub-circular rather than ovate: while the rest of the species described by Billings in the volume cited are probably types of two or three new and at present uncharacterized genera.\n\nThe Guelph Formation has yielded a single specimen of an interesting new species of *Tryblidium*, which may be thus described.\n\n**TRYBLIDIUM CANADENSE. (N.

Townsend: eight tolerably perfect but not very well preserved casts of the interior of the shell.\n\nThe genus *Scenella* of Billings has never been properly defined, and consequently ought either to be re-constituted or abandoned. The \"obscure carina extending from the apex down one side to the margin,\" given as part of the diagnosis of *S. reticulata*, is not even a constant specific character, for there is no such keel on an exceptionally large specimen of that species from the typical locality in the Museum of the Survey. The surface ornamentation, too, upon which the genus was mainly based, is clearly of not more than specific importance.\n\nThe specimens from Durham described above are here placed provisionally in the genus *Scenella* on account of their very close resemblance in external form to *S. reticulata*, but the muscular impressions, which would probably afford the surest indications of the true affinities of both, are entirely unknown. They may, however, be referable to Whitfield's genus *Lepetopsis*.\n\nIn the second volume of the \"Palaeozoic Fossils\" of Canada, on page 77, *Stenotheca pauper* and *Scenella reticulata* are described under the head of Huronian fossils, whereas both of these species are from the Menevian limestones of Conception Bay, Newfoundland, which directly overlie the black shales or slates of the \"Acadian\" Group or Lower Cambrian of that Island.\nOPERCULA OF GASTEROPODA.\n\nPlate 3, figs. 10, 10a, 10b, and 11, and pl. 7, fig. 7.\n\nSeveral specimens of the operculum or opercula of one or more species of holostomatous gasteropoda have been collected at Hespeler by Mr. T. C. Weston and at Durham by Mr. J. Townsend, the largest of which measures fully three quarters of an inch in its greatest diameter. These opercula are all calcareous, thick, circular in outline and multispiral. Though often perfect and well preserved, the sculpture of their outer surface is usually obscured and nearly covered by small portions of the tenacious matrix. So far they have never been found in place, so that it is quite uncertain to which species they belong or to how many.\n\nIn certain specimens (such as the one represented by figures 10, 10a and 10b of plate 3, which for convenience may be called No. 1) the outer side is conical and moderately elevated,\u2014the height of the cone being usually rather less than one-half the diameter of its base,\u2014the apex is subcentral, the whorls are sinistral and bounded externally with a thin, laminar, raised ridge, the spaces between the coils of which are obliquely striated across. On their inner sides (which, however, are possibly imperfect) they are gently concave, the central portion paucispiral and the outer obscurely annular.\n\nIn other individuals (such as the original of figure 11 on plate 3, which may be distinguished temporarily as operculum No. 2,) the outer side is much more compressed than that of No. 1, and might better be described as depressed convex rather than conical. The inner surface of No. 2 is nearly flat and marked with concentric annular striations, but there is a small pit in the centre, and a rather narrow, elevated and annular rim around its outer margin.\n\nIt is most probable that these opercula belong to shells of the genus Euomphalus or Straparollus, in the sense at least in which these words are used in this article, perhaps to E. Galtensis or S. crenulatus. Stoliczka says* that the opercula of Euomphalus (which he regards as a synonym of Straparollus) \"very much resemble those of Torinia, being thick and composed of numerous lamellar volutions,\" a description which would apply perfectly to those from Durham. On the other hand, the opercula of Euomphalus tunatus, as figured by Bailey\u2020 are also very like the Durham specimens, and this similarity would rather favour the view that the latter may be the opercula of Straparollus crenulatus.\n\n* Paleontologia Indica.

Not uncommon.\n\nAs Professor Hall has pointed out,* the specimen figured in the \"Geology of Canada\" as *Bellerophon angustatus* is no doubt referable to *T. Alpheus*, as are also a dozen other good specimens in the Survey Museum. But in justice to the memory of Mr. E. Billings, who was officially responsible for the pal\u00e6ontological part of the volume cited, it should not be forgotten that the \"Geology of Canada\" was published a year before the first description of *T. Alpheus* appeared in print. Moreover, it is by no means clear that *T. Alpheus* is sufficiently distinct from *Bucania angustata*. On the contrary it is highly probable that these two names have been given to the same species in different states of preservation. Prof. Hall states that *T. Alpheus* \"bears some resemblance to *Bucania angustata*,\" * * \"but differs in the more rotund volutions, and in the interrupted oblong nodes representing the perforations on the periphery, while that species is free from nodes or\n\n* Eighteenth Reg. Rep., p. 347.\ncarina.\u201d* The brief and rather vague description of *Bucania angustata*, by the same author, is as follows: \u201cVolutions narrow, rounded on their sides, expanding near the aperture. The specimen figured is a rough cast in limestone, preserving no remains of surface markings. The volutions are less extended laterally than any other species of equal size known in our strata.\u201d\u2020\n\nMost of the specimens of *T. Alpheus* in the Museum of the Survey are, however, very strongly compressed at the periphery, and these agree perfectly in shape with Hall\u2019s figures and description of *Bucania angustata*. The \u201cinterrupted oblong nodes\u201d on the periphery, which seem to be always present in casts of the adult shell of *T. Alpheus*, are said to be absent in *B. angustata*; but this statement may very well have been due to the accidental circumstance that the type and only specimen known of the latter species happens to be too imperfectly preserved to show them.\n\nOn page 304 of the second edition of the \u201cAmerican Palaeozoic Fossils,\u201d Mr. S. A. Miller says that *T. Alpheus* is a synonym for *Bucania Chicagoensis*.\n\n**EOCULIOMPHALUS CIRGINATUS. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 5, figs. 4, 4a, 4b, and 4c, and pl. 8, fig. 5.\n\nShell sinistral, composed of about one and a half free and disconnected spiral volutions, which are coiled nearly on the same plane and which increase rather rapidly in their dorso-ventral but more slowly in their lateral diameter; upper side somewhat flattened vertically or gently convex; periphery subangulated or narrowly rounded; under side rather strongly convex, subcarinated or more or less faintly subangulated in the middle, especially near the mouth; aperture ovately-triangular, inequilateral, unsymmetrical and higher than wide. Surface of the test densely striated across; upper side of the outer half of the last volution of the cast marked by two distant and nearly parallel spiral grooves, one of which is placed near the inner edge and the other about the middle. Posterior extremity, in one specimen at least, distinctly septate or chambered, the septa being simple, concave, and placed at distances of from one to two millimetres apart.\n\nGalt, Rev.

Rep., p. 347.\n\u2020 Idem.\nThe condition in which this species is most frequently found is in that of not very well preserved casts of the interior of the shell. In such specimens the slight angulation of the periphery and of the centre of the lower side is often nearly or quite obsolete, and the outline of the aperture is subovate, the upper side being less convex than the lower. In two unusually well-preserved fragments of this species from Durham, however, which have most of the test preserved, the aperture is clearly subtriangular or ovately triangular in contour.\n\nProf. McCoy states* that there are \"no chambers\" in shells of the genus *Ecculiomphalus*, but the present species is occasionally septate. Stoliczka places *Ecculiomphalus* in the Solaridae, but its affinities appear to have been very near to *Maclurea*.\n\n**CEPHALOPODA.**\n\n**Trohoceras desplainense**, McChesney.\n\nPlate 5, fig. 5.\n\n*Trohoceras Desplainensis*, McChesney. 1859, New Palaeozoic Fossils, p. 68, pl. 8, fig. 1.\n\n*Trohoceras Desplainense*; Hall........

The volutions of the shell in that species are said to be \"very gradually increasing in size throughout and probably circular in a transverse section when not compressed, but in the specimen used and figured are of very much greater diameter in a dorso-ventral direction than laterally, giving a rather acute dorsal keel; most likely due to compression, the specimen being imbedded in the rock parallel to the stratification.\"\n\nThe outline of a natural transverse section of a specimen from Hespeler, which in other respects agrees well with the description of *L. multico status*, is transversely sub-elliptical or subreniform, its dorso-ventral diameter is much less that its breadth laterally, its periphery is broadly rounded and somewhat flattened, and there is not the slightest indication of a keel. The siphuncle is small and situated in the centre of the inner margin of the whorls, and the species appears to be a true *Trocholites*, very closely allied to the *T. ammonius* of Conrad.\n\n**Orthoceras crebescens**, Hall.\n\n*Orthoceras crebescens*, Hall\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202620th Reg.

Pal. Foss. Canada, Vol. I., p. 161.\n\nThe type of this species, which has not previously been figured, is a very imperfect and badly preserved cast of the interior of part of the septate end of the shell. The siphuncle is visible only on the terminal septum of the smaller end, whose supposed ventral surface is partly removed by weathering, so that some allowance should probably be made for Mr. Billings' qualified statement that the centre of its siph-\nuncle \"appears to be\".....\"6 lines from the dorsal and 3 lines from the ventral margin.\" At any rate, in the writer's judgment, the eccentricity of the siphuncle in this species, the only character by which it can be distinguished from the *Cyrtoceras Myrice* of Hall and Whitfield, is more apparent than real and is probably due to distortion or to the accidental and unequal erosion of the posterior end of the specimen. The shell of *O. Darwinii* is gently curved as is that of *C. Myrice*, and the exterior of both is longitudinally grooved or fluted, the breadth of the grooves or furrows in each case being about one line.\n\n**Cyrtoceras Myrice**, Hall and Whitfield.\n\nPlate 6, figs. 3 and 3a.\n\n*Cyrtoceras Myrice*.

One is a cast of the interior of nearly the whole of the septate portion of the shell, while the other, the one figured on plate 6, shews the central and apparently moniliform siphuncle and concave constriction of the body-chamber.

Geology of Wisconsin, vol. 4, p. 301, pl. 19, fig. 3.\n\nShell somewhat compressed, apparently very little curved: septate end expanding rapidly in the dorso-ventral diameter, septa numerous, the four or five next to the body chamber averaging about five\nmillimetres in their distance apart, and as close together on the ventral or siphonal side as they are on the dorsal or anti-siphonal: siphuncle marginal or nearly so, moniliform and about eight millimetres broad in its greatest diameter on the septum next to the body-chamber. Chamber of habitation ovate in outline in transverse section, narrowest on the siphonal side, expanding very slowly in its dorso-lateral diameter and broadest in that direction at or a little below the mouth: maximum height of the same chamber in some specimens about equal to, and in others much less than, its greatest dorso-ventral diameter, its ventral side being always shorter than the dorsal. Aperture linear and narrowly contracted in the middle for a distance of a little more than an inch, expanded and nearly circular at both ends, the anti-siphonal expansion being much larger than the siphonal. Surface of the septate portion and of the posterior half of the chamber of habitation marked by very faint, longitudinal, rounded ribs.\n\nHespeler, T. C. Weston, 1867; Elora, loaned by the Trustees of the School Museum per Mr. David Boyle: Durham, Mr. J. Townsend, 1883. A single cast from each of these localities, one of which is that of the body chamber only, showing the shape and position of the siphuncle, while the others are casts of the same chamber with from six to nine septate chambers attached. As the posterior end of each happens to be imperfect, it is difficult to estimate the exact amount of their curvature.\n\nThese specimens resemble the *P. Nestor* of Hall, from the Niagara Group of Wisconsin, much more closely than they do the *P. Hector* of Billings, from the Guelph Formation, especially in the shape of the aperture and in the contour of the chamber of habitation. They appear to indicate a mere local and stratigraphical variety of *P. Nestor*, which can most readily be discriminated from the type of that species by its much straighter form,\u2014in consequence of which the edges of the septa are nearly equidistant all round,\u2014and by its faintly ribbed outer surface. This latter character, however, does not seem to be constant, for the ribbing is only to be seen in places on two of the Canadian specimens, and not at all on a third. The cast from Elora, which on the whole should probably be regarded as belonging to this variety of *P. Nestor*, is not only perfectly smooth but its dorsal aperture is produced into a short tube.\n\nA specimen in the Museum of the Survey which was collected by Dr. R.

Nestor*.\n**Phragmoceras parvum**, Hall and Whitfield.\n\nPlate 7, fig. 2.\n\n*Phragmoceras parvum*, Hall and Whitfield. 1875, Pal. Ohio, vol. 2, p. 151, pl. 8 fig. 10.\n\nTwo imperfect casts of the chamber of habitation of a *Phragmoceras* have been collected at Hespeler, which resemble *P. parvum* in their small size and in the tubular prolongation of the ventral end of the aperture. These specimens appear to differ from the type of that species only in not being quite so much curved.\n\n**Ascoceras Townsendi.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 6, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nShell small, slightly compressed at the sides, regularly oval in transverse section, its septate portion conical and widening gradually as well as somewhat convexly upwards from an obtusely pointed base: chamber of habitation unknown, with the exception of a small portion of its decurrent extremity: test and surface markings of the test also unknown. Septa apparently three in number. The first or posterior septum crosses the dorsum at a distance of about one millimetre from the posterior end, then curves concavely upwards on each side and finally passes over the ventral edge at a distance of eleven millimetres from the posterior end. The second septum crosses the dorsum close to the first and runs closely parallel with it on each side in its upward and concave curve, after which it bends first convexly towards the dorsum, and then suddenly backwards towards the ventral edge, which it ultimately passes over at a distance of four and a half millimetres above the septum. On the immediate centre of the dorsum the third septum is about one millimetre distant from the second: then for some distance on each side, as far as the upward concave curve extends, the sutures of the third and second septum are confluent, after which the third septum also bends convexly towards the dorsum, and then rather abruptly backwards towards and to the ventral edge, which it finally crosses at a distance of four millimetres above the second septum. The siphuncle is visible only at the pointed or posterior end: it is very small, and at this point is situated close to the centre of the dorsal margin of the first air chamber. The ventral half of the first air chamber is marked by a transverse groove or constriction.\n\nDurham, Mr. J. Townsend, 1883: a well preserved cast of the septate portion of the shell, with a small portion of the decurrent posterior\nextremity of the body-chamber. Although the type specimen is not perfect, this curious and interesting little shell appears to be easily distinguishable from all other species of the genus by its compressed conical form, and by the peculiar arrangement of the septa. The writer desires to couple with it the name of its discoverer, Mr. Joseph Towns- end, of Durham, a zealous collector of the fossils of that locality, to whom the Museum of the Survey is indebted for many choice specimens, some of which are described and figured in the present paper.\n\nTRILOBITA.\n\nCeraurus Niagarensis, Hall.\n\n*Ceraurus Niagarensis*, Hall. 1867.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 7, Fig. 3.\n\nCarapace moderately convex, broader than long, greatest breadth a little above the middle; semiovate, broadly rounded in front and squarely trunated behind; sides somewhat convex at their margin above, but straighter below; front and sides bordered by an elevated, narrow ridge, which is highest and most strongly marked on the posterior half of the sides. Eyes reniform, prominent, about four milli- metres in the greatest diameter; nine mm. apart (as measured from the centre of their inner margins) and placed at a distance of six mm. from the anterior, and of seven mm. from the lateral margin. Ocelli not clearly indicated, but probably placed on or near a small rounded prominence or elevation, which is situated exactly in the middle of the space between the two eyes. Surface of the carapace apparently finely granulose, and ornamented with minute rounded tubercles, some of which are isolated and others confluent in sets of two or three.\n\nThoracic and caudal portions together consisting of twelve segments, exclusive of the telson or caudal spine; the first, second, third and\nfourth thoracic segment each bearing on the median line a single, large and prominent, transversely elongated tubercle, which is arcuate or reniform at its base and somewhat bilobate at its summit. The lateral diameter of each of these tubercles greatly exceeds the longitudinal, and measuring at their base, the proportions of each tubercle may be thus approximately estimated; that on the first thoracic segment, lat. diam. four mm., long. diam. not quite one mm.; that on the third, lat. diam. nearly five mm., long. diam. rather more than one mm.; that on the third, lat. diam. five mm., long. diam., two mm.; and that on the fourth, lat. diam. five and a half mm., long. diam., three mm.\n\nTelson produced into a gradually narrowing, slightly curved, and rather obtusely pointed linear spine, which seems to be triangular in transverse section.\n\nAntennae, endognaths and ectognaths unknown, as is also the nature of the surface markings of the test of the thoracic and caudal segments.\n\nEntire length, including the telson, about seventy-five mm. (or three inches); length of carapace, twenty mm., greatest breadth of the same, twenty-seven mm.; length of telson, fifteen mm.\n\nElora, collected in 1881, by Mr. David Boyle, an intelligent and successful collector of the fossils of the Guelph formation for many years, to whom the writer begs to dedicate the species. The specimen figured, which has been kindly presented to the Museum of the Survey by the Trustees of the Elora School Museum, is an impression in a rather coarse-grained dolomite of the exterior of the upper surface of the carapace, with the whole of the thoracic and caudal segments in situ. Although the type and only specimen known is too imperfectly preserved to admit of as accurate a description as could be wished, the species, nevertheless seems to be sufficiently well characterized by the single large and peculiarly shaped tubercle placed on the median line of the upper surface of each of its four anterior thoracic segments.\nPLATE I.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all the figures are of natural size.\n\n**Pycnostylus Guelphensis** (page 3).\n\nFigure 1.

DAWSON, PRINTER TO THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY\nSEPTEMBER, 1895\nThe present Report, which forms the second part of the third volume of \"Palaeozoic Fossils\" now in course of publication by this Survey, consists of two papers, viz.: (2) a revision of the fauna of the Guelph formation of Ontario, with descriptions of a few species, and (3) a systematic list, with references, of the fossils of the Hudson River or Cincinnati formation at Stony Mountain, Manitoba.\n\nThe drawings for the seven plates illustrative of the first of these papers, were made from nature by Mr. L. M. Lambe, F.G.S., the artist to the Survey, and reproduced on stone by Mr. O. E. Prud'homme.\n\nGEORGE M.

Revision of the fauna of the Guelph formation of Ontario, with descriptions of a few new species.\n\nBY J. F. WHITEAVES.\n\nSince the first part of this volume was written, quite a number of fossils from this formation have been acquired by the Survey, most of which were collected by Mr. Joseph Townsend, of Toronto. Some of these fossils are much better specimens than had hitherto been obtained, of species that were already insufficiently characterized, others are new to this formation in Ontario, and a few appear to have been previously undescribed. Of late years particular attention has been given to the collecting of natural moulds of the exterior of shells of gasteropoda, etc., from this formation, as it has been found that gutta percha impressions of such moulds often give much more information about the exact shape and surface markings of the shell than can be derived from mere casts of the interior. Quite a number of these natural moulds have recently been obtained from a small exposure on the south bank of the Grand River at Belwood, formerly called Douglas or Garafraxa, in the township of West Garafraxa, seven miles north-east of Fergus. Several of the figures on the plates which accompany this paper are drawn from impressions of such moulds. These impressions were skilfully and most successfully made by Mr. L. M. Lambe, to whom the writer is indebted for valuable assistance in ascertaining the characters of some of the more critical species which are neither enumerated or described in this Report.\n\nThe publication of many special monographs and papers, and notably that of Lindstr\u00f6m's beautifully illustrated memoir \"on the Silurian gastropoda and pteropoda of Gotland,\"* has thrown so much new light upon the fossils of the Silurian (Upper Silurian) rocks, that it is now thought practicable to attempt a revision of the entire fauna of the Guelph formation as developed in Ontario, based not merely upon the new material collected, but upon all the specimens in the Museum of the Survey.\n\n*Kongl. Svenska vetenskaps-academiens Handlingar, Bandet 10, No. 6. Stockholm, 1884\nIn the earlier days of the Survey's operations, the fossils of this formation were collected\u2014at Galt by A. Murray in 1847, by Professor James Hall in 1848, by E. Billings, assisted by John (not James) Richardson, in 1857, by Dr. R. Bell in 1861, and by T. C. Weston in 1867; at Guelph by E. Billings in 1857; at New Hope (now called Hespeler*) by E. Billings in 1857, by T. C. Weston in 1867 and 1871; at Elora by Dr. R. Bell in 1861, and by T. C. Weston in 1867. Some of the fossils of the Guelph formation in the Museum of the Survey were collected by Mr. David Boyle at Elora between the years 1876 and 1881, and a large number of unusually fine specimens, upon which both this and the preceding part of the present volume are largely based, were collected by Mr. Townsend in the vicinity of Durham in 1878-75, and since then at Elora, Belwood, etc.\n\nFor the information of those who may not be familiar with the literature of the subject, it may be well to state that the earliest descriptions of the fossils of this formation in Canada are contained in the second volume of the Palaeontology of the State of New York, published in 1852 and in pages 154-169 of the first volume of \"Palaeozoic Fossils\" published by the Survey in 1862 and 1865. In the former, fifteen species were described and figured by Professor James Hall, and, in the latter, twenty-one additional species were described by E. Billings, sixteen of which are figured. Between 1865 and the date of publication of the first part of this volume (1884), descriptions of a few more fossils from the Guelph formation of Ontario have appeared in various publications, but it will not be necessary to refer to these descriptions or publications any further here, as the name of each species in the following systematic list will be accompanied with full references to the memoirs or papers in which it has been described or quoted. The classification followed in this list is for the most part that adopted by Zittel in his Handbuch der Palaeontologie, but the gasteropoda are arranged in accordance with the order followed in Lindstr\u00f6m's monograph of the Silurian gastropoda, etc., of Gotland.\n\nIn 1888 rocks containing numerous specimens of a coral apparently identical with *Pycnostylus Guelphensis*, and of a Stromatoporoid apparently referable to *Clathrodictyon ostiolatum*, and therefore probably of the age of the Guelph formation, were discovered by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell at Davis Point, on the eastern shore of Lake Manitoba. At the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Rochester, N. Y., in 1892, Professor Albert L. Arey exhibited quite a large series of fossils characteristic of the Guelph formation, which were collected in the immediate vicinity of that city.\n\n*The name New Hope was formally and officially changed to Hespeler in July, 1858.*\nALCYONARIA.\n\nHELIOLITES INSTERSTINCTUS, L.\n\nMadrepora interstincta, Linn\u00e6us ..........1767.

Bell, 1861; Hespeler, T. C.\nWeston, 1867; and Durham, J. Townsend, 1878-1882. In the Geology\nof Canada, H. catenulatus is said to have been found in the Black River\nlimestone of the Ouatchouan River, Lake St. John, P.Q.; in the Hudson\nRiver formation at the west end of the island of Anticosti; in all the\ndivisions of the \"Anticosti Group\" of that island; and, in the Niagara\nlimestone, near Thorold, Owen Sound, the Manitoulin Islands, Rockwood and Isthmus Bay (Lake Huron); at Lake Temiscamang, Dudswell and Port Daniel. The specimens in the Museum of the Survey from most of these localities belong to the large tubed or typical form of the species which Prof. Whitfield suggests (op. cit.) should be called *H. catenulatus* var. *labyrinthicus*, but some of those collected at Lake St. John by Mr. James Richardson in 1857 or by Mr. Walter McOuat in 1871, and at Port Daniel by Sir W. Logan in 1843, represent the small tubed form or dimorphic variety which Edwards and Haime described and figured as the *Halysites escharoides* of Lamarck.\n\nSince 1863, characteristic examples of the typical form of *H. catenularia* have been collected by Dr. R. Bell (in 1879) at the second and third limestone rapids of the Nelson River, Keewatin, and it has been found to be abundant in the Trenton limestone of the Red River valley, in Manitoba (at East Selkirk and Lower Fort Garry), of the western shore of Lake Winnipeg and of many of the islands in that lake. Specimens of the typical form of the \"chain coral\" and of the variety with extremely small corallites (*H. catenulatus* var. *microporus*, Whitfield) were collected by Prof. A. P. Coleman in 1864, in the Silurian (Upper Silurian) rocks of the north-east shore of the Columbia River, near Donald. Mr. McConnell obtained the typical form in 1886 at several localities \"along the central and more elevated parts of the Beaverfoot Range of the Rocky Mountains and its continuations,\" in rocks which are well exposed between Palliser and Golden, on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Mr. Tyrrell collected it in 1889 in rocks apparently of the age of the Niagara limestone, on the Saskatchewan River at and below Cedar Lake. It has been found near the Neigette River, six or seven miles east of Rimouski village, in the province of Quebec, by Mr. Weston in 1880, and at Lake Metapedia by Prof. L. W. Bailey in 1888.\n\n**Halysites agglomeratus**, Hall.\n\n*Catenipora agglomerata*, Hall. . . . . . 1843. Geol. Rep. 4th Distr. N.

The writer has either not seen or has failed to recognize the specimen referred\nto by Dr. Dall, but the unusually perfect specimen represented on Plate 10, which was collected at Durham by Mr. J. Townsend in 1884, is probably the pedicle valve of a variety of *T. Ohioensis*. The interior of this valve, however, is so completely filled with the matrix that its identity with that species is not quite certain. The exterior of the valve is compressed convex, its marginal outline broadly subovate, broader than long and broadest in advance of the midlength. The beak is slender, elongate and acuminate, its apex being acutely pointed and slightly incurved. The maximum length of the valve is a little more than three inches, and its greatest breadth not quite two inches and a half. Its outer service is marked with concentric striae of growth. Its \"deltidium\" is much higher or longer than broad, but the surface markings of the whole of its cardinal area are obscured by the tough and tenacious matrix.\n\nA cast of the interior of both valves of a specimen from Elora, kindly lent to the writer, for examination, by Mr. B. E. Walker, of Toronto, appears to be referable to this species.\n\nIn the second part of the first volume of the \"Report of the Geological Survey of Ohio,\" pages 184 and 185, Mr. Meek concludes that *T.

Immediately in front of the cardinal facet, and on each side of its forward curve, there is a shallowly subcrescentic excavation or depression of the hinge plate. Crown of the crescent apparently narrow, its sides and ends not clearly defined. Interior of the valve deeply concave posteriorly, simple and devoid of umbonal chambers. Platform sharply V-shaped; platform vaults apparently shallow; anterior septum short, extending from the apex of the platform to a short distance from the front margin of the valve.\n\nSurface of the exterior of both valves apparently smooth.\n\nThe only specimen known to the writer is not sufficiently perfect to admit of exact measurements, but, when unbroken, it was probably about three inches and a half in length, and an inch less in its greatest breadth.\nEdge Mills, near Durham, J. Townsend, 1884: a single specimen with a considerable portion of the test preserved, though the apices of the beaks of both of the valves are broken off. The specimen consists of two pieces, which fit together exactly. One of these pieces, the original of figure 1 on Plate 9, shows the test, though badly exfoliated, of the pedicle valve, the well preserved hinge area of that valve, and an imperfect cast of the interior of the brachial valve. The other piece shows both sides of the test of the umbonal region and part of the beak of the brachial valve, the other portion of that valve, as represented by figure 1 on Plate 15, being drawn from a gutta percha impression of the corresponding cast of the interior of the shell. The test in the umbonal region of the brachial valve is fully half an inch in thickness.\n\nThis remarkable shell is referred to the genus *Monomerella*, mainly on the authority of Professor J. M. Clarke, who has carefully examined the specimen described. The species differs from the typical forms of the genus, in the enormous development of the beak and pedicle surface of the brachial valve, and in the apparent presence of shallow platform vaults in that valve, but it could very well be congeneric with such shells as *M. Egani* and *M. Kingii*.\n\n**Monomerella. Species uncertain.**\n\n*Rhynobolus Galtensis*, Whiteaves. (Pars.)..1884. This volume, pt. 1, pl. 8, fig. 3a, but not fig. 3.\n\n*Monomerella*, Sp. ?

Except in the much greater proportionate breadth of the hinge plate, it is remarkably similar, in shape, size and surface markings, to the brachial valve of that species, but its interior is completely filled with the matrix. More recently, however, Professors Hall and Clark have expressed the opinion that this specimen is probably the brachial valve of a species of Monomerella, and in this opinion the writer is inclined to concur. They state, with much apparent justice, that this specimen does not agree with the pedicle valve of the shell now known as *Rhinobolus Galtensis*, as figured by Davidson and King, but that \"it is, on the contrary, of about the same outline as the brachial valve\" of that species, with a low incurved umbo and a very broad margin of contact, much like that seen in the species *Monomerella ovata* and *M. Greenii*. The brachial valve of *M. ovata*, however, is much larger, more strongly convex, and its beak much more incurved than\nthat of the species now under consideration: while the hinge plate of the corresponding valve of *M.

York, Vol. VIII., pl. 4B, and explanation of that plate.\n\nThe original description of *Obolus Galtensis*, Billings, is as follows:\n\n\u201cOvate, both valves moderately convex; sides gently, and front margin broadly rounded; apical extremity of ventral valve 70\u00b0; greatest width a little below the middle. The area of the ventral valve is flat, with a concave groove along the middle; and while in one specimen it lies nearly in the plane of the margin, in another it slopes a little outwards. The largest specimen seen is 25 lines in length and 18 in width.\n\n**Locality and Formation.\u2014Galt.** In the Guelph formation; Middle Silurian. **Collectors:** E. Billings, R. Bell.\u201d In a paper \u201cOn the Genus Obolellina,\u201d published in the Canadian Naturalist and Geologist for April, 1872, Mr. Billings adds the following particulars: \u201cThe beak of the ventral valve is very large, its length being one-half that of the body of the shell. It is slightly incurved. The area has three furrows, the peduncular and the two lateral grooves. The muscular impressions are rhomboidal rather than ovate, and confined to the central portion of the shell. There are no cavities under the area.\u201d\n\nWhile writing the paper last mentioned Mr. Billings states that \u201cfifteen casts of the interior of *O. Galtensis*\u201d were lying before him, but the specimens in the Museum of the Survey upon which the foregoing descriptions of that species would seem to have been most largely based,\nare five in number. Two of these are natural casts of the interior of the brachial valve, both from New Hope, now called Hespeler: the one evidently that referred to as the \"largest specimen seen,\" and the other, (a gutta-percha impression of which is represented on Plate 15,) the original of figure 152, printed inadvertently upside down, on page 168 of the first volume of the \"Palaeozoic Fossils.\" One is a cast of the interior of both valves of a small specimen from Galt. This is the original of figures 4 and 4a of Plate XIX. of Davidson & King's paper on the Trimerellidae, in the thirtieth volume of the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London. The remaining two are casts of the interior of the pedicle valve, with the inner surface of the beak and area also fairly well preserved, both from Galt. The smaller of these two is the type of Trimerella minor, Dall, and both are almost certainly the specimens upon which Billings, Davidson and King based their descriptions of the beak and area of the ventral or pedicle valve of the species now under consideration.\n\nThe genus Rhinobolus was based upon a gutta-percha impression of a natural cast of the interior of a ventral or pedicle valve collected by Hall at Galt in 1848. Billings, Davidson and King seem to have been fully satisfied that the type of Rhinobolus is a ventral or pedicle valve of O. Galtensis, Billings, although Hall and Clarke appear to have entertained some doubts on this point, possibly because they had not seen any authentic examples of the pedicle valve of that species, which was not figured by Billings. However that may be, it seems to the writer that the characters of the two pedicle valves from Galt, upon which Billings evidently based his description of that valve of O. Galtensis, are essentially similar to those of the type of Rhinobolus as described and figured by Hall.\n\nR. Galtensis was collected at Galt by A. Murray in 1847; at Galt, Guelph and New Hope (now Hespeler) by E. Billings in 1857; at Galt and Guelph by Dr. R. Bell in 1861; at Hespeler by T. C. Weston in 1867 and 1871; and at Durham by J. Townsend in 1880-83. Most of the specimens collected are natural casts of one or both valves, but a few (six) brachial valves with the test preserved were obtained at Durham by Mr. Townsend. On Plate IV. B (fig. 8) of the eighth volume of the Paleontology of the State of New York, Hall figures \"the interior of a small brachial valve\" of R. Galtensis, from Elora. The specimen from Durham, figured on Plate 2, fig. 1a, of the first part of this volume, as the pedicle valve of R. Galtensis, has the cardinal area completely covered with the matrix and the interior filled with dolomite, so that its identification with that species is by no means certain.\nRhinobolus.\n\n(Species uncertain, but perhaps a var. of R. Galtensis.)\n\nPlate 9, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nPedicle valve. Exterior compressed convex, subovate in marginal outline, about one-third longer than broad, broadest a little in advance of the midlength and rather abruptly pointed behind, its surface marked with concentric lines of growth at irregular but somewhat distant intervals. Interior shallowly concave, the concave portion a little longer than broad. Beak elevated, solid, erect: cardinal area or pedicle surface a little broader than high, occupying about one-fourth of the length of the valve, its interior margin convex and slightly produced in the centre and concave on each side. \"Deltidium\" gently convex, moderately prominent, much higher than broad and striated across: \"deltidial ridges\" broad, not so much raised as the \"deltidium\" and almost flat: \"areal borders\" consisting of a pair of widely divergent narrow and acute angular ridges, which are separated from each of the deltidial ridges by a linear groove. \"Umbo-lateral scars\" represented by a pair of distant, small and indistinctly defined shallow pits. Crescent much like that of Trimerella, but with its sides more nearly marginal. Platform apparently essentially similar to that of R. Galtensis, but placed a little farther forward.\n\nBrachial valve. Unknown.\n\nLength, forty-eight millimetres; greatest breadth, thirty-two mm.; maximum thickness of test, eight mm.\n\nIrvine Rocks, Elora, at the \"cave\" near Modeland's foundry, J. Townsend, 1885: a nearly perfect and well preserved specimen of the pedicle valve, with the test preserved and showing the whole of the characters of both the inside and outside of that valve, though the front margin of the platform is slightly broken.\n\nThis shell has a much shorter cardinal area or pedicle surface than that of the pedicle valve of R. Galtensis, but it may possibly represent only an extreme variety of that species.\n\nOrthis.\n\nA few casts of the interior of single valves of apparently two species of Orthis have been collected at Durham, but they are all much too imperfect and too badly preserved for identification or description.\n\nStrophomena.\n\nElora, T.

All the specimens that the writer has seen, so far, are either casts of the interior of the shell or else have the outer layer of the test exfoliated and hence do not show the fine radiating raised lines characteristic of the species. The two dorsal valves from Durham have the mesial fold partly divided by a faint longitudinal grove, and there are three low, rounded plications on each side of the fold. The characters of the two ventral valves from Durham are so similar to those of the Spirifer bicostatus, the Orthis bicostatus of Vanuxem, as described and figured by Professor Hall, that it is just possible that these two valves should be referred to that species rather than to S. plicatella. S. plicatella and its var. radiata had previously been recorded (in the Geology of Canada, 1863) as occurring in the Clinton formation at Flamborough West, near Dundas; in the Niagara limestone at Thorold, Flamborough West and Grimsby; in rocks of about the same age at Port Daniel, in the Baie des Chaleurs; and in division 4 of the Anticosti group at South-west Point and the Jumpers.\n\nSpirifera crispa, Hisinger.\n\nTerebratula crispa, Hisinger (not of Linnaeus)...1826.

It has long been known to be abundant in the outlier of Niagara limestone at Lake Temiscaming, and, more recently, it has been recorded by Dr. H. M.

Bell, in 1861, and the other at Durham by Mr. Townsend between the years 1878 and 1882. Neither of these specimens gives a correct idea of the marginal outline of the valves or of the nature of the surface ornamentation. Since the first part of this volume was written, Mr. Townsend has obtained five additional and more perfect examples of *I. Galtensis* at Durham, and, quite recently (in 1894), the unusually perfect and well preserved left valve from Elora figured on Plate 15. This specimen, which is drawn from a gutta-percha impression of a natural mould of the exterior of that valve, shows that, when perfect, the valves are nearly as high as long and that the ventral margin is narrowly rounded and somewhat produced at or a little in advance of the mid-length. The beaks are small and subcentral, and the surface markings are seen to consist of very numerous and closely disposed fine concentric striae, with a few coarser ones at irregular but more distant intervals.\n\nThe systematic position of *Ilionia* is quite problematical, as the muscular impressions are not at all well preserved in any of the specimens collected, and its hinge dentition is still unknown. Zittel, in the first part of the second volume of his Handbuch der Palaeontologie, published in 1881, places it between the Pholadomyidae and the Anatiniidae, in a group characterized as \"paleozoic genera with a simple pallial line, and of doubtful systematic position.\" Tryon, in the third volume of his \"Structural and Systematic Conchology,\" published in 1884, places it in the Anatiniidae, and Fischer, in the last \"fascicule\" of his Manuel de Conchyliologie, published in 1887, includes it in the Lyonsiidae. On the other hand, the external form of the Elora specimen of *I. Galtensis* figured on Plate 15, is so similar to that of some of the lower Paleozoic species of *Lucina* (inclusive of *Paracyclas*) that it is difficult to see how *Ilionia* is to be distinguished from *Lucina*, and in this connection it is to be observed that the *Tellina prisca* of Hisinger, which E. Billings states is a typical *Ilionia*, is regarded by Bronn and Ferdinand Roemer* as a *Lucina*.\n\nILIONIA (?) COSTULATA, Whiteaves.\n\nIlionia (?) costulata, Whiteaves. 1884.

Each of these is a nearly perfect cast of the interior of the shell, upon which not a vestige of the muscular impressions can be detected.\n\nThe genus Scenella, which was constituted by E. Billings in 1872, is not mentioned in Dr. Paul Fischer's manual of recent and fossil shells, by Zittel in his Handbuch der Palaeontologie, nor by Nicholson in the latest or any other edition of his Manual of Palaeontology. Tryon, in his \"Structural and Systematic Conchology,\" and S. A. Miller (op. cit.) place it in the class Pteropoda, but its conical, limpet-like shell suggests that it may rather be referable to the Patellidae or Capulidae. It seems to the writer that Scenella, Palaeacmea (Hall, 1873), and Hercynella (Kayser, 1878) are very closely related, if not actually synonymous.\n\nCapulus Canadensis, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 11, fig. 1.\n\nTryblidium Canadense, Whiteaves. 1884. This volume, pt. 1, p. 31, pl. 5, figs. 1 & 1a.\n\nThe only known specimen of this species is a cast of the interior of the shell, from Hespler, which does not show the muscular impressions at all clearly. Still, upon this cast there is an obscure, narrowly elliptical depression on each side of, and at a short distance below, the nearly terminal apex. These depressions seem to be united into one continuous subhemispherical scar, under and immediately behind the presumably posterior apex. This supposed muscular scar is not quite correctly represented in the two figures of Tryblidium Canadense on Plate 5, of the first part of this volume, and a new figure of the type specimen is given on Plate 11. If the appearances just described are correctly interpreted, they would seem to indicate that the fossil, now under consideration is referable to the Capulidae of Cuvier rather than to the Patellidae, though one would expect to find the muscular impressions upon the cast represented by slight elevations rather than depressions. Until more perfect specimens are obtained, therefore, it is thought desirable to refer the present species to Capulus, in the sense in which De Koninck uses that generic name, rather than to Tryblidium.\nBELLEROPHON.

Those of adult shells almost invariably show traces of the \"interrupted oblong nodes\" on the centre of the periphery, that are said to be characteristic of *T. Alpheus*, and most of them are marked with spiral grooves on the outer volution. These \"oblong nodes\" on the periphery are said to be absent in *B. angustata*, but the type of that species is stated to be a \"rough cast in limestone,\" which is doubtless too imperfectly preserved to show them. In the writer's judgment, *B. angustata* and *T. Alpheus* are names expressive merely of different states of preservation of the same species.\n\nIt is not improbable that *T. angustatus* itself may prove to be identical with the *Bellerophon dilatatus* of Sowerby, which is now known to belong to the genus *Trematonotus*. However this may be, in the Museum of the Survey there is a fine specimen of *T. dilatatus*, identified as such by the late Mr. E. Billings, and showing the widely expanded outer lip of\nthe adult shell, collected by Dr. R. Bell in 1862 from rocks of about the age of the Niagara limestone, at L'Anse \u00e0 la Vieille in the Baie des Chaleurs; and another but less perfect specimen, also identified, though with some doubt, by Mr. Billings as this species, collected by the late Mr. James Richardson in 1856 from \"Division 2\" of the Anticosti Group, at Cape Sand Bay, Anticosti.\n\n**PLEUROTOMARIA.**\n\nThe Pleurotomariae that have so far been collected from the dolomites of the Guelph formation in Ontario are so imperfectly preserved that it is not yet practicable to group them according to their natural relations. Many of the species are still known only from casts of the interior of the shell, and even in those rare specimens which are partly or wholly testiferous, the minute structures of the slit band are not preserved. Under these circumstances the only course that seems to be feasible is first to group together those species that are now known to have an alate or spinose periphery, and afterwards to consider those apparently devoid of either, in accordance with the dates at which they were described, commencing at the earliest.\n\n**A.

Valeria,* which was figured for the first time in the present volume, is an imperfect cast of the interior of the shell, collected by Mr. E. Billings at Galt in 1857. Between the years 1879 and 1882 a few specimens of this species, with the test partially and imperfectly preserved, were obtained at Durham by Mr. Townsend, and one of these is figured on Plate 4, fig 1 a. Two specimens from this locality are natural moulds of the exterior of the apical side of the shell, and gutta-percha impressions of these moulds, such as that represented on Plate 11, fig. 2, show that the comparatively slender tubular portion of the outer volution is encircled externally by a thin and slightly curved alate expansion, that is broader than the tube itself, and shallowly concave. The corresponding alation of the later volutions of the spire is not even indicated in either\nof these casts, so that they do not give a very good idea of the original contour of the spire, and the only surface markings that they show, are numerous flexuous growth lines upon the outer volution.\n\nThe umbilical side of a shell of this species is well seen in the gutta-percha impression of a natural mould of the exterior of a specimen collected by Mr. Townsend and the writer at Belwood in 1893, and represented by fig. 3 on Plate 11. In this specimen the peripheral alation of the outer volution is remarkably perfect, the outer lip is clearly defined and the incremental striae are beautifully preserved. These latter are curved concavely backward on the tubular part of the outer volution, and obliquely as well as convexly outward and forward on the peripheral alation.\n\nFrom the additional information afforded by these specimens it would seem that *P. Valeria* is most probably synonymous with *P. alata*. Still, as the few specimens of *P. Valeria* that have been collected so far, are neither sufficiently perfect nor well preserved to admit of a satisfactory comparison with the published descriptions and figures of *P. alata*, it is thought better to provisionally retain the name already given to the former.\n\n**Pleurotomaria velaris. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 11, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nShell conical, more than twice as broad as high: its base widely and deeply umbilicated. Volutions perhaps as many as six or seven when perfect, though only the last four are preserved in the single specimen collected, those of the spire obliquely compressed, the alation of each of its three later volutions partially overlapping and appressed to the volution that immediately succeeds it. Outer volution expanded laterally and rather strongly convex next to the alate periphery above: the alation broad and curving concavely outward and downward, as viewed from the apical side: base of the tubular portion gently convex around the umbilicus: aperture transversely subelliptical, a little broader than high.\n\nSurface of the apical side marked by low, rounded, flexuous, transverse plications and striae of growth, also by numerous small revolving raised lines or minute spiral ridges, that are more distinct upon the peripheral alation of the last volution than upon its tubular portion. Crescents of the slit band unknown. Base marked only by flexuous incremental striae, that curve concavely and obliquely forward upon the tubular portion of the outer volution, and convexly outward and forward on its alate expansion.\n\nThe specimen described is not sufficiently perfect to admit of an accurate statement of its proportionate dimensions, but both the figures are of the natural size.\nIrvine rocks, Elora, J. Townsend, 1885: one specimen with the test preserved. The apex is imperfect, but the three latest volutions of the spire, and most or the outer volution, with the characteristic alation of each, are well preserved.\n\nThe shell for which the foregoing name is suggested, may prove to be a variety of *P. Valeria* or of *P. alata*, but the surface markings of its apical side seem to be very different to the corresponding markings of either of those species.\n\n**Pleurotomaria Halei**, Hall.

Volutions probably four or five when perfect, though only the three later ones are preserved in the specimens collected, those of the spire ventricose or expanded, the penultimate volution distinctly angulated anteriorly, in some specimens, such as the one figured, a little below the middle, and in others at or near the base and next to the suture below. Outer volution widely expanded, a little higher than the spire, obliquely convex near the suture and faintly concave next to the alate periphery above; encircled about the midheight with a prominent, but apparently non-spinose, alate keel four millimetres and a half in altitude, which incloses the slit band; rather strongly convex beneath, but depressed and deeply umbilicated in the centre, the umbilicus occupying about one-third of the diameter of the base, though its margin is rounded and indefinite.\n\nThe surface markings of the umbilical side are well preserved in most of the specimens collected, and consist of crowded, flexuous, striae of growth, which curve obliquely and concavely backward from the peripheral alation to the umbilicus, and are crossed by spiral incised lines. The crescents of the slit band are crowded, but they are not sufficiently well preserved to show the details of the structure. The surface ornamentation of the apical side is not nearly so well exhibited, but it appears to consist of numerous and closely disposed lines of growth, which are crossed by one or more spiral ridges.\n\nDurham, J. Townsend, 1882-89: nine specimens. As seen from above, these specimens bear a certain general resemblance to *P. Elora*, Billings,\nbut in the former the alation of the outer volution is central and apparently non-spinose, and the base rather strongly convex exteriorly. In *P. Elora* the alation of the outer volution is basal and distinctly spinose, and the base flattened around the umbilicus.\n\n**B.

Bell at Elora in 1861. A few additional and much more perfect specimens, some of which have most of the test preserved, have recently been obtained by Mr. Townsend at Durham, Elora and at Aboyne, one mile east of Elora. The testiferous specimens, two of which are figured, show that the angulated periphery of the outer volution, when perfect, is armed with a single row of long and slightly curved, slender and hollow spines, not unlike externally to those of *Guildfordia* or some recent species of *Astralium*. In two remarkable specimens collected by Mr. Townsend at Aboyne in 1892, and presented by him to the Museum of the Survey, these spines, as shown by figure 6 on Plate 11, are more than three-quarters of an inch in length. In another specimen, the original of fig. 5 on the same plate, the spines appear to commence on the outer half of the last volution of the spire, where they form a spiral row of small tubercles immediately above that part of the suture which separates the spire from the outer volution, near the aperture, in consequence of their being almost completely overlapped by the upper portion of the outer volution. The surface of the apical side of the shell is marked by the usual flexuous stri\u00e6 of growth and that of the spire by a few spiral raised lines, but the markings of the umbilical side are still unknown.\n\n**C.

An imperfect and very badly preserved cast of the interior of a shell collected at Hespeier by Mr. Weston in 1867 has since been identified with this species by E. Billings. *P. bispiralis* appears to be very rare, as these two specimens are, so far as the writer is aware, the only ones known. It is recognizable by its narrow turbinate-conical form, by its imperforate or nearly imperforate base and by its elevated spire, encircled with two spiral ridges.\nPleurotomaria perlata, Hall.\n\nPleurotomaria perlata, Hall. 1852.

A fine large species of which only casts of the interior of the shell have yet been found.

Canada, p. 334, fig. 349.\n\nThe types of this species are two imperfect casts of the interior of the shell, collected at Galt by Dr. R. Bell in 1861. The apices of both of these specimens are broken off, and only the three outer volutions are preserved in the more perfect of the two. In September, 1893, Mr. Townsend and the writer obtained at Belwood two casts of the interior of a shell which is evidently referable to P. Galtensis, with corresponding moulds of the exterior of each, from which the intermediate test has long ago disappeared. The figure on Plate 11 is a representation of a gutta-percha impression of one of these natural moulds. It shows that the volutions of the spire are angulated and subcarinate at or near their base, that the outer portion of the last volution is angulated a little above the mid-height and encircled by a spiral ridge which is concave on the apical side and convex on the umbilical, also that the very convex umbilical side is imperforate when the test is preserved. On each side of the spiral angulation the whole surface of the shell appears to have been smooth.\n\nPleurotomaria Deiopeia, Billings.\n\nPlate 12, fig. 1.\n\nPleurotomaria Deiopeia, Billings. 1862.

Bell at Elora in 1861. No other specimen of it has been seen by the writer. In addition to the original description it may be added that the umbilicus of the type of *P.

According to Professor Lindstr\u00f6m,* the *Murchisonia Hercyna* of Billings comes near to *Pleurotomaria elliptica*, Hisinger, and may possibly be only a variety of that species, though the Canadian shell is more elongated, and its apical angle is more acute. The characters of *M. Hercyna*, on the whole, seem certainly to accord better with those of *Pleurotomaria* than with those of *Murchisonia*.\n\n\"**Pleurotomaria?

Townsend, 1886: two similar specimens.\n\nThis species is so imperfectly characterized that it is very doubtful if it can be retained. No specimen has yet been collected in which even a very small piece of the test is preserved, or any considerable portion of the spire is visible, and the outer volution of the type, as described by Billings, shows only \"some appearance of an angulation.\" It is by no means certain, even, that the species should not be referred to *Straparollus* rather than to *Pleurotomaria*.\n\n---\n\n*On the Silurian Gastropoda and Pteropoda of Gotland.

To the naked eye the surface of\nthe outer volution appears to be nearly smooth and marked only with a narrow and apparently flat spiral band a little above or on the apical side of the mid-height. Under a lens it seems to be marked with numerous and extremely minute transverse lines of growth, which are crossed by equally minute spiral raised lines, but the specimen is not sufficiently well preserved to show the minute details of the sculpture at all satisfactorily.\n\nDimensions of the most perfect specimen, the original of fig. 9: entire height, as measured in the median line of the dorsal surface, fourteen mm.; greatest breadth, eleven mm. and a half; height of spire, five mm. and a half.\n\nDurham, J.

According to Lindstr\u00f6m, only one species of that section was previously known, viz., the P. exquisita of that author himself, from the Silurian rocks of Gotland. The minute surface markings of P. Townsendii, so far as they can be ascertained at present, seem to resemble those of P. exquisita, but in that species the slit band is placed below or on the umbilical side of the mid-height, the spire is shorter and much more obtuse and the base distinctly umbilicated.\n\nMurchisonia.\n\nIt will be convenient to group the species of this genus that are known to occur in the Guelph formation of Ontario, as far as practicable in their natural order, commencing with the short-spired Pleurotomaria-like forms, and ending with the slender species with very numerous volutions. M. Hercyna, Billings, is now regarded as a Pleurotomaria; M. Boydii, Hall, appears to the writer to be a Loxonema; and Fisher's genus Loxoplocus will be retained for M. soluta (Whiteaves) of which M. tropidophora (Whiteaves) is now known to be a synonym. Specimens of M. bivittata collected at Belwood by Mr. Townsend in 1892, which happen to be broken in such a way as to afford good longitudinal and transverse sections of the empty shell, show that the earlier volutions of the spire are divided into chambers by numerous transverse partitions, also that the columella, which has long been known to be encircled with two spiral folds, is tubular and hollow throughout.\n\nA.

The specimen is represented as measuring twenty-four millimetres, or a little less than an inch in height, but the figure of it is slightly restored, the spire of the original being rather badly preserved and its apex broken off. According to Mr. Billings, the shell of this species is short and consists of \"four or five ventricose whorls, with a narrow spiral band a little above the middle on the last,\" and, it may be added, on the last only.\n\nMurchisonia. (Species uncertain.)\n\nPlate 12, fig. 3.\n\nBetween the years 1878 and 1882 Mr. Townsend collected, at Durham, five specimens of a rather large short-spired *Murchisonia* which may represent the adult condition of *M. Mylitta*, but which in some respects seems to be intermediate in its characters between that species and *M. Xanthippe*, Billings. The largest of these specimens, which is imperfect at the apical end, is fifty-four millimetres or upwards of two inches in height or length, and three of the smaller ones have most of the test preserved. In these latter the slit band, which is enclosed in a prominent but narrow spiral ridge or keel, encircles the outer volution above the mid-height, especially near the aperture, as represented by the figure on Plate 12, and the volutions of the spire are angulated a little below the mid-height. The whole five give one the impression of a shell like the *Murchisonia bicincta* of Hall, with only one spiral keel developed, and closely resembling that form of *M. bicincta* from Ardre figured by Lindstr\u00f6m under the name *Pleurotomaria bicincta* on Plate 8, figure 20, of the \"Silurian Gastropoda and Pteropoda of Gotland.\" In that monograph the \"*Trochonema (Eunema) fatua*\" of Hall, from the Niagara limestone of Wisconsin, is regarded as a synonym of *Pleurotomaria bicincta*.\nMurchisonia Xanthippe, Billings.\n\n*Murchisonia Xanthippe*, Billings. 1862.

The species has also been collected at Durham by Mr. Townsend, and at Belwood (in 1893) by Mr. Townsend and the writer. With the exception of the one from Elora represented on Plate 4, fig. 7a, of the present volume, all the specimens of this species that the writer has seen are natural moulds of the exterior of the shell. The type of *M. macrospira*, as figured by Professor Hall, is a mould of the exterior of five of the later volutions. A gutta-percha impression of this mould has recently been presented to the Museum of the Survey by Professor R. P. Whitfield. It shows that the volutions are rounded, ventricose and encircled at their mid-height by a low, rounded, spiral ridge which represents the slit band. Other specimens shew that the number of volutions is at least nine.\n\nIt is very doubtful whether the distinction between this species and *M. Logani* can be be sustained. The original figures of both give the impression that the volutions of *M. Logani* are a little broader in proportion to their height and perhaps slightly more numerous than those of *M. macrospira*, but these apparent differences do not seem to hold good when a series of specimens is compared. In the diagrammatic figure of *M. macrospira* on page 339 of the \"Geology of Canada,\" the volutions are more like those of *M. Logani* than those of *M. macrospira*. Again, the writer can see no difference, except in size, between the specimen which Professor Nicholson figures on Plate 3, fig. 4, of his second \"Report upon the Paleontology of the Province of Ontario\" as *M. Logani*, and that which he figures on the same Plate, figure 9, as *M. macrospira*.\n\n**Murchisonia Boylei**, Nicholson.\n\n*Murchisonia Boylei*, Nicholson.1875. Rep. Pal. Prov.

Whiteaves, 1893.\n\nThis is one of the commonest fossils of the Guelph formation at these localities, and one that, as has been pointed out by Professors Hall and Nicholson, is most readily recognized by the \"double spiral fold or carina\" upon its columella. The condition in which *M. bivittata* is usually obtained, is either that of natural longitudinal sections of the hollow shell, with the columella preserved throughout and the broken edges of the test exposed; or casts of the interior, or specimens with the outer layer of the test exfoliated. When perfect the shell was evidently composed of two layers of about equal thickness, but no considerable portion of the outer surface of the test is preserved in any specimen that the writer has seen.\n\nSpecimens of this species recently collected at Belwood by Mr. Townsend and the writer, give the following additional information about the\nexternal shape of its shell and its internal peculiarities. Figure 5 on Plate 12, which represents a gutta-percha impression of a natural mould of the exterior of the shell from Belwood, shows that it is rather slender and composed of about twelve volutions. Those of the spire are compressed convex above and distinctly angulated below the mid-height; the suture is deeply impressed; the outer volution is angulated, apparently with a spiral band, about the mid-height, and rounded and apparently narrowly umbilicated below. Figure 6, on the same plate, represents a longitudinal section of the upper portion of the shell, also from Belwood. It shows that the transverse shelly partitions of the earlier volutions of the spire are concave, numerous, and placed at intervals of from one to two millimetres apart. Other specimens from the same localities show that the columella is hollow throughout, as previously stated on page 78.\n\n*M. bivittata* seems to be most nearly related to *M. Estella*, Billings, but in the latter species the shell is still more slender and composed of more than fifteen volutions. The diagrammatic representations of *M. bivittata* on page 339 of the \"Geology of Canada\" is very unsatisfactory and does not give a correct idea of its characters.\n\n**BBB.

Townsend, 1878-82. *M. longispira* is remarkable for its extremely elongated and very slender spire, also for its numerous volutions, which are stated to be \"rounded on the surface, and carinated below the centre.\" Professor Hall says that he has counted twenty-five volutions in a mould of this species\nfrom Galt, that is imperfect at the base.

In this specimen the volutions of the spire are laterally compressed, but most prominent and obtusely sub-angular a little below the mid-height, where they are encircled by a rather narrow and not much elevated spiral band, which is flattened at the summit and bounded above by a spiral impressed line. The outer volution, which is not much larger than the one which precedes it, and rounded below, is encircled by the spiral slit band a little above the mid-height. On each of the volutions the numerous and close-set striae of growth curve obliquely backward to the slit band above and forward to the suture, on those of the spire, or to the base of the outer volution, below.\n\n**Loxoplocus solutus**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 12, figs. 7 and 8.\n\n*Murchisonia soluta*, Whiteaves.......1884.

Weston, Boyle and Townsend, which show only one spiral keel on each volution. *M. tropidophora*, on the other hand, was described from an imperfect specimen with nearly the whole of the test preserved, and\nshewing the characters of the entire outer volution, which is encircled by three spiral keels. The aperture is circular and the outer lip slightly expanded.\n\nIn 1892, however, Mr. Townsend obtained natural moulds of the exterior of two shells (one at Elora and the other at Belwood), which have convinced the writer that the specimens upon which *M. soluta* and *M. tropidophora* were based, are merely different states of preservation of the same species. Fig. 7, on Plate 12, represents a wax impression of the mould from Elora, and fig. 8, on the same plate, a similar impression of the mould from Belwood. These show that, when the test is preserved, the spire is encircled by three spiral keels, two of which are placed comparatively close together, at the upper part of each volution, and the third at the base. On the outer volution of the type of *M. tropidophora* the basal carina ultimately becomes confluent with the upper or posterior margin of the lip, on the columellar side.\n\n**Euomphalus inornatus**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 13, fig. 1.\n\n*Trochonema inornatum*, Whiteaves. 1884.

The figure of this specimen, however, is not at all satisfactory, and the additional and much more correct illustration upon Plate 13 of the present part of this volume, is drawn from a cast of the interior of the shell, from Durham. In spite of its comparatively elevated spire, and narrow or perhaps closed umbilicus, the general shape and the insinuation of the growth lines on the shoulder of the outer volution, would seem to indicate that this shell is referable to *Euomphalus* rather than to *Trochonema*. It may prove to be merely an abnormal form of the species next to be considered.\n\n**Euomphalus Galtensis**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Euomphalus Galtensis*, Whiteaves ..........1884.

Townsend, 1878-84.\n\nProfessor Lindstr\u00f6m says \"that the genus Ecculiomphalus was originally based by Portlock upon two shells which are expressly stated to bear 'great resemblance to an unrolled Euomphalus.' Since then Ecculiomphalus has been made to include 'species of evolute Euomphali and likewise evolute Pleurotomariae. It must, consequently, Professor Lindstr\u00f6m thinks, 'be broken up and its species distributed in these genera.' In view of these remarks, Ecculiomphalus circinatus appears to the writer to be a sinistrally coiled evolute Euomphalus. Further, Professor Lindstr\u00f6m has shown\u2020 that in Euomphalus Gotlandicus the shell may be either involute with the whorls everywhere in contact, or evolute and loosely coiled, also that its volutions are coiled indifferently to the right or to the left. Hence it is not at all improbable that E. circinatus may prove to be merely an evolute sinistral variety of E. Galtensis, though at present no specimens with characters intermediate between these two forms have been seen by the writer.\n\nProfessor James Hall has applied the name Phanerotinus, Sowerby, to the uncoiled species of Euomphalus, but the type of the genus Phanerotinus, the Euomphalus cristatus of Phillips, is stated by that paleontologist to be provided with a \"large double dentated keel, continued to the inner whorls.\"\n\nLoxonema Boydii, Hall.\n\nLoxonema Boydii, Hall........1843.

Still in these the general shape of the shell, with its compressed convex but evenly rounded volutions, devoid of the slightest indication of a slit band, appears to the writer to be much more like that of a *Loxonema* than that of a *Murchisonia*. Moreover another species of *Loxonema* is now known to occur in the Guelph formation of the province. The largest specimen of *L. Boydii* known to the writer, when perfect, would probably have been about an inch and three-quarters in height or length. The apical angle of specimens from Ontario is 24\u00b0.\n\nThe genus *Loxonema* is included by Lindstr\u00f6m in the family of *Euomphalid\u00e6* of De Koninck on account of its insinuated growth lines like those of *Euomphalus*, its solid axis and earliest \"whorls filled with an organic deposit of homogeneous calcite,\" as in that genus. On the other hand, the late Dr. Paul Fischer* regarded these points of resemblance as of little importance, and placed *Loxonema* in the Pyramidellid\u00e6 and *Euomphalus* in the Solariid\u00e6.\n\n**Loxonema magnum**, Whitfield.

Surface markings unknown.\n\nGalt, Hespeler and Elora: the specimens referred to on page 17 of the first part of this volume as *Loxomena magnum*, Whitfield. They seem, however, never to have attained to so large a size as *L. magnum*, and their volutions are apparently much more convex proportionately than those of that species. The rate of increase of the volutions of the typical *L. magnum* is said to indicate a \"length of fully eight inches for the entire shell,\" but judging by the proportions of specimens from different localities in Ontario, their entire length could scarcely have been much more than five inches. Still, these supposed differences may be more apparent than real, and the writer is by no means convinced that the Ontario specimens are specifically distinct from *L. magnum*.\n\n*Manuel de Conchyliologie, &c., p. 715.*\nPyconomphalus solarioides, Hall.

Nicholson (op. cit.) says that P. solarioides is \"not uncommon in the Guelph formation of Hespeler, Guelph and Elora.\"\n\nIn the writer's judgment, figure 4a on plate 84 of the second volume of the Palaeontology of New York, which is stated to represent the base of a specimen of Pleurotomaria solarioides, represents rather the under side of an imperfect specimen of P. perlata. A number of specimens collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham, Elora and Belwood, which correspond perfectly with the other figure (fig. 4b) of P. solarioides on plate 84 of the volume referred to, have convinced the writer that this species is referable to Lindstr\u00f6m's genus Pyconomphalus.\n\nSome of these specimens are mere casts of the interior of the shell. In these the volutions are depressed somewhat obliquely above and regularly rounded beneath. The base appears to be widely and deeply umbilicated, and the inner volutions exposed up to the apex, as represented by fig. 5. Other specimens are casts of the interior, with the test preserved in the umbilical cavity and between the volutions. A section through the centre of one of these, transverse to the volutions, as shown in fig. 6, shows that the inner surface of the latter is encircled by a narrow and slightly recurved prominent spiral ridge, which projects to the centre, leaving open only a narrow spiral umbilical perforation. This spiral ridge was first observed by Mr. Lambe in a natural section of a specimen from Belwood. Besides these a few natural moulds of the exterior of the base of the shell, in a dolomitic limestone, have been collected. A gutta-percha impression of one of these moulds from Belwood (fig. 4) shows the characters of the lower half of the aperture, the heavy thickening of the inner or columellar lip, the contour of the exterior of the base, with its narrow umbilical perforation, and some indications of the growth lines around the umbilicus. The largest specimen of this species that the writer has seen (the original of fig. 4, on plate 13,) is fifty-one millimetres, or a little more than two inches in its maximum diameter.\nPolytropis, DeKoninck.\n\nIn a paper on the development of the gastropoda from the Cambrian to the Trias,* Professor E. Koken remarks that, in his view, the genus Oriostoma of Munier Chalmas includes very different things. The typical species of Oriostoma (or Horiosstoma, as the word is amended by Fischer) he thinks belong to the Capulidae, while the forms from the Upper Silurian described by Lindstr\u00f6m (excluding O. helicinum, O. dispar and O. nitidissimum) group themselves around the Euomphalus rugosus and E. discors of Sowerby, for which DeKoninck, in 1881, proposed the genus Polytropis. This latter genus is referred to the Turbinidae by Lindstr\u00f6m on account of the nacreous structure of its test and the peculiarities of its operculum. According to Koken, Polytropis, as understood by him, extends very far back in time, as it probably includes the \"Pleurotomaria (?) Calphurnia\" of Billings,\u2020 from the Quebec group of Newfoundland, which is, he says, nearly related to \"Oriostoma globosum.\"\n\nIn the \"Geology of Canada\" (1863, p. 444) Euomphalus rugosus, which would now be called Polytropis discors var. rugosus, is recorded as occurring in the Silurian (Upper Silurian) rocks of Port Daniel, in the Baie des Chaleurs, and the Pleurotomaria princessa of Billings,\u2021 from the Lower Helderberg rocks between Cape Gasp\u00e9 and Cape Rosier is also a Polytropis.\n\nSome of the depressed conical, solid, shelly opercula, with numerous narrow coils, that were formerly referred to Euomphalus by English authors, are now known to belong to species of this genus. Such opercula are not uncommon in the Guelph formation at Elora and Durham, and two of these are represented on Plates 3 and 7 of the first part of this volume. Five species of Polytropis are now known to occur in this formation in Canada, viz., P. sulcatus (= Cyclonema sulcatum, Hall); P. macrolineatus (= Euomphalus macrolineatus, Whitfield); P. crenulatus (= Straparollus crenulatus, Whiteaves); and two which were previously undescribed.\n\nPolytropis sulcatus, Hall.

Both of these have nearly the whole of the test preserved, and one of them has also a small portion of its operculum still remaining, almost *in situ*, but turned inside out. So much of this operculum is broken off that it is impossible to say whether it was originally solid or hollow inside, but there is enough left to show that it is calcareous, multi-spiral and not much elevated exteriorly.\n\nThe specimens collected at Belwood by Mr. Townsend and the writer, are sharply defined natural moulds of the exterior of four different shells, and gutta-percha impressions of these moulds, such as the one figured in Plate 13, together with the two testiferous examples from Elora, give the following new information about the species. A specimen of average size is about thirty millimetres in height, and twenty-five in maximum breadth. The volutions are five or six in number, rounded and ventricose, but depressed and flattened above in such a way as to form a shoulder with a narrow band between it and the suture. In the centre of the base of the outer volution there is a narrow but rather deep umbilical depression, but no portion of any of the inner volutions is exposed. The upper portion of each of the last three volutions is marked by a few spiral raised lines, and their central and lower portions are encircled by narrow ridges. Upon the lower half of the last volution of the spire of the specimen figured there are four spiral ridges, and upon the central and basal portions of the outer volution of another specimen, there are as many as ten or eleven spiral ridges, the three around the umbilical depression being more prominent and distant than any of the others. The volutions, also, are everywhere crossed by crowded and oblique minute raised lines.\nPolytropis macrolineatus, Whitfield. (Sp.)\n\nEuomphalus macrolineatus, Whitfield...1878. Ann. Rep. Geol.

Moreover, the periphery of P. Hoyi is described as \"somewhat flattened, with a depressed band truncating the upper angle,\" whereas that of the Durham specimens is regularly but rather narrowly rounded.\n\nPolytropis Durhamensis.

Volutions three in number, or possibly four if the apex were preserved, and encircled by narrow spiral ridges, which are everywhere crossed by numerous and crowded transverse striae. On the last volution there are five spiral ridges, one at the periphery, two on the apical and two on the basal side, but the two above the periphery are much more prominent and distinct than the two which surround the umbilicus.

The upper side of the specimen represented by fig. 1 on Plate 13 of the present paper is exactly similar to that of the specimen of *Oriostoma angulatum*, Wahlenberg (Sp.) figured by Lindstr\u00f6m on Plate 20, fig. 37, of his monograph, but in Wahlenberg's species the shell is planorbiform, with rounded periphery and an extremely wide and open umbilicus. *Straparollus Niagarensis*, Meek,* which is probably also a *Polytropis*, is described as having a discoidal shell, with rounded volutions and an umbilicus in which \"almost the entire diameter of the inner volution is exposed.\"\n\n**Polytropis parvulus.

As far as can be ascertained at present, the principal difference between these two forms seems to be that on the umbilical side of the Canadian shell there are at least five spiral ridges, which are closely disposed and not very prominent, whereas on that side of the shell in the Gotland species there are only two spiral ridges, which are large and distant.\n\n**Codonochilus striatus**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Codonochilus striatum*, Whiteaves..1884.

Fischer, in his \"Manuel de Conchyliologie,\" remarks that it is composed of incongruous material, and that it has been circumscribed by Salter and Lindstr\u00f6m so as to include some small shells apparently near to the Littorinidae. Four species of gasteropoda from the Guelph formation of Ontario have been referred to *Holopea*, but two of these, viz., *H.

This volume, pt. 1, p. 16, pls. 3, fig. 2, and 7, fig. 6.\n\nThis species was originally described from a single specimen collected at Durham, and there are now three other typical examples of it in the Museum of the Survey, one from Hespeler, one from Elora and one from Durham. Its principal characteristics are the slender, subfusiform contour of the shell, and the nearly cylindrical shape of the somewhat constricted outer volution, which is usually a little narrower than the one that immediately precedes it. The later volutions of the spire, too, are generally much broader than high.\n\nSubulites compactus? Var.\n\nPlate 14, figs. 4 and 5.\n\nSix specimens of a small Subulites, collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham and now in the Survey Museum, differ from the type of S. compactus in the following particulars. They are still more slender in shape, not most tumid at the mid-length, and the outer volution of each is scarcely contracted but gently convex, a little more so than the one which precedes it. The last volution of the spire and sometimes the last but one, are usually higher than broad. It is doubtful whether these specimens (two of which are figured) should be regarded as a mere variety of S. compactus, or as a distinct species.\n\nOpercula\n\nof unknown genera and species.\n\nA. Paucispiral opercula.\n\nPlate 14, fig. 6.\n\nA few paucispiral opercula, like those of recent species of Natica or Littorina, were collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham in 1884 and 1885.\nThese are described in some detail in a paper published in the Canadian Record of Science for December, 1891, and entitled \"Notes on the occurrence of Paucispiral Opercula of Gasteropoda in the Guelph formation of Ontario.\" As there stated, they are \"rather thin, nearly flat, but slightly concave externally and as slightly convex internally, broadly subovate, about one-fifth longer than broad, obtusely pointed at the end corresponding to the posterior angle of the mouth of the shell whose aperture they closed, paucispiral and composed of from two and a half to three rapidly expanding volutions, the nucleus being eccentric.\"* \"Only the outer or concave surface of each of those opercula is exposed to view, the inner side being buried in the matrix.\" Figure 6 on Plate 14 represents the exterior of the largest and most perfect specimen known to the writer, of natural size. Its maximum length is twenty millimetres, and its greatest breadth sixteen. It is so highly dolomitized that it is difficult to estimate its exact thickness, but at the distance of a millimetre from the edge, at the somewhat truncated termination of the outer volution, its thickness is between one-half and three-quarters of a millimetre, though it seems to increase rapidly inward.\n\nThese opercula would seem to have belonged to shells that are referable either to the Naticidae or to the Littorinidae. At present there is no satisfactory evidence that the Naticidae dated as far back in time as the Palaeozoic era, but the Littorinidae are said to be represented in the Silurian period by numerous species of Holopea. It has previously been shown that four nominal species of Holopea have been described from the Guelph formation in Canada, but the generic relations of H. Guelpensis are still very obscure, and it is most probable that H. occidentalis is a Polytropis\n\nB. Supposed multisprial opercula.\n\nPlate 15, figs. 4, 5, 5 a and 6.\n\nSeveral specimens of an organism, which may be the operculum of some gasteropod, were collected at Elora and Durham by Messrs. Boyle and Townsend between the years 1878 and 1892. The most perfect of these organisms, such as the specimen represented by figure 4 on Plate 15, are elongate conical, nearly three times as long as broad and truncated at the larger end. Their internal structure, as shown in natural or artificial longitudinal sections, like that represented three times the natural size and somewhat diagrammatically by figure 6 on the same Plate, is very singular. It consists of an extremely elongated, slender, multispiral calcareous and solid central axis (\u03b1), which is everywhere surrounded by a second and correspondingly slender, solid and tightly enveloping calca-\n\n*Rather than \"subcentral,\" as stated in the paper referred to.\nreous coil composed of from twenty to thirty sinistral volutions, in close contact (b), and this in its turn is enveloped in a thin calcareous outer layer or sheath (c). The volutions of the outer of these two shelly coils are flattened from back to front and narrow at the edges, so that in specimens such as the originals of figs. 5 and 5a, in which the thin outer coating is not preserved, as is usually the case, it is only the outer edges of the volutions that are visible. At the larger end, the outer layer or sheath, when preserved, seems to project very slightly beyond the outer shelly coil and to form a raised rim around it, but in those specimens in which the outer layer is not preserved, the last volution of the outer coil appears to extend a little beyond the central axis, and to be ultimately truncated rectangularly, thus giving the appearance of a comparatively broad depression in the centre of the larger end, as represented by figure 5a.\n\nCEPHALOPODA.\n\nOrthoceras Selwyni, Billings.\n\nOrthoceras Selwini, Billings. 1862.

Cadmus from Elora referred to on page 38 of the first part of the present volume, is a fragment of a longitudinally ribbed and fluted Orthoceras, not quite an inch and a half in its maximum length. Although identified with O. Cadmus by E. Billings himself, it is difficult to see how this fragment can be satisfactorily distinguished from the O. Darwini, Billings, of the Guelph formation, as that species is now understood, or from the O. bellatulum, Billings, from the Anticosti group of Anticosti.\n\nA much more perfect specimen, which agrees perfectly with Hall's figures of O. angulatum, on Plate 19 of both editions of the Twentieth Regent's Report, was collected by Mr. Thomas G. Connon at the Irvine River, Elora, in 1887. This specimen, which has recently been presented to the Museum of the Survey by Mr. Connon, consists of a piece of the septate portion of the shell about five inches in length, and a\nportion of the body chamber about an inch and a half long, but there is a piece missing between them, which, from the rate of tapering, is estimated at nearly two inches in length. Allowing two inches for the missing piece, the specimen, which even then is imperfect at both ends, could scarcely have been much less than eight inches and a half long. It has a considerable portion of the test preserved, especially at the smaller end, and the position of the siphuncle is clearly seen in two nearly transverse fractures. The surface markings consist of narrow and continuous longitudinal ridges, separated by rather wide intervals, and by numerous transverse raised lines between the ridges. The siphuncle is very nearly central.\n\nIn the Twentieth Regent's Report, Hall says that his *O. angulatum* \"is probably the species described by Mr. McChesney, in a paper published in 1861, under the names *O. Scammoni*, *O. Hoyii*, *O. lineolatum*, *O. irregulare*, *O. Woodworthi*. The last one figured is a fragment less than an inch in length. A gutta-percha cast sent by Prof. Winchell under the name *O. Scammoni*, corresponds very well with specimens referred by me to *O. angulatum*. Should the species prove distinct from the European one, we may select a name from among those above cited.\"\n\nIn a foot note to page 412 of the revised edition of that Report, he says also, in effect, that *O. angulatum*, Hall, *O. columnare*, Hall, *O. Scammoni*, McChesney, and *O. Cadmus*, Billings, are all probably the same species, and in the explanation of one of the figures of *O. angulatum*, in the same Report, it is stated that the character of its surface \"is precisely like that of *O. cancellatum*, Hall, from the Niagara group of New York, and differs in no essential particular from the minute surface markings of *O. columnare*.\"\n\nAt different times no less than ten names have been given to this species, but, of these, *O. Scammoni*, McChesney, is here provisionally retained on the ground that it appears to be the first that is not pre-occupied. Mr. Foord's figures of English and Swedish specimens of *O. angulatum*, Wahlenberg, on page 71 of the first part of his catalogue of the Fossil Cephalopoda of the British Museum, represent shells that are distinctly curved, with sub marginal siphuncles, but his description of *O. canaliculatum*, Sowerby, applies remarkably well to the large Elora specimen here referred to *O. Scammoni*.\n\n**Orthoceras Darwini**, Billings.\n\n*Orthoceras Darwini*, Billings...........1862. Geol. Surv. Canada, Pal. Foss., vol. I., p. 161.\n\n*Cyrtoceras Myrice*, Hall and Whitfield...1875.

Billings in 1857 at Hespeler (then called New Hope), referred to on page 38 of the first part of the present volume and figured on Plate 6. Two additional specimens, both undistorted and well preserved casts of the interior of the shell, were collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham between the years 1878 and 1882, and one of these is figured on Plate 6 of the first part of the present volume under the name Cyrtoceras Myrice. This latter specimen is remarkably similar to Professor Blake's figure (Plate 7, fig. 1) of O. angulatum in the first part of his \"British Fossil Cephalopoda,\" which Mr. Foord says represents O. virgatum, Sowerby. It seems to the writer that there is very little difference between O. Darwini, Billings, O. bellatulum, Billings, and O. virgatum, Sowerby. In the Museum of the Survey there is a small well preserved fragment of an Orthoceras, collected by Dr. R. Bell in 1862 from the Silurian (Upper Silurian) rocks at L'Anse \u00e0 la Vieille, in the Baie des Chaleurs, which was identified with O. virgatum, Sowerby, by E. Billings. The surface ornamentation of this specimen consists of very narrow longitudinal ridges, with extremely fine, numerous and equidistant, transverse raised lines in the rather wide spaces between them, thus producing a cancellated appearance when the specimen is placed in a favourable light.\n\nOrthoceras annulatum, var.

These consist of transverse elevations, partaking more of the nature of undulations than of ribs, and becoming in some places indistinct or even obliterated. The undulations are generally wider than the spaces separating them, being at a distance of about one-sixth the diameter. The fimbriae are coarse, as in the variety crassum, but with their arches or festoons much wider apart. Three or four only occupy the spaces between the undulations. The longitudinal elevations are sometimes so strong as to cause a nodose appearance; but this is not always the case, as I have a specimen before me in which they are very obscure.

This specimen, which is the type of the species, but which has not previously been figured, is represented on Plate 14. In the original description of *C. Orodes* no mention is made of the siphuncle, but it is evidently exogastric and situated close to the margin of the venter.\n\nTwo specimens, which agree with the type of this species in general form, also, very nearly, as far as known, in the relative position of the siphuncle, were collected by Mr. Townsend at Durham between the years 1878 and 1882. One of these, the original of fig. 8, on Plate 14, is a well preserved but slightly distorted specimen of the septate portion of the shell, about three inches in maximum length, and with the test preserved. The surface is nearly smooth, and marked only with very fine and closely disposed transverse stri\u00e6 and a few more distant and a little\ncoarser ones. This specimen was carefully ground down on the ventral side in such a way as to give a longitudinal section through the centre of the siphuncle and to show the edges of 22 septa, as represented in fig. 8a. These septa are about one millimetre apart at the smaller end, and four millimetres at the larger. Between the septa the siphuncle is not enlarged. The other specimen from Durham (fig. 9), which is a little over two inches and a half in its maximum length, consists of the greater part of the body chamber and the posterior half of the septate portion of the shell, both almost completely covered with the test. The venter and dorsum are very slightly compressed, and each of the beautifully preserved transverse striae upon the test forms a very faint hyponomic sinus on the median line of the venter.\n\nIn 1890 Mr. Townsend obtained at Elora a large but not very well preserved specimen, nearly four inches and a-half in length, which is also believed to be referable to *C. Orodes*. It is somewhat compressed on the venter and dorsum, and its siphuncle is apparently exogastric and almost marginal. It is very similar, in general outline, to large specimens of *Oncoceras Petitii*, Billings,* from the Niagara limestone at the North Gore, Grimsby, Ontario, but the siphuncle of the latter is inflated between the septa.\n\n**Phragmoceras Hector**, Billings.\n\n*Phragmoceras Hector*, Billings .1862.

Zittel, on the other hand, in the second volume of his \"Handbuch der Palaeontologie,\" places *Gomphoceras* in the family Orthoceratidae and *Phragmoceras* in the Cyrtoceratidae. Fischer, in his Manuel de Conchylologie (1883) regards the two genera as distinct and places both in the Nautilidae. The characters which have so long been used to distinguish *Phragmoceras* from *Gomphoceras* appear to the writer to be still valid and of more structural and systematic importance than the modifications of the aperture upon which Hyatt's six genera are based.\n\n---\n\n*Catalogue of the Silurian Fossils of the Island of Anticosti*, p. 86.\n\n\u2020Proceedings of the Boston Soc.

Murray in 1847, and one by E. Billings in 1857, which were labelled with the name of this species by E. Billings, many years ago. These are evidently the specimens of C. Blumenbachii referred to on page 340 of the Geology of Canada. Two of them are coarse casts of the interior of the head and thorax, and one a similar cast of the thorax and pygidium.\n\nMr. Billings was of the opinion that C. senaria, Conrad, C. Niagarensis, Hall, and C. platys, Green, are synonymous with C. Blumenbachii, but Salter, in his Monograph of the British Trilobites, retains C. senaria as a distinct subspecies, although he places C. Niagarensis, Hall, among the synonyms of C. Blumenbachii. Exclusive of the trilobites from the Trenton and Hudson River formations which are generally referred to C. senaria, there are in the Museum of the Survey, specimens labelled C. Blumenbachii by E. Billings, from the Niagara limestone at Limehouse, Ontario; from the Anticosti group at six different localities on the island of Anticosti; from the Lower Helderberg rocks at Cap Bon Ami, near Dalhousie, New Brunswick; and from the Silurian (Upper Silurian) rocks at Arisaig, Nova Scotia. In the \"Geology of Canada\" (1863), C. Blumenbachii is recorded as occurring also in the Clinton formation at Flamborough West, near Dundas, Ontario; in the Niagara limestone at Thorold and Flamborough West; and in the limestones of the Anticosti Group at the Chatte River in the province of Quebec.\n\nAccording to Lindstr\u00f6m* this species was first described by Brunn in 1781 under the name Trilobites tuberculatus, and hence should be called Calymene tuberculata (Brunn), as it is by Friedrich Schmidt \u2020 and some other recent writers upon European palaeontology.\n\nCeraurus Niagarensis.

Systematic list, with references, of the fossils of the Hudson River or Cincinnati formation at Stony Mountain, Manitoba.\n\nBY J. F. WHITEAVES.\n\nIn a letter written by Sir James Hector, dated Fort Carlton, December 14th, 1857, and published in the official report of Captain Palliser's Exploring Expedition,* the following passage occurs:\u2014\"At Stony Hill, about fifteen miles north-west from the Upper Fort, there is an isolated bluff of limestone, rising from the plain level to the height of eighty feet. The south and western exposures are abrupt and water worn, it having been at one time an island; and indeed, during the great floods which several times inundated the settlement, it has been one of the few spots upon which the inhabitants can take refuge, reaching it by means of boats. The beds of limestone are horizontal or nearly so, and are slightly different from those at Fort Garry in their mineral aspect, having a more crystalline fracture and the colour being of a reddish hue. No fossils can be discovered in newly fractured portions, but on the weathered surfaces a few obscure remains of fossils are to be seen projecting along with siliceous and gritty particles from a dull floury surface.\"\n\nOn the occasion of a short visit to this locality (now more generally known as Stony Mountain) in 1875, Dr. R. W. Ells noticed that pieces of limestone and shale thrown out while excavating for the foundation of the provincial penitentiary then in course of construction there, were full of fossils in a remarkably fine state of preservation, and made as large a collection of them as the time at his disposal would admit. Lists of most of the species represented in this collection and in one made at the same place by Dr. R. Bell in 1879, were contributed by the writer to the Report of Progress of this Survey for 1878-79 (pp. 49 and 50C), published in 1880, and it was there stated that \"a large portion of the mass of Stony Mountain consists of limestones, with clayey partings, which are identical, both in their lithological and palaeontological characters, with the well known\n\n* Papers relative to the Explorations by Captain Palliser of that portion of British North America which lies between the north branch of the River Saskatchewan and the frontier of the United States, and between the Red River and the Rocky Mountains. London, 1859, page 21.\nrocks of the Hudson River or Cincinnati group of southern Ohio and elsewhere.\" At the summit of the mountain these limestones pass into rich cream coloured, yellow or greyish white dolomites, but, as the writer had then seen no fossils from the latter, no opinion was expressed as to their age. A collection of the fossils of this locality, made by Mr. T. C. Weston in 1884, consists of about twelve species from these dolomites, which it will be convenient to distinguish as the upper beds, and of an unusually large number of those of the immediately underlying impure limestones or lower beds. This collection and a small series of fossils from the upper beds, obtained by Mr. Tyrrell in 1888, show that the fauna of the upper beds, and hence that of the whole of the rocks at Stony Mountain, are probably referable to the Hudson River or Cincinnati formation, which has not yet been definitely recognized at any other locality in Manitoba.\n\nThe Polyzoa and Ostracoda contained in Dr. Ells's and Mr. Weston's collections have been identified or described by Mr. E. O. Ulrich in the second part of the \"Contributions to the Micro-Palaeontology of the Cambro-Silurian rocks of Canada,\" published by this Survey in 1889, but no complete list of the fossils from Stony Mountain has yet been prepared. The present paper is an attempt to supply this deficiency, and consists of a systematic list of all the species from that locality which are now represented in the Museum of the Survey. As many of these fossils are common and well known species, it is not thought desirable to give an exhaustive list of synonyms of each, but only such references as are likely to be useful to students of Canadian geology.\n\nALG\u00c6.\n\nBythotrephis (like B succulens, Hall).\n\nCfr.

The Fossils of the Galena-Trenton and Black River formations of Lake Winnipeg and its vicinity.\n\nBY J. F. WHITEAVES.\n\nThe existence of highly fossiliferous limestones on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg and in the Red River valley north of the United States boundary line has long been known to geologists.\n\nOn Lake Winnipeg these limestones appear to have been first observed north of the Saskatchewan, in 1819, by Sir John Richardson, when accompanying the members of the first Franklin expedition, as naturalist, on their journey to the polar sea.\n\nIn the early part of the \"Narrative\" of this expedition, it is stated that the party entered Lake Winnipeg, from Norway House, on the night of the seventh of October, 1819, that they spent some time in examining the north and part of the north-west shores of the lake on the eighth and on the morning of the ninth of October of that year, that they sailed for the Saskatchewan at two p.m. on the ninth of October, and reached the mouth of that river, preparatory to its ascent, on the midnight following.\n\nIn another publication,* Richardson says that the strata at the First and Second Rocky Points on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg, north of the Saskatchewan, \"contain many gigantic Orthoceratites, some of which have been described by Mr. Stokes in the Geological Transactions.\" These Orthoceratites, therefore, would seem to have been collected upon the eighth or ninth of October, 1819, though Dr. Fitton, in an appendix to the narrative of Captain Back's Arctic Land Expedition, says that they were collected in 1820.\n\nHowever this may be, in an Appendix to the Narrative of Franklin's first expedition, Richardson says that cliffs of bluish and yellowish grey limestone \"appear on the west side of Limestone Bay, and continue to bound the lake as far as the mouth of the Saskatchewan, and, as we have\n\n*Journal of a Boat Voyage through Rupert's Land to the Arctic Sea, vol. I. (London, 1851), p. 65.\nbeen informed, down the whole of its western shore.\u201d This limestone, he adds, \u201cwhich extends over a vast tract of country, probably belongs to the great series of limestone formations under the green sand and above the new red sandstone.\u201d In another part* of this Appendix, he states that Professor Jameson, who had been requested to \u201cexamine the specimens of limestone collected on the shores of Lake Winnipeg and in the Cumberland House district, obligingly sent the following note:\u2014The specimens of limestone received from you contain examples of the following fossil organic remains:\n\n1. Limestone with encrinites. The encrinites are in fragments.\n2. Limestone with orthoceratites.\n3. Limestone with terebratulae.\n4. Limestone with caryophyllites.\n5. Limestone with lingulae.\n\nThese fossils would seem to intimate that the rocks in which they are contained belong to the Mountain limestone formation, by many referred to the transition, by others to the oldest or deepest part of the secondary class of rocks.\u201d\n\nOn Franklin\u2019s second expedition to the shores of the polar sea, in 1825-27, which Richardson also accompanied as naturalist, the party proceeded via Fort William, the Lake of the Woods, Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan, and touched at Dog Head, Stony Point, Cat Head, Broken Canoe Point, Wicked Point, Egg Island and Long Point, in 1825, before reaching the Saskatchewan. Richardson\u2019s Appendix (Appendix No. 1) to the narrative of this expedition contains a very full and graphic description of the \u201cLimestone of Lake Winipeg.\u201d The fossils obtained during this expedition are there stated to have been examined by Mr. Stokes and Mr. James de Carle Sowerby, \u201cwho found amongst them terebratulites, spirifers, maclurites and corallines,\u201d but it is nowhere stated where these fossils were collected. The Maclurites is said to belong \u201cto the same species with specimens from Lakes Erie and Huron and also from Igloolik,\u201d and to be \u201cperhaps referable to the Maclurea magna of Lesueur.\u201d Mr. Sowerby, also, is said to have determined a shell, which occurs \u201cin great abundance in the strata at Cumberland House, about 120 miles to the westward of Lake Winnipeg, to be the Pentamerus Aylesfordii.\u201d\n\nIn the early part of Captain Back\u2019s Arctic Land Expedition to the mouth of Great Fish River, the party which he commanded entered Lake Winnipeg from Norway House, in 1833, and left by the Saskatchewan, as Franklin\u2019s party had done in 1819. Dr. Fitton, in Appendix\n\n* In a foot note to page 506, which was omitted in its proper place and printed on the last page of the volume.\nNo. 4 to the \"Narrative\" of this expedition, gives a general description of some \"Orthocerata of a peculiar kind\" collected near the First and Second Rocky Points on the north-west shore of Lake Winnipeg, where similar specimens had previously been collected by Richardson, and says that from this locality \"there is also one specimen, which, though not in good preservation, is doubtless a Catenipora, or chain coral, a genus characteristic of the older transition limestones, in which beds also Orthocerata are common.\"\n\nUp to the year 1851, the limestones of Lake Winnipeg were regarded, at least by some geologists, as of Carboniferous age, for Edwards & Haime, in their \"Monographie des Polypiers Fossiles des Terrains Pal\u00e9ozoiques,\" published in that year, described and figured a fossil coral from Lake Winnipeg as a Carboniferous species, under the name Lithostrotion Stokesi. But, in the first volume of the Journal of a Boat Voyage through Rupert's Land to the Arctic Sea, published also in 1851, Richardson states that the whole of the coast on the north-west side of Lake Winnipeg is occupied by the Black River limestone. No reasons are given for this statement, but a little further on in the same volume the occurrence of a species of Receptaculites, supposed by Dr. S. P. Woodward to be closely related to the R. Neptuni of Defrance, and of large Orthocerata at Pine Island Lake, are said to point to the existence of the Birdseye and Trenton limestones in that neighbourhood. The Receptaculites of the Winnipeg limestones, which Etheridge subsequently identified with R. occidentalis, Salter, in Palliser's Report and in Sir James Hector's paper \"On the Geology of the Country between Lake Superior and the Pacific Ocean,\"* is now known to be, not that species, but the R. Oweni, Hall, of the Galena limestone.\n\nDuring the Canadian exploring expedition to the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan, in 1858, in charge of Professor Henry Youle Hind, the party made a geological survey of the west coast of Lake Winnipeg from Deer Island to Cat Head. They examined the rock exposures at Deer Island, Grindstone Point, Punk Island, Limestone Cave Point, and Cat Head, and collected a few fossils at each of these localities. In the official Report upon this expedition, published at Toronto in 1859, it is stated that \"the formations which have been recognized on Lake Winnipeg and in the valley of Red River are the Chazy, Bird's-eye and Trenton formations and the Hudson River group.\" \"Fine exposures of the Chazy formation\" are said \"to occur on Punk Island and along the west coast north of Big Grindstone Point as far as the Cat Head;\" Sir John Richardson is quoted as the authority for the statement that the whole of the\n\n*Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. XVIII., p. 425, London, April, 1861.\ncoast on the north-west side is occupied by the Black River and Trenton limestones; and the Hudson River group is said to appear in cliffs twenty feet high at the Stone Fort (now called Lower Fort Garry) on the Red River and near the rapids.\n\nThe fossils collected by Professor Hind and Mr. Fleming from the limestones and sandstones of Lake Winnipeg, as identified or described by E. Billings in this Report, are as follows:\u2014From Punk Island, two species of fucoids \"resembling forms which occur in the Chazy limestone\"; \"columns of a large Glyptocrinus allied to G. ramulosus\"; \"two specimens of a plaited Rhynchonella a little smaller than R. plena\"; a new species of Modiolopsis described under the name M. parviuscula, but not figured; a Pleurotomaria \"allied to P. rotuloides, Hall\"; \"a Maclurea allied to M. Logani, Salter, but with more slender whorls,\" and a small Serpulites \"which much resembles the large species from the Chazy limestone.\" From Grindstone Point, a coral \"allied to Columnaria alveolata\"; columns of a large Glyptocrinus, the same as those from Punk Island; and plates of a Glyptocystites \"closely allied to G. multiporus.\" From Cat Head, a new species of Orthoceras, described and figured under the name O. Simponsi. From Limestone Point (now known as Clark's Point) about eleven miles north of the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan, Trochonema umbilicatum (Hall), and a Maclurea like that from Punk Island. According to Mr. Billings, the occurrence of Modiolopsis parviuscula, Trochonema umbilicatum, the Maclurea and Glyptocystites \"are quite sufficient to show that the localities where they have been collected are Lower Silurian, and most probably about the age of the Black River and Chazy limestones.\" Fortunately, most of these fossils are still preserved in the Museum of this Survey.\n\nThe occurrence of limestone \"in situ\" in the Red River valley, at or near the locality now known as Lower Fort Garry, was noticed by Major Long in 1823, during his expedition to the source of the St. Peter's River. Keating, in the second volume (page 75) of his narrative of that expedition, published two years later, says of this limestone that it is a \"horizontal secondary rock, such as probably lies under these prairies.\" \"We observed,\" he adds, \"in the limestone no organic remains, although it probably contains some.\"\n\nThe fossiliferous character of these limestones seems to have been first discovered by D. Dale Owen in July, 1848, for in chapter 4, pages 180 and 181 of his Report of a Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota, published at Philadelphia in 1852, the following passage occurs: \"About twenty miles below the mouth of the Assiniboine, near Lower Fort Garry, solid ledges of limestone are exposed, of a light buff colour, sometimes mottled, spotted or banded with light brown. Imme-\ndiately opposite the Fort, a considerable amount of rock has been quar-\nried and used in the construction of the building. In these beds I\nsucceeded in finding several well-defined and characteristic fossils,\nsufficient to establish without the least doubt, the age of the Red River\nlimestones. They are, *Favosites basaltica*; *Coscinopora sulcata*; hemi-\nspherical masses of *Syringopora*; a *Conularia*; a small, beautiful, unde-\ntermined species of *Pleurorhynchus*, *Ornoceras Brongniartii*; *Pleuroto-\nmaria lenticularis* (?); *Leptena alternata*. *Leptena plano-convexa* (?);\n*Calymene senaria*; and several specimens of the shield of *Illenus crass-\nicauda*. Many of these are identically the same fossils which occur in the\nlower part of F. 3, in Wisconsin and Iowa, in the blue limestones of\nIndiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, and also in the Lower Silurian\nof Europe. The *Coscinopora* is precisely the same as the coral which is\nparticularly characteristic of the lower beds of the Upper Magnesian\nlimestone of Wisconsin. The specimens of *Favosites basaltica* cannot be\ndistinguished from those which abound in the Upper Magnesian limestones\nof Wisconsin and Iowa, and the Lower Coralline beds of the Falls of the\nOhio. It is also worthy of note that these limestones of Red River,\nlike their equivalents in Iowa and Wisconsin, are highly magnesian, con-\ntaining from seventeen to forty per cent of the carbonate of that alkaline\nearth.\" In an appendix to this Report, two new species of fossil mol-\nlusca, viz., *Pleurotomaria muralis* and *Pleurorhynchus antiqua*, are either\ndescribed and figured, or merely figured. The first of these is said to\noccur in the Upper Magnesian limestone (F. 3) though, in a subsequent\ntabular list of fossils, it is referred, perhaps inadvertently, to the Lower\nMagnesian limestone or Calciferous (F. 2). In this tabular list the Upper\nMagnesian limestone (F. 3) is subdivided into F. 3 A (the Trenton), F. 3 B\n(the Galena, Utica and Hudson River group), and F. 3 C (the Coralline\nand Pentamerus beds, the Clinton and Niagara.) Of the other fossils\nfrom Lower Fort Garry, in this list, two (and one, \"Orthoceras verte-\nbrale,\" with a query) are referred to F. 3A; four to F. 3B; and one\n(*Coscinopora sulcata*) to the horizon of the Niagara limestone in F. 3 C.\n\nThe official Report of Captain Palliser's Explorations in British North\nAmerica in 1857-60 contains the following list* of the fossils collected at\nLower Fort Garry by Sir James Hector, apparently in July, 1857, and\ndetermined by Mr. Salter.\n\n\"Magnesian Limestone, Lower Fort Garry.\n\nCyathophyllum. Strophomena euglypha.\nColumnaria alveolata, Hall. Orthis biforata, var. lynx.\nOrnoceras Lyoni, Stokes. Spirifer elegantula.\nFavistella. (*Favosites basaltica*, Owen.) Maclurea.\nReceptaculites occidentalis, Salter. Rhynehonella increbescens, Hall.\nStrophomena plano-convexa.\n\n* With the typographical errors corrected\nA similar list, but with the name of *Strophomena euglypha* omitted, is contained in Sir James Hector's paper \"On the Geology of the Country between Lake Superior and the Pacific Ocean,\" &c., published in 1861, in the seventeenth volume of the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London.\n\nThe geology of Lake Winnipeg and its immediate vicinity has been studied in detail by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell and Mr. D. B. Dowling, of this Survey, in 1889, 1890 and 1891. Preliminary accounts of the progress of these investigations have been published in the Summary Reports of the Survey for those years and a joint report upon the work of these three seasons is now being prepared. Mr. Tyrrell's conclusions as to the sequence and correlation of the palaeozoic rocks of this region, form an introduction to a paper entitled \"Three Deep Wells in Manitoba,\" published in the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada. In this introduction, all the limestones of the Red River valley in Manitoba (except those at Stonewall, which, it is stated, may belong to the Niagara limestone, and those at Stony Mountain, which are clearly referable to the Hudson River group), and of the western side of Lake Winnipeg are referred to the Trenton formation, and the sandstones of Punk and Deer Islands, Grindstone Point, etc., to the Chazy (St. Peter's) formation. In this connection, however, it may be remarked that, so far, no fossils of any kind have yet been detected in the sandstones which are supposed to be referable to the Chazy (St. Peter's) formation, except at their summit, in passage beds which probably represent the Birdseye and Black River limestones. As elsewhere stated,* \"there is, at present, no satisfactory palaeontological evidence for the existence of the Chazy formation, or its equivalent, in Manitoba,\" or the immediate neighbourhood of Lake Winnipeg. In a paper published in the \"Ottawa Naturalist\" for June, 1895, Mr. Dowling subdivides the Winnipeg and Red River limestones, in descending order, into the \"Upper Mottled limestones,\" the \"Cat Head limestones,\" and the \"Lower Mottled limestones,\" and calls the sandstones of Punk and Deer islands, etc., the \"Winnipeg sandstones.\"\n\nThe occurrence of rocks of presumably the same age as the Winnipeg limestones at several localities on the Nelson River, Keewatin, had previously been recorded by Dr. Bell in the Report of Progress of this Survey for 1878-79. Rocks containing similar fossils were discovered by Mr. Tyrrell near Doobaunt Lake, in latitude 62\u00b0 44', and longitude 100\u00b0, in 1893; at Sturgeon Lake, north-east of Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan River, and at Fort Churchill, on the west side of Hudson's Bay, in 1894, as noted by him in the Summary Report of this Survey for\n\n*Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1889, vol. VIII., sect. 4, p. 83.\n1895; and at Minago and Wekusko lakes, in the District of Saskatchewan, in 1896.\n\nSomewhat extensive collections of the fossils of the limestones and sandstones of Lake Winnipeg and the Red River valley were made by Dr. R. Bell in 1879 and 1880, by T. C. Weston in 1884, by J. B. Tyrrell in 1889 and 1890, by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890, and by D. B. Dowling in 1890 and 1891. The authorities of the United States National Museum at Washington have kindly lent to the writer, for examination and comparison, all the fossils from the limestones of the Red River valley in their collection, and several fossils of much interest collected at East Selkirk and Lower Fort Garry by A. McCharles in 1884, were presented by him to the Museum of the Survey. The fossils collected by Dr. Bell from the Winnipeg limestones have been reported upon, provisionally, by the writer, in the Reports of Progress of this Survey for 1878-79 and 1879-80, and, since then, papers descriptive of some of the most remarkable species in these collections have been published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1889 and 1891, and in the Canadian Record of Science for July, 1895.\n\nThe last part of this volume contains a systematic list of all the fossils from the Hudson River formation at Stony Mountain that are represented in the Museum of the Survey. In the present paper it is intended to supplement this list with a similar one, as complete as possible, and with descriptions and illustrations of such species as may seem to be new, of the fossils of all the Cambro-Silurian rocks in the Lake Winnipeg district, that are believed to be older than the Hudson River formation, with the exception of a small but interesting series of Stromatoporoids, which has yet to be studied. Most of the specimens are from limestones which most probably represent the whole of the Utica and Trenton formations, inclusive of the Galena, though they hold several fossils elsewhere supposed to be restricted to the Hudson River group, but some are from the few feet of passage beds already referred to, which are presumed to represent the Birdseye and Black River limestone, immediately beneath the limestones and at the summit of the sandstones. It is thought desirable to consider the fossils of these limestones separately from those of the transition beds, and to commence with the former. The state of preservation of most of the fossils from these limestones is, however, by no means favourable to their accurate specific or generic determination. Most of the brachiopoda have no portion of the hinge area of either valve preserved, and nearly all of the mollusca and crustacea are represented by mere casts of the interior of the shell or crust.\n\nOne of the most striking features in the fossils of the Winnipeg and Red River limestones is the large size to which many of the specimens\nattain, though this is more particularly the case with the Cephalopoda. Thus, one of the Receptaculitidae (*Receptaculites Oweni*), which is abundant in these limestones, is known to attain to a size of twelve or even twenty inches in diameter. Some specimens of a simple Cyathophyloid coral (*Streptelasma robustum*) from Lower Fort Garry are nearly seven inches in length, as measured along the convex curve, and nearly five inches in height. A brachiopod from the same locality (*Rafinesquina lata*) is rather more than three inches in length at the hinge line, and a specimen of *Strophomena incurvata* from East Selkirk is fully double the usual size of that species. One of the gasteropods (*Maclurea Manitobensis*) of these limestones is sometimes as much as eight inches and a half in diameter, and another (the *Hormotoma Winnipegensis* of this Report) is eight inches long. The \"gigantic Orthoceratites\" noticed by Sir John Richardson on the west side of Lake Winnipeg, have already been referred to, but these are from localities north of the Saskatchewan. South of that river, at Dog Head, specimens of Orthoceratites (probably of *Endoceras subannulatum*), four feet and a half or even six feet in length, and imperfect at both ends, were observed by Mr. Lambe in 1890. A siphuncle of *Endoceras crassisiphonatum*, which is also imperfect at both ends, is nearly three feet long. A specimen, which appears to be a cast of the anterior end of the body chamber of a specimen of a *Poterioceras* (probably *P. nobile*), recently collected by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe at Berens Island, and showing the infolding of the lip, is seven inches across. Rough casts of the interior of spirally coiled discoidal or nearly discoidal shells, apparently allied to *Barrandoceras*, from several localities on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg, are nearly or quite two feet across. Lastly, a free cheek of a trilobite, *Asaphus (Iosotelus) gigas*, from Cat Head, indicates a specimen that must have been twenty inches in length when alive; and other similar examples could be given.\n\nThe writer is much indebted to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, of the Geological Survey of Minnesota, for valuable information in regard to the polyzoa, pelecypoda and some of the gasteropoda that are enumerated or described in this report; to Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the United States National Museum, for assistance in the determination of some critical species or peculiarly preserved specimens of Strophomenidae; to Professor T. Rupert Jones for the description and drawings of *Aparchites parvulus*; and to the proprietors of \"Palaeontographica\" for permission to reproduce the figures of *Aulocopina Winnipegensis* in that publication.\nLIST OF SPECIES.\n\nA.\u2014From the limestones.\n\nALG\u00c6.\n\nChondrites (Bythotrophis) patulus.\n\nChondrites patulus, Whiteaves ............1896 (Jan. 17th).

Natural size.\n*Thallus frondose, continuous, spreading widely in the same plane, and consisting, as now preserved, of a thin, uniformly flat expansion, devoid of midrib or veins, which is doubly deeply and widely trifurcate, with the secondary divisions again once or twice cleft at their summits; the undivided and partially divided portions narrow below, widening above and widest at the commencement of each division, averaging from three to four millimetres in breadth in the narrowest places, and from fourteen to fifteen mm. in the widest. Base of attachment unknown; minute structure not preserved.\n\nInmost or Birch Island, Kinwow Bay, Lake Winnipeg, T. C. Weston, 1884: four good specimens, consisting of well defined, rather dark brown, ferruginous impressions upon pieces of pale buff-coloured limestones, and seven similar but very imperfect ones.\n\nIn the present state of our knowledge, it would seem that *Bythotrephis*, (Hall)\u2020 can scarcely be satisfactorily distinguished from *Chondrites* (Sternberg). Goeppert,\u2021 though he retains the name *Bythotrephis* for *B. flexuosa* and *B. succulenta*, as described and figured by Hall, is careful to state that he does so provisionally, on account of the absence of satisfactory evidence on this point, and says that the only difference between *Bythotrephis* and *Chondrites* is the flatter habit of the thallus of the former, a character which, he adds, is not always seen in Hall's figures of species of *Bythotrephis*. Geinitz and Liebe\u00a7 say that no essential difference can be recognized between the two genera, and claim that Goeppert also is of the same opinion.\n\n---\n\n\u2020 Originally spelled *Buthotrephis*.\n\n\u2021 Ueber die Fossile Flora der Silurischen, der Devonischen und Unteren Kohlenformation oder des Sogenannten Uebergangsgebirges, 1859, p. 452.\n\n\u00a7 Ueber ein \u00c6quivalent der Takonischen Schiefer Nordamerika's in Deutschland, &c., p. 18.\n\n---\n\n* Most of the descriptions of species that have been previously described by the writer in other publications, have been either partially or wholly rewritten for this Report.\nChondrites (Bythotrephis) cuneatus.

One of the most perfect specimens known to the writer, from Cat Head, Lake Winnipeg, and of the natural size.\n\nThallus frondose, continuous, devoid of midrib or veins, compressed, almost flat, and consisting of a nearly straight and rather narrow central axis, with both terminal and lateral, simple or deeply bifurcate, divergent, elongated and narrowly wedge-shaped divisions, at short but irregular intervals. The central axis does not much exceed three millimetres in breadth, in any of the specimens known to the writer, and the terminal and lateral divisions average from three-quarters of an inch to about an inch in length, and from three to four millimetres in breadth at their subtruncate apices. Base of attachment unknown; minute structure not preserved.\n\nApparently not uncommon at Cat Head, Lake Winnipeg, where well defined but not quite perfect specimens, in a similar state of preservation to those of C. patulus, were collected by T. C. Weston in 1884; and three miles west of Cat Head, where a few good specimens were obtained by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890.\n\nThese fossils bear a certain general resemblance to the Sphenothallus angustifolius of Hall, as figured on Plate 68 of the first volume of the Paleontology of the State of New York, and the writer has long been under the impression that they might possibly represent a local variety.\nof that species. Quite recently, however, Mr. R. Ruedemann has published a paper (in the \"American Geologist\" for 1896) in which he adduces arguments to prove that the specimen upon which *S. angustifolius* was based is not a plant, but a number of imperfect shells of a sessile *Conularia* (probably *C. gracilis*, Hall) with thickened margins and a bulbous base, attached to the cast of the interior of another shell (*Trocholites*). However this may be, an original drawing of the type of *T. angustifolius*, kindly forwarded by Mr. Ruedemann, shews that there is no real resemblance between that specimen and the fossils from Cat Head.\n\n**Chondrites cupressinus**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 17, fig. 1.\n\n*Chondrites cupressinus*, Whiteaves ..........1896. Canad. Rec. Sc., vol. VI., p. 388.\n\n\"Thallus frondose, continuous, and consisting of a long, slender and extremely narrow rhachis, with numerous short, crowded and variously-divided lateral ramifications; base of attachment unknown. The rhachis is flat, erect, nearly straight, and scarcely more than half a millimetre in its maximum breadth. The lateral ramifications are linear, pinnately partite, or possibly verticillate, opposite, divergent, and spreading outward and a little upward. They decrease very gradually in length from below upward, and are either doubly bifurcate, bifurcate with both of the ultimate ramifications trifurcate, or bifurcate with one of the ultimate branchlets trifurcate and the other single.\n\nCat Head, Lake Winnipeg, D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe, 1890: one specimen, which has been split longitudinally down the centre into two pieces of nearly equal size.\n\nTo the naked eye this specimen has much the appearance of the polypary of a recent hydroid, and especially of that of the well known *Sertularia cupressina*, L., which Professor Allman now refers to *Thuiaria*. When viewed under an ordinary simple lens, however, it has obviously more the aspect of a plant, although its minute tissues are not preserved. There are no indications of any corneous or chitinous structures, of articulations, of a central virgula, as in the Graptolitidae, or of marginal hydrotheca, as in the hydroids and graptolites.\"\n\n**Chondrites gracillimus**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 17, fig. 2.\n\n*Chondrites gracillimus*, Whiteaves ..........1896. Canad. Rec. Sc., vol. VI., p. 389.\n\n\"Thallus frondose, continuous, pinnately partite, with a slender rhachis, which is nearly a millimetre in breadth about the mid-height,\nbut narrower at and near the base and apex, and apparently flattened, with no indications of a central axis or virgula. Lateral ramifications simple, unbranched, narrower than the rhachis, averaging about one millimetre apart, the longest about fifteen mm. in length, divergent in the same plane outward and a little upward, but showing no traces of hydrothec\u00e6 or cell openings on their margins; basal attachment unknown.\n\nInmost Island, Kinwow Bay, Lake Winnipeg, T. C. Weston, 1884: one well defined and nearly perfect specimen, though its minute structure is not preserved.\n\nThis specimen is so similar in general shape to some of the Devonian and Carboniferous species of *Plumalina* that the writer has long been under the impression that it could be referred to that genus. It is also equally similar in general shape to the *Buthograptus laxus* of Hall, from the Trenton shales of Wisconsin. According to S. A. Miller,* *Ptilophyton*, Dawson, is a synonym of *Plumalina*, and the writer is informed by Sir J. W. Dawson that he has recently ascertained that *Buthograptus laxus* is exactly congeneric with *Ptilophyton*. In Hall\u2019s original description of *Plumalina\u2020* the specimens described are said to have a \u2018well-preserved corneous structure,\u2019 and Whitfield has shown that the lateral branches of *Buthograptus laxus* are articulated. Under a lens, the specimen from Inmost Island shews no indication of corneous structure, and its lateral ramifications are apparently continuous with the rhachis. It would, therefore, seem to be the most prudent course to refer it provisionally to the genus *Chondrites*. Whether viewed with or without a lens, it has so many characters in common with *C. cupressinus* that practically the only difference between them is, that the one has long and undivided pinnae or lateral ramifications, and the other short and much divided ones.\u201d\n\n**RECEPTACULITID\u00c6.**\n\n**Receptaculites Oweni**, Hall.\n\n*Coscinopora sulcata*, D.

I., Atlas, pl. 3, fig. 21a.\n\nA few specimens which can scarcely be distinguished by any external character from the types of *Pasceolus gregarius* in the Museum of the Survey, or from *Cyclocrinus Spaskii*, as figured by F. Roemer, in the Atlas to the first volume of the Leth\u00e6a Geognostica, were collected at Lower Fort Garry, at Dog Head and Inmost Island, Lake Winnipeg, by T. C. Weston in 1884; at Jack Head Island by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; and on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg north of Saskatchewan and opposite the north end of Selkirk Island by D. B. Dowling in 1891. Most of the specimens are mere casts of the interior of the organism, which shew nothing of the minute structure. One specimen has a portion of the thin investing integument preserved, but it shews only a transverse section of the integument, the outer surface being completely covered by the matrix. The casts are small spherical bodies, about an inch in diameter, and marked externally with numerous minute hexagonal facets, about one millimetre in diameter. In some these facets are slightly convex, with a narrow flat border, and indications of a small tubercle in the centre of each, when examined with a lens, but in others the outer margin of each facet is raised and the central portion depressed.\n\nIt would seem to be doubtful whether *Pasceolus gregarius* can be satisfactorily distinguished from *Cyclocrinus Spaskii*, especially in view of the facts that the types of the former are from the Island of Anticosti, and\nthat *C.

Winnipegensis*, with the references to the figures altered to suit those in this publication.\n\nThis remarkable sponge is distinguished by its singular form from all other Aulocopidae, and in that respect stands in the same relation to them as the Cretaceous *Siphonia (Hallirhoca) costata* does to the other Siphonid\u00e6.\n\nPlate 16, fig. 1, shews the upper side of the fragment, whose boundary on the right hand side is formed by the broken surface. The smooth parts are the mineral fillings up of originally empty spaces; p is the Paragaster, while G 1, G 2, and G 5, are mineral wedges, shaped like the segments of an orange, whose inner edges are almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sponge, in an almost perpendicular direction from the summit to the base. The under side of the sponge is concave (as seen in fig. 9 on the next page) whereas the summit is convex. Between the wedges of sediment (G 1, G 2, and G 5) is situated the body skeleton, which is divided into a number of strong ribs or rays, traversed by thick, arched exhalent canals (aporrhysen) which appear upon the outer surface of the strongly weathered and probably worn fragment (Plate 16, fig. 1, as interrupted grooves.\n\nA vertical section through the middle of one of the rays is shown in the woodcut (Fig. 9), which represents both the vertically fractured surface and a section through the longitudinal axis of the Paragaster.\nThe Paragaster is deep; it reaches nearly down to the point from which the skeleton fibres (Skelet-radiant) radiate, and occupies about two-thirds the entire height of the sponge. The exact point from which these fibres radiate could not indeed be actually observed, but its position is so clearly indicated by the convergence of the fibres that the possible deviation from its true position, as represented in the figure, cannot amount to more than one or two millimetres. I have not been able to find distinct inhalent canals, though it is possible that they may have disappeared in consequence of the complete and unfavourable silicification* which the body skeleton has undergone. The basal surface\n\n*The rock is a most peculiar, very uniform, fine grained, siliceous limestone. The grains, which for the most part measure from 30 to 60 micronmillimetres, consist of well defined calc spar rhomboids, which are so closely embedded in an isotropic siliceous mass that the rock effervesces but weakly with acids, in spite of the amount of lime that it contains. This sediment is completely free from other organisms, such as sponge spicules, which are often found distributed throughout siliceous limestones. The whole silicified sponge body is free from calcareous matter, and is altered, not to an isotropic silica, but into a compact cryptocrystalline chalcedony.\nadheres inextricably to the matrix, as shown in the woodcut. We must therefore conclude that this surface was originally concave, or else we must suppose that the basal concavity was caused by an alteration of its original form previous to fossilization, a view which is not borne out by the regular contour of the specimen.\n\nA transverse section half way up through the fragment gives the appearance represented between A and C on figure 1 of Plate 16. This figure, considered in connection with the woodcut, proves that the skeleton fibres, in each of the radial rays, are pinnately arranged on both sides of a vertical median plane, and that these fibres diverge upward and downward as well as to the right and left. The distance between the axes of the fibres would measure from 0\u00b735 to 0\u00b750 mm. Of an integument layer I could find no traces.\n\nAlthough the skeleton has undergone a secondary silicification, and has therefore for the most part become obliterated, there is no doubt that, in structure and dimensions, it corresponds with that of *Aulocopium* or the American *Zittelella*.\n\nFigures 2 and 3 of plate 16 are attempts at a restoration of this sponge, the diagrams being one-third the natural size. Figure 2 shews a side view, and figure 3 a basal view of the organism, as it is supposed to have been when entire. The sponge had the form of a cog-wheel, with a diameter of at least 150 millimetres and a height of 75 mm., from whose conical hollow axis (about 40-50 mm. in diameter) eight radial rays proceed, which are 15-20 mm. thick and 50 mm. long at the midheight. From the mouth of the Paragaster, surface furrows radiate downward over the convex summit and upper surface of the rays. The naked basal surface is concave. In each ray the skeleton fibres are symmetrically arranged to a radial vertical median plane.\n\n**Trichospongia hystrix.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, fig. 3.\n\nThe foregoing name is proposed provisionally for a single specimen of a sponge, in which the main portion of the body skeleton is represented by a light brown or pale ferruginous impression or stain on the flat surface of a piece of limestone, with its margin outlined by a darker tint. This impression is rather narrowly elongated, about five times as long as high, with the base nearly straight but slightly convex in the middle, the summit still straighter, and the two ends narrowly rounded. Lying across it are numerous, exceedingly narrow, straight and apparently simple spicules, which project beyond the summit and ends to a maximum distance of eight millimetres. Exclusive of the projecting spicules,\nthe impression which is supposed to represent the body skeleton is forty-five millimetres in length, and nine in its maximum height or depth.\n\nThe specimen figured, which is the only one known to the writer, was collected at Cat Head, Lake Winnipeg, by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890.\n\nCOELENTERATA.\n\nHYDROZOA.\n\nClimacograptus bicornis, Hall.\n\nGraptolithus bicornis, Hall .............1847. Pal. N. York, vol.

All the branches on its right hand side look as if they had been abruptly and abnormally bent backward near the main axis, and then forward or forward and outward, prior to fossilization.\n\nWith only one specimen for comparison, and that one partially distorted, it is impossible to be at all certain whether this fossil is merely a local variety of *T. capillaris* or a distinct species. As compared with Hall's original figure of *T. capillaris*, the specimen from Cat Head would seem to differ in the much more acutely angular divergence of its branches from the main axis, and in the circumstance that these branches do not, apparently, bear any short secondary branches.\n\n**Inocaulis Canadensis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 17, fig. 4.\n\nPolypany large, thin, nearly flat or slightly undulated, widely expanded and composed of very numerous narrow radiating branches, which diverge or divide, reunite and anastomose in every direction, at short and frequent intervals, in such a way as to form a close and finely meshed network. Meshes longer than wide, varying in outline from subrhomboidal to almost lanceolate, and usually pointed at one or both ends. Branches averaging from about one-fifth to one-third of a millimetre in breadth, though the largest are as much as two-thirds of a millimetre broad, and apparently bearing on their celluliferous surface two or three longitudinal rows of rounded cell apertures or pores, with intervals between them of about twice their length or more, though the only specimen which shews this feature is very imperfectly preserved. Surface markings not clearly ascertainable, base of attachment and free extremities of the branches unknown.\n\nA few large but imperfect specimens of this graptolite were collected in or around Lake Winnipeg, at Inmost Island, Kinwow Bay, by T. C. Weston in 1884; at Cat Head by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; and at Clark's Point, about eleven miles north of the Little Saskatchewan, by D. B. Dowling in 1891. The largest of these specimens is three inches high, nearly two inches and a half broad, and was evidently much larger than this when entire.\n\nThis species is provisionally referred to *Inocaulis*, Hall, because it would seem to be most nearly related to the *I. arbuscula* of Ulrich* from the Hudson River or Cincinnati group of Ohio, which is still retained in that genus by Dr. Gurley in his recent paper on North American\n\n---\n\n*Journal of the Cincinnati Society of Natural History, vol. II., 1879, p. 28, pl. 7, figs. 27 and 27a.*\nGraptolites,* though Mr. Joseph F. James asserts that it is undoubtedly a *Dictyonema.*\u2020 It seems to be a much larger species than *I. arbuscula*, with branches apparently devoid of the \"strong, prong-like projections rising from the sides at variable intervals,\" which are said to characterize that species, forming a more complete network, with very numerous, fine meshes. Mr. Ulrich, to whom one of the best specimens from Innmost Island was submitted, thinks that it is quite distinct from his *I. arbuscula*, and that a new genus, near to *Dictyonema*, ought perhaps to be constituted for the reception of these two species. In the absence of any knowledge of the base of attachment of *I. Canadensis*, it is not at all clear to the writer how it can be separated generically from *Rhizograptus*, Spencer.\n\n**ACTINOZOA.**\n\n**ALCYONARIA.**\n\n**Halysites catenularia**, L., var. gracilis.\n\n*Catenipora gracilis*, Hall..................1851.

M.

The chief peculiarities of this variety, Mr. Lambe thinks, are \"the marked regularity of the corallites, their sides being flattened,\u2014and the absence of the tubules between them.\"\n\nIt is most probably a specimen of this variety of *H. catenularia* that was collected on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg, north of the Saskatchewan, by Captain Back in 1833, and referred to in Dr. Fitton's Appendix No. 4 to Back's Narrative of the Arctic Land Expedition to the mouth of the Great Fish River,\" &c., as \"doubtless a *Catenipora* or chain coral.\"*\n\nMore recently specimens of this coral have been collected by members of the staff of the Geological Survey of Canada at the following localities: In the Red River valley, at Lower Fort Garry, by T. C. Weston in 1884, and at East Selkirk by T. C. Weston in 1884 and by L. M. Lambe in 1890. In or around Lake Winnipeg, at Dog Head and Big Grindstone Point, by T. C.

In all these specimens the longer septa reach to the centre of the corallites.\n\nThis coral appears to have been previously collected at Lower Fort Garry by D. Dale Owen in 1848, and by Sir James Hector in 1857. It is probably the Facosites basaltica of Owen\u2019s list of Lower Fort Garry fossils, on page 181 of his Report of the Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa and Wisconsin, published in 1852, and the \u201cFavistella (Facosites basaltica of Owen)\u201d of the list of fossils from the same locality on page 245 of Captain Palliser\u2019s official report. Mr. Lambe recognizes it in a small collection of fossils made by J. B. Tyrrell at Doobaut Lake in 1893. It appears to be abundant at Fort Churchill, Hudson\u2019s Bay, where a number of specimens were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1894, from a small exposure of dolomite; and it has since been collected at Wekusko (Herb) Lake, and at Hill\u2019s Lake, Minago River, in the district of Saskatchewan, by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1896.\n\nDiphyphyllum Stokesi, Edwards and Haime.

Carbonif\u00e8re. Am\u00e9rique du Nord: Lac Wennepeg. Coll. Stokes.\" This species was probably referred to Lithostrotion, by Edwards & Haime, rather than to Diphyphyllum, because the rocks from which it was collected were then supposed to be of Lower Carboniferous age. In the description quoted, it will be observed that there is no mention of any styliform columella, like that of Lithostrotion, in the centre of the corallites, and there is no indication of any such structure in the original figure of L. Stokesi.\n\nA few well preserved specimens, which agree very well with the description and figure of L. Stokesi, also with Hall's illustrations and vague diagnosis of his \"Sarcinula (?) obsoleta,\" but which are clearly referable to the genus Diphyphyllum, as now understood, were collected at Lower Fort Garry by Donald Gunn in 1858, and by T. C. Weston in 1884. These specimens consist of large portions of colonies of fasciculated corallites, with few connecting processes between them. The corallites average from six to eight millimetres in diameter, and are covered externally by a thin, transversely striated epitheca. When the epitheca is worn off or broken away, as it often is, the surface of the corallites underneath it is marked with fine linear longitudinal grooves, corresponding to the septa within. The internal structure of the corallites consists of twenty-two long septa, alternating with as many shorter ones, and of the usual transverse tabulae characteristic of Diphyphyllum.\n\nStreptelasma robustum, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 18, figs. 1 and 1a.\n\nStreptelasma corniculum, H\u00f6l.

In some adult or nearly adult specimens the sides are so much compressed\n(perhaps abnormally so) that the convexly arched region is obtusely angulated in the centre, longitudinally; in some young specimens this region is distinctly flattened, but others are circular in outline in transverse section, or as seen from above. Septa alternately long and short, varying in number in large specimens from 160 to 170 in all, the longer ones extending to the centre at the bottom of the calyx. Surface marked with transverse wrinkles and numerous fine strie of growth in well-preserved specimens, but often so much worn, apparently prior to fossilization, as to be almost smooth.\n\n\"Longitudinal sections through the centre of large specimens show that the calyx is not very deep, and that its cavity occupies but a small proportion of the entire length. Below the calyx the corallum is filled with strongly developed and apparently thickened septa, with well-marked dissepiments between them, and these septa, with their dissepiments, unite in the centre in such a way as to form a large irregularly reticulated pseudo-columella, which projects slightly \"above the centre of the base of the calyx, as a boss of irregular shape, but with a narrowly rounded summit.\n\n\"This fine coral is especially abundant, and attains to a large size in the Red River valley, at Lower Fort Garry and East Selkirk, Manitoba, where it was collected by Dr. R. Bell in 1880, by T. C. Weston and A. McCharles in 1884, by L. M. Lambe in 1890, and by D. B. Dowling in 1891.\"\n\nOn the western side of Lake Winnipeg a few comparatively small and very imperfect specimens, which may be referable to this species, were collected at Deer Island by T. C. Weston in 1884, at Little Black Island by J. B. Tyrrell in 1889, at Jack Head and Snake islands by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890, at Dog Head, Dancing Point, Little Tamarack and Selkirk islands, and on the main shore opposite the north end of Selkirk Island and north of the Saskatchewan by D. B. Dowling in 1891. Most of the specimens from these localities appear to widen out much more rapidly, at a short distance from the pointed base, than any of the eastern examples of *S. corniculum* do, but a single specimen from Little Black Island approaches very near to that species.\n\nA small specimen, which is probably also referable to *S. robustum*, was collected at the junction of the Little and Great Churchill rivers by Dr. R. Bell in 1889.\n\nWhen fully grown this species can be readily distinguished from *S. corniculum* by its very much larger size and more robust habit of growth. It seems to bear somewhat the same kind of relationship to *S. corniculum* that the *Receptaculites Oweni* of the Cambro-Silurian rocks of the west does to the eastern fossil known by the rather inappropriate name of\nR. occidentalis, and that Hormotoma Winnipegensis of the same rocks does to the eastern M. bellicincta.\n\n**Protar\u00e6a vetusta**, Hall.\n\n*Porites? vetusta*, Hall..................1847.

Calyces closely contiguous, extremely shallow, about two millimetres in diameter, rounded polygonal, but very indistinctly defined, the centre of each occupied with a group of from five to seven minute tubercles. Septa about twelve in number, short, wedge-shaped, and perhaps crenulated at their summits. When the surface is slightly ground down and examined with a lens the closely grouped tubercles in the centre of each calyx have somewhat the appearance of a spongioso pseudo-columella.\n\nTransverse and vertical sections, if correctly interpreted by the writer, shew that the entire corallum is composed exclusively of compact sclerenchyma, consisting of a close aggregation of minute tubes which are nearly uniform in size and extent from the base to the summit of the organism, and that the calyces are mere shallow depressions of the surface of this mass of sclerenchyma. Transverse sections through the calyces shew that there are from three to six sclerenchymatous tubes between two closely adjacent calyces, and similar sections below the calyces exhibit only a dense mass of minute sclerenchymatous tissue, composed of tubes that are irregularly four to six sided. In longitudinal sections these tubes are seen to be frequently rather flexuous and somewhat twisted together. They are invariably filled with the matrix, but in some of\nthem transverse diaphragms or tabulae can be detected with the aid of a lens.\n\nLower Fort Garry, Dr. R.

Weston, 1884, four specimens, one partly encrusting a colony of the Chaetetes perantiquus of this Report, and the others detached from the organisms to which they were originally adherent.\n\nThese specimens would seem to indicate a well marked local variety of P. vetusta, or perhaps a distinct species, which differs from the ordinary form of P. vetusta chiefly in its much greater size and thickness. They very closely resemble the Coccoseris Ungerni of Eichwald, as described and figured in the \"Leth\u00e6a Rossica,\"* but the calyces of C. Ungerni are represented as a line and a half, or three mm. in diameter. Lindstr\u00f6m, however, in his \"Index to the Genera of Pal\u00e6ozoic Corals,\"\u2020 regards Protar\u0153a and Coccoseris as distinct and \"well-established\" genera. In this \"Index,\" Stylar\u0153a of Von Seebach is stated to be synonymous with Coccoseris. Protar\u0153a Verneuili of Edwards and Haime\u2021 is said to have calyces three millimetres in diameter, with twenty septa in each.\n\n**Favosites prolificus**, Billings.\n\n*Favosites prolificus*, Billings............. .....1865.

The corallites of which they are composed are usually hexagonal but sometimes pentagonal tubes, nearly equal in size, and the largest average from two millimetres and a quarter to two mm. and a half in diameter. The spiniform septa are very short, and the mural pores would seem to be placed in the angles of the corallites, though they cannot be seen distinctly in any of the specimens, as the corallites are nearly always either filled, or their walls lined, with minute crystals of calcite. The tabulae are complete, numerous and placed at a distance of one millimetre apart. A single specimen of a coral which is probably only a variety of this species, and in which the corallites average about a millimetre in diameter, was collected at Wicked Point, Lake Winnipeg, by D. B. Dowling, in 1891.\n\nIn the second part of this volume it is stated that \"it is doubtful whether *F. prolificus* should be regarded as a distinct species or as a mere local variety of *F. Gothlandica*,\" but if all the specimens from Stony Mountain, East Selkirk, and Lower Fort Garry that are here referred to *F. prolificus* are correctly determined, it would appear that *F. prolificus* is most probably synonymous with *F. aspera*.

Two small but characteristic specimens of this species were collected at the junction of the Little and\nGreat Churchill Rivers, Kecwatin, by Dr. Bell in 1879; it is represented in a small collection of fossils from the vicinity of Doobaunt Lake, made by Mr. Tyrrell in 1893; and a badly preserved specimen of it was collected at Wekusko (Herb) Lake by Mr. Tyrrell in 1896.\n\nThe genus *Calap\u00e6cia* was first proposed and defined (in 1865) by E. Billings, who regarded it as consisting of three species, which he described under the names *C. Canadensis*, *C. Huronensis*, and *C. Anticostiensis*. In 1866, however, in a foot-note to page 33 of his Catalogue of the Silurian Fossils of the Island of Anticosti, Mr. Billings says of *Calap\u00e6cia Anticostiensis* that \"it appears to be congeneric with *Syringophyllum organum* (*Sarcinula organum*).\" Lindstr\u00f6m, in 1883, made *Columnopora*, Nicholson, a synonym of *Calap\u00e6cia*, and Nicholson had previously (in 1879) regarded *Houghtonia* of Rominger as a synonym of *Columnopora*.\n\nThe writer has long been convinced that *Columnopora cribiformis*, Nicholson, is identical with *Calap\u00e6cia Huronensis*, and that the latter cannot be satisfactorily distinguished, even as a mere stratigraphical variety, from *Calap\u00e6cia Canadensis*. Mr. Billings admits that *C. Huronensis* is closely allied to *C. Canadensis*, but claims that the former \"has the corallites in general more slender,\" and that it \"presents a different aspect.\" In the original descriptions it is stated that the corallites of *C. Canadensis* are \"about one line, usually a little more, in diameter, and generally in contact though still remaining circular,\" but that those of *C. Huronensis* are \"somewhat less than one line in diameter, with a few others much smaller between them.\" In one of the specimens of *C. Huronensis*, from Cape Smyth, in the Museum of the Survey, most of the corallites are certainly a little larger than those of *C. Canadensis*, and perhaps a little farther apart, but this is not the case with other specimens of *C. Huronensis* from the same locality. The specimens from the Red River valley and Lake Winnipeg correspond almost equally well with the descriptions of either, but, upon the whole, in the mere size of their corallites, perhaps a little better with the character of *C. Canadensis* than with those of *C. Huronensis*.\n\nIn a letter dated October 10th, 1885, Professor Nicholson (to whom one or more examples of each of the nominal species of *Calap\u00e6cia* had been sent by the writer, for comparison with specimens of *Syringophyllum*) states that he had arrived at the following conclusions in regard to them: \"(1.) My *Columnopora cribiformis* is identical, both generically and specifically, with *Calap\u00e6cia Huronensis*, Billings. My name must, therefore, be abandoned. It is quite probable that *Calap\u00e6cia Canadensis*, Billings, is also the same as *C. Huronensis*, but, the specimens being silicified in the former, I am not sure of this. (2.) *Calap\u00e6cia*\nAnticostiensis, Billings, is not generically separable from Syringophyllum, and must stand as Syringophyllum Anticostiense, Billings, sp. (3.) Having obtained lately much material of S. organum, Linn., in Russia, I have worked out the genus Syringophyllum, and find it to be an ally of Chonostegites, E. & H., and Thecostegites, E. & H. Indeed, I am doubtful if Syringophyllum and Chonostegites can be regarded as generically separable at all. These genera, viz., Syringophyllum, Chonostegites and Thecostegites are all related to Syringopora, and form a kind of intermediate group between the Favositidae and Syringoporidae.\n\nECHINODERMATA.\n\nCRINOIDEA.\n\nNo crinoids with any portion of the calyx preserved have yet been collected in place from the Winnipeg or Red River limestones, so far as the writer is aware, though a good specimen of an apparently new species of Saccocrinus, with the dorsal cup and portions of the arms preserved, in a loose piece of limestone probably of Silurian (Upper Silurian) age, was picked up at Cat Head by Dr. Selwyn in 1873.\n\nA few badly preserved portions of columns of apparently two or three genera of crinoids were collected at Inmost Island by T. C. Weston in 1884; at the same island and at Snake Island by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; and at Cat Head by Mr. Dowling in 1893. Most of these are scarcely determinable, even generically, but some of those from Inmost Island appear to be referable to Glyptocrinus or Schizocrinus.\n\nCYSTOIDEA.\n\nGLYPTOCYSTITES. (Species undeterminable.)\n\nA few calyx plates of a species of Glyptocystites, which Mr. E. Billings said are \"closely allied to his G. multiporus,\" were collected by Professor Hind in 1858, at Grindstone Point, as previously stated on page 132, and similar plates were collected at the same locality by Mr. Weston in 1884, and by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889. Detached calyx plates and specimens apparently referable to the same species, with the whole or part of the column and two or three of the plates of the basal portion of the calyx preserved, though the whole of their outer surface is much water worn, were collected at Deer Island by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889.\n\nASTEROIDEA.\n\nAn imperfect and obscure specimen of a protasteroid starfish was collected at Cat Head by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890, on the\nsame small piece of limestone as the type of *Trichospongia hystrix*. Mr. Schuchert, who has seen this starfish, in a letter to the writer dated Jan. 21, 1897, states that \"it cannot be described specifically, but that generically it appears to be a *T\u00e6niaster*.\"\n\n**VERMES.**\n\n**ANNELIDA.**\n\n*Serpulites dissolutus*, Billings.\n\n*Serpulites dissolutus*, Billings .... ..........1862. Geol. Surv. Canada, Pal. Foss., vol. I., p. 56.\n\nPunk Island, Lake Winnipeg, Professor H. Y. Hind, 1858, an imperfect but fairly well preserved specimen, which seems to be essentially similar to the types of *S. dissolutus* in the Museum of the Survey. It is about an inch and three-quarters in length, but imperfect at both ends, and one millimetre and a half in its maximum breadth. The surface of *S. dissolutus* was described as apparently smooth, but, when examined with a lens the \"elevated wire-like margin on each side of the central depression\" of the specimen from Punk Island is seen to be marked with minute transverse undulations, which are not so clearly visible in eastern examples of *S. dissolutus*. In the twentieth chapter of Professor Hind's Report on the Canadian Exploring Expedition to the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan (page 87) Mr. Billings says that \"a small Serpulites appears to be common at Punk Island; it much resembles the large species of the Chazy limestone,\" but this chapter was written four years before *S. dissolutus* was described.\n\n**ARABELLITES.** (Species undeterminable.)\n\nLittle Black Island, Lake Winnipeg, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: a well-preserved portion of a jaw. This specimen has been kindly examined by Dr. G. J. Hinde, who has made a special study of the teeth and jaws of the Annelida of the Palaeozoic rocks, and who thus reports upon it in a letter to the writer dated June 22nd, 1894. \"It is too fragmentary for positive determination, but it seems to have had a prominent anterior hook, about half of which remains, and a long row of subequal minute teeth on the crest of the plate. So far as I can judge, it belongs to the genus *Arabellites*, forms of which are figured in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. xxxv., pl. 18, figs. 13-19, also in vol. xxxvi., pl. 14, and in the Transactions of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, Sept. 13, 1882 (Kongl.

Should these parts eventually be discovered in the latter species, *L. Iowensis*, Owen, will give place to *L. rectilateralis*, as the latter has two years' priority over the former. Professor Hall in 1847 ** regarded Emmons's species as a synonym of *L. quadrata*, Eichwald, while Whitfield \u2020\u2020 regarded this form as identical with *L. Iowensis*, Owen.\" \"We have seen four specimens of typical *Lingula quadrata*, Eichwald, from Esthonia, in the collection of Mr. Ulrich, and these prove beyond a doubt that none of the American forms identified with this species are correctly named.

Billings, expressed the opinion (which the writer took down in writing, at the time, from his dictation) that the Anticosti specimens labelled *Lingula quadrata*, Eichwald, are exactly similar to Eichwald's types, and that two specimens from the Trenton limestone near Montreal that are similarly labelled, may be correctly named.\n\n**LINGULA ELONGATA**, Hall.\n\n*Lingula elongata*, Hall...........1847.

According to Messrs.

On the other hand, Shaler has since referred *Orthisina Verneuili*, Billings, to his species, in which he is correct. On comparison with the European species, as illustrated by de Verneuil,* it is seen that the American species is wider along the hinge-line, the ventral area much less incurved and elevated, with finer striae and a narrow sinus in the dorsal valve. These differences are sufficient to distinguish the two species.\" Winchell & Schuchert, op. cit., p. 380.\n\nIn the Museum of the Survey there are eight specimens on exhibition in the cases, which were identified with *Orthisina Verneuili* by E. Billings, and which are still so labelled. Four of these are from the Trenton limestone at Ottawa, three are from the same formation at Jessup's Rapids on the Bonnechere, and one is from Division 1 of the \"Anticosti group\" at Gamache Bay, Anticosti. All of these specimens were carefully examined in 1891 by M. Friedrich Schmidt, who informed the writer that the Anticosti example labelled *O.

At East Selkirk, in 1884, Mr. Weston obtained an unusually large ventral valve of S. incurvata, which is about seventy millimetres broad at the hinge line, and forty-four mm. long. On Lake Winnipeg the species has been collected at Kinwow Bay, and at Birch or Inmost Island, in Kinwow Bay, by T. C. Weston in 1884, and by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; also at Cat Head and Big Sturgeon Island by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890.\n\nCharacteristic examples of S. incurvata had previously been collected by Dr. R. Bell in 1879, on the Nelson River, Keewatin, at the Lime-stone Rapids, 100 miles up, at the second and third rapids, and at the first Birch Brook.

C. Weston, in 1884; at Deer Island by J. B. Tyrrell in 1889; at Snake and Jack Head islands by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; at the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan River\nand at Little Tamarack Island by D. B. Dowling in 1890; at Clark's or \"Limestone\" Point, eleven miles north of the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan, at an exposure eight miles north of Clark's Point, and on the west shore of the lake, north of the Saskatchewan and opposite the north end of Selkirk Island by D. B. Dowling in 1891. Nearly all the specimens from these localities are dorsal valves in various states of preservation. They are here referred to Owen's species, which has not yet been satisfactorily illustrated, mainly on the authority of Mr. Charles Schuchert, to whom three of the best specimens were sent for comparison, and who regards them as \"typical examples of *Strophomena trilobata*, as found in the upper Mississipi valley.\"\n\n**Strophomena.** (Species uncertain.)\n\nA few dorsal valves of a *Strophomena*, whose specific relations are at present uncertain, were collected at Lower Fort Garry by Dr. Bell in 1880 and by Mr. Weston in 1884. So far as can be ascertained from their imperfect state of preservation, these specimens would appear to be intermediate in their characters between *S. trilobata* and *S. Hecuba*, Billings.* In the dorsal valve of *S. trilobata* the visceral disc is flattened and the remainder of the valve bent abruptly inward at an obtuse angle, at about one-third of the length from the beak to the nasute anterior extremity, while that of *S. Hecuba* is ventricose and evenly convex. These dorsal valves from Lower Fort Garry are tumid and gibbous a little behind the midlength, when viewed laterally, and neither obtusely angulated posteriorly, as in *S. trilobata*, nor uniformly convex as in *S. Hecuba*. They may possibly indicate or represent a nasute local variety of *S. incurvata*.\n\n**Strophomena Billingsii**, Winchell and Schuchert.\n\n*Strophomena reeta*, Billings .... ..........1862.

The following remarks upon this rather peculiar shell are made by Messrs. Hall and Clarke, on page 288 of the eighth volume of the Paleontology of the State of New York: \u201cThere is a small number of species, the incipient members of the genus *Stropheodonta*, in which the delthyrium is open, or but partially covered, as in some of its later forms, the crenulations are confined to a very limited extent on either side of the deltidium, and upon one of these forms, *Strophomena Leda*, Billings, from the Anticosti group, Professor Shaler has proposed to found the genus *Brachyprion*. To the same group belong the *Strophomena Philomela*, Billings, from the *Pentamerus oblongus* beds of Anticosti, and Professor Shaler has described two other species from Anticosti, *Brachyprion ventricosum* and *B. geniculatum*. These features can scarcely be regarded as of generic value, but the group is an interesting one on account of its being the precursor of the fuller development of those characters upon which the genus *Stropheodonta* was originally founded.\u201d\n\n**Rafinesquina lata**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 19, figs. 2-5.\n\n*Rafinesquina lata*, Whiteaves.........1896. Canad. Rec. Sc., vol. VI., p. 392.\n\n\u201cShell large, adult specimens measuring as much as three inches along the hinge line, deeply concavo-convex, much broader than long, and broadest at the hinge line: cardinal angles produced. Ventral or pedicle valve strongly convex exteriorly, usually regularly arched from back to front, most prominent and in some specimens gibbous and even obtusely subangular about the midlength, with the visceral disc flattened obliquely, in others most tumid in the umbonal region posterior to the midlength, its beak moderately prominent, its cardinal area wide and about four millimetres and a quarter in height, with a broadly triangular deltidium in the centre. Dorsal or brachial valve deeply concave, closely following\nthe curvature of the ventral, its cardinal area about one mm. and a quarter in height, and its beak apparently small.\n\n\"Surface of both valves marked with very numerous and closely disposed, thread-like radiating raised lines or minute ridges. In the only well preserved dorsal valve known to the writer these radii are very nearly equal in size, but upon the ventral valves of several specimens they are unequal in size and irregular in their disposition. In some places the larger radii alternate with the smaller ones, but in others there are from two to four, or even more, of the smaller radii between two of the larger ones. In addition to these radii, the visceral disc of the ventral valve of some specimens is marked with comparatively coarse, undulating, concentric but somewhat interrupted corrugations.\n\n\"Hinge dentition and characters of the interior of both valves unknown, but an imperfectly preserved cast of the interior of the shell of a ventral valve\" from Cat Head \"shews that the flabellate diductors of that valve are very similar in shape to those of R. alternata, as figured by Hall on Plate 8, figure 10, of the eighth volume of the 'Palaeontology of the State of New York,' though their external margins are very much less distinctly defined.\"\n\n\"Apparently not uncommon\" \"at Lower Fort Garry\u2014where it was collected by Donald Gunn in 1858, by Dr. R. Bell in 1880, by T. C. Weston in 1884, and D. B. Dowling in 1891, and at East Selkirk\u2014where specimens were obtained by T. C. Weston and A. McCharles in 1884. From the limestones of Lake Winnipeg it has so far been collected only at Cat Head (by T. C. Weston in 1884 and D. B. Dowling in 1891), and at Jack Head Island (by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890).\n\n\"Altogether, the writer has seen fourteen specimens of this shell, three of which show the characters of the hinge area of both valves fairly well though the beak of the dorsal valve cannot be seen in either, as it is either broken off or buried under the matrix. The ventral aspect of these specimens is remarkably similar to that of the fossil figured by Professor Winchell and Mr. Schuchert on Plate 31, figures 35 and 36 of the 'Lower Silurian Brachiopoda of Minnesota,' as Rafinesquina alternata, var. lovorhytis, but which, Mr. Schucherthas recently informed the writer, he now regards as a form of R. Kingii, the Strophomena Kingii of Whitfield. Mr. Schuchert, however, who has seen all the specimens from Manitoba upon which the preceding description is based, states that their hinge areas are always nearly three and even four times as high as those of the Minnesota specimens of R. Kingii which he has studied, and regards this as a valid distinction between them. Professor Whitfield, also, who has seen some of the most perfect Manitoba specimens of R. lata, regards them as specifically distinct from his Strophomena Kingii, on the ground that the umbones of ventral valves of the\nformer are more full, and the valves themselves proportionately more convex than those of *S. Kingii.*\n\n**Lept\u00e6na unicostata**, Meek and Worthen. (Sp.)\n\n*Strophomena unicostata*, Meek and Worthen..1868. Geol. Surv. Illinois, vol.

I., p. 145, pl. 33, figs. 12, a-c.\n\nSeveral specimens of a shell which the writer is convinced is a rather large local variety of *Rhynchonella Anticostiensis*, were collected at Lower Fort Garry by the late Mr. Donald Gunn in 1858, by Dr. R. Bell in 1880, and by Mr. Weston in 1884; also at the First Limestone Rapids, 100 miles up the Nelson River, Keewatin, by Dr. R. Bell in 1879.\nIn all the specimens of this north-western variety that the writer has seen, the ventral valve is longer than broad, or at least as long, and its beak is prominent, erect or prolonged, and narrowly conical, whereas the ventral valve of *Rhynchotrema inaequivalvis*, Castelneau (=*increbescens*, Hall) is almost always broader than long, and its beak short and incurved. This variety of *Rhynchonella Anticostiensis* differs from the typical form of that species in being a little larger, and proportionately rather broader in advance of the midlength. The eastern specimen of *R. Anticostiensis* figured by Billings, which is as large as any the writer has seen from Anticosti, is 17 millimetres long, as measured along the median line, and 15 mm. in its greatest breadth. Two average adult examples of the north-western variety of that species, from Lower Fort Garry, measure,\u2014the one 19 mm. in length by 17\u00b775 mm. in its greatest breadth,\u2014and the other 20 mm. in length by 20 mm. in breadth. Some of the specimens from Lower Fort Garry approach rather closely to *Atrypa subtrigonalis*, Hall, but the antero-lateral angles of the former are more broadly rounded. The characters of the interior of the typical *R. Anticostiensis* are still entirely unknown, but casts of the interior of the closed valves of the north-western variety shew the impression of a mesial septum, which commences at the beak and extends about half way to the anterior margin, in the dorsal valve.\n\n**Zygospira recurvirostra**, Hall.

(Gen. nov.)\n\nShell small, aviculoid in outline, both ears being well developed and the left valve more convex than the right: hinge dentition consisting of minute elongated thin laminar teeth, nearly parallel with and close to the cardinal margin, on both sides of the beaks.\n\nThe specimens upon which this genus is based are all casts of the interior of separate valves, and the slightly divergent hinge teeth are represented by their imprints, which are scarcely visible to the naked eye. When carefully examined with a lens, however, these casts show the impressions of two anterior and two posterior teeth in the right valve, and of two anterior and apparently three posterior teeth in the left valve. The genus is here proposed at the suggestion of Mr. Ulrich, who has examined the specimens, and who thinks that their hinge dentition is more like that of the Macrodontidae than any pterineoid hinge known to him.\n\nPAL\u00c6OPTERIA PARVULA.

Exped., p. 186.\n\n\u201cThis species closely resembles *M. modiolaris* (Conrad) but is always much smaller. It is transversely elongate, anterior extremity small, rounded, half the width of the posterior; the latter obliquely truncate and somewhat straight from the end of the hinge line for rather more than half the width, then rounded at the lower posterior angle. Hinge line straight or a little arched, full three-fourths the whole length of the shell. The umbones are less than one-fifth the length from the anterior extremity. The valves are moderately convex, obscurely and obliquely carinate from the umbones towards the lower posterior angle. In many specimens the ventral margin is concave near the anterior extremity, as if for the purpose of a byssus. Surface with obscure concentric undulations of growth. Length of large specimen, one and a half inch. In general they are a good deal smaller.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shell so much resembles *M. modiolaris* that I have long hesitated as to the propriety of giving it a separate name. It is very widely distributed, since we have specimens from Lake Winnipeg at Punk Island, from the Pallideau Islands in Lake Huron, where it occurs in\nstrata which hold fossils of the Chazy, Black River and Trenton limestones, and from near Cornwall and the Island of Montreal in the Chazy.\"\u2014E. Billings (op. cit.).\n\nIn the Museum of the Survey there are three specimens of *M. parvius. cula* which are labelled as having been collected by Professor H. Y. Hind at Punk Island in 1858, but, although from the typical locality, they are all so imperfect and so badly preserved that their characters are indefinite and their specific relations obscure. It has been found impracticable to make a satisfactory drawing of either of these specimens, as their original outlines are not sufficiently distinct, and the writer has seen no others from the Lake Winnipeg region.\n\n**Modiolopsis angustifrons.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 20, fig. 4.\n\nShell moderately elongated, nearly twice as long as high, slightly arcuate, very narrow, in the direction of the height, anteriorly, and expanded in the same direction posteriorly, the greatest height being at a short distance from the posterior end: valves moderately convex, most prominent on the broadly rounded, oblique, posterior umbonal slope, in front of which there is an abrupt concave inflection or shallow constriction. Anterior side very short, narrow in the direction of its breadth or thickness as well as height, and rounded at the end: posterior side much longer than the anterior and rather more than twice as high: posterior end obliquely subtruncate above, rounded and somewhat produced below: ventral margin, or margin of the valves in the byssal region, shallowly concave a little in advance of the midlength: hinge line nearly straight and gently ascending behind the beaks, occupying rather more than one-half of the entire length of each valve: umbones broad, depressed in the middle but tumid behind: beaks depressed, incurved, inclined forward, and placed at a short distance from the anterior end.\n\nSurface markings unknown, though the well preserved and perfect cast of the interior of both valves upon which the preceding description is based, is marked by numerous small concentric plications, which are most strongly marked on the upper part of the valves and behind the beaks.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: greatest length, 47\u00b75 mm.; maximum height, 26\u00b75 mm.: greatest height in front of the beaks, 12 mm.; approximate thickness of the two valves when closed, about 16 mm.; length of hinge line behind the beaks, between 28 and 30 mm.\n\nLower Fort Garry, T. C. Weston, 1884: a cast of the interior of a specimen with the valves widely open.\nThe most salient characteristics of this species are the pinched or constricted anterior end, and the concavely arched margin of the valves in the byssal region. The surface markings appear to be essentially similar to those of *M. concentrica*.\n\n**Orthodesma affine. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 20, fig. 5.\n\nShell elongated, nearly three times as long as high, and highest behind, valves strongly compressed and very inequilateral. Anterior side very short and narrowly rounded; posterior side much longer than the anterior, increasing gradually and very slightly in height and depth posteriorly, though the cardinal margin behind the beaks and the posterior half of the ventral margin are not far from parallel; posterior end more broadly rounded than the anterior; ventral margin nearly straight or slightly concave anteriorly and at the midlength, but faintly convex posteriorly; cardinal border, behind the beaks, slightly ascending outward, almost straight but very slightly convex; beaks probably small, depressed and appressed, evidently placed very near to the anterior end.\n\nHinge dentition unknown, muscular impressions not distinctly defined.\n\nMaximum length of the only specimen collected, 59.4 mm.; greatest height, 21 mm.; height at midlength, 19 mm.\n\nWest side of Selkirk Island, Lake Winnipeg, D. B. Dowling, 1891: a cast of the interior of both valves, in a loose piece of limestone. The beaks are broken off, but in every other respect the cast is nearly perfect. The specimen seems to indicate a species which is most nearly related to *O. curvatum* of Hall and Whitfield,* from the Hudson River group of Ohio, but which differs therefrom in its flatter valves, more obscure umbonal slopes, more evenly and less obliquely rounded posterior extremity, and, more particularly, by its proportionately shorter and much broader (or rather, higher) anterior side.\n\n**Vanuxemia.

Considering the section of the genus to which this species belongs, the strength and definition of the muscular scars, pallial line, and hinge denticles, and in fact the whole characters of the cast, would seem to show that it was made by an adult shell and not by a young specimen of *Ctenodonta* (or *Tellinomya ovata*, Hall). In the Cat Head specimen the denticles bend toward and not away from the beak.\n\n**Clinopista (?) antiqua.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 20, fig. 6.\n\nShell equivalve, compressed convex but lightly inflected above and behind the subangular posterior umbonal slopes, elongate, about twice as long as high, and rather narrowly subelliptical. Anterior side longer and broader in the direction of its height than the posterior, its extremity somewhat narrowly rounded, posterior side short and truncate or sub-truncate at the end; umbones depressed, beaks incurved, and placed a little behind the midlength.\n\nSurface markings unknown, as the test is not preserved, but the cast of the interior of both valves is nearly smooth and marked only with a few faint concentric striae of growth.\n\nHinge dentition unknown, though the test appears to have been very thin and the hinge practically edentulous. Immediately behind the beaks there are indications of a short external ligament.

An imperfect natural mould of the exterior of a specimen which is probably referable to this species, had previously been collected at the same locality by Mr. Weston in 1884.\nAt first sight the more perfect of these two specimens has the general appearance of a *Ctenodonta*, and its marginal outline is somewhat like that of *C. dubia* (Hall) as figured by E. Billings on page 175 of the \"Geology of Canada.\" On closer examination, however, its hinge would seem to have been practically edentulous, and therefore very different to that of *Ctenodonta*. The shell, also, has much the aspect of a small, narrow species of *Thracia*, but in that genus the left valve is always flatter than the right, and the ligament internal. The species is here provisionally referred to *Clinopista*, at the suggestion of Mr. Ulrich, but it may represent a new generic type, which at present there are not sufficient data to define. In the preceding description of the characters of the species, the shorter, narrower and truncated or subtruncated portion of the shell is regarded as the posterior side, and *vice versa*, in accordance with what are presumed to be its natural homologies.\n\n**Rhytimya recta.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 20, fig. 7.\n\nShell elongated, more than twice as long as high, and very inequilateral: valves compressed laterally, most convex but not very prominent along the very oblique and indistinctly defined posterior umbonal slope and shallowly inflected above it. Anterior side extremely short, its margin sloping obliquely and rapidly downward and outward in the lunular region, most prominent and forming a narrowly rounded or somewhat pointed junction with the ventral margin, at a little below the midheight: posterior side about five times as long as the anterior: posterior end obliquely truncated, and forming an obtusely pointed junction with the ventral margin, which is nearly straight or but very slightly convex for the greater portion of its length: cardinal margin, behind the beak, straight, horizontal and almost parallel with the ventral border: umbones compressed and slightly depressed both laterally and vertically, beaks incurved, placed very near to the anterior end, but not quite terminal.\n\nSurface of the cast marked with irregularly disposed but continuous concentric striae or lines of growth, and by a few short faint undulations, parallel to them, on the posterior umbonal slope.\n\nHinge dentition and muscular impressions unknown.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen known to the writer: maximum length, 38 mm.; height, at the midlength, 15\u00b72 mm.\n\nA perfect and tolerably well preserved cast of the interior of the right valve of a specimen of this species was collected by Mr. Dowling in 1890 from a loose piece of limestone at Reindeer Island, Lake Winnipeg.\nThe marginal outline of this specimen would seem to be sufficiently different from that of the *R. compressa* and *R. convexa* of Ulrich, as figured on plate 56 of the seventh volume of the Report of the Geological Survey of Ohio, to justify its separation from either, as a distinct species. Thus, in *R. compressa* the anterior side is proportionately longer and more broadly rounded than that of *R. recta*, and the posterior end of the former is less pointed below. In *R. convexa* the anterior side is also much longer than that of *R. recta*, the cardinal margin of the former is more arched and its posterior end is represented as more produced below.\n\n**Conocardium antiquum**, D.

Anterior side short, its margin abruptly contracted both above and below and narrowly rounded or narrowly subtruncated at the end: posterior side longer and broader (in the direction of its height) than the anterior: posterior end obliquely subtruncate and somewhat contracted above, rather narrowly rounded and moderately produced below: ventral margin broadly rounded, but more convex posteriorly than anteriorly, most prominent behind the midlength and straighter in front: cardinal margin, behind the beaks, very short, faintly convex and slightly ascending: beaks moderately prominent, incurved and placed considerably in advance of the midlength.\n\nSurface marked by concentric lines of growth, and on some specimens, when viewed with a lens, there are obscure indications of close set, minute radiating striae. Hinge dentition not known with any degree of certainty, but probably edentulous. On each side of the umbones there is a long and narrow, widely divergent slit or groove, at a short distance from the cardinal border and not far from parallel with it. Muscular impressions not distinctly defined, though the scar of the anterior adductor seems to have been vertically elongated.\nDimensions of one of the largest specimens known to the writer, the cast of the interior of a right valve figured: length 12\u00b72 mm.; height, 10\u00b73 mm.; estimated thickness of a cast of both valves, 5 mm.\n\nCasts of the interior or moulds of the exterior of one or both valves of shells of this species are abundant at Inmost Island, Kinwow Bay, Lake Winnipeg, where they were collected by T. C. Weston in 1884 and by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890.\n\nIn the preceding description the shorter and narrower portion of each valve is regarded as the anterior side, and the longer and broader as the posterior, but it is by no means clear that these terms, as thus used, represent the true homologies of the shell. It may be that the shorter is the posterior side and vice versa.\n\nThis curious little shell is referred provisionally to the genus *Edmondia*, at the suggestion of Mr. Ulrich, who, in a letter to the writer, dated May 8th, 1896, make the following remarks upon specimens of it that had been sent to him for examination and comparison: \"After a most careful investigation and comparison, I fail to find, despite my earnest wish to do so, the remotest difference between this Manitoba Trenton shell and the most typical Devonian and Carboniferous species of *Edmondia*. The agreements are as follows: (1) the hinge is edentulous; (2) there is an internal plate in each valve beneath the beak, which extends posteriorly and leaves in the cast (as your specimens show very clearly) a long narrow sharp slit or fissure running nearly parallel with and a short distance within the cardinal margin; (3) the muscular scars have the same position and form, and the anterior one, which is vertically elongated, sends up an obscure furrow to the front side of the beak; (4) the surface of the casts exhibit obscure traces of radiating lines; and (5) the rounded form and short anterior end. Considering these important agreements, together with the fact that the material at hand shows no differences, I do not see that you can do otherwise than refer the species to *Edmondia*.\"\n\nIn some manuals of paleontology or conchology *Edmondia* is said to be restricted to the Permian and Carboniferous systems, but Hall * has recently described and figured several species from the Devonian rocks of the United States, and Zittel \u2020 says that it ranges in time from the Silurian to the Dyas (Permian).\n\n**GASTEROPODA.**\n\n*TETRANOTA BIDORSATA,* Hall.

On the dorsal side of the outer volution, when viewed with a lens, these ridges are seen to be unequal in size, the larger ones usually alternating with one or two smaller ones. There are about twenty of the larger ridges in this region, and these, although placed rather close together, are not quite equidistant. On a cast of the interior of the shell there are indications of the larger revolving ridges, and in addition to these there is a faint narrow spiral groove, with an obtuse peripheral carination immediately under it, which may represent the slit-band, at about the midheight of the outer volution. On the surface of the gutta percha impression, however, the middle of the supposed slit-band, when viewed with a lens, is seen to be encircled with a minute spiral ridge.\n\nMaximum breadth of the specimen described, six millimetres; probable height of the same, when perfect, about equal to the breadth.\n\nInmost Island, Kinwow Bay, Lake Winnipeg, D.

It is quite uncertain whether the shell was really provided with a slit-band or not, and consequently whether it should be referred to Pleurotomaria or Cyclora. Its shape is not very unlike that of Cyclora minuta, Hall, as figured by Meek,* but the surface of that species is described and represented as smooth.\n\n**Liospira Americana**, Billings.

B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890. The larger of these specimens, which is figured, is fully eight inches in length and very much flattened in the dorso-ventral direction. The smaller, which is upward of seven inches in length, is slightly compressed in the same direction. They both differ from *Murchisonia major*, Hall,\u2020 in their very much larger size, and from *M. teretiformis*, Billings,\u2021 in their much less ventricose volutions, more lightly impressed suture, and in their coarser and more rib-like wrinkles of growth.\n\nComparatively small specimens, which are apparently referable to the same species and which rarely exceed four inches and a half in length, had previously been collected at two localities on the Nelson River, Keewatin, by Dr. R. Bell in 1879; at Dog Head and Jackfish Bay, Lake Winnipeg, by T. C. Weston in 1884; at Little Black Island by J. B.

Flat side faintly depressed in the centre in some specimens and as faintly raised in others: volutions, as viewed on this side, very shallowly concave in the centre and slightly raised on their outer margins: suture lightly impressed. Convex side moderately prominent (the greatest thickness or depth varying in different examples from two-fifths to one-third the maximum diameter): somewhat conical or subhemispherical, the outer volution obliquely flattened and narrowing very rapidly, but in a few specimens somewhat convexly, from the periphery to the umbilical margin: umbilicus deep, conical, and moderately wide: aperture obliquely and rather narrowly subtrapeziform: outer lip apparently simple: test thick.\n\nSurface of the test on the flat side marked with irregularly disposed, but for the most part distant, transverse linear grooves or periodic arrests of growth, each of which curves gently backward in a shallowly convex curve, and occasionally with a few striations which run parallel to them. In the specimen figured on Plate 13, fig. 1, of the eighth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, which is little less than four inches in its greatest diameter, and in which the whole of the test is\n\n* Published in volume III., part 2, of the Final Report of the Geology of Minnesota.\npreserved on the flat side, there are six of these periodic arrests of growth on the outer volution, while the inner whorls are perfectly smooth. In larger but similarly preserved specimens these arrests of growth, which are not sufficiently deep to produce any impressions on the casts, are somewhat more numerous and disposed at still more unequal intervals. On the convex side the test is ornamented with rounded spiral ribs of nearly equal size, and these are crossed by straight, transverse cost\u00e6, in such a way as to present a somewhat nodulous appearance.\n\n\"The foregoing description is intended to apply only to those specimens in which the greater part of the test is preserved. The condition in which the species is usually obtained is that of mere casts of the interior of the shell. In these, the slender early whorls are often broken off, the suture, on the flat side, is deeply excavated or channeled, and, on the convex side, a large portion of the inner whorls is visible in the umbilicus. The whole of the thick test between the volutions is sometimes removed in these casts, in which case the volutions are completely separated.\n\n\"In Appendix I to the Narrative of Franklin's Second Expedition to the Shores of the Polar Sea, under the heading 'Limestone of Lake Winnipeg,' the discovery, among other fossils, of specimens of a Maclurea which is most probably identical with the present species, on the western shore of that lake, in 1825, is thus referred to by Sir John Richardson:\u2014\n\n'Professor Jameson enumerates terebratul\u00e6, orthoceratites, encrinites, caryophyllit\u00e6 and lingul\u00e6, as the organic remains in the specimens brought home by Captain Franklin on his first expedition. Mr. Stokes and Mr. James De Carle Sowerby have examined those which we procured on the last expedition, and found amongst them terebratulites, spirifers, maclurites and corallines. The maclurites belonging to the same species with specimens from Lakes Erie and Huron, and also from Igloo-lik, are perhaps referable to the Maclurea magna of Le Sueur.'\n\n'A few casts of the interior of shells which are certainly referable to M. Manitobensis were collected by Mr. John Fleming in 1858' at Limestone or \"Clark's Point, Lake Winnipeg, eleven miles north of the Little Saskatchewan, and by Prof. H. Youle Hind, in the same year, at Deer Island, near Grindstone Point and at Punk Island, on the same lake. These specimens, which are still in the Museum of the Survey, are referred to by Mr. E. Billings, in chapter 20 of Prof. Hind's report, as belonging to a species of Maclurea, 'allied to M. Logani, Salter, but with more slender whorls.'\n\n\"Since then the species has been collected at the following localities, but the first specimens known to the writer in which any considerable portion of the test is preserved, were obtained in 1884 by Mr. T.

Natural size.\n\"In 1890 Messrs. Dowling and Lambe collected an operculum, which is probably that of a large specimen of this species, at Jack Fish Island, opposite the mouth of Jack Fish River, Lake Winnipeg. \"This operculum, which is represented in outline in the wood-cut, is a little more than four inches in height or depth, and not quite three inches in its maximum breadth. Its outer surface is completely buried in the matrix, the inner surface only being exposed. In the wood-cut the side indicated by the letter A clearly corresponds to the outer side of the shell, and the concave side opposite,\u2014B,\u2014to the inner or columellar side. The side marked C corresponds to the flattened spiral side of the shell, and that marked D to the inner wall of the umbilicus. The margins of the sides C and B, whose junction forms the 'nuclear angle,' are thickened, but the edges of the other two sides are very thin. This thickening of the sides C and B is immediately followed by a shallow depression in the nuclear region, but the inner side of the operculum is otherwise nearly flat. The surface markings of this side consist of numerous concentric raised lines of growth, but there are no clear indications of any \"internal projections for the attachment of muscles.\" Although the opercula of *M. Loganii*, Salter, and *M. crenulata*, Billings, are known to be provided with well developed\" projections or \"muscular processes on the inner side, this is by no means always the case in other species of the genus. On page 238 of the first volume of the \"Palaeozoic Fossils\" of Canada, E. Billings distinctly states that there are no muscular processes on the inner side of the operculum of his *M. oceana*, and on page 243 of the same volume he figures opercula of two other species of *Maclurea*, from Cape Norman, Newfoundland, in which there are no muscular processes on that side. In the Museum of the Geological Survey at Ottawa there are two opercula from the Calciferous of the Mingan Islands, which were referred by E. Billings, with some doubt, to the *M. matutina* of Hall. There are no processes on the inner side of these opercula.\"\n\nAccording to Messrs. Ulrich and Scofield (op. cit., p. 194), their genus *Maclurina* (which the writer prefers to regard, for the present, as a subgenus) is proposed for \"the reception of shells heretofore classed as *Maclurea*, but differing from the typical form of the genus in wanting the projections for the attachment of muscles on the inner side of the operculum.\" \"*Maclurea Manitobensis*, Whiteaves, the operculum of which is figured and described by Whiteaves in the Canadian Record of Science for April, 1893, is regarded as the type of the new genus.\" \"In this species the nucleus is at the junction of the lower and inner margin of the operculum, and we believe the same is true of *M. cuneata* and *M. subrotunda* of Whitfield, which, with Whiteaves's species, are all that at the present time it seems safe to refer to *Maclurina*.\"\nTrochonema umbilicatum, Hall.

Specimens in which the annulations of the exterior are preserved were obtained at East Selkirk by Dr. Bell in 1880, by Messrs. T. C. Weston and A. McCharles in 1884 and by Mr. L. M. Lambe in 1890; at Grindstone Point, Lake Winnipeg, by Mr. Weston in 1884, and by Mr. J. B.

Dowling and Lambe in 1890. \"Very large but badly preserved specimens, which probably belong to the same species but which do not show the characteristic surface ornamentation, were col-\nlected at Lower Fort Garry, and at Dog Head, Lake Winnipeg, by Mr. Weston in 1884; at Big Island, by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889; at Black Bear Island (near Snake Island), by Messrs. Dowling and Lambe in 1890; and at Commissioners (or Cranberry) Island by Mr. Dowling in 1890.\"\n\n\"The largest specimen in which any considerable portion of the test is preserved is the one from East Selkirk collected by Mr. McCharles, the posterior moiety of which is represented by fig. 2, on Plate 5\" of the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada. \"It is upwards of seventeen inches and a half in length, three inches and a half in thickness at the smaller end and about four and a quarter at the larger. It is septate throughout, and its transverse annulations are comparatively narrow, there being five to an inch. The largest specimens without the test are upwards of two feet in length, and imperfect at both ends, while a large fragment, which, however, has been abnormally compressed, is eight inches in breadth by about fifteen in length. All of these also are septate throughout, and, so far, not a trace of the chamber of habitation can be found in any of the specimens from Manitoba. This is the more remarkable when it is borne in mind that the Wisconsin specimen of *E. subannulatum* figured by Professor Whitfield, which is represented as only two inches in breadth at the larger end, has no less than three inches and three-quarters of the body chamber preserved and only about an inch and three-quarters of the septate portion of the shell.\n\n\"In *Endoceras annulatum* the septa are stated to be 'more approximated than the annulations,' but in the present species the opposite is the case, the sutures of the septa being usually about twice as far apart as the breadth of the annulations. In the Manitoba specimens, which may possibly prove to be distinct from the typical *E. subannulatum*, there is a considerable amount of variation in the proportionate thickness of the annulations. Some medium-sized ones, a little less or a little more than two inches in thickness, have as few as three or four annulations to the inch and others as many as six. The annulations, although always rounded at the summit, are by no means always 'low,' as described by Professor Whitfield, but are often so prominent as to give a strongly ribbed appearance to the shell, and the concave spaces between them are not infrequently broader than the annulations themselves.\n\n\"Detached siphuncles of this species are by no means rare in Manitoba, the largest known to the writer (from Big Sturgeon Island) being fifteen inches and a-half in length, nearly one inch and a quarter thick at its smaller end, and two inches and an eighth at its larger. The very large and apparently single siphuncular sheath is elongated, conical and rather thin walled, the test of the wall being about half a millimetre thick. The endosiphon has not been observed.\"\nEndoceras (Narthecoceras) Crassisiphonatum, Whiteaves.\n\nEndoceras crassisiphonatum, Whiteaves....1891. Trans. Royal Soc., vol.

Endosiphon narrow and nearly cylindrical posteriorly, but widening irregularly and gradually anteriorly. At the anterior end of the thickest specimen collected (which is represented in outline on Plates 6, fig. 4, and 7, fig. 1\" of the paper in which the species was originally described) \"the diameter of the endosiphon is a little more than half that of the siphuncle.\" \"In another specimen (the original of figure 3 on Plate 6\" of the same paper) \"the interior of the narrow posterior end of the siphuncle appears to be portioned off by a few transverse concave dissepiments.\n\n\"Collected at Lower Fort Garry by Mr. Donald Gunn in 1858; and at East Selkirk by Dr. R.

Its actual length is three feet all but an inch, and it is obviously imperfect at both ends. It is the only specimen known to the writer in which the increase in thickness is very obvious. At the smaller end its maximum thickness is an inch and a tenth, and at the larger end just two inches. Its rate of increase, therefore, as already remarked, is three-tenths of an inch per foot.\n\n\"Another large fragment, collected by Mr. Lambe at East Selkirk, which is represented in outline, of natural size, on plate 6, fig. 1\" of the paper quoted, \"and which may be indicated as specimen No. 2, is about eight inches in length by two inches and three and a half-tenths in its maximum thickness at one end and not appreciably more at the\nother. Judging by its thickness, No. 2 could very well have formed part of the anterior end of No. 1, and both are from the same locality. At the rate of taper of three-tenths of an inch per foot, it is estimated that specimen No. 1 would have to be eight inches longer anteriorly than it now is before it could be as thick as No. 2. This would give thirty-five inches for No. 1, eight for No. 2 and eight for the interval between them, or a total of four feet and a quarter for the siphuncle only, which, even then, would be imperfect at both ends.\n\n\"In their proportionate thickness and probably submarginal position, as well as in the irregularity and gradual expansion of their endosiphons, these siphuncles seem to agree better with those of Endoceras than with those of Orthoceras proper. Although no clearly defined sheath or sheaths have yet been detected in them, they appear to be most nearly related to that section of the genus Endoceras which Professor Hyatt has differentiated under the name Sannionites, Waldheim, and in this view of their affinities the writer's opinion was endorsed by Professor Hyatt,\" who, however, has since indicated a new genus of Endoceratid\u00e6, which he proposes to call Narthecoceras, and based upon these siphuncles and those of Orthoceras Simpsoni, Billings. Specifically, these siphuncles also seem to differ from those of O. Simpsoni in their huge size and proportionate thickness, but more especially in their more rapid increase in thickness, though this increase is still so very gradual as to be not readily appreciable in the comparatively short fragments that are usually obtained.\"\n\n**Endoceras (Narthecoceras) Simpsoni**, Billings.

Youle Hind in 1858 at Cat Head, on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg, and is thus described by the late E. Billings. The specimen is a portion of the siphuncle, nine inches and one-fourth in length, eleven lines at the larger extremity, and ten at the smaller. It is nearly cylindrical, with a broad, shallow constriction above and below each of the narrow annulations which mark the attachment of the septa. There are eight of these septal rings at the following distances from each other, commencing at the smaller extremity: Between the 1st and 2nd, fourteen lines; 2nd and 3rd, twelve lines; 3rd and 4th, ten and a half lines; 4th and 5th, thirteen and a\nhalf lines; 5th and 6th, fifteen lines; 6th and 7th, thirteen and a half lines; 7th and 8th, twelve and a half lines. The annulations are nearly at right angles to the length, and we must infer from this fact either that the septa are scarcely at all concave, or that the siphuncle must be central or very nearly so. If in an orthoceratite the septa are flat, then, no matter whether the siphuncle be central or not, the septal annulations must be at right angles, but if the septa are concave then the annulations will be oblique if the siphuncle be at all removed from the centre. My impression is, that this is a large orthoceratite with distant septa and a nearly central siphuncle, since the annulations have a scarcely perceptible obliquity.\n\n\"It is one of those species in which the siphuncle became gradually filled with a solid calcareous animal secretion, with the exception of a narrow cylindrical channel along the centre. This central canal is clearly indicated in the specimen and has a diameter of nearly two lines.\n\n\"Dedicated to Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company.\"\n\nSince this description was published, a few specimens of siphuncles with very similar characters to those of *O. Simpsoni*, and which are therefore probably referable to that species, have been collected at each of the following localities in or on Lake Winnipeg: Dog Head, T. C. Weston, 1884, and L. M. Lambe, 1890; Little Black Island, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889, and D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe, 1890; Snake Island, Messrs. Dowling and Lambe, 1890; and Commissioners Island, D. B. Dowling, 1890.\n\nSome of the specimens from these localities are much longer and of course proportionately thicker than the type from Cat Head, but the increase in thickness in all of them is so slow as to be scarcely appreciable. In the type, the septal annulations certainly cross the siphuncle at nearly right angles, as described by Mr. Billings and as represented in his figure, a reproduction of which, in outline, is given on Plate 7, fig. 2, of the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, but in the majority of specimens there referred to *O. Simpsoni*, which have been collected since, this is by no means always the case. Thus, in a specimen from Dog Head, which is nearly two feet long and a portion of which is represented in outline on Plate 7, fig. 3, of the volume just referred to, the septal rings cross the siphuncle somewhat obliquely.\n\nThe only specimen, presumably referable to this species, in which any remains of the septa and outer shell are preserved, as well as the siphuncle, is the large fragment from Little Black Island, represented in outline by fig. 1 of Plate 8 of the volume cited. This specimen, which is about four inches in length and not quite three inches and a half in breadth, has been worn down on one side in such a way as to give a natural and\nlongitudinal section of the shell, showing the edges of the septa and the lateral margins next to the test, as well as the siphuncle. The latter is seen to be eccentric and sublateral but not quite marginal, and to occupy, at its thickest part, rather more than one-third of the entire diameter. As exposed in this section, the septa are seen to be rather deeply concave internally, but the nature of the markings of the exterior of the test is still unknown.\n\n**Actinoceras Richardsonii**, Stokes.\n\n*Actinoceras Richardsonii*, Stokes...........1840.

Specimens have since been collected by Mr. Dowling, in 1891, at nearly or possibly the same place, viz., on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg, opposite the north end of Selkirk Island, and at the north end of that island; also at Clark\u2019s or Limestone Point, eleven miles north of the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan. It is apparently abundant at Lower Fort Garry, where it was collected by D. Dale Owen in 1848, by Sir James Hector in 1857, by Donald Gunn in 1858, by Dr. R. Bell in 1879 and 1880, and by T. C. Weston and A. McCharles in 1884. It occurs also at East Selkirk, where it was collected by Mr. Weston and Mr. McCharles in 1884.\n\nThis species is represented in the Museum of the Survey by a fine series of specimens from the Red River valley. These shew that the rate of tapering in some specimens is rather more rapid than has generally been supposed. Thus, in the original of fig. 1, on Plate 8, of the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, in a length of four inches the maximum diameter of the shell increases from thirty-seven millimetres at the smaller end to sixty at the larger. The outline of a transverse section is usually circular, except when the specimen has been abnormally compressed. The surface markings consist of rather regularly disposed transverse and imbricating striae. The septa, as described by Mr. Foord, are \u201cfour lines distant where the shell has a diameter of three inches,\u201d and arch strongly forward and outward.\nThe very large submarginal and nummuloidal siphuncle varies in its proportionate size in different specimens, though its maximum diameter is usually more than half that of the shell. It is very strongly inflated between the septa, and both acutely and narrowly constricted at the places where they join it. In the longitudinal section of a specimen of this species represented by fig. 2 of Plate 9 of the volume referred to, the posterior segment of the siphuncle is thirty-six millimetres in maximum breadth and nine in height, while the last perfect segment anteriorly is forty-seven mm. in its greatest breadth by ten in height. The endosiphon and the lateral tubuli which proceed from it are all well shown in this and in similar sections.\n\nFigures 3 and 3a on Plate 9 of the volume cited represent the apical extremity of what appears to be an abnormally flattened specimen of this species, in which the outline of a transverse section at the larger end (fig. 3a) is elliptical and not circular.\n\n**Actinoceras Bigsbyi?

Specimens, which the writer has referred to *A. Bigsbyi*, have since been collected in the Red River valley, at East Selkirk, by A. McCharles in 1884; and on or around Lake Winnipeg, at Little\nBlack Island, by J. B. Tyrrell in 1889 and by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890; at Big Sturgeon Island by Mr. Dowling and Mr. Lambe in 1890; and at the mouth of the Fisher River by Mr. Dowling in 1891.\n\nAlthough part of the test is preserved on some of the specimens from these localities, it is invariably so much worn or weathered as to shew no trace of the \"longitudinal, undulated, thread-like lines\" which suggested to Hall the specific name *tenuifilum*. The surface markings, however, are rarely preserved in specimens of *O. Bigsbyi* from the Black River or Trenton limestones of the provinces of Ontario or Quebec.\n\nThe siphuncles of the specimens from Lake Winnipeg and the Red River valley, which are here referred to *A. Bigsbyi*, are quite different in their contour to those of *A. Richardsonii*. In the former the siphuncle consists of prominent annular ridges, with deeply and obliquely excavated grooves between them, and the latter of a single series of large anchylosed nummuloidal discs, with rounded edges. A portion of a siphuncle, from Snake Island, Lake Winnipeg, which is crushed almost flat but somewhat obliquely, and which may represent an extreme form of *A. Bigsbyi*, has the annular ridges low and rounded and the grooves or constrictions between them unusually broad and shallow. The longitudinal section of a specimen from Little Black Island represented on Plate 10, fig. 2, of the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, \"shews the opening of the large foramen directly into the endosiphon posteriorly, and some of the lateral canals or tubuli, which radiate first outward and then outward and forward, from the endosiphon. Not a vestige of the chamber of habitation of this species, nor of that of *A. Richardsoni*, has yet been discovered.\"\n\nThe types of *Actinoceras Bigsbyi* are from Thessalon Island, Lake Huron, where they were collected by Dr. Bigsby in 1820. In the \"Geology of Canada\" (1863), specimens which were identified by E. Billings with *A. Bigsbyi* (under the name *Orthoceras Bigsbii*) are recorded as occurring, in Ontario, on Campement d'Ours Island, on the Palladeau, Manitoulin and Lacloche Islands and on Snake Island, in Lake Huron,\u2014at Loughborough, Dickson's Mills, near Pakenham and Cornwall; in Quebec, at Point Claire (on the island of Montreal,) Montreal, St. Ambroise and Lake St. John. The specimens from Montreal are from the Trenton limestone, but all the others from the localities just cited, in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, are from the Black River limestone.\n\n**Actinoceras Allumettense**, Billings.

The specimen is a little more than six inches in length, by nineteen millimetres in its maximum diameter at the smaller end and thirty-six at the larger. It was identified with the present species, with some confidence, after a careful comparison with four of Billings's types of O. Allumetense, from Paquette's Rapids, on the Ottawa River. A specimen collected by Messrs. Dowling and Lambe at Black Bear Island, Lake Winnipeg, in 1890, which consists of a natural but much weathered longitudinal section of the shell, about eight inches in length, in a piece of limestone, is also probably referable to this species.\n\nA. Allumetense seems to be intermediate in its characters between Actinoceras and Sactoceras, and should, perhaps, be referred to the latter genus rather than to the former. Still, in the Orthoceras Richteri of Barrande, which is stated by Professor Hyatt to be the type of his genus Sactoceras, the height and breadth of the siphuncular segments, which are moniliform rather than nummuloidal, are represented as nearly equal, whereas in A. Allumetense these segments are nearly twice as broad as high, and therefore more nearly nummuloidal.\n\nActinoceras (Deiroceras) Python, Billings.

At the apex, posteriorly, nearly the whole of the first chamber is filled up with the first segment of the siphuncle, which is twelve millimetres in its maximum diameter. In the next five or six chambers, the siphuncular segments fill the greater part of the space, and average from fifteen to sixteen millimetres in their maximum diameter, after which the siphuncle decreases so rapidly in size that in the fourth chamber from the body chamber, the maximum diameter of the segment therein contained is only five mm.

The remarks which Professor Hyatt makes upon S. docens, however, are quite as applicable to the Canadian species. In reference to the former, he states that 'it is a transition form' but we place it in this genus because at an age when an Actinoceras would have the rosettes large and perfect, this species begins to lose them, and the siphon decreases also. The reduction of the siphon is a degradational senile shrinkage, and it occasions the loss of the rosettes. M. Barrande views this old stage of the siphon as a return to the tubular siphon, but in our opinion we cannot call this a tubular siphon. As a matter of fact it is a modified nummuloidal siphon, as may be seen by comparison with others.\"\nOrthoceras Winnipegense, Whiteaves.\n\nOrthoceras Winnipegense, Whiteaves...1891. Trans.

Dowling and Lambe at Berens or Swampy Island, and the other, which is six inches broad, by Mr. Dowling at Commissioners Island. Both are broadly ovate or ovately subcircular in a full front view, and both shew the infolding of the lip, which seems to be characteristic of the genus.\n\n\"This species is provisionally referred to Poterioceras, on account of its supposed simple and entire aperture, but it may prove to be a true Gomphoceras.\"\n\"The genus *Poterioceras* was thus originally defined by M'Coy:\u2014'Shell fusiform, short; mouth contracted; siphuncle dilated between the chambers, eccentric. Distinguished from the true *Orthoceratites* by its short fusiform contour, and contracted mouth.' This diagnosis is accompanied by a small diagram, which shews that, although the body chamber narrows rapidly from its commencement up to the aperture, yet the aperture itself is simple and entire, and neither T-shaped or lobate as in *Gomphoceras*, nor contracted in the middle and expanded at both ends as in *Phragmoceras*.\n\n\"The validity of the genus *Poterioceras* is not recognized by Barrande, Fischer, Zittel and others, who place the name among the synonyms of *Gomphoceras*. On the other hand, in the first part of his Monograph of the British Fossil Cephalopoda,\" Professor J. F. Blake \"accords full generic rank to *Poterioceras* on the ground that 'the only species described by M'Coy, as well as his diagram, indicates a genus with the form of a *Gomphoceras* without its peculiar aperture.' In the same volume, Professor Blake contends that *Oncoceras*, Hall, is synonymous with *Poterioceras*, and states that Professor Hall's \"actual type, as well as others which have been referred to the genus, in no respects differ from M'Coy's genus. To this contention the present writer feels compelled to demur, as the statement by which it is supported seems to be at variance with the known facts of the case. If the genus *Poterioceras* is to be retained at all, in the sense in which it was defined by M'Coy, the name will probably have to be restricted to those straight *Gomphoceras*-like shells in which the aperture is simple and entire, and it is in accordance with this definition of its character that the name will be used in the present paper. In *Oncoceras*, on the other hand, the shell is always distinctly curved and inflated in a peculiar manner in advance of the midlength, while its body chamber is transversely constricted just behind the aperture. According to Professor Hall the aperture of *Oncoceras* is constricted, but as Mr. E. Billings asserts that it is oval,* the constriction referred to by Hall may have been meant to refer to that immediately behind the aperture.\"\n\nIn the outline drawing of the type of the species on Plate 14 of the seventh volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, although the contour and exact dimensions of the original are correctly represented, the sutural lines are slightly restored and the supposed outline of the aperture, on one side of the specimen, is indicated by a dotted line.\n\n**Poterioceras apertum**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Poterioceras apertum*, Whiteaves... ...1889.

From P. nobile it seems to be readily separable by its much smaller size, more slender contour, and more compressed sides.\n\nIn Professor Blake's original description of P. intortum * (which, by the way, seems to be very closely allied to P. apertum) the following\n\n* On page 187 of the first part of his \"Monograph of the British Fossil Cephalopoda,\" London, 1882.\nsentence occurs: \"The shell thickens near the aperture, but at last a sudden inbending takes place to an opening much smaller than the general section. This may, of course, be an abnormal feature.\" The thickening of the shell towards the aperture and its \"sudden inbending\" are so well shown in the two specimens of *P. apertum* from Little Black Island, represented on Plate 11, section 4, of the ninth volume of Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, that these characters can scarcely be considered as accidental or even abnormal. The original of fig. 2, on this plate, is slightly and rather irregularly worn down in the siphonal region, in such a way as to give a natural and longitudinal section of the whole shell, very near to the surface. Posteriorly, the weathering of this specimen exposes six or seven of the septa and five segments of the very eccentric siphuncle. Anteriorly, it gives a section of the whole of the body chamber, and, more particularly, of the thickening and inbending of the test at the aperture, though in this particular specimen the thickening and inbending happen to be very slight. The specimen whose aperture only is represented by fig. 3 on the same plate is so weathered as to give a natural and longitudinal section of part of the shell, but the section of the aperture is nearly through the centre of the latter. In this specimen the thickening and infolding of the test at the aperture are strongly marked, the test being fully six millimetres thick at its recurved extremity, and the aperture appreciably diminished in size by the infolding of the lip.\n\nAs stated elsewhere,* in the original description of this species, of *Oncoceras magnum*, *O. gibbosum* (Whiteaves not Hall, = *O. Whiteavesii*, Miller) and *Cyrtoceras Manitobense*, their convex sides were inadvertently designated as dorsal and their straighter sides as ventral, in accordance with the old terminology. In the amended descriptions of these species in this Report, the use of such terms as ventral, dorsal and the like is purposely avoided, as it is not quite clear which is really the venter and which the dorsum of either.\n\n**Poterioceras gracile**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Poterioceras gracile*, Whiteaves\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20261892.

On the siphonal side the margin of the septate portion is shallowly concave posteriorly and slightly convex anteriorly. Body chamber oblique, short, occupying about one-third the entire length, contracted and obliquely truncated anteriorly. At its commencement posteriorly the body chamber is broad and bounded by a rather deep, obliquely transverse groove, which is almost parallel to the septa nearest to it; in front of this groove the chamber narrows rapidly, but at first convexly, towards the aperture, behind which there is a broad and shallowly concave constriction.

In a letter recently received, Professor Hyatt says of this specimen: 'The suture has a decided broad ventral lobe and lateral lobes, and internally there is an impressed zone showing a true close coiled nautilian form. The siphuncle is ventrad of the centre, small and with delicate walls.' *Nautilus Hercules* of Billings, from the Hudson River formation of the Island of Anticosti, which Hyatt doubtfully refers to the genus *Liloceras*, has a broad flattened venter and a similar kind of coiling to that of *E. plicatus*, but both sides of the outer volution of *Nautilus Hercules* are distinctly angular.\"\n\n**Discoceras Canadense.

Inner volution nearly smooth, marked only with fine and crowded transverse striae.\n\nSiphuncle placed near the margin of the inner and probably dorsal side: sutures of the septa unknown.\n\nMaximum diameter of the most perfect specimen collected: two inches and a half.\n\nLittle Black Island, Lake Winnipeg, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889, one specimen; and Commissioners (or Cranberry) Island, D. B. Dowling, 1890, the specimen figured. The slight lateral flattening observable on both of them is apparently abnormal and probably due to compression subsequent to their fossilization.\nThis species is placed in the genus *Discoceras* solely on a count of the dorsal position of its siphuncle, and at the suggestion of Professor Hyatt, who has seen one of the specimens. Externally it is very similar, especially in the style of its surface markings, to the fossil from Lorette, in the province of Quebec, which Mr. A. H. Foord described and figured under the name *Trohoceras Halli* on page 42, figs. 4, a-b, of the second part of his Catalogue of the Fossil Cephalopoda of the British Museum, but in specimens from several localities in that province, in the Museum of the Survey, which are apparently referable to *T. Halli*, the siphuncle is placed on the venter.\n\n**Trohoceras (?) McCharlesii**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Trohoceras McCharlesii*, Whiteaves.......1889. Trans. Royal Soc. Canada, vol. VII., sect. 4, p. 81, pl. 16.\n\n\"Shell very large (the only specimen known to the writer, which is septate throughout, having a maximum diameter of ten inches and a-half) and composed of about three apparently separate but closely contiguous volutions, which are circular in transverse section, and which increase rather slowly in size: they are also slightly asymmetrical and enrolled on very nearly but not quite the same plane, the spire being sunk a little below the highest level of the outer whorl.\n\n\"Surface of the outer volution marked by very numerous, close-set, rounded and flexuous ribs, which are rather narrow but unequal in size, with an average breadth of about three millimetres.\" Across the sides the ribs curve obliquely and convexly backward and outward, and on the periphery each rib makes a broad, shallowly concave and backwardly directed sinus.\n\nOn and near the periphery or venter, the only place where they happen to be visible, the sutural lines run parallel with the ribs on the test, though the former are placed much further apart, the average distance between them being about nineteen millimetres. Position of the siphuncle unknown.\n\nThe specimen upon which this species was based was collected at East Selkirk by Mr. A. McCharles in 1884. About one-third of this specimen has been broken off, but the part remaining presents a very instructive transverse section of the shell at a right angle to the direction of the volutions. A considerable portion of the test is well preserved on the outer volution, and in those places where the test has been accidentally removed, the characters of the septa are well shown. The two inner whorls are not nearly so well preserved as the outer volution, and the asymmetry and separation of all three are best exhibited in the transverse section afforded by the specimen.\nA few specimens showing traces of a similar surface ornamentation, which are therefore possibly referable to this species, were collected at Little Black Island, Lake Winnipeg, by J. B. Tyrrell in 1889, and by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890. One of these is a rough cast of one side of the greater part of the outer volution (with a small portion of the test preserved) about twenty-seven inches in length, as measured along the middle of the side and following its curve, the septate portion occupying about nine inches thereof posteriorly. This specimen, which appears to have been abnormally compressed laterally, is about four inches and three-quarters in its dorso-ventral diameter posteriorly and about five inches anteriorly. It is regularly curved posteriorly, but straighter anteriorly. Another is a rough cast of one side of an almost straight but very slightly curved and much more slender specimen, which is sixteen inches in length, as measured along the middle of the gentle curve of the side, and two inches and three quarters in its dorso-ventral diameter at about the midlength. A third is a mould of the exterior of one side of the outer volution, upwards of six inches in diameter, and shewing posteriorly impressions of fine transverse ribs, but much worn and indefinite anteriorly. In another large fragment from this locality the ribbing is unusually fine and the ribs average scarcely a millimetre in breadth. All four, however, are much too imperfect and too badly preserved to be satisfactorily determined.\n\nIn addition to these, a few coarse and very imperfect casts of large nautilian or gyroceran shells, which represent at least two and perhaps more species, but which shew no indications of the position of the siphuncle, nor any trace of the surface markings, and which cannot at present be determined even generically, were collected at Dog Head by Mr. Weston in 1884, and at Clark's Point and the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan by Mr. Dowling in 1890. In most of these specimens, if not in all, the sutures of the septa appear to curve concavely backward on each of the sides, and probably form single, convex saddles on the periphery, whereas in *Trochoceras McCharlesii* the sutures curve convexly forward on the sides, and concavely backward on the periphery.\nCRUSTACEA.\n\nOSTRACODA.\n\nAPARCHITES WHITEAVESII, JONES.\n\n*Aparchites Whiteavesii*, Jones\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20261889.

Clarke, who has recently studied an extensive series of specimens of *Isotelus gigas* and *I. maximus (megistos)* from the Trenton limestone of the state of New York, says that he is convinced that the only valid distinction between these forms is the absence of cheek spines in the one and their presence in the other. He also adopts the name *Isotelus gigas* in preference to *Asaphus platycephalus*, on the ground that \"none of the figures given by Stokes shew the structure of the genal angles, and it is therefore wholly a matter of presumption whether his specimens were of the same character as those afterwards fully described and illustrated by De Kay.\" (Op. cit. supra., p. 706.)\nMost of the trilobites from the Winnipeg and Red River limestones have scarcely any portion of the crust preserved, and the specimens referable to *Asaphus* or *Isotelus* in particular are often so imperfect that it is scarcely possible to ascertain whether they had genal spines or not. In addition to the four specimens here identified with *Asaphus* (*Isotelus*) *Susa*, which are probably not sufficiently distinct from *I. gigas*, an imperfect left free cheek of a large *Isotelus*, with the genal angles distinctly rounded, which appears to be referable to *I. gigas*, was collected at Cat Head by D. B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890. This specimen must have been about twenty inches in length when entire. The maximum diameter of the eye is twenty millimetres, and the breadth of the cheek, immediately below the eye, is four inches and a half.\n\nSeveral small specimens of an *Isotelus*, which do not show the characters of the genal angles at all clearly, but which are also probably referable to *I. gigas*, were collected at Cat Head by Mr. Weston in 1884, and by Messrs. Dowling and Lambe in 1890; at Kinwow Bay by Mr. Weston in 1884; and at Inmost or Birch Island by Mr. Weston in 1884 and by Messrs. Dowling and Lambe in 1890. The largest of these specimens are from three and a half to four inches in length. One of the specimens from Inmost Island is nearly entire, though most of the test is exfoliated, and one from Cat Head is a natural mould of the exterior of the dorsal surface of an entire specimen. In each of these, the cranial shield and pygidium are narrowly rounded or somewhat pointed in the middle. Two of the specimens from Inmost Island are separate glabella; two, cephalic shields with the lower surface exposed and showing the doublure, one with the hypostoma in place; and one is a small separate hypostoma.\n\n**Asaphus (Isotelus) maximus**, Locke.\n\n*Isotelus maximus*, Locke .......... .......... 1838.

B. Dowling and L. M. Lambe in 1890. Although imperfect at both ends the actual length of this free cheek is upward of seven inches.\n\n* But, in the \"Report of the Geology of Ohio,\" vol. I. (1873) p. 159, Meek gives 1842 and 1843 as the dates on which the species was described under this name.\nA badly preserved mould of the exterior of the dorsal surface of a nearly entire specimen of a small trilobite, which is also probably referable to *I. maximus*, and which has a short cheek spine at each of the genal angles, was collected near the First Limestone Point on Lake Winnipeg, north of the Saskatchewan, in a loose piece of limestone, by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell in 1890. The length of this specimen is one inch and three quarters.\n\nTwo doubled up and nearly entire specimens, which are probably referable to this species, though no vestige of the genal spines is preserved in either, were collected by Mr. Weston in 1884, one at Big Grindstone Point, Lake Winnipeg, and the other at Dog Head, on that lake. In both of these specimens, but especially in the one from Dog Head, the cephalic shield and pygidium are almost triangular in outline, with the apices obtusely pointed, and the sides nearly straight.\n\n**Ill\u00e6nus Americanus**, Billings.\n\n*Ill\u00e6nus Americanus*, Billings..............1859.

Zittel, in the first volume of his Handbuch der Palaeontologie, published in 1883, places it, with doubt, with some other genera, at the end of the Cyclostomata, in the Bryozoa; and Nicholson & Lyddeker, in the first volume of their Manual of Palaeontology, published in 1889, refer it provisionally to the Hydrozoa. More recently, however, Dr. A. Brown, in a paper published in the Geological Magazine for April and May, 1894, claims that it is a calcare-\nous alga, on the ground that \"no recent coelenterate has zooidal tubes as minute, or nearly as minute, as those of *Solenopora*. Its structure is,\" he says, \"truly cellular and not tubular.\" In the same paper, Professor H. A. Nicholson is quoted as saying: \"We cannot refer it to the Hydrozoa, for we are not acquainted with any hydrozoon, living or extinct, with which *Solenopora* could be compared. It shows no features in its minute structures which remind us of the hydrocorallines, and it assuredly presents no structural resemblance to any known type of the Stromatoporoids.\"\n\n**CH\u00c6TETES PERANTIQUUS.

Corallites of one kind only, in complete contact throughout their entire length, and averaging a little more than half a millimetre in their longer diameter, and a little less than half a mm. in their shorter. As seen in transverse sections near the surface, such as that represented by fig. 17, the corallites are variable but for the most part nearly oval or almost circular in outline, with a depressed space or groove round each, and with single minute interspaces between them. The two features last named, however, are purely superficial, for\ntransverse sections made lower down (fig. 18) shew that the walls of adjoining corallites are completely amalgamated and solid below the calyces. Longitudinal sections (fig. 19) shew that the corallites are provided with complete and rather distant traverse diaphragms or tabulae.\n\nLower Fort Garry, T. C. Weston, 1884: one imperfect specimen about two inches and a half by two inches in diameter, with part of its upper surface covered with a colony of *Protarava* (*vetusta? var.*) *magna*.\n\nThis species is referred to the genus *Chuetetes* on the authority of Mr. Ulrich, who has carefully examined the specimen upon which it is based, and who was the first to recognize its structural characters and generic position. It is of special interest as occurring at such a low geological horizon. Its more minute surface characters are somewhat similar to those of *Chatetes tumidus*, as represented by Milne Edwards and Haime, on Plate 45, fig. 3b, of their Monograph of the British Fossil Corals, published by the Palaeontographical Society. The exact systematic position of *Chuetetes* has yet to be ascertained. In a letter recently received, Mr. Ulrich expresses the opinion that it is not a polyzoon or bryozoon, but a coral, and it is in accordance with this view that the preceding description was written, and the terms \"corallum\" and \"corallites\" used rather than zoarium and zoecia. He is inclined to think that *Chuetetes* is most nearly related to *Labechia*.\n\nB.\u2014From the passage beds at the top of the Lower Sandstones.\n\nALG\u00c6.\n\n*Licrophycus Ottawaensis*, Billings.\n\n*Licrophycus Ottawaensis*, Billings........ 1862.

FROM KEEWATIN.\n\nA. I.\u2014FROM THE ATTAWAPISKAT RIVER.\n\nCOLLECTED BY DR. R. BELL IN 1886.\n\nThe exposures of fossiliferous limestone on the lower portion of this river are described on pages 27c and 28c of Dr. Bell's \"Report on an exploration of portions of the At-ta-wa-pish-kat and Albany rivers, Lonely Lake to James Bay,\" which forms part of the Annual Report of this Survey for 1886, New Series, vol. II. The fossils were collected at Rainy Island (N. Lat. 53\u00b0 05', W. Long. 84\u00b0 23') and seventeen to thirty miles below Rainy Island. Those from the first of these localities are referred to on page 27c, and those from the second on page 28c, of Dr. Bell's Report. In that report, the few and for the most part fragmentary fossils from each of these localities were provisionally stated to be probably of Devonian age. But, the subsequent receipt of a fine series of fossils from similar rocks on the Ekwan River, collected by Mr. Dowling in 1901, has convinced the writer, as elsewhere stated,* that not only the fossiliferous limestones of the Attawapiskat, but also those of the Fawn River (or branch of the Severn), are of Silurian age.\n\nANTHOZOA.\n\nTETRACORALLA.\n\nZaphrentis Stokesi, Edwards and Haime.\n\nZaphrentis Stokesi, Milne Edwards and Haime...1851.

Gothlandica, and the same remark applies to all the specimens that are referred to under this name in this paper. The Devonian specimens, with septal squamulae, that were identified with F.

As Mr. Schuchert suggests that this western fossil may not be the same as the eastern Rochester shale species, it will be convenient in this paper to refer to the former as Strophedonta Niagarensis. The valve from Rainy Island is moderately convex, and marked with minute crowded radii, of two sizes, also with faint corrugations at the hinge line.\nSeventeen to thirty miles below Rainy Island: a large but very imperfect valve, that seems also to be rather nearly related to *S. Niagarensis*, but that may be distinct from the Rainy Island specimen. The former is proportionally more convex, and tumid or geniculate at or about the midlength, and its sculpture is slightly different from that of the latter.\n\n**Orthis**, sp. indet.\n\nSeventeen to thirty miles below Rainy Island: three imperfect and badly preserved specimens of an apparently rather coarsely ribbed species.\n\n**Meristina (?) expansa**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 27, figs. 6, 6 a, and 7.\n\n*Meristina (?) expansa*, Whiteaves ..........1904.

It is by no means clear whether the beak of the ventral valve of any of them is perforate or not. They are provisionally and very doubtfully referred to *Meristina*, on account of their general resemblance in external form to the European *M. tumida*, but it may be that they should rather be referred to *Meristella* or *Reticularia*.

They are longicone and increase very slowly in thickness, nearly circular in transverse section, and encircled, at more or less regular intervals, by narrow and rather deep, obliquely transverse constrictions. Between these constrictions the siphuncle is laterally compressed and but slightly expanded, while its tranverse diameter is from two to three times as great as the distance between the constrictions.\n\n\"The surface markings of these siphuncles consist of fine, close-set longitudinal striae,\" and their internal structure is as represented by fig. 8 on Plate 30.\n\nRainy Island: three fine and rather slender specimens. The best of these, \"which shows ten of the siphuncular constrictions, is three inches and nearly a half in length, by twelve millimetres in diameter near the smaller end, and twenty two near the larger. In this specimen the width of the siphuncle is about twice as great as the distances between the constrictions. In another equally slender but shorter specimen from the same locality, which shows seven siphuncular constrictions, the width of the siphuncle is nearly three times as great as the distance between the constrictions, at the smaller end; and only twice as great as at the larger.\" Similar specimens have since been found on the Ekwan and Winisk rivers.\nThe only other fossil Cephalopoda collected on the Attawapiskat by Dr. Bell are (1) a rough cast of the interior of part of the shell of a slender, longicone orthoceratite; and (2) a fragment of the mould of the exterior of a large straight, subcylindrical shell, shewing four distant linear longitudinal grooves; both from Rainy Island.\n\nA 2.\u2014FROM THE EKWAN* RIVER.\n\nCOLLECTED BY MR.

Most of the letter press which relates to these fossils is reprinted from that Appendix, but the twenty three new species described therein are here illustrated for the first time.\n\nCommencing at thirty-five miles from its mouth, there are five exposures of limestone on the Ekwan, from which these fossils were collected.

Pedicle valve flattened somewhat obliquely, most convex and deepest at a short distance from the beak, nearly as wide as long, broadly rounded in front, more narrowly rounded at the sides, and obtusely pointed behind, the umbo and beak being moderately produced, their lateral margins meeting at an angle of about 98\u00b0, and the beak gently incurved. Characters of the interior of this valve unknown.\"\n\"Brachial valve regularly but moderately convex, most prominent externally at or about the midlength, a little wider than long, broadly rounded in front and less so at the sides, as in the pedicle valve, but abruptly contracted at the umbo, which is narrowly rounded and but slightly produced, while its beak is strongly incurved and recurved. Casts of the interior of this valve are marked with a longitudinal, linear, median groove, that represents the median plate and that extends from the umbo almost to the front margin, also with a lateral and slightly divergent linear groove, on each side, that extends from the umbo to a little beyond the midlength.\n\n\"Surface of both valves marked only with a few distinct concentric lines of growth.\"\n\nPortage road at falls: \"one imperfect and badly preserved specimen with both valves in situ, a nearly perfect pedicle valve, three imperfect brachial valves with most of the test preserved, and a cast of the interior of a large brachial valve.\n\n\"Judging by these specimens, this species would appear to belong to the group of T. acuminata rather than to that of T. grandis, though it seems to be always much shorter and wider than T. acuminata, T. Ohioensis or T. Lindstr\u00f6emi. The marginal contour of its brachial valve is not very unlike that of T. Lindstr\u00f6emii, but in the latter this valve is represented as flattened anteriorly to the umbo, and its pedicle valve has quite a different outline, the umbo being proportionately broader laterally, and the beak straight rather than incurved.\n\nTrimerella borealis, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 25, figs. 3 & 3 a.\n\nTrimerella borealis, Whiteaves....... .... 1902.

Each of these specimens is a portion of a longicone orthoceratite, with a circular transverse section, a central or nearly central siphuncle, and marked with narrow longitudinal ridges, separated by wider grooves or intervals, with minute, close-set, transverse, raised lines between them. Specimens with similar external characters have been found in the Niagara and Guelph formations at three localities in Ontario and Quebec. These are the Orthoceras Cadmus, of Billings, from Grimsby and Elora; a specimen from Elora that the writer has referred to O. Scammoni; and a specimen from L'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe, near Port Daniel, in the Baie des Chaleurs, in the Museum of the Survey, labelled O. virgatum by E. Billings.\n\n\"O. Cadmus, O. subcancellatum and O. orus are names that have been given to this shell on the assumption that Hall's Orthoceras cancellatum is not the same as the Orthoceratites cancellatus of Eichwald. Billings, in a paper entitled 'New Species of Fossils from the Clinton and Niagara formations' and published with his 'Catalogues of the Silurian Fossils of the Island of Anticosti', says that his O. Cadmus appears to be O. cancellatum, Hall, not Eichwald. And in the explanation of fig. 11, of Plate 19 (10) of the Twentieth Regent's Report, Hall says that the character of the surface of impressions of the exterior of specimens from Wisconsin\nand Illinois that he figures and refers to *O. angulatum* and *O. virgatum*, is 'precisely like that of *O. cancellatum*, Hall, from the Niagara group of New York, and differs in no essential particular from the minute surface markings of *O. columnare*.' But Dr. Foord has shown that Eichwald's *Orthoceratites cancellatus* is an *Endoceras*, and the specific name *cancellatum* does not appear to be preoccupied in *Orthoceras*, and certainly is not in *Kionoceras*. And if it be objected that 'once a synonym always a synonym', then the next specific name to be selected would seem to be *K.* or (*O.*) *Scammoni*, if Hall's *O. cancellatum* is not the same as the *O. canaliculatum* of Sowerby.'\n\n**Orthoceras**, sp. indet.\n\nApparently brevicone; longitudinally ridged, ridges unequal in size and irregular in distribution.\n\nPortage road at falls: a fragment that is not sufficiently long to shew conclusively whether it formed part of a brevicone orthoceratite or not.\n\n**Orthoceras Ekwanense**, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 33, figs. 1 & 1a.\n\n*Orthoceras Ekwanense*, Whiteaves ..........1904.

Billings adopted the name *Cheirurus* in preference to *Ceraurus* for the Canadian species of that genus, and in a list of Lower Silurian fossils in the Geology of Canada (1863) gives 1815 as the date of publication of *Cheirurus*, Beyrich. But, Salter, in his Monograph of the British Silurian Trilobites, and the United States palaeontologists, give 1832 as the date of publication of *Ceraurus* by Green, and 1845 as that of *Cheirurus* by Beyrich, and consequently use the former of these names.\n\nIn the second part of the third volume of the Final Report on the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota, Dr. J. M. Clarke places *C. Tarquinius* in the same group, or section of the genus, as *C. pleurexanthemus*. But it seems to the writer that the pygidium of a Port Daniel specimen of *C.

The more perfect of the two, a small ventral valve, is moderately convex, wider than long, and its cardinal angles are produced. Its surface markings consist of fine radiating raised lines, with from two to six still smaller ones between each pair of the larger ones. The characters of the interior are not shewn in either. Both of them are from loose pieces at or near the mouth of the river.\n\nOne good sized and fairly well preserved specimen, collected at an exposure ten miles above the mouth of the river, has been kindly compared with typical western specimens of S. Niagarensis, by Mr. C. Schuchert. These western shells, Mr. Schuchert thinks, are \"more convex, and their larger striae more prominent, causing the intermediate areas with the finer striae to be more depressed,\" but these may be only local peculiarities. At the same locality three other Strophomenoids were collected, which may prove to be varieties of S. Niagarensis, but which do not shew the characters of the hinge area, or of the interior of either valve. One is a small ventral, with very fine and equal radiating striae. The other two are medium sized detached valves that are moderately convex, or tumid, gibbous and geniculate, at about the midlength, wider than long, with the cardinal angles slightly produced, and the front margin nasute. Their surface markings consist of minute, fasciculate, radiating raised lines, with minute punctures between them. According to Mr. Schuchert, S. Niagarensis is \"closely related to Strophomena imbrex, Pander, variety, as identified by Lindstr\u00f6m from the Silurian of Gotland,\" and E. Billings has recognized and recorded S. imbrex as occurring in the Hudson River formation at Cape Robert, Anticosti.\n\nA concave dorsal valve from an exposure thirty-one miles above the mouth of the river, may also be referable to S.

The spiral cones in the Winisk shell are directed toward the dorsal side, but I cannot see the jugum. For the present I would refer it to Glassia. In external characters it is very near to G. subovata (Sowerby) but the difference in the spiralia will distinguish them, as the latter has the cones inwardly or medially directed. This difference is certainly of specific value, but for the present I should not regard it as of generic importance, as different genera of the Atrypidae have the spiralia directed either laterally, medially or dorsally.\"\n\nMOLLUSCA.\n\nGASTEROPODA.\n\nEuomphalus, sp. indet.\n\nA cast of the interior of a specimen of a closely coiled Euomphalus, that is perhaps conspecific with a similar cast from the lower rapid of the Ekwan.

The spiniform septa consist of both longitudinal and transverse rows of close-set, very short, straight and inwardly directed, minute spinules, not very unlike those of a Silurian Favosite, but much smaller and shorter. Where the tabulae are comparatively far apart, the longitudinal arrangement of the rows of spinules is very obvious, and there are from four to seven spinules in each longitudinal row, between two of the tabulae. But, in places where the tabulae are close together, the transverse arrangement of the rows of spinules is more apparent, and there are either one or two transverse rows of spinules between two tabulae.\n\n\"The general shape of the corallites in this genus, their mode of growth and their internal tabulae, appear to be essentially similar to those of Pycnostylus, but in the latter the septa are marginal, well developed, and consist of thin, continuous, longitudinal ridges.\n\n\"Pycnostylus seems to be most nearly related to Amplexus, which is usually referred to the Zaphrentidae, and it may be that Aphyllostylus should also be included in that family.\n\n\"Aphyllostylus gracilis, sp. nov.\n\n\"Corallites slender, averaging about two or three millimetres in diameter; septal spinules very minute, scarcely visible to the naked eye.\n\n\"This genus and species are based upon fragments of colonies, in six small pieces of limestone of Silurian (Upper Silurian) age, from Stonewall, about thirty-one miles west of East Selkirk, collected by J. B. Tyrrell in 1897. Each of these pieces of limestone shows both longitudinal and transverse sections of a few contiguous corallites, upon one or more of its recently broken surfaces. The internal structure of most of these corallites is well preserved, but their mode of branching is nowhere very clearly seen. Two or three similar specimens had previously been collected by the writer in 1888 from loose masses of limestone on the banks of the Fairford River, about six or seven miles below the Hudson Bay post at Fairford, Manitoba.\"\nHEXACORALLA.\n\nFAVOSITES GOTHLANDICUS, Lamarck.\n\nCommon.\n\nFAVOSITES ASPER, d\u2019Orbigny.\n\n*Favosites alveolaris*, Lonsdale........... ...1839.

The only figure in each.\n\n*Tripleuroceras Robsoni*, Whiteaves. . . . . . . 1898. Ottawa Naturalist, vol. XII, no. 6, p. 123.\n\nOriginal description: \"Shell large, robust, longicone, straight and increasing very slowly in breath and thickness, flattened in the broad siphonal and presumably ventral region, but rounded and much narrower at the sides: characters of the antisiphonal side and nature of the surface markings unknown. Sutures of the septa broadly and concavely arched on the venter, nearly straight where they pass over the sides; the three or four next to the body chamber closer together than those which immediately precede them. Siphuncle marginal, presumably ventral, large, expanded between the septa and apparently nummuloidal.\n\n\"Three imperfect and badly preserved casts of the interior of shells of this species, from Stonewall, Manitoba, were presented to the Museum of the Survey in the fall of 1897, two by Mr. W. H. Robson, of Lethbridge, Alberta, and one by Mr. Donald Gunn, of Stonewall. The whole of the antisiphonal and presumably dorsal region of each of these specimens is buried in a very hard dolomitic limestone, so that it is doubtful whether they are referable to Hyatt's genus or not. The two presented by Mr. Robson are septate throughout, and the larger one\" which is figured on\nPlate 32, \"has a nearly cylindrical, septate but possibly adventitious object, like a cast of the interior of the shell of a small Orthoceras, some two inches in length and fully half an inch in thickness, exposed in the middle of its siphuncle posteriorly. The one presented by Mr. Gunn\" which is figured on Plate 31, \"has a considerable portion of the ventral side of the body chamber preserved but the lateral margin on both sides is very imperfect.\n\n\"The species seems to differ from the \"Orthoceras (Actinoceras) Beloitense\" of Whitfield,* from the Trenton limestone of Wisconsin, which it resembles in some respects, in its more flattened venter, more concavely arched septa in the ventral region, and in its proportionately larger and apparently nummuloidal siphuncle.\"\n\nBut, in regard to the siphuncle of T. Robsoni, it would have been better to say, that its exact shape, size and relative position are not at all clearly shewn in the few specimens yet collected, though it seems to have been marginal and enlarged between the septa.\n\nCyrtoceras (?) cuneatum. (N.

Siphuncle and test unknown.\n\nThe specimen upon which the foregoing description is based is a cast of the interior of part of the septate portion of the shell. It is evidently not a true Cyrtoceras, but a probably new generic type, which there is not yet sufficient material to define satisfactorily.\n\nTrochoceras insigne, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 41.

Surface of the test unknown, that of the cast marked by large, transverse rib-like plications, which are moderately prominent on each of the sides, but obsolete on the periphery or venter,\u2014and by very small, acute, thread-like spiral ridges. The transverse plications are rather distant, slightly flexuous and somewhat sigmoidal on each side of the outer volution, where they are separated by wide and shallowly concave depressions. The small spiral ridges are numerous, comparatively close together, though not very regularly disposed, and in one specimen, at least, rather larger and more prominent on the periphery of the outer volution than on its sides. Sutures of the septa concavely arched on both of the sides, where each suture intersects one, or rarely two, of the transverse plications. Shape and position of the siphuncle unknown.\n\n\"The first specimen of this shell that the writer had seen was given to the late Chief Justice Wallbridge by a quarryman at Stonewall and presented to the Museum of the Survey by Prof. E. J. Chapman in 1895. The exact locality from which this specimen was obtained was for a long time doubtful, but there is now every reason for believing that it came from the quarries at Stonewall. At any rate, in the fall of 1897, two specimens, which are known to have been collected at Stonewall, were presented to the Museum, one by Mr. John Gunn, and the other by Mr. W. H. Robson. At the same time, also, Mr. Tyrrell obtained a characteristic fragment of a specimen of this species, in situ, at the Stonewall quarries. By far the most perfect of the specimens yet received is the one presented by Mr. Gunn, and figured on Plate 41. It has two entire volutions preserved, which are gyroceran rather than nautilian in their mode of coiling, but very slightly asymmetrical. The inner volution is openly coiled, the apex or initial point being widely eccentric, and there is a large central perforation about an inch and a quarter in diameter.\n\n\"These specimens seem to indicate a previously undescribed species, which is here referred provisionally to Trochoceras rather than to Lituites, until the shape and relative position of its siphuncle be ascertained, when it may have to be transferred to Plectoceras, Peismoceras or Discoceras. It differs from Lituites Bickmoreanus, Whitfield (from the Niagara limestone of Indiana) which Hyatt says is a Plectoceras, in its more openly coiled inner volution, in its broadly elliptical and not subquadrate cross section, and in its closer transverse plications, which are quite obsolete on the periphery. Professor Whitfield, who has kindly compared two of the best specimens from Stonewall with the types of his species, thinks that the two forms are quite distinct.\"\nB. 2.\u2014FROM DAVIS POINT, LAKE MANITOBA.\n\nCOLLECTED BY J. B. TYRRELL AND J. F. WHITEAVES IN 1888.\n\nThe section at this locality is thus described on pages 195 and 196E of Mr. Tyrrell's \"Report on North-western Manitoba, with portions of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan,\" in the Annual Report, New Series, Vol. V, pt. 1, of this Survey for 1890\u201391. Mr. Tyrrell's Report is dated 1892, but the volume of which it forms part is dated 1893.\n\n\"North west of the head of the Fairfield River the shore of the lake is generally low, and it is not till the vicinity of Davis Point is reached that the Silurian again makes its appearance. At the southern end of this low exposure, a thin and even-bedded dolomitic limestone crops out of the bank near the water's edge, and many slabs of the same rock are scattered over the shore. No fossils were found in it, but it is doubtless the same band as is exposed at Fairford.\n\n\"At the north end of the exposure, and apparently overlying the last mentioned rock is a layer of very thick-bedded limestone, also slightly dolomitic. It is yellow, hard and tough, but not compact like the last, being largely composed of the debris of Stromatoporoids and corals. It weathers white, with a very rough surface.\" And it is from this upper layer that the following species of fossils were collected.\n\nANTHOZOA.\n\nTETRACORALLA.\n\nZAPHRENTIS STOKESI, Edwards & Haime.\n\nOne specimen, which Mr. Lambe thinks is most probably referable to this species.\n\nPYCNOSTYLS GUELPHENSIS, Whiteaves.\n\nApparently common at this locality, though only a few specimens were collected.\n\nHEXACORALLA.\n\nFAVOSITES GOTHLANDICUS, Lamarck.\n\nApparently also common at this locality.\n\nHYDROZOA.\n\n(Clathrodictyon ostiolatum, Nicholson, and C. vesiculosum, Nicholson and Murie, are quoted by Mr. Tyrrell as having been collected at Davis Point\nin 1888, on the authority of the late Professor H. A. Nicholson, who, in a letter to the present writer, received June 24, 1889, says that he can \"pretty certainly identify\" both of these species in the specimens forwarded to him from that locality. But, it is to be noted that Nicholson has nowhere quoted Manitoba as a locality for either of these species, in any of his subsequent publications; and that no specimen of any Stromatoporoid from Davis Point in the Museum of the Survey is labelled with either of these names by him.)\n\nC.

Ventral valve regularly convex from beak to front, though the nasute forms are most prominent anteriorly along the median line; umbonal region compressed; beak small and raised very little above the general level of the hinge line; area transversely elongated and very narrow in the direction of its height, with a small equilateral foramen in the centre. Dorsal valve concave, with a perfectly straight cardinal margin, an extremely minute beak and a hinge area much narrower than that of the ventral.\n\n\"Surface marked by numerous, but comparatively distant and, for the most part simple, radiating raised lines, which increase by intercalation and alternate at unequal distances with from one to five (or perhaps more) shorter and much smaller ones, the whole being crossed by extremely minute and close set concentric striations, and by a few more or less distant lines of growth. Characters of the interior unknown.\n\n\"Collected at several localities on the northern portion of the east shore of Lake Winnipegosis, in the district of Saskatchewan and in the adjacent part of the Province of Manitoba by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell in 1889, (but previously found loose in this vicinity by Mr. D. B. Dowling in 1888,) also on the shores and islands of Cedar Lake, and on the Saskatchewan below Cedar Lake, by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell in 1890. At each of these localities it is apparently abundant and often associated with *Isochilina grandis*, var. *latimarginata*, Jones.\n\n\"The specimens consist either of natural moulds of the exterior of the shell or of casts of the interior, in a compact fine grained dolomite, and in no case is there any vestige of the actual test remaining. In several of these natural moulds, however, the minutest details of the surface ornamentation are well preserved, and it is from wax impressions made from two of these moulds that the figures\" on Plate 24 were drawn.\n\n\"The species is apparently most nearly allied to the *Strophomena Leda* of Billings,* from division 3 of the Anticosti group of the Island of Anticosti (which Mr. Billings correlates with the Llandovery of England and with the Clinton of the State of New York), but seems to differ therefrom in its much larger size, and in the greater proportionate length of its cardinal spines. Both it and *S. Leda* are evidently what Professor H. S. Williams\u2020 would call 'geological mutations' of the 'race which began in *Strophomena alternata* in the Trenton stage,' but they form a marked exception to his statement that in the American race of the *S. alternata* type, the slender mucronate points at the terminations of the hinge line first appear in the Tully limestone.\"\n\n*Geological Survey of Canada, Palaeozoic Fossils, vol.

America, published May, 1890.\nTwo other species of brachiopoda are represented in the collections made by Mr. Tyrrell at some of the exposures on the north-east shore of Lake Winnipegosis, or on the islands adjacent thereto. These are:\u2014three very imperfect specimens of a shell like a small *Athyris*; and a few casts of the interior, or moulds of the exterior, of the valves of a small *Camarot\u00e6chia*.\n\n**MOLLUSCA.**\n\n**PELECYPODA.**\n\n**Pterinea occidentalis. (N.

Hinge line straight and ascending from the anterior to the posterior end, but apparently not very far from horizontal in some specimens; umbones moderately prominent, beaks small, appressed and placed near the anterior end. Surface marked with numerous, regularly disposed and close-set impressed lines.\n\nHinge dentition and muscular impressions unknown.\n\nAbundant at an exposure on the north-west point of Ami Island, near the north-east shore of Lake Winnipegosis, where most of the specimens are compressed convex and moderately elongated. One of these is represented by figure 1, on Plate 28. Abundant also on the weathered surfaces of small, thin slabs of limestone at the Grand Rapids of the Saskatchewan River, below Old Portage, where the specimens are strongly convex and much elongated. One of these is represented by figure 2 on the same Plate. At both of these localities, the specimens collected are for the most part casts of the interior of the left valve, but a few have either the whole or a part of the test preserved. The testiferous left valve represented by figure 3 on Plate 28, is exposed on the weathered surface of a small slab of limestone (apparently loose) from Swan Lake, at\nthe head of Shoal River, Manitoba, collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889. This valve is associated with several characteristic specimens of *Strophodon acanthoptera*.\n\nThe specimens from Ami Island and the Saskatchewan upon which this species is based, are those that were referred to *Pterinea aviculoidea*, with a query, in the provisional lists of fossils that accompany Mr. Tyrrell's report. But it has since been apparent that they differ materially from the Wisconsin specimens of that species, as figured by Whitfield, (1) in their different marginal outline, (2) in their more prominent umbones, and (3) in their proportionately larger anterior wing.\n\n**Ilionia (?) parvula. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 28, figs. 6, 7 and 8.\n\nShell small, compressed, narrowly and ovately subelliptical, nearly twice as long as high. Anterior side narrowly rounded; posterior side more pointed but not much longer than the anterior; beak small, low, incurved, and placed not far from the midlength.\n\nSurface closely and concentrically ribbed.\n\nHinge dentition and muscular impressions unknown.\n\nAmi Island, one left valve; and Long Point, two right valves; all of which are figured of the natural size.\n\nThis little shell may prove to be only a small form, or perhaps a mere local variety of the *Ilionia (?) costulata*, from the Guelph formation of Ontario, which is described and figured in the first part of this volume. *I. parvula*, however, seems to be uniformly smaller than *I. costulata*, and the beak of the former is placed nearer the midlength. Both of these shells are only provisionally referred to *Ilionia*. They are probably indicative of a new generic type, which there is not yet sufficient material to define satisfactorily.\n\n**Gasteropoda.**\n\nThe gasteropoda in the collections made by Mr. Tyrrell on the northeastern side of Lake Winnipegosis are imperfect and indeterminable casts of the interior, or moulds of the exterior, of the shell of two species of *Murchisonia*, and of one species each of *Pleurotomaria* and *Straparollus*.\n\n**CRUSTACEA.**\n\n**Ostracoda.**\n\n**Isochilina grandis, var. latimarginata**, Jones.\n\n*Isochilina grandis, var. latimarginata*, Jones. 1891.

Eyes small, placed very near the posterior margin of the head and opposite the most contracted portion of each of the free cheeks: ocular ridges moderately prominent, slightly curved and converging obliquely forward from the eyes to their terminations near the frontal margin, where they are about twice as close together as at their commencement anteriorly. Characters of the glabella unknown. Outer margin of each of the free cheeks somewhat expanded anteriorly and forming a not very prominent rounded lobe, which is armed with eight very short pointed spines\u2014slightly contracted behind the midlength and terminating posteriorly in a straight and pointed genal spine, which is a little shorter than that of the pleura of the first abdominal segment, and diverges outward and backward at an angle of 40\u00b0 to a line that might be drawn at a right angle to the longitudinal axis.\n\n\"Thorax arched upon the axis, depressed and flattened on the pleur\u00e6: composed of nine segments: axis occupying more than one third of the entire breadth without the s., lines, and narrowing very gradually to the posterior end: its annulations horizontal, subparallel and nearly straight, but faintly sinuous at their margins, both in front and behind. Pleur\u00e6 also decreasing very gradually in breadth to the posterior end of the thorax, nearly straight and terminating externally on each side in a long and very slender spine, which is bent backward and outward at an angle of about 57\u00b0. The spines increase gradually in length posteriorly, the two spines on the anterior thoracic segment being shorter than the pleur\u00e6 from which they proceed, and nearly equal in length to the genal spines immediately in front of them, whereas in the posterior thoracic segment the pleural spines are nearly three times as long as the pleur\u00e6 and as the spines on the pleur\u00e6 of the anterior thoracic segment.\n\n\"Pygidium broad and short, its outer margin broadly rounded and fringed with spines, its inner or anterior margin almost straight and nearly three times as broad as the length of the non-spinose portion along the median line; its axis moderately convex and its pleur\u00e6 flat. Axis narrowly rounded posteriorly and terminating just within the margin of the pygidium, apparently bearing two transverse annulations, the posterior unarmed and the anterior bearing a long and very slender primary spine on each of its rounded postero-lateral angles. These primary spines, whose length considerably exceeds that of the united pygidium and thorax, diverge for the greater part of their length at an angle of about 48\u00b0, but curve slightly inward at their outer ends. Outer margin of the pygidium armed with four secondary internal spines between the two primaries, and with five secondary external spines on each side of the latter. The four secondary internal spines are moderately close together, nearly equal in length and about one fourth as long as the primaries. The five outer\nsecondary spines on each side are much closer together than the four inner ones and not more than one-half as long.\n\n\"Surface markings unknown.\n\n\"Long Point, at the north east angle of Lake Winnipegosis, just outside of the northern boundary of Manitoba, J.

Ventral valve strongly convex, very tumid, prominent, and rounded or obtusely angulated along the median line, and narrowing rapidly to the margin on both sides, but devoid of a distinctly defined mesial fold, its umbo prominent and rather broad, and its beak so strongly recurved as almost to touch that of the opposite valve. Fissure rather large, triangular, a little higher than broad, completely covered by the recurved beak and visible only when the beak is broken off. Dorsal valve much flatter than the ventral, gently and uniformly convex, or flattened with a faint longitudinal depression in the centre, its beak small, rather narrow and slightly incurved.\n\n\"Surface marked by very numerous, closely disposed, rounded and but slightly elevated radiating raised lines, which are crossed by smaller, more close set and irregularly disposed concentric raised lines, as well as by a few distant and more or less imbricating lines of growth. The radiating raised lines, which are rather irregular in their arrangement and unequal in size, increase so rapidly by division that as many as from sixty to one hundred or more of them can be counted around the front margin of an adult specimen, though, on account of its greater convexity, there is always a larger number on the ventral valve than on the dorsal.\n\n\"Septum of the ventral valve well developed, comparatively thick but very short, occupying less than one fourth of the entire length in some specimens, but a little longer in others, though rarely or never exceeding one third of the total length. Septa of the dorsal valve thin, feebly developed and almost rudimentary, very slightly divergent and much shorter than the ventral septum. Muscular and vascular impressions unknown. Interior of the valves rather minutely papillose.\n\n\"Dimensions of the specimen figured: maximum length, eighty-seven millimetres, greatest breadth, fifty nine mm.; maximum height or depth through the closed valves, fifty-two mm.; amount of recurvature of beak of ventral valve, sixteen mm.\n\n\"The only locality in which this species is known to the writer to have been certainly found in place, is in a light brownish yellow dolomitic limestone at the foot of the Grand Rapids of the Saskatchewan, where a number of fine specimens were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1890. Boulders containing it have been found at several localities in Manitoba, and elsewhere in the central portion of the Dominion. It is almost certainly the shell referred to by Sir John Richardson as a *Pentamerus*, very like *P.*\nKnightii,' which was gathered by Dr. Bigsby 'in 1823' on the Lake of the Woods and presented by him to the British Museum,* as specimens of the shell which I here call *P. decussatus* have since been collected from boulders on the south west shores of that lake by Dr. G. M. Dawson in 1873 and by Dr. A. C. Lawson in 1884. Other localities at which the species has been obtained from boulders are as follows:\u2014Nelson River, about sixty miles above its mouth, Dr. R. Bell, 1879; Lower Fort Garry, Dr. R. Bell, 1880; Kenogami River, six miles above the mouth of the Bagutchewan, Dr. R. Bell, 1886. Mouth of the Fairford River and Steep Rock Island, Lake Manitoba, J. F. Whiteaves, 1888. North east side of Lake Winnipegosis and Red Deer River near its mouth, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889; Virden, Manitoba, C. N. Bell, 1889.\n\n\"In Appendix No. 1 to Franklin's 'Narrative of a Second Expedition to the Shores of the Polar Sea, in the years 1825, 1826 and 1827,' \"Sir John Richardson says that 'Mr. Sowerby determined a shell, occurring in great abundance in the strata at Cumberland House' .......... 'to be the *Pentamerus Aylesfordii,*' which is regarded by Dr. Davidson as a synonym of *P. Knightii.* Although Cumberland House is 135 miles farther up the Saskatchewan than the locality at which Mr. Tyrrell obtained *P. decussatus* in place, it is by no means improbable that the specimens which Mr. Sowerby determined as *P. Knightii* are really referable to the present species. However this may be, it seems to the writer that *P. decussatus* differs materially from the true *P. Knightii,* especially in the following particulars. The umbo of the ventral valve of the former is narrower and less prominent, while its beak is much less strongly curved; the coarser surface markings of both valves do not consist of comparatively distant and irregular radiating ribs, as in *P. Knightii,* but of close set, irregularly disposed, unequal and not much elevated radiating raised lines; and the mesial septa of both valves of *P. decussatus* are not more than half the comparative length of those of *P. Knightii.*\n\nThe fossil brachiopoda from the Saskatchewan River that were doubtfully and provisionally referred to *Rhynchonella altiplicata,* *Atrypa reticularis,* and *Trematospira formosa,* in Mr. Tyrrell's Report, are too imperfect to be satisfactorily determined.\n\nMOLLUSCA.\n\nPELECYPODA.\n\nPTERINEA OCCIDENTALIS, Whiteaves.\n\nSaskatchewan River, at Grand Rapids below Old Portage, J.

Septate portion occupying a little more than one-half the entire length, narrowly conical in lateral aspect, pointed posteriorly and about twice as long as it is broad anteriorly. Body chamber crenulated around the base, its outer margins at first nearly straight and almost parallel on both sides as viewed laterally, its anterior termination rounded but much more broadly so on the ventral side than on the dorsal; ventral region at the summit laterally compressed on each side of the aperture.

III.\n\n6. The Canadian species of Plectoceras and Barrandoceras.\n\nBY J. F. WHITEAVES.\n\nThe genus *Plectoceras* was first described by Hyatt in 1883, on page 268 of his \"Genera of Fossil Cephalopoda,\" published in the twenty-second volume of the Proceedings of the Boston Natural History Society. In that paper it is placed in the Family Tainoceratid\u00e6, and is described as follows:\n\n\"PLECTOCERAS*, nobis, includes Silurian species having cost\u00e6 curved posteriorly on the sides and crossing the abdomen as in *Trocholites* and sutures similar, but with ventral saddles. The whorls quadrate, the abdomens narrower than the dorsum and the sides convergent outwards. The siphons are ventral and holochoanoidal. The young are precisely similar in form, smoothness of the shell and stri\u00e6 of growth, and in sutures to the straight sutured forms of *Trocholites*. Type, *Plect. (Naut.) Jason*, sp., Bill., Canad. Nat., vol. 4, 1859, p. 464, Mus. Geol. Surv. Can.\"\n\nIn the \"Phylogeny of an Acquired Characteristic,\" published in 1894, in the thirty-second volume of the \"Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, pages 499 and 500, the genus, and three of its species are thus described.\n\n\"PLECTOCERAS.\n\n\"This genus was described in *Genera of Fossil Cephalopods*, page 268, by the author, to include the costated forms similar to *Discoceras*, but having the siphuncle ventrad of the centre.\n\n\"The type was *Plectoceras (Naut.) Jason*, sp. Billings. The mode of coiling may be quite close and regular, with perhaps a slight impressed zone or flattened dorsum, or the coil may be open, and sometimes it is very irregular. In several specimens of *Jason* the first whorls may touch, the ephebic volution may be open and free and yet the extremity of the living chamber again come in contact. The umbilical perforation is large\n\n*\u03a0\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, twisted or plaited.*\nand the impressed zone is absent until the whorls come in contact and it is invariably absent in gerontic whorls.\n\n\"The species are as follows:\n\n\"PLECTOCERAS JASON, sp. Billings. (Canadian Nat., iv, p. 464).\n\n\"Type in Museum of Geological Survey at Ottawa. It occurs in the Calciferous* of the Mingan Islands and there are similar forms in the same horizon in Newfoundland.\n\n\"PLECTOCERAS OBSCURUM, n. s.\n\n\"This species occurs in the Black River fauna in New York, and is quite commonly mistaken for the young of Eurystomites undatus, but it has an open gyroceran spiral, the siphuncle is nearer the venter and the costae are more highly developed and more prominent, and have a distinct character from those of that species.\n\n\"PLECTOCERAS BICKMOREANUS, sp. Whitfield (Bull. Am. Mus., New York).\n\n\"This species of the Niagara fauna has an open gyroceran whorl, and in the gerontic stage the last whorl is free and in some specimens completely straightened out and lituitean in aspect.\"\n\nHyatt's latest views on Fossil Cephalopoda are embodied in the article on Cephalopoda in the first volume of Dr. C. E. Eastman's translation of Zittel's Text Book of Palaeontology, published in 1900. In this article (p. 520) Plectoceras is made the type of a new family called Plectoceratid\u00e6, and this family and the genera of which it is said to be composed are thus described.\n\n\"Family 6. PLECTOCERATID\u00c6.\n\n\"Gyroceracones, nautilicones, and torticones having annular cost\u00e6 from the neanic stage until late in life, and in some genera, more or less prominent longitudinal ridges, which usually disappear in the ephebic stage.

XXXII, p. 498.\n\n**Original description of Nautilus Jason.** \"Discoid, planorbiform, all the whorls exposed in the umbilicus. Section of shell broad oval, the ventral and dorsal sides being depressed convex, the other two sides rounded, the two diameters being to each other as fifteen to seventeen. The tube increases in diameter at such a rate as to give to the coil a diameter of three inches and a half on the completion of the second whorl, at which point the septa are two lines distant from each other in their centres, two and a half lines in the middle of the ventral side, and a little less than one and a half lines on the dorsal or inner side of the whorl. They become gradually more approximate as they approach the apex, so that where the tube is half an inch in diameter they are one line distant in their centres. They are only moderately convex, and their edges cross the ventral aspect in a straight line, but on the sides with a gentle curve towards the apex of the shell.\n\n\"The surface exhibits a series of rounded ridges which, starting from the umbilicus, curve backward, and make a deep rounded undulation toward the apex on the ventral aspect. The distance of the ridges from each other along the median ventral line is about five lines, and the intervening spaces are shallow and concave. The surface is also marked with obscure fine stri\u00e6, and smaller ridges all parallel with the larger.\n\n\"The siphuncle is from one and a half to two lines in diameter, cylindrical, not inflated, and distant about two lines from the outer margin.\n\n\"On comparing this species with the figures of *L. undatus* (Emmons) given in the Pal\u00e6ontology of New York, vol. 1, plate 13, we find that our best preserved specimen is exactly the size of figure 1; that the ventral aspect is not angular at the sides, nor do the ridges pass straight across, as shewn in fig. 1 b; and that in fig. 3 the septa are more than three lines distant in their centres instead of two lines, as they are in our specimens. The specimen represented on plate 13 bis has the septa three and a half lines nearly distant about the completion of the second whorl, while those next the chamber of occupation are more approximate, as they usually are in all the Nautilidae. Our species therefore, although closely allied, is a distinct species from *L. undatus*.\n\n\"Locality and Formation.\u2014Mingan Islands; Chazy limestone.\"\n\nThe foregoing description was evidently based upon three fine and remarkably well preserved specimens from Clear Water Point, in the\nMuseum of the Survey, the largest of which is fully four inches in its greatest diameter. One of these specimens still bears the original written label; \"Mingan. Clear Water Point. L. 1859;\" the L. of course meaning Logan. This is the locality referred to on page 134 of the \"Geology of Canada\" (1863) as the bay \"above Clear Water Point,\" where the lowest part of the Chazy formation is said to be visible. A section of the rocks exposed at this locality is given, part of which is said to consist of twenty feet of \"grey nodular limestone with Columnaria parva, Stenopora adhaerens, Fenestella incepta, Orthis piger, Strophomena incrassata, Ctenodonta nasuta, Nautilus Jason, Amphion Canadensis, Harpes antiquatus, and Illenus globosus.\" Clear Water Point is on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, opposite to the Mingan Islands.\n\nIn the same Museum there are two other specimens of Plectoceras Jason. One of these is a large and imperfect but characteristic specimen, labelled as having been collected at St. Charles Island by J. Richardson in 1860; and the other, labelled only \"Mingan.\"\n\n(2.) **Plectoceras Halli**, Foord. (Sp.)\n\nPlate 35, figs. 3, 4, and 4 a.\n\n_Inachus undatus_ (pars) Conrad.............1842.

Halli_ are said to be as follows: \"The shell, which is not complete, consists of two volutions; the asymmetry is slight, but quite discernible. The shell increases its diameter about three times in the last volution. The section is distinctly\nsubquadrate, the ventral side being the broadest, as well as being considerably flattened. The surface is ornamented with oblique, rounded, not very prominent annulations, divided by concave interspaces of about equal width. The annulations bend backward on the ventral side and there form a deep sinus; while on the dorsal or concave side, approaching the umbilicus, they become quite obsolete; the young shell is almost smooth. The entire surface of the test is covered with very fine transverse lines both on the ribs and the interspaces, and there are also obscure traces of longitudinal lines. The septa are a little more than 1 line apart, where the shell has a ventro-dorsal diameter of 6 lines. The siphuncle is not seen.\" The species is said to be represented in the British Museum collection by two specimens from the Black River limestone at Lorette, and the specimen figured is not much more than two inches in its maximum diameter. These specimens are obviously those that Dr. Bigsby collected at Indian Lorette in 1822, and that Salter referred to *Lituites undatus* in 1853.*\n\nThe specimen from Watertown, N.Y., that Hall figures under the name *Lituites undatus* and that Foord includes in his synonymy of *Trochoceras Halli*, is very little more than two inches and a quarter in its greatest diameter. It is No. 12581 of the palaeontological department of the New York State Museum at Albany, and has been kindly lent to the writer by Dr. John M. Clarke. It is obviously immature, as the earlier volution and part of the later one are smooth, the oblique rib-like folds, which are five in number on each side, being developed only on the outer portion of the last volution. The venter is flattened and unusually smooth, while the siphuncle is both marginal and ventral. It is most probable that this specimen is the original of the smaller figure of *Inachus undatus*, Conrad, in Emmons' report on the Geology of the Second District of the State of New York.\n\nIn 1898 Mr. T. C. Weston visited Lorette, on behalf of this Survey, and succeeded in collecting for its Museum a fine series of unusually large and well preserved specimens, that agree very well with Foord's descriptions of *Trochoceras Halli*, but that give some additional information in regard to its characters. These specimens have been described, and their generic and specific relations discussed in some detail, in two papers, the one entitled \"Notes on some Canadian specimens of 'Lituites undatus,' and the other \"Additional Notes on some Canadian specimens of 'Lituites undatus,'\" published in the Ottawa Naturalist for October and December, 1903. The latest results of a study of these and other specimens are embodied in the foregoing synonymy. It is now obvious that the *Trochoceras Halli* of Foord is a *Plectoceras* closely allied to *P. Jason* (Billings) but apparently\n\n* In the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. IX, p. 86.\ndistinct therefrom, and that it is both generically and specifically identical with the subsequently described *Plectoceras obscurum* of Hyatt.\n\nThe latter conclusion is based upon a direct comparison of the specimens of *P. Halli*, collected by Mr. Weston, with the types of *P. obscurum* in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass., kindly lent to the writer by Dr. W. Y. M. Woodworth, in 1903. As elsewhere stated,* the types of *P. obscurum* are three in number, one a comparatively perfect specimen from the Black River limestone at Watertown, N.Y., marked 2077; and the others, two fragments from Watertown, each marked 2078. The specimen marked 2077 has nearly the whole of one side worn away, but the other side shews the general shape of the shell and its surface markings very well. It is about three inches and a half in its maximum diameter and consists of two entire whorls. The inner whorls, if there were any, are not preserved. Both sides of the specimen shew that the whorls are at first so closely coiled that the inner half of the outer whorl is in close contact with the one that immediately precedes it, but that its outer half is free and slightly uncoiled. At the anterior end of the shell, the outer whorl is about seventeen millimetres apart from that which immediately precedes it. And it would seem to be the body chamber, which occupies rather less than one half of the outer whorl, that is free and separate. The surface markings are precisely similar to those of the fine specimens of *P. Halli* collected by Mr. Weston at Lorette. On the worn side all the septa but the last are obliterated, and the shape and position of the siphuncle are not at all clearly shewn. A label, in Hyatt's hand writing, however, states that the siphuncle is \"marginal and ventral,\" as it is known to be in *P. Halli*. The two fragments marked 2078 shew neither the external form of the shell, the outline of the transverse section, nor any of the surface markings. One of these is a little more than about one-third of the outer whorl of a specimen which has been worn down in such a manner as to shew a longitudinal section of the body chamber and of the last five septa, which latter average from five to five and a half millimetres in their greatest distance apart. The other shews scarcely anything, except that the venter is much flattened.\n\nAdult or presumably adult specimens of *P. Halli* average about three inches and a quarter in their maximum diameter, and appear to be always smaller than full grown individuals of *P. Jason*. The former, too, are more closely coiled, the rib-like folds on the outer volution are more numerous and much narrower proportionately, while the siphuncle is quite marginal. The characters of the external aperture are well shewn in some of the specimens of *P. Halli* collected by Mr. Weston. The lip is thin and simple, and its outer margin is exactly parallel with the flexuous,\n\n---\n\n* Ottawa Naturalist, vol. XVII, pp. 161 and 162.\nrib-like folds and raised lines of growth that cross the outer volution, both of which are nearly straight on the dorsum, curved obliquely and convexly backward on each side, and deeply and concavely sinuate on the venter.\n\nIn a large number of specimens there is some diversity in the mode of coiling, and in the surface ornamentation. The volutions are always rather closely coiled, but they may be either separate but closely contiguous throughout, or partly in contact and partly free. In some specimens the volutions are most distant posteriorly, and in others anteriorly. But, in any case, there is no impressed zone or contact furrow on the dorsum.\n\nOn the outer volution, the oblique, rib-like folds are most prominent in the ventral and ventrolateral region, but in some large specimens from Lorette there is a narrow, shallow longitudinal depression in the median line of the venter, upon which some of these ribs or folds are more or less obsolete. And, as before stated, in the small specimen from Watertown that Hall figures as \"Lituites undatus,\" the whole of the flattened venter is practically smooth. The sutural lines of the Lorette specimens are nearly straight, and the siphuncle is cylindrical, ventral and marginal.\n\nIn the Museum of the Survey there are specimens of *Plectoceras Halli* from the following localities in the Province of Quebec. Falls of the St. Charles River, Indian Lorette; collected by Logan and Richardson in 1852, by Ami and Giroux in 1888, and by Weston in 1898. St. Ambroise, four miles north of Indian Lorette; and Lac Oureau river (the Naquerreau river of the \"Geology of Canada\") above the mouth of the Riviere Rouge and S. W. of Joliette; collected by Logan and Richardson in 1852. Also, three miles west of Napierville, south of Montreal, collector and date not stated. From Ontario, a few specimens of *P. Halli* have recently been collected at two localities near Ottawa by Walter R. Billings and J. E. Narraway.\n\nBy one alias or another, this species has long been regarded as a characteristic fossil of the Black River limestone of the State of New York by Emmons and Hall, and of the Province of Quebec by E. Billings and Foord. But, it is to be noted that the limestone at the falls of the St. Charles River, Lorette, where it is most abundant, was said to be of Trenton age by Bigsby and Salter in 1853, and by Ells in 1888, though Ells says that the beds at the foot of the fall \"have a Black River facies in their lowest portion.\"\n\n(3.) *Plectoceras (?) undatum*, Conrad.

Soc., vol. XXXII, p. 445.\n\nThe type of this species, as now restricted, is a specimen from the Black River limestone at Watertown, N.Y., collected more than sixty years ago by Dr. Crawe, of that city. This specimen is the original of Emmons' larger figure of Inachus undatus in the report on the Geology of the Second District of the State of New York; and of Hall's representation of Lituites undatus on Plate 13, fig. 1, of the first volume of the Paleontology of the State of New York. It is about three inches and a half in its maximum diameter, but is very imperfect anteriorly. Only one side of this fossil is preserved, and all that the specimen shews is the general shape of the shell and some of the coarser surface markings, but there are no indications of the siphuncle. Another specimen from Watertown, collected by Dr. Crawe, which is figured by Hall (op. cit., pl. 13 bis) is fully six inches in its maximum diameter, though part of the body chamber is broken off. It also gives no information as to the shape or relative position of the siphuncle. Both of these specimens are in the American Museum of Natural History at New York City.\n\nIt is still doubtful to which genus of Cephalopoda this species should be referred. Inachus was long ago rejected for it, as being preoccupied in Crustacea and for other reasons. It is equally clear that it is not a Lituites, and that it does not even belong to the family Lituitidae. Hyatt regarded it as a Trocholites in 1883, but ultimately abandoned this view and placed it in Eurystomites in 1894. On Plate 5, figs. 1 and 2, of the \"Phylogeny of an Acquired Characteristic,\" a small specimen from Poland, Herkimer County, State of New York, is figured under the name Eurystomites undatus. This specimen, which is in the Walcott collection in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass., has been kindly lent to the writer by Mr. Samuel Henshaw. It is about forty-three millimetres, or about an inch and three quarters, in its maximum diameter. One whorl and a half are preserved; these are in close contact, widely elliptical in cross section, and wider laterally than in a dorsoventral direction. On the earlier half of the outer whorl the test is marked with numerous, close-set and minute, transverse raised lines, which are straight in passing over the venter. But on the latter half of this evolution, the lines of growth are curved convexly on each side, and concavely backward on the venter. The sutural lines are nowhere ex-\nposed, and the siphuncle is ventral and marginal. It is difficult to see how two of the large specimens figured by Hall as *Lituites undatus*, or the small specimen from Poland that Hyatt figures as *Eurystomites undatus*, can be distinguished generically from *Plectoceras*.\n\nAll the specimens from the Province of Quebec that were formerly identified with *Lituites undatus* are *Plectoceras Halli*. The only specimen that the writer has seen, that was certainly collected in Canada and that is probably referable to *Plectoceras undatum* (or, as Hyatt calls it, to *Eurystomites undatus*) is the original of the figure on Plate 37. It was obtained, a few years ago, from the Black River limestone exposed in an excavation for a sewer in a street not far from Queen's College, Kingston, and has recently been acquired for the Museum of this Survey, in exchange, from the authorities of Queen's University. It is a cast of the interior of the septate portion of the shell, five inches and a half in its maximum diameter, with fragments of the test attached. Its outer volution is subquadrate in transverse section, and the sutural lines are nearly straight on the sides, but shallowly concave on the venter or periphery. In the Museum of Queen's University there are two large specimens of *P. undatum* (or *Eurystomites undatus*) that are supposed to have been collected from the Black River limestone at or near Kingston, but it is not at all certain where either of them are from.\n\nIf a *Plectoceras*, *P. undatum* is obviously a much larger species than *P. Jason* or *P. Halli*.\n\n*Eurystomites plicatus*, nobis, from the Galena-Trenton formation of Little Black Island, Lake Winnipeg, which is described and figured in the third part of this volume, has much the appearance of a *Plectoceras*, externally, but its siphuncle is known to be \"ventrad of the centre.\"\n\nThe genus *Barrandeoceras* also was first described by Hyatt in 1883, in his \"Genera of Fossil Cephalopoda,\" already referred to as having been published in the twenty-second volume of the Proceedings of the Boston Natural History Society. On page 299 of that memoir it is placed in the family Nautilidae, and is thus described:\n\n\"BARRANDEOCERAS, nobis, includes gyroceran and nautilian shells with very large umbilical perforations, and compressed, slightly costated or smooth whorls, generally without an impressed zone, though this is sometimes present. The venter is narrower than the dorsum, the siphon near but above the centre, septa deeply concave, and sutures with ventral saddles, lateral lobes and dorsal saddles, without annular lobes. Type, Barr. (Naut.) natator, sp. Bill. Can. Nat. N.S., vol. 4, Mus. Geol. Surv. Can. The genus also includes the Bohemian forms Barr. (Naut.) Bohemicum, sp. Barr., Vol. 2, Syst. Sil. pl. 32, 33; Sternbergi, ibid., pl. 36, 37;\"\ntyrannus, ibid., pl. 38; Sacheri, ibid., pl. 39. Living chamber is about one-half of a volution in length; it is about three-fourths of a volution in length in the type species.\"\n\nIn 1894, in the \"Phylogeny of an Acquired Characteristic\" (Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc., vol. XXXII, pp. 450 and 451) the genus is placed in the new family Tarphyceratidae, and is described as follows:\n\n\"Barrandeoceras.\n\n\"This genus was described in my Genera of Fossil Cephalopoda to include shells having large umbilical perforations, compressed slightly costated or smooth whorls. The venter usually narrower than the dorsum, the whorls barely in contact or with very slight contact furrow, siphuncle near but above centre, septa deeply concave, sutures having usually ventral and dorsal saddles and lateral lobes. This last statement is true of all the forms having the gyroceran mode of coiling, but not of those which have the closer nautilian form. In these there is a slight dorsal lobe and a different form of the paranepionic whorl which may eventually lead to their generic separation.\n\n\"The type is Barrandeoceras (Naut.) natator, sp. Billings.\"\n\nEight species of this genus are enumerated or described by Hyatt in the \"Phylogeny,\" two from the Cambro-Silurian rocks of the Province of Quebec, one from the same formation in the State of New York, four from the Silurian rocks of Bohemia, and one from the Niagara group of Indiana.\n\nAt present (1906) four species of Barrandeoceras have been recognized as occurring in Canada, two in the Chazy, and two in the Black River limestone.\n\nThese are as follows:\n\n(1.)

Surface and siphuncle unknown.\"\n\"The specimen is imperfect; but if it has not been compressed laterally, then, as nearly as I can determine, the dorso-ventral diameter at the end of the fifth whorl is sixteen lines and the lateral twelve; at the fourth whorl five to seven; and it would appear therefore that the third must be scarcely three lines in its greatest diameter.\n\n\"I have not seen the first and second whorls, but as there is an empty space nine lines in diameter in the centre of the coil, I presume that they did once exist and occupy that space. The whorls are in contact, but the outer ones are not indented by those next preceding.\n\n\"Locality and Formation.\u2014Mingan Islands; Chazy limestone.\n\n\"Collectors.\u2014Sir W. E. Logan, J.

The label now attached to the tablet upon which it is placed states that it was collected in 1856.\n\nThe same specimen is thus described by Hyatt, under the name *Barrandeoceras natator*, in his \"Phylogeny of an Acquired Characteristic.\"\n\n\"This species has volutions compressed oval in section, the dorsum somewhat broader than the venter; siphuncle is extracentroventran, even in the neanic stage; septa deeply concave; sutures with dorsal and ventral saddles and the lateral lobes as in other species of the genus.\n\n\"The volutions are in contact, but no contact furrow was formed at any age. The contact takes place as in the young of *Estonioceras perforatum*, on the venter of the paranepionic volution.\n\n\"The volution in the neanic stage, dorso-ventral diameter 13 mm., has a much narrower venter in proportion to the dorsum than in the adult. The venter was rounded at all stages and also the dorsum. The aneanic and nepionic stage were not present in the original specimen in the Museum at Ottawa, but in following out the same lines it is easily ascertained that the umbilical perforation must have been enormous, at least 15-17 mm. in diameter. The living chamber was somewhat over one-fourth of a volution in length. The whole diameter was about 108 mm. It was reported as having been found in the Chazy limestone.\"\n\n(2.) **Barrandeoceras Minganense**, Hyatt.\n\n*Barrandeoceras Minganense*, Hyatt...........1894. Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., vol.

But, it is only upon well preserved, testiferous specimens that the surface markings are at all clearly shewn, and the two specimens of B. convolvans that Hall figures, are mere casts of the interior of the shell.\n\n(4.)

It is scarcely necessary to observe that from the above materials the generic rank of the fragment cannot be determined with the certainty desirable; the tube is too much curved to come within the definition of Cyrtoceras, the whorls too widely separated for Nautilus or Lituites, and yet, without a view of the aperture we cannot say positively that it is a Gyroceras.\n\n\"Formation.\u2014Black River limestone.\n\n\"Localities.\u2014La Petite Chaudi\u00e8re Rapids, Ottawa River, and in the outcrop of the Black River limestone, near Mile End, St. Lawrence Street, Montreal.\"\nOf the specimens referred to in this quotation, the only one that the writer has seen is the fossil from La Petite Chaudi\u00e8re that has been rubbed down on one side and polished in such a manner as to exhibit the \"artificial polished section\" described by E. Billings. This specimen, which is now figured for the first time (figs. 1 and 1a) is evidently intended as the type of the species, though it shows little more than the mode of coiling and the lateral compression of the whorls.\n\nOf late years a few imperfect specimens, that are apparently referable to this species, have been collected at La Petite Chaudi\u00e8re, on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River, at Tetreauville, by Mr. W. R. Billings, Mr. J. E. Narraway, and the writer. One of these specimens, the original of figs. 2 and 2a on Plate 40, is an imperfect cast of the interior of the septate portion of the shell. It shows that on the convex exterior of the cast, each of the sutural lines forms a single, widely and very shallowly concave sinus or \"lobe\" on each side, and a low, simple, undivided and obtusely subangular saddle on the venter. On the dorsum, also, there are indications of a similar saddle. It seems to the writer that the few specimens of *Gyroceras* (or *Lituites*) *vagrans* that have yet been obtained are clearly congeneric with *Barrandeoceras convolvans*, and *B. subcostulatum*.\n\nFigures 3 and 3a were inadvertently printed on Plate 40, because the writer was at first under the impression that the original of both was also a fragment of a specimen of *B. vagrans*. But it soon became apparent that this fragment is a piece of a specimen of a *Cyrtoceras*, and most probably of *C. sinuatum*, Billings, the type of which is a badly preserved cast of the interior of a shell, also from the Black River limestone at La Petite Chaudi\u00e8re. The exterior of this fragment (figure 3) shows that the surface ornamentation consists of narrow, transverse and slightly flexuous ribs, with wider spaces between them; and the inner portion (figure 3a) which has been broken in such a way as to exhibit a longitudinal and nearly median section, shows that the siphuncle is placed a little outside of the middle, or, as Hyatt, would have said, somewhat ventrad of the center.\nPAL\u00c6OZOIC FOSSILS.\n\nVOL.

V, pp. 205 and 206, with the text figure here reproduced.\n\nThe following is a copy of the original description of this genus and species:\n\nAnomalocaris. (Gen. nov.)\n\n\"Carapace and its appendages unknown or too obscurely indicated for their characters to be defined: body many jointed and consisting of not less than nine to thirteen segments, exclusive of the caudal segment; ventral portion of each of the body segments bearing a pair of slender, narrowly elongated and acutely pointed, simple and probably branchial appendages, of the nature of uropods or foot gills: posterior terminal segment margined with three pairs of caudal spines, one terminal and the other two lateral,\u2014the posterior pair of uropods represented in the woodcut apparently belonging to a pre-caudal segment whose posterior boundary has been obliterated.\"\nAnomalocaris Canadensis, sp. nov.\n\nFig. 20. Anomalocaris Canadensis.\u2014Outline of a specimen in which nine of the abdominal segments are preserved, besides the caudal segment. Natural size.\n\n\"Body, inclusive of the tail, elongated, slender, decreasing slowly in size from the anterior to the posterior end, rather strongly curved posteriorly and nearly straight anteriorly, the length of the portion preserved varying in different specimens from nine to ten centimetres (as measured at about the midheight and following the curve of each), and the height or depth at the imperfect anterior end, from twelve to seventeen millimetres, exclusive of the ventral appendages. Body or abdominal segments, which, in all the specimens collected are abnormally flattened laterally, a little higher or deeper than long, broader above than below, the pair of ventral appendages proceeding from each, nearly equal in height or depth to the segment itself. These appendages are straight and prolonged downward at almost a right angle to the main axis of the body, for although there is a slight divergence in each pair, neither are directed distinctly backward nor forward. Between each pair of segments there is evidence of a wedge-shaped or very narrowly triangular lateral area or interval, which is broadest or widest below and does not seem to extend quite to the dorsal margin. At the posterior end the segmentation is very obscurely defined. Caudal spines, which are simple, slender, longitudinally elongated and acutely pointed, averaging six millimetres in length by about one mm. in breadth at the base: the three pairs of spines about equal in length, though the two lateral ones are placed farther forward than the central and terminal pair. Surface markings entirely unknown.\n\n\"This genus and species are based upon upwards of fifty specimens collected from a band of shale of Middle Cambrian age, at Mount Stephen, near Field station on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two of these specimens were collected by Mr. R. G. McConnell, of the Geological Survey of Canada, in 1888, and the remainder by Dr. H. M. Ami, of the same...\"\nSurvey, in 1891. The species seem to have been somewhat gregarious in its habits when living, for upwards of twenty specimens of it are exposed on the surface of a large slab of shale collected by Dr. Ami at this locality, and fourteen upon that of another. It is associated with numerous species of trilobites, brachiopoda, etc., most of which have been described by Dr. Carl Rominger and Dr. C. D. Walcott. All the specimens of *A. Canadensis* are crushed quite flat laterally and occur as obscurely defined and extremely thin impressions of the body segments, with the tail, the latter usually a little twisted, on each of the surfaces exposed by splitting pieces of the shale.\n\nThe generic name *Anomalocaris* (from \u1f00\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2, unlike,\u2014\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2, a shrimp, i.e., unlike other shrimps) is suggested by the unusual shape of the uropods or ventral appendages of the body segments and the relative position of the caudal spines.*\n\nThis description was followed by a brief discussion of the supposed relations of *Anomalocaris* to other genera of Phyllocarida, but it is not thought necessary to reproduce this discussion here, as Professor T. Rupert Jones and Dr. Henry Woodward have expressed the opinion* that *Anomalocaris* is probably not a Phyllocarid. The affinities of this genus are still uncertain. In the first volume of his Text Book of Palaeontology, published in 1900, Dr. C. R. Eastman places it provisionally in the Family Branchiopodidae of the Order Branchiopoda.\n\nB.

Astrocystites Ottawaensis. Fig. 21. \"Side view of a nearly perfect specimen, shewing the small plates surrounding and perhaps covering the anus, on the left side of one of the ambulacral areas, at A, and the peculiar sculpture of part of the calyx, natural size.\" Fig. 21a. \"Summit view of the same specimen, also of the natural size.\" Fig. 22. \"Radial plate on the left of the anal region of another specimen, twice the natural size, to shew the peculiar shape and sculpture of this plate, also the overlap by the distal portion of one of the ambulacral areas above, and the modification of the upper margin of the plate on the anal side: A\u2014relative position of the anus.\"\n\n\"Body or 'crown' of the organism globose, almost spherical but narrowing rapidly below into a very short, slender column or stem, and somewhat five-sided as seen from above.\n\n\"Calyx or dorsal cup broadly conical and entire below the midheight, but divided above into five large, pointed and slightly incurved, sepaloid lobes, with rather oblique and slightly convex sides, by the decurrent portions of the ambulacral areas. The greater part of one of these lobes, as seen at A,\" in fig. 21, \"is occupied with a cluster of minute plates which surround and either partially or wholly cover the anal opening.\"\n\"Surface of the calyx marked by small, short, branching grooves, which radiate from the centre and anastomose at the margins of large plates of irregular shape. The exact outlines of some of these plates are not clearly defined in any of the three specimens that the writer has seen, but two of the latter have part of the calyx crushed in such a way as to shew parts of the margins of at least two of the radials and of one of the basals. Judging by these indications of the outlines of the plates and by the peculiar sculpture of others, the composition of the calyx would seem to be essentially as follows. In the undivided and lower moiety of the divided portion there appears to be a circlet of large subpentagonal and presumably basal plates, immediately above the column. On the surface of these plates the branching grooves radiate upward and outward, but not backward, and, consequently, only the front and part of the lateral margins of each of these plates is minutely sinuated. Next to these supposed basal plates and alternating with them there is a circlet of five large radials. These radials are irregular in outline, but their margins are minutely sinuated all round, except in the middle of the summit, where each of these plates is overlapped by the distal portion of the ambulacral area, as shewn in fig. 22. On each side of the anal region the upper and inner portions of the margin of each of the two radials that partially bound it, are slightly modified, as also shewn by fig. 22, in which A represents the relative position of the middle of the anal region. In the upper and lobate portion of the calyx there appears to be a comparatively small and presumably interradial plate, whose outline it is not yet possible to define precisely, in or near the middle of each of four of the lobes, the corresponding part of the fifth lobe being occupied by the group of small plates which surround and apparently cover the anus.\n\n\"The summit or entire surface above the calyx, is exclusively occupied with five large linear lanceolate, radiating ambulacral areas, which extend a little beyond and below the midheight and alternate, at and near the centre, with five small narrowly elongated, subtriangular, almost bottle-shaped plates. The ambulacral areas consist of well defined grooves, which are partially and perhaps in perfect specimens were wholly roofed over with two rows of small, transversely elongated and alternately arranged covering plates, from the centre of the summit, where they interlock and probably cover the presumably subtegminal mouth. In the only specimens known to the writer these plates roof over the ambulacral grooves, from the middle of the summit, for distances varying from one-half to fully two-thirds of the entire length of each groove, but always, at least, as far outward as to the bases of the small alternating subtriangular plates. On some of the ambulacral grooves only eight covering plates can be counted on each side, in a longitudinal direction, but on others there\nare as many as fourteen on each side. In the latter case the circumstance that several of the outermost covering plates are crushed down into the ambulacral grooves leads to the inference that the grooves may have been almost or completely roofed over in perfect specimens. A central area at the summit, in which the ambulacral areas or covered inner ends of the ambulacral grooves are everywhere in close contact with the small alternating subtriangular plates, is bounded by the bases of the latter. Outside of this area the ambulacral areas suddenly become more widely divergent, and their grooves are bordered on each side by a prominent raised rim. At the outer end of each of the ambulacral areas, where the covering plates have been removed or are absent, there is a longitudinal row of marginal pores on the inner surface of the raised rim which bounds the groove on both sides, as shewn in fig. 22, and the whole of the outer declivity or downward slope of the rim is transversely corrugated or ribbed.\n\n\"When examined with a lens, the whole surface of the calyx, of the covering plates of the ambulacral grooves and of the small subtriangular plates which alternate with the inner ends of the ambulacral areas at the summit, is seen to be densely pitted or perhaps perforated.\n\n\"Two specimens of this species, both collected by Mr. John Stewart in 1886 from the Trenton limestone at Division St., Ottawa, are in the Museum of the Geological Survey of Canada, and an imperfect specimen from the same locality has been kindly lent to the writer by Mr. Walter R. Billings. All three of these specimens, when found, were almost completely covered with a very tenacious shaly limestone, and although they have been both carefully and skillfully cleaned, it is just possible that some of the covering plates of the ambulacral grooves may have been accidentally removed in the cleaning. At present, also, it is not possible to ascertain from either, whether the dense pitting of so large a portion of their surface is caused by \"conjugate\" pores or not. It is only proper to add that the general outlines of the plates of which the calyx is composed in this species, were first suggested to the writer by Mr. W. R. Billings, who, as is well known, has devoted much time to the study of the crinoids and cystideans of the Trenton limestone of the Ottawa valley.\n\n\"Astrocystites would seem to be most nearly related to Asteroblastus, Eichwald, and is probably referable to the same family, though it clearly differs from that genus in several important particulars. Thus, a comparison of the plates of which the calyx is composed in these two genera shews that, although they have much the same shape and style of sculpture, yet those of Asteroblastus are both small and very numerous, while those of Astrocystites are large and comparatively few in number. The anal region of Astrocystites, too, is lateral and well defined, but no indications of\nany such region have yet been observed in *Asteroblastus*. The summit, also, is very differently constructed in these two genera. In *Asteroblastus* there is a central oral aperture, immediately surrounded by five apical plates, and the ambulacral areas, which are comparatively broad and short, do not reach to the centre. No traces of the oral aperture are visible anywhere on the summit of *Astrocystites*, the mouth of that genus being apparently subtegminial, and the ambulacral areas, which are long and narrow, extend to the centre, where their covering plates interlock.\n\n\"The ambulacral areas of *Astrocystites* are somewhat like those of *Blastoidocrinus*, but, in the latter genus (which is still known only from the few fragments collected by E. Billings from the Chazy limestone of the Island of Montreal and its immediate vicinity, and from the imperfect specimens from the \"Orthoceratitenkalk\" of Pulkowa, Russia, described and figured by Friedrich Schmidt) the spaces between them are completely filled with the large deltoids, which, according to E. Billings \"extend the whole length of the pseudambulacra.\"\n\n\"There are, also, apparently, some points of resemblance between *Astrocystites*, and *Cystoblastus*, Volborth, but in Zittel's description of the latter genus, which is the only one that the writer has access to, there are said to be two pectinated rhombs in the calyx, whereas no traces of such structures have been observed in the dorsal cup of *Astrocystites*.\n\n\"In 1874* Schmidt expressed the opinion that *Blastoidocrinus*, *Asteroblastus*, *Mesites* and *Cystoblastus* are all cystidea which may be regarded as intermediate in their characters between that class and the blastoids, and it is quite clear that these are the genera to which *Astrocystites* is most closely allied. 'Blastoids,' writes Dr. Charles Eastman, in the first volume of his Translation of Zittel's Text-book of Paleontology, published in 1896, 'have not been recognized, as such, up to the present time, in strata lower than the Silurian; but it is possible that several genera occurring in the Ordovician of North America and Russia (*Blastoidocrinus*, *Asteroblastus*, etc.), which are now referred to the Cystids, may eventually be transferred to the Blastoidea.' In that event, *Astrocystites* would, of course have to be included in the same category. On the other hand, Etheridge and Carpenter, on page 129 of their 'Catalogue of the Blastoidea in the Geological Department of the British Museum,' published in 1886, say distinctly 'we have no certain evidence of the existence of true Blastoidea anterior to the Upper Silurian period. For we much doubt, as we have explained in the previous chapter, whether the problematical *Blastoidocrinus* from the Lower Silurian of Canada and Russia can properly be referred to this group.'\"\n\nNicholson and Lyddeker, in the\n\n---\n\n* \"M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences de St.-Petersbourg, VIIe S\u00e9rie, tome XXI, p. 25.\"\nfirst volume of their 'Manual of Palaeontology,' published in 1889, follow Johannes Muller's classification of the Cystoid\u00e6, and divide the class 'into the three orders, of the Aporitid\u00e6, Diploporitid\u00e6 and Rhombiferi, according as the calycine plates are imperforate, are pierced by yoked pairs of pores indiscriminately distributed, or have their pores arranged in pore-rhombs.' Of these three orders, Astrocytites would seem to be most probably referable to the Diploporitid\u00e6.\" Figures 21; 21a & 22 of this paper are reproductions of original drawings by Mr. L. M. Lambe.\n\nA few months later, in a postscript to this paper, published in the Canadian Record of Science for July, 1897, but which was not issued until January, 1898, the generic name Astrocytites was changed to Steganoblastus, at the suggestion of Dr. F. A. Bather, who thought that it was too near to Asterocystis, Haeckel (1896).\n\nThe specimens upon which S. Ottawaensis were based have since been studied somewhat exhaustively by Dr. Bather, whose general conclusions thereon are summarized in part III, chapter XII, of the \"Treatise on Zoology,\" edited by Dr. E. Ray Lankester, and published in 1900. Dr. Bather thinks that Steganoblastus is more nearly related to Edrioaster than to Asteroblastus, and makes it the type of a new family, which he calls Steganoblastidae, and places in the class Edrioasteroidea of E. Billings. The family and genus are thus described, and the typical species figured (but with other numbers) by Dr. Bather, on pages 209 & 210 of the volume cited.\n\n\"Family 4. Steganoblastidae. Edriasteroidea, with a rigid theca composed of plates relatively larger and thicker than in other families of this class; these include elements comparable to the R R and B B of Blastoidea; B B attached to a stem, probably short; ambulacra descend into the radials. Genus\u2014Steganoblastus, Whiteaves (1897, originally described as Astrocytites, name preoccupied), Ordovician, Canada\" (figs. 23 and 24). \"The remarkable resemblance to Asteroblastus, insisted on by its founder, suggested the reference of Steganoblastus to the Protoblastoidea (Bather, 1899); but the ambulacra are now known to have essentially the same structure as in Edrioaster, while the absence of brachioles may be maintained with confidence. Theca piriform, its plates strongly marked with axial folds, and consisting of: B B (5?, sutures not clear); R R, 5, alternating with B B, and receiving the distal ends of the ambulacra; interambulacrals, one large one and an uncertain number of smaller ones, in each interradius; 5 slightly pitted plates of spear-head shape, stretching up between the ambulacra to the oral pole and simulating O of Crinoidea or \u0394 of Blastoidea, but perhaps being only proximal covering-plates. The anus pierces one interambulacrum, and slightly disturbs the pentamerous symmetry of the theca. From the mouth 5 ambulacra stretch about half-way down the theca; the adambulacrals (side-\nor flooring-plates) appear almost anchylosed, but the pores between them are very clear, and one can trace the original median line of suture; the ambulacrals or covering-plates were stout, at least in the proximal regions, where they seem to have combined with the spear-head plates to form a solid roof over mouth and food-grooves. Stem small, round, with lumen less than half the diameter. Fifty years ago Steganoblastus would have been described as a generalized or synthetic type, with Cystid, Blastoid, Crinoid and Asteroid affinities; it is simpler to regard it as a specialized Edrioasteroid, in which features common in stalked genera of other classes have been evolved independently under similar conditions of existence.\"\n\nMATHERIA BREVIS, Whiteaves.\n\n*Matheria brevis*, Whiteaves.........May, 1903.

Billings in 1858, in the third volume of the Canadian Naturalist and Geologist. It was based upon a single species, the *M. tener* of Billings, a small lamellibranchiate or pelecypodous bivalve, from the Trenton limestone of Lake St. John, P.Q. *Matheria* appears to be most nearly related to *Cyrtodonita* and\nVanuxemia, and is now included in the family Cyrtodontidae, Ulrich, of the order Prionodesmacea, Dall. The types of *M. tener*, which were collected by Mr. J. Richardson and Dr. R. Bell in 1857, at Blue Point, on Lake St. John, are still in the Museum of this Survey.\n\n\"A second species of this genus, from the Trenton shales of Minnesota, was described by Mr. Ulrich in 1892, under the name *M. rugosa*, in the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. And, in his report on the Lower Silurian Lamellibranchiata of Minnesota, published in 1897, in volume three, part two, of the final Report on the Geology of Minnesota, Mr. Ulrich expresses the opinion that the *Modiolopsis recta* of Hall, from the Niagara limestone of Wisconsin and Illinois, is also a *Matheria*.\n\n\"In the Museum of the Geological Survey there are a few specimens of a fourth and previously undescribed as well as unfigured species of this genus, from the Trenton limestone of Ottawa, collected many years ago by E. Billings and labelled by him with the manuscript name *Matheria brevis*. This species may now be defined and characterized as follows.\n\n**Matheria brevis.**\n\n*Matheria brevis*. Fig. 25.

The transverse annulations average from two and a half to three millimetres apart, at their summits, and are separated by shallow depressions nearly twice as wide as themselves. The longitudinal ribs or ridges are equidistant, uniform in size, and, on an average, about one millimetre and a half apart. The crossing of these ribs by the transverse annulations makes a very regular and rectangular reticulation, which is plainly visible to the naked eye, but the crowded transverse raised lines cannot be well seen without the aid of a lens.

Its surface ornamentation \"appears to be decidedly different from that of any of the small annulated species of Orthoceras from the Trenton limestone of the State of New York described and figured by Hall in the first volume of the Palaeontology of that State. O. bilineatum, Hall, is a much larger and more robust species, with coarser annulations and two series of longitudinal ridges or linear elevations.\n\n\"In O. clathratum, Hall, the longitudinal markings are very minute and crowded, and are said to consist of 'sharp elevated lines distant \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch,' or very little more than half a millimetre apart. There are, also, no comparatively coarse and distant longitudinal ribs or ridges in O. textile, Hall, and in that species the transverse annulations are represented as both prominent and angular.\n\n(Orthoceras Westoni, which was described in the same paper as O. Beauportense, and which has not been figured, is based upon a specimen from the Trenton limestone at Montreal, which the writer now thinks to be part of the siphuncle of an Endoceras. The \"distant and very obliquely flattened annulations\" of the exterior of this specimen are probably septal rings, like those of a Piloceras, and the obscure indication of a supposed siphuncle, as exposed in a transverse fracture, is probably part of the endosiphuncle.)\n\nC.

Billings, which he collected at Galt in 1857, and a slightly smaller one from Elora, collected by Mr. T. C. Weston in 1867. These are the only specimens known to the writer upon which any portion of the test is preserved. Both of them have recently been examined by Dr. Ulrich, who writes as follows in regard to them, in a letter dated April 7, 1906. \"As is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by the peripheral portion of the smaller specimen, this is not a *Murchisonia*, nor even one of the Pleurotomariidae. It is no less certain that it is congeneric with *Trochus Kolmodini* and *T. Wisbyensis*, Lindstr\u00f6m. Indeed it is closely allied specifically to these Gotland shells, especially to the former. Whether Lindstr\u00f6m was justified in referring these species to *Trochus*, or not I have not decided, though inclined to doubt it.\" In the writer's judgment, the reference of *M. Billingsana* to the Linn\u00e6an genus *Trochus*, as now defined, would be almost as unsatisfactory as its original reference to *Murchisonia* has proved to be. Its surface markings are remarkably similar to those of *Holopea Harmonia*, Billings.\n\n**Pleurotomaria bispiralis**, Hall.\n\nIn their memoir on the Guelph Fauna in the State of New York, Clarke & Ruedemann regard this species as a *Lophospira*. Ulrich, however, dissents from this conclusion and gives the following reasons for his dissent, in a letter dated January 20, 1906. \"*P. bispiralis*, Hall. As figured by Clarke and Ruedemann (pl. 10, figs. 7 and 8) this species cannot justly fall under *Lophospira*. Its relations seem to me to be altogether different, the band as represented being distinctly concave instead of convex. The characters shown in figs. 7 and 8 recall *Eotomaria* on the one hand (whorls too full below) and the aberrant *Plethospira* recently distinguished as *Ulrichospira* by Miss Donald. Without good specimens I hesitate to decide its position. Clarke and Ruedemann's figure 6, if the drawing is correct, seems to me to represent something quite different.\nThe general form, direction of the lines of growth and absence of a distinct, concave band, suggest *Eunema* very strongly. Figure 6 (Clarke and Ruedemann, pl. 10) seems to me to be the true *P. bispiralis*, 7 and 8 apparently something new.\u201d Figure 9 on the same plate, which Ulrich does not refer to in these notes, seems to the writer to be also quite different from figure 6.\n\n**Pleurotomaria Viola**, Billings.\n\nIn a letter dated April 7, 1906, Dr. Ulrich expresses the opinion that the type of this species, which is figured on Plate 12, fig. 2, of the second part of this volume, is a \u201c*Poleumita* near *P. discors* (Sowerby). It is, however,\u201d he writes \u201cas you say, a wretched cast, and better specimens, if you could satisfy yourself that they were really the same species, might show quite different affinities, with *Trochonema*, for instance. My opinion is based (1) on the general form of the shell and whorls, which is not unlike that of the higher varieties of *P. discors*; (2) on the broad retral bend of the under side of the lip; and (3) on the indications, obscure it is true, of revolving ridges.\u201d\n\n**Pleurotomaria Cyclostoma**, Whiteaves.\n\n\u201cThis certainly is an extraordinary type, though its relations are not so far to seek as may appear at first sight. Despite the well-developed slit-band, I am still of the opinion that it does not belong to the Pleurotomariidae. Its nearest relatives, however, are among Gotland species referred to *Pleurotomaria* by Lindstr\u00f6m. One of these, (*P. planorbis*, Hisinger) I have already removed to the Euomphalidae under the new generic name *Hisingeria*. (See Minnesota report). The other relatives are Lindstr\u00f6m\u2019s *P. praetexta* and *P. togata*. In the *Hisingeria* we have a narrow yet distinct slit-band, but the type is distinguished generically from *P. cyclostoma* by its planorbiform shell and narrower and more simple band. The *P. praetexta* group agrees better with your shell in general aspect and in the position of the carina, that corresponds to the band in *P. cyclostoma*, but the much better developed, and more sharply defined and concave instead of convex character of the band, together with the closed umbilicus on your species, constitutes sufficient ground for generic separation. In short, I would establish a new genus for *P. cyclostoma*, another for *P. praetexta*, et alii, and provisionally refer both, with *Hisingeria*, to the Euomphalidae. Undoubtedly all of these shells are related to *Euomphalopterus*, which I have referred, I fear erroneously, to the Raphistomidae.\u201d Ulrich, in letter dated March 19, 1906.\n\n**Pleurotomaria Townsendii**, Whiteaves.\n\nThe type of this species, which was described on page 77 of the second,\npart of this volume, as a \"natural mould of the exterior of the shell\", etc., would be more correctly described as a well preserved hollow, testiferous specimen, that has been broken longitudinally in such a way as to expose the concave inner surface of about one half of each of the five volutions. Its characters are clearly indicative of a new generic type, which there is not sufficient material to define satisfactorily.\n\nEuomphalus Galtensis, Whiteaves.\nEuomphalus inornatus, Whiteaves.\nEuomphalus circinatus, Whiteaves.\nStraparollus Hippolyte, Billings.\nStraparollina Daphne, Billings.\n\nPoleumita, Clarke and Ruedemann.\n\nEuomphalus (pars) Sowerby. ...........1814.

Ulrich, however, who is the founder of the genus Gyronema, is not of that opinion, and in a letter dated April 13, 1906, writes as follows on this point. \"P. sulcata is a Poleumita and not a Gyronema because of its subircular mouth, the association of opercula with it, the greater directness with which the lines of growth cross the under side of the volutions and the fact that the\nstrongest of the revolving ridges occur in the umbilical region (comp. Oriostoma globosum as figured by Lindstr\u00f6m).

On the other hand, in an unpublished M.S. list of the fossils collected at that locality by Dr. R. W. Ells in 1875, Mr. Billings refers to the Zaphrentidae as \"*Petraia*, two new sp.,\" and does not identify any of them with his *P. rustica* or *P. latuscula*.\n\nPage 115.\nFor \"*Homotrypella gracilis*, Nicholson.

IV) Mr. Lambe expressed the opinion that the specimens from Lower Fort Garry that were referred to *D. Stokesi*, are identical with the *Palaeophyllum rugosum* of Billings, and that they should be called *Columnaria rugosa*. Three years later (in the second fasciculus of the \"Palaeontologia Universalis,\" p. 29 d) Dr. Walcott says that there \"seems to be no doubt that *Columnaria Thomi*, Hall, and *Diphyphyllum Stokesi*, Whiteaves, are species of *Cyathophyoides*, \"which, it may be added, is probably not generically distinct from *Columnaria*. If, however, the specimens from Lower Fort Garry are identical with the \"Lithostrotion Stokesi\" of Milne-Edwards and Haime, from Lake Winnipeg, it would seem that they\nshould be called *Columnaria Stokesii*.\n\nPage 153.\nLine nine from bottom, for \"1886,\" read\u20141881; and line eight from bottom, for \"57,\" read\u201457 c.\n\nPage 155.\nLine six from top, for \"Porites,\" read *Protaroea*.\n\nPage 183.\nLine ten from top, for \"original\", read\u2014marginal.\n\nPage 193.\nFor \"Solenospira pagoda (Salter) var. occidentalis.\" read:\u2014\n\n*Ectomaria pagoda* (Salter) var. occidentalis,\n\nAccording to Miss Donald (Quart.
