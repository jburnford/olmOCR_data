The deceased gentleman was one of the earliest parliamentarians in the Canadian Parliament, and previous to that for several years represented Cape Breton in the Nova Scotia Legislature. He was elected senator at the Port of Sydney, C.B., for many years, and was distinguished for his urbanity of manner, his zeal and his generous hospitality. Hon. Mr. Bourinot was the father of the able and efficient clerk of the House of Commons, now holding the position of chief clerk of the world of letters.\n\nThe late Stephen Field, a highly educated and efficient public servant, has been taken suddenly away at Ottawa, Alpheus Thomas Field, who has been connected with the Parliamentary Library since Confederation in 1867, died suddenly of apoplexy of the brain whilst engaged in the preparation of the Hon. Charles Tupper's speech in the House of Commons. He was born in 1827. He emigrated to Canada with his parents when a child, and became a member of the staff of Captain John Scott, of her Majesty's Ninth Regiment. He was appointed assistant librarian of the Parliamentary Library in 1869 and principal librarian of the Assembly of Canada after the union of Upper and Lower Canada. He held the same office after the Confederation of British North America in 1867. He was honorary secretary of the Royal Society of Canada, Kingston, Ont., and was created a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1878. He was also the author of a Manual of Parliamentary Practice, for colonial use (1846); Parliamentary Practice (1867); 2 vol. History of London, 1867; History of the Government in the British Colonies (1880), and of various pamphlets. The Parliamentary Library contains about 150,000 volumes. The annual report of the Librarian of Parliament was laid on the table of the House of Commons in 1883. About 1,500 new volumes were purchased during the year, making the total number in the library one hundred and seven thousand five hundred.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\n\nSPINK & MAVEETY\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.

O. DAVIS & CO.\n\nBRANCH STORE\n\nPRINCE ALBERT - SASK.\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN\n\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1884\nPRAYING FOR A REPORTER.\n\nA remarkable scene in the Salvation Army barracks.\n\nOn Friday evening, the Salvation Army barracks was filled with a large crowd of people gathered to pray for a reporter. The reporter had been reported missing by his friends and family, and the prayers were being offered in hopes of locating him.\n\nThe prayers were led by a woman who spoke passionately about the importance of prayer and the power of God. She reminded everyone present that the reporter was a child of God and that he would be found.\n\nAs the prayers continued, the atmosphere became increasingly tense. Some of the reporters present began to argue with each other, while others tried to maintain a sense of calm.\n\nAfter several minutes of prayer, a man approached the group and handed them a note. The note contained a message from the reporter, stating that he was safe and well.\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause as the news was shared. The prayers had been answered, and the reporter was finally found.\nTHE MARQUIS OF LORNE ON CANADA.\n\nOur dear Governor General in delivering speeches in Great Britain in which he spoke the future of Canada with no uncertain sound. At Glasgow the other day he was pressed by the ladies of the town. In the evening he delivered a lecture before the Young Men's Christian Association on \"Canada and the North West,\" and closed his talk with the following illustration to the North West:\n\nNEW LANDS IN THE NORTH WEST.\n\nAway to the North of the present Canadian boundary there is an indefinite amount of excellent country. Mr. Macdonald, one of the most intelligent who has been here for years and still in charge of Swan River District, says:\n\n\"I have lived in the North-West two months. I have visited every quarter of nearly every mile of country through which lines of railway will be constructed. I am convinced there is no hesitation in saying the Manitoba and North Western Railway people have to-day the best railway charter in Canada. They will open up large areas of agricultural, grazing, timber, coal, and mineral lands of any country of equal magnitude, and secure for itself from first, I believe, paying traffic.\n\n\"And the conclusions of this observation are confirmed by the opinions of other high authorities upon the country. Mr. A. L. Russell, in the Government Report on the North-West, 1878, describes the northern portion of this section, and says\u2014'During the past year I have spent six weeks in various parts of Manitoba and the North-West. I have never seen greater luxuriance of growth than here, nor do I consider the soil of that Province as frequently a stiff clay, as inviting to the farmer as the most fertile soil of this continent.'\n\n\"Besides its superior soil, the North-West contains enormous deposits of coal, iron, gold, silver, lead, and other minerals of surface. Immense deposits of salt exist on Lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, and on Salt Lake. Numerous petroleum springs are seen along the valley of the Athabasca, and gold is found in considerable quantities in certain parts of the country, so that although we are not safe in saying that this vast interior is a mine of mineral wealth, yet there is no doubt that it holds much more than the present value of civilized man.\n\n\"This is the land of emigrants he will find here in this country.\n\n\"The land to emigrate.\n\n\"They who would leave the old country in order that they may at their time have full pockets and best remain at home. The classes not wanted are clerks and shop assistants, teachers and all women who cannot work with their hands. All who can work at the farm in the North-West, could succeed in this country, and be certain, if they have physical ability of good success. The classes desired are agricultural labourers and able-bodied farmers; the women wanted are, of course, the healthy ones. If they are able, of course they must be able to put their hands to work. Fine ladies and fine ladies' maids are not wanted. Farmers, say from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 a year, for these men will have opportunities of making money, and will be able to purchase what they cannot realise at home. It is most remarkable that such men and of such families should be willing to come. Almost always hears that they like their own life. (Applause.) For one letter received from a man of a gentlemanly appearance, I have seen six others, each one of the fullest contentment; indeed, so curiously has any complaint been made, that I have taken the trouble to investigate a few cases of alleged failure, and I am forced to say that in the case of several of them I have come across undeniable evidence that they were tramped up by interested parties, and were not, as I state at all, what they were claimed to be understood, that which Canada offers is not an El Dorado such as that which inspired Cortez and Pizarro, who went to the South American shores expecting tribes of Indians to meet them, who brought heaps of gold and silver unto curious works of art, and whose dreams were realised, came wonderfully near the truth. It is not the same paradise that Canada offers. Her offer is this: a comfortable home on your own soil, a home that has the greenest of lawns and a decent knowledge how to use him; if he had something of his own to start with, so much the better will it be for him. (Applause.)\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE Prince Albert Directory AND BUSINESS GUIDE.\n\nIt is proposed to issue a Business Directory for the town of Prince Albert and vicinity, containing a list of local firms. Which will contain the advertisements of each business establishment, (to be in strict accordance with rate) and a description of the same.\n\nThe produce will contain a history of Prince Albert, its present condition and future prospects, together with a statement of this year's crops, as far as they can be ascertained for the District of Lorne, extent of land cultivated, number of horses, cattle, sheep, etc., last year's crop, population of District, and other useful information, written by a well-known authority.\n\nAbout 500 or more copies will be published (according to the encouragement received) which will be distributed throughout the Dominion and the Mother Country.\n\nIt is hoped that by this means, benefit will accrue not only to each individual advertiser and subscriber, but that the whole country will become better known and appreciated both at home and abroad, and a healthy propaganda extended to this country.\n\nPrice of wholesale\u2014whole pages, two copies given free.

I had heard a barber barber about one well known, and the barber and the shaved were in position to look up into the street.\n\n\"Who's that?\" cried the customer.\n\n\"I would freeze fast and be spoiled the first day I repented the barber.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come under there?\"\n\n\"Ah! there was a track the floor up.\"\n\n\"There they go.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't pay. It wouldn't pay the ice off until noon, and by that time you've got yourself this way, and the ice disappears.\"\n\n\"What makes you have such queer paper on the thing, for your hair and mouth and all those queer designs make my head dizzy. I fancy some people who haven't shaved at their former places go out and find they've got an attack of the jimmies.\"\n\n\"Don't think so,\" said you.\n\n\"No more than that.\"\n\n\"Such a nice well enough, but it might not seem some people.\"\n\n\"You're next,\" called out the barber to a young man who had just come from the shaving-room.\n\n\"What is he next for?\" asked me in the interrogation point in the chair.\n\n\"That's our rule,\" said the barber.\n\n\"Quite right all right through, I suppose,\" remarked the barber in an undertone.\n\n\"What do you call a fair day's work for a barber? How many men can a barber shave in a day?\"\n\n\"That depends.\"\n\n\"Depends on what?\"\n\n\"Why, the kind of a barber he is. A fast man might shave fifty or sixty men in a day.\"\n\n\"No more than that?\"\n\n\"Not more than that,\" answered the barber.\n\n\"Four business isn't it? Why don't you get out of it?\"\n\n\"I can't get out of it very well.\"\n\n\"Why can't you, don't you know any other business?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"There's nothing doing I don't understand. You see the man in the chair, and that is why you barbers always comb a man's hair at the side, and slick it down, so that it looks like a shaven chin. Why don't you comb it himself?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know how they comb it themselves,\" answered the barber.\n\n\"They say you comb every man's hair different. You do every man's hair just so, and a man who has any shame at all will look at the glass and fix it over his head.\"\n\n\"We never complain of that,\" said the barber mildly.\n\n\"Oh, but don't you? Don't you look cross-eyed at him and say when he does that? Don't deny it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Oh yes you do. Now when I get up and take off all these things and cuffs and spit cords you have fixed, and all those little devices you have put the hair upon you will see that I will want you to buy for brushing of my coat, say?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" answered the barber.\n\n\"What are your barbers in such con-\n\nsternation about?\"\n\n\"I didn't know they were.\"\n\n\"Well, they are. Every time I come in here to get shaved they run their fingers through my hair and say if I wouldn't like to have a shampoo. Well, when I say no they take their thumb nail, dig into my head, and say they have taken off some of my skin they show it to me and tell me my head is in a fearful condition, and to look out for \"white head.\" What do they do that for?\"\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS!\n\nChas.
