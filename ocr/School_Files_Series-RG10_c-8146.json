We have marked the location of the teacher's residence on the lot, which runs between No. 3 and No. 5, 100 ft. and fifty feet back from the road.\n\nIf the authority to go in and make the repairs to the building comes in time, Mr. Butler expects to be able to have it ready for the teacher by the 1st of May next. Meanwhile there being no place for him to board back there and stay out being a holiday leaving only four listing days in next week, we gave permission for him not to start tomorrow till the following Monday.\n\nIn reference to the distribution of lands which we talked over with Mr. Stewart, the lands in question are No. 6 and No. 7. No. 6 has been drawn to the Fosse lot. J. Fosse sold his right to it to Mrs. Fosse and moved to the Amargosa Valley. She rented the land to Bennett Eisehans. When he died last year it was left vacant as his lease had expired. The former owner with families wanted land and offered to pay for improvements thirty-five dollars each. George Smith paid thirty-five dollars cash for half of it, and Mr. McLean gave a three months note for the other half. The latter man is going on Bennett Eisehans' property, and he having had possession for some little time is not satisfied and claims some of the land.\n\nLot No. 8. When J. Perry's wife died he gave up his land, and the tract was moved off. Mr. Harlow, again at that time gave Frank Perry possession of it. When Mrs. Fosse died Frank came into possession of her lot and gave up his right to No. 8. Therefore Butler gave a three months note for half of this lot; on which note he paid $25.\n\nTrusting this is satisfactory and awaits your further orders.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nBridgeport, N.S.\nAug. 28, 1917\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo: Osias Bealer,\nScarsdale, N.S.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1917 | Sept. 5 | For house and lot 50' x 100' for residence for teacher of the New Germany Indian School.

Maclean\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your favor of the 30th ultimo which is in reference to a complaint made to you that Miss Quinn, teacher of the Nepissing Indian School at Bancroft has not been attending properly to her duties, I wish to say that I shall inform Miss Quinn of the complaint made, request her to see that in future she so conducts herself as not to give any further cause for complaint, or I shall be compelled to request her to hand in her resignation.\n\nYour letter does not state the nature of the complaint lodged against Miss Quinn, and I shall be glad if you will kindly advise me what the complaint consists of, so that I can, on my next visit to the Reserve (which will be I presume sometime towards the end of the present month), investigate the cause of complaint.\n\nI may say that both Mr. School Inspector Grant & myself look upon Miss Quinn as a capable teacher, judging by an examination of the pupils under her charge which I made last fall the progress they are making is very satisfactory.\n\nIn regard to the complaint that she refuses to teach the children of Mr. McNamara, the station...\nSir,\n\nI think this statement is hardly correct. Mr. McNamara's children being of white origin progress more rapidly in their studies than the Indian children, & Mr. McNamara desires that special classes should be established for the advancement of his children which would of course entail considerable extra work on the teacher. I shall however investigate this matter also on my next visit to the Reserve & find out the exact position of affairs & report to you more fully meantime.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.B.

Brennan of North Bay, the teacher in charge of this school, requesting her to call on Dr. McNulty and find out how long he thinks the school should remain closed. I have also written the doctor asking him to inform me as to when he thinks it will be safe to reopen this school & I presume it will be advisable for me to follow out his advice in this matter.\n\n(Signed) W.T.B. Maclean\nInd. Dept.\nOTTAWA, 7th January, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 28th ultimo which refers to the closing of the Nipissing school on account of an outbreak of smallpox on the reserve, I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by you and agree with you that you should be guided by the advice of Dr McMurphy as to its re-opening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nSecretary\n\nW. B. Maclean, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Sweezy has assumed charge of the Reserve Indian School at Beauce without having received any appointment or any authority from me to do so.\n\nThe first intimation I had of this was on receipt of a letter from her on the 30th ultimo asking for some school supplies for the school, the letter being signed \"Sarah Sweezy Teacher\". Prior to the receipt of this letter I had appointed Miss Christina McLeod of Pembroke as teacher of the school & authorized her to proceed to Beauce to open the school at the earliest possible moment which she did on Sept 1st. On her arrival at Beauce she found the school in charge of Miss Sweezy consequently she returned to Pembroke.\n\nOn receipt of Miss Sweezy's letter I at once wrote her that I was at a loss to know by what authority she was teaching at Beauce as she had received no appointment to do so. I also informed her that Miss McLeod had been appointed to take charge of the school & would arrive at Beauce on the 1st inst when I would expect her to vacate the school premises at once.\n\nAs Miss McLeod was engaged by me in good faith to take charge of this school I have written her that she may consider herself in the employ of the Department of Indian Affairs and\nThe Secretary...\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThat all expenses incurred in going to Beauce or returning to her home at Humboldt will be paid by your Department. I have also notified her to hold herself in readiness to again proceed to Beauce as soon as Miss Sweney has been compelled to vacate the school.\n\nI have today written Chief James Commanda of the Nepisigong Band expressing my astonishment at the state of affairs which exist at the Beauce school, notifying him that Miss Sweney must leave the school at once & informing him that Miss McLeod the duly authorized teacher for this school would hold herself in readiness to proceed to Beauce as soon as Miss Sweney had vacated the premises.\n\nI have learned that Miss Sweney was sent to Beauce by the Catholic Trust at Massy which of course is most unwarranted action.\n\nI shall thank you to advise me at the earliest possible moment if any action in the matter meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.B. Maclean\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, 19th September, 1932\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant reporting that when Miss McLeod, the teacher engaged by you for the Beauage (Nipissing) school, went there to assume her duties after the summer holidays, she found it in charge of Miss Sarah Sweasy, who had received no appointment or authority from you to teach there.\n\nThe Department approves of your action in notifying the Chief that Miss Sweasy must leave the school at once and that it must be placed in charge of your nominee, Miss McLeod.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Rev. George Grant Inspector of Public Schools for the District has a teacher named Mrs. Leonie Landry of North Bay engaged to take charge of this school, but at the last moment she declined to go to Beausoleil. I have therefore advertised in the Toronto Globe for a teacher for this school & hope to secure one shortly to assume the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B. Maclean\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa, 9th September, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of 4th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves of the action of advertising in the Toronto Globe for a teacher for the Nipissing Indian School.

McMurchy of North Bay advising me that there is an outbreak of scarlet fever at Bearage & Duchesnay Creek on the Nipissing Reserve & suggesting that the school remain closed until the New Year. I presume it will be advisable to carry out the Doctor's suggestion.\n\nImmediately prior to the receipt of the Doctor's letter I had secured a teacher named Miss Marcan to re-open the school on the 1st and she had started for the Reserve before I could notify her of the outbreak of scarlet fever. As she has incurred some expense in going to the Nipissing Reserve & returning to her home at North Bay it will be only right to pay her whatever amount this has cost her. I will advise you of what the amount will be in the usual way when Miss Marcan writes me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

In reply I beg to say that under the circumstances, the Department approves of the school being closed until January.\n\nThe Department will pay the transport of the teacher from North Bay to Nipissing and return, on condition that it is not held liable for any salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nW.B.

Comanda complains that this teacher tries to talk in the Indian language to the children and uses Indian phrases and words which she does not understand the meaning of and which if she did understand the meaning of she certainly would not use.

You will of course understand that Indians are very childish and I have only this man's word to go by and have not taken the matter up with the Indian agent at all, but was asked to write this letter by Commanda himself. If you thought it wise to have the Indian agent Mr. Cockburn look into the matter I would like a letter from you to that effect so that I could have something to report to Frank Commanda.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcKee\nOttawa, May 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that a complaint has been made to you by an Indian named Commanda that the teacher of the Nipissing school in her endeavour to learn the Indian language uses words and phrases which she does not understand with the result that the children laugh at her and are punished in consequence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Cockburn will be requested to inquire into this complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Miller, Barrister of Law, written on behalf of an Indian named Commanda, concerning the conduct of the teacher at the school where he works. The teacher has been instructed to make sure that the children attend school regularly and are punctual. In consequence, I have directed that Commanda be held responsible for any complaints raised by the parents against Commanda's conduct. It is not within the school's jurisdiction to deal with the Rev. Father Smith's Indian missionary work except as they are instructed by the teacher at each school. It is also requested that the catechism in the Indian language be used in attendance.\n\nI visited the school on February 26th, when the missionary (and Commanda) had the trouble. I also wish to request that all the Indians upon this reserve are Roman Catholics will be forbidden to use any other language than the English language during religious services, and that the use of the catechism be continued.\n\nThe Secretary\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your explanation, the Department does not think it would be well to take any steps which would result in the teacher of the Nipissing school having to quit the teaching of the catechism.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This school has never been used by the Indians as the Indians never go there and consequently get no\nBenefit from it. Now there is a lady at Wolf Lake, Miss Kate Dobbin who has been teaching some of the Indian children at Wolf Lake and is residing there. She has no diploma as she never had the need of it but educated at Jean Marie College of Quebec and the lady in charge of the Institution told her that if ever she needed a position as governess that to apply to her and she would certify to her capability to teach. The difficulty up here seems to be that teachers do not care to stop up here long if the department should send us a favorable answer we would go to work to build a school house.

I beg to tell you that I have visited the Indians of Grass Lake and Wolf lake.\n\nI have considered the school question and I have spoken with the Indians.\n\nA certain number of Indians reside in the vicinity of the North river, Hunter's Point, where there is a school at present, and I believe that about a dozen children at least might attend.\n\nMoreover, among the Indians around Wolf Lake, a distance of thirty miles from the preceding place, there would be at least twenty children, and even more, at the school which could be opened there.\n\nSo you can see, if it would be possible to have two schools, this would be perfect.\n\nNevertheless, before deciding, I would advise the Department to send your agent, Mr. A. Renaud, to make an inspection and to investigate for himself the state of things.\n\nMr. A. Renaud, to whom I have spoken, would be ready to take charge of this mission and forward to you a good and just report, on condition that he be remunerated.\n\nI believe also that he might lessen the sale of liquor to the Indians in these surroundings.\n\nYour, &c.,\nIs. Evans, Mins., O.M.I.\n\nP.S. If you come to a decision, reply to Mr. Renaud immediately.\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nRev.

It is thought well to have you visit this locality, look carefully into the circumstances and report fully. I would ask you, therefore, to make this trip at a convenient season after communicating with Rev. Father Evain, Missionary, at North Timiskaming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Renaud, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Timiskaming, Que.\nSir,\n\nReferring to letter of approximately Dec. 36873, regarding establishment of summer school at Wolf Lake. After having considered the question with Mr. Fisher, Evans I judge the proper time for this trip about June 12th.\n\nI would have to be accompanied by one Indian from Lumbering as interpreter. I can get two canoe and outfit for this trip at Chipewa Lake. The men hired to be paid $2 per day and myself $5 per day. It will need take about 2 days for the trip, hoping that this is satisfactory to the department.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nA. R.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Renaud, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Timiskaming, Que.\nOttawa, May 16, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of April 28th, last, in reference to the establishment of a school at Wolf Lake I beg to say that the Department has decided that it will not be necessary for the Agent to visit this locality. If there is a building available for school purposes and if you have in view a satisfactory person who would take charge the Department is prepared to try the experiment for two months this summer and will pay a salary at the rate of $50.00 per month. When reporting as to the qualifications of the teacher and in reference to the building be good enough to state where a small supply of school material can be sent for the use of the school. The question of continuing the school for the summer seasons will depend upon the results attained this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Is.

As soon as this is done the necessary stationery will be ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. Is.

Father Evain appointing me trustee of the Indian School at Wolf Lake and informing me that I was to get the material for the school at Hunter's Point and a letter from the department telling me when the things would be delivered at Hunter's Point, but yet I got no word and Father Evain\nis away on his mission to Athabasca. He told me he wanted the school started on the first of July. I did so there are eighteen children at school now and more to come soon. I think there will be 25 or 30 children all told. The school books are some that the teacher got for the Indian children that she was teaching the winter before last.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEd. A.

Father Evain has not yet nominated a teacher to take charge of the Wolf Lake School and until this is done there will, of course, be no necessity to send in school supplies. In view of the fact that the Reverend Father has not replied to the Department's communication of May 29th, last, it is presumed that it is not his intention to take any further action this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Without noticing that you were waiting for a reply, I asked the teacher who was found, as well as the school, to begin the school, and believe that I asked the agent to send to the following address:\n\nEd. Robinson, Wolf Lake, via Hunter's Bay,\n\nthe same material that you sent for the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nLongue Pointe school; and it would still be time to send it, because it's only three weeks since the school was opened and the Indians are willing to send their children all the month of September. The teacher herself purchased some books and slates, while awaiting yours. She has 22 children on the register. Her name is Miss Agnes Robinson; she's 32 years of age, and has taken a good course in the United States.\n\nSo, please send to the following address the material required for a school of 30 children, all beginners, namely:\n\n1. registers\n2. blackboard, 6 feet\n3. dozen slate pencils\n4. dozen slates\n5. dozen drillers\n6. dozen copybooks\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOfficer,\n\n1 doz. pen holders\n1 box of pens\n3 doz. lead pencils\n3 \" Books, Part I\n1 \" Books, Part II\n1 box chalk\n2 blackboard brushes\n1 set of reading cards\n1 dictionary for the teacher\n1 arithmetic book do\n1 grammar do\n1 geography do\n1 history do\n3 doz. small rulers for plates\n1 box of ink powder\n1/2 doz. milk bottles\n\nAllow the material as follows:\n\nMr. Ed.

She has been teaching for that length of time with little or no school material and under those conditions it cannot be expected that much progress will be made. The Department was quite prepared to have sent in a supply of material, but was awaiting the nomination of a teacher by you. It is now too late in the season, as by the time the order would be placed with the Stationery Office and the goods forwarded it would be time to close the school for this year. The Department considers that it would be well to ask Miss Robinson to close for this season as soon as you can get word to her and if you will inform the Department as to her qualifications, etc., the question of re-engaging her next year will be considered. In the meantime Miss Robinson will be paid for the time she put in in the school and she\n\nRev. I.

I regret the misunderstanding; I had understood, on reading your letter rather quickly, on return from the mission, that you had given me authority to open the school at Wolf Lake.\n\nYou were not aware that I was the missionary. I am sometimes absent five or six weeks without returning home, having no knowledge of the letters that come to North Temiskamingue. I have just received your letter at this moment; it was sent to me here, where I am building a new church, which I will rent for a school, since the department has let me understand that it will rent the church for a school during the summer months.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nIs.

Evain\nmissionnaire\nNorth Timiskaming, Feb. 16, 1912.\n\nThe Supt. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 380578, relative to the request of Miss Doeker for the summer school, I beg to make the following remarks:\n\n1. With regard to Wolf Lake I have little confidence as to the success at present, as the families that have children to send to school, and that are half-breeds and Indians, do not reside in the locality of the school, and, besides, I should fear very much that the inconvenience of the travelling and the distance and the lack of comfort would frighten a person not used to the life of the woods.\n\n2. As for the school at Longue Pointe the difficulty is not so great in the matter of distance; but I beg to remark that the school\u2014or rather the church, which is used as a school-house\u2014and near which the Indians camp during the summer\u2014is altogether alone at the present time, there are no white people at all in the neighbourhood. The school mistress will conduct her kitchen as Mrs. McLaren did last summer and as the one at Abitibi also does.\n\nThe school at Bear Island is differently situated; it is easy to board there. Besides the great majority of the children of Bear Island, Timagami, speak English, while it is still rare to hear the Indians of those other places speak English.\nNone the less, I shall be glad to accept your assistance for these different localities by your sending school mistresses.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nI. Evans\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 28, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply I beg to say that your remarks with reference to the summer school at Wolfe Lake are noted. Under the circumstances it would not appear advisable at the present time to conduct a school at this point during the summer months.\n\nIn regard to the Lotus Pointe School Miss Docker has been informed as to the conditions and requested to communicate with you should she desire further information before a definite engagement is made.\n\nI may add for your information that the teacher has already been engaged for the Bear Island School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

As you will see by the contents, the Indians of Grassy Lake intend to reside at Wolf Lake in order to join the families of half-breeds residing there, and so to have a summer school. Therefore, since things are as they are, I should advise the Department to send Mr. A. Renaud, the Indian Agent, to make an inspection of the locality, of the building and the inhabitants in order to get an exact idea of the situation. The best time for this inspection has arrived. From Kipiwa it is easy to go there in a canoe with two men; one can go in one day from North River or Hunter's Point to Wolf Lake.\n\nMr. Robinson can supply the building and the school mistress, the one who was their last year.\n\nVery humbly,\n\nJ. Evain,\nMissionary.\nWolf Lake April 16th 1917\n\nRev. Father Corbin\nNorth Demangan\n\nDear Father,\n\nI write you two lines to ask you if there is any prospect of having school this summer. The Indians have moved down and have built their houses at Wolf Lake and intend to stay here. If the school will open this summer I would like to get for the school supplies:\n\nFirst Book 1st Part $0.50 each\n\" \" 2nd Part $0.50 each\nSecond Book 5 each\nArithmetic 10 \"\nCopy Books 20 \"\nInk - Pen - Pencils 20 \"\nScriber & lead pencils 20 \"\nBlackboards 1 \"\nCrayons 20 \"\nBlackboard eraser\nSlates 20 \"\nSlate pencils 1 box\nDrinking Cups 5 each\n\nThere has only been 1 death among the school children since last school report.\n\nAddress with best wishes\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nEll. A. Robinson\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just received two letters one from Mr. Gathery and one from Mr. Johnson. The tribe of Indians residing there, as you will note, has been very active in their efforts to have summer schools. Mr. Gathery and Mr. Johnson state that it would be to their advantage for the good of these Indian children that the request be granted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with enclosures in reference to the summer school at Wolf Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in February, last, Rev. Father Evain wrote the Department stating that he had little confidence in the success of this school and it was decided that no further action would be taken. It is noted that the half-breeds are referred to in Father Evain's letter, but, as you are aware, it is not within the province of this Department to supply educational facilities for those people. I have to ask you to be good enough to make careful inquiry and ascertain, if possible, how many Indians are likely to be at this point during the summer period and the number of children of school age. In this statement the half-breeds should not be included.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A.

Miss A. Robinson is certainly not able to understand and translate Algonkin, and consequently to advance the Indian children as easily and rapidly as a teacher who spoke both languages. The Catholic Indians have also asked me what their children can receive in the way of religious instruction in their own language while they continue incapable of understanding English. I know Miss Maria King, and have known her for fifteen years. I believe that if it would be agreeable to the Department to make a change, this person is well qualified to fill the position. She is educated and speaks both languages well, and lives in the vicinity of Wolf Lake. I believe, moreover, that she would be esteemed by the Indians. Her address, if it be required, is as follows.\n\nMiss Maria King,\nHunter's Pointe, via Kippawa,\nc/o W.

There are no complaints except in the family of Michel Sturin who has been making trouble for three years.

Last Summer one of\nhis daughters had to have\nan operation performed and\nhe was able to furnish\nTwo Hundred and Fifty Dollars\nand then tried to send the\nDepartment for her treatment.\nI believe where was down\nto Ottawa that his children\nwould have went to School\nif he had known that school was open. Well he lives next door to the school and he interfered with the teacher ringing the Bell to call the children to school.

From information given me on my recent visit to Wolf Lake, it would seem that at no time during the summer there was enough pupils to make it worth while to open the school at all, as the attendance ranged from 1 to 4.\n\nI arrived at Wolf Lake on Friday the 12th of August after the school was closed, and left on Sunday the 14th, so I did not have an opportunity to visit the school while it was open, but the chief and others in the vicinity informed me that there was only one Indian scholar attending. The teacher has not got a register but I examined the book in which she keeps the record of the attendance and found 15 names, 8 of which are white people's children, mostly Yeungs and Robinsens, and they are not attending very regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

Mclean Esq.,\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nSt. Anne, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to know why the school at Wolf Lake has been closed down? We were promised that the school would be kept open for five months at least. I have heard that a report was sent in that only one child was attending the school. That is not so. I know that twelve attended regularly, two of them were twins and they never missed a day. Other children were not so regular but pretty eighteen families were of age to attend. If their leaders who had children had made arrangements to stay near the school until November.\n\nAnother thing the agent Mr. Lewis I believe...\nit being to make the Indians all go to North River, it will be a great mistake if they go there. They will have no place to hunt or hunt get supplies as easily as here, nor government supplies either. They all have homes here & wood close at hand where as at North River the people have a long distance to get wood as it is all second growth. I think if it is this man stronger Michel Chene who have made the Agent believe it would be better for the Indians to move to North River.\n\nI hear also that they are trying to cut Wood Jackson in Dr James. Slaley we are well satisfied with Dr James & he is good to the Indians & this living in Metawa is convenient for the people if they wish to visit him.\n\nI do not like to trouble you but I would like to see if things could not be more satisfactory for us. Mr Michel Chene had some trouble with the store keeper here Andy Young & the tall Rock Lake. I go skite Andy Young he is trying to get the Indians to leave. There was never any trouble before among the\nhere until Shant & Trager made\ntrue reports to the agent & Indian depart-\nment.\n\nI hope that things will be better for us\nall this winter than they look to be now.\n\nYour most sincerely,\n\nJoseph Petrement (Chief)\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, Sept. 23rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 12th instant regarding the Wolf Lake summer school, I beg to say that from information received, the attendance of Indian children did not warrant this school being conducted after the 31st of August last. It was found that the greater number enrolled were children of white parents.\n\nIt is considered that, as the Indians did not avail themselves of the privilege afforded and have their children attend regularly, it was advisable to close the school on the above date.\n\nRegarding the other matters referred to in your letter, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am the last Hudson Bay manager that has been up here and since I have left the Company they always apply to me when they get into any trouble.\n\nThe chief was complaining about the school being stocked well from my knowledge of the matter there is only one family of white children going to school at the Indian School at Wolf Lake. The trouble is all through Michael Sheen a disturber and former stanger a renegade staff Board from the Reserve at North Temiskaming and he is trying to make trouble for those people here and the latest information I have of them is that the North River people are\nwishing to chase them out from among them\nI don't want to say anything about North\nRiver they need a school there certainly\nBut the Wolf Lake Indians are as badly\nin need of it as at North River\n\nI give you the names of the parties\nthat are trying to make the trouble and\nyou might ask Dr. James for corroboration\nof what I tell you.\n\nWhen Mr. Lewis came\nto Wolf Lake this summer the teacher wished\nto have him examine the scholars but\nhe made the excuse that he had not time\nAnd then I believe reported that the children\nat school were all white children\nI am sure that is not the case and\nat North River there is only three Michel's\nfamily pure Indian and there are some of\na age to go to school now\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.

He reported that at no time during the summer was there enough Indian pupils in attendance to make it worth while to open the school at all. He further stated that of all the children on the roll eight were the children of white parents. I would point out for your information that this Department is not responsible for the providing of educational facilities for white children. As the Indians did not avail themselves of the privileges offered it was decided that it was unnecessary to continue the school.

There is a school at North River and one at Brennan Lake. Now I wish to let you know that there is not a full-blooded Indian child in either of those schools, they are all white and half-breed children in those schools. There were 3 white children and the rest were Indian children and half-breeds living at this mission. We are not able to send our children to North River and Brennan Lake and don't want to have any connection with them for the place is not good for my Indians as there are no hunting grounds down there.\n\nThe Agent was up last fall and the teacher told him that she would call in the children and have him examine them but he made the excuse that\nI had no time and he was only stopped four hours. I was going to tell him the reason that there was so much trouble about the school was that there Michel and James Steiger a half breed was trying to get my Indians to go to North River. But it is not a suitable place for them too much white and too many white people and Indians cannot make a living there.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon in this regard.\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief of Grass Lake or Kipawa Indians\nWolf Lake\nMarch 7th 1922\n\nDr. M.

We will not go to Hunter's Point or Brennan Lake; we intend to remain at Wolf Lake where our...\nChurch is and the Indians don't want to move. There are Indian schools at Brennan Lake and North River. There are only 6 full-blooded Indian children at Brennan Lake School and not one pure-bred child at North River.\n\nI had some trouble in getting some of the Indians to get their children to come to school but now it is all settled and I hope you will see it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Retrimont\nChief\nKiskewa Indians\nTo the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose a letter which I received from Jos.

The children attended so irregularly that it was considered advisable to close the school. Besides, the greater number attending were children of white parents.\n\nIt is noted in the Chief's letter to you that he has promised a better attendance than last year, if the school is re-opened.\n\nWe are taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Lewis, of North Temiskaming, and authorizing him, if he considers there would be a sufficient number of Indian children at this point to warrant the re-opening of the school, to secure the services of a suitable teacher for the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Petremont, Wolf Lake, requesting that the school at this point be re-opened at an early date.\n\nYou will remember that last year when the school was in operation at Wolf Lake, the Indian parents sent their children very irregularly, and, in fact, most of the children enrolled were whites. The Chief says that the Indians refuse to go to Hunter's Point or Brennan's Lake and intend to remain at Wolf Lake.\n\nIf you consider that it would be advisable to re-open the school for the coming summer, I will be pleased if you would endeavor to obtain the services of a suitable teacher. The qualifications and experience of the person nominated by you should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. We will approve of the re-opening of this school if, in your opinion, the attendance will warrant the expenditure incurred in the payment of a teacher's salary.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter, at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter No. 46-6-1 of the 30th of March, re the re-opening of the school at Wolf Lake, I beg to say that I do not think it is advisable to open this school before the first of June. The Wolf lake Indians do not reside permanently at this point. They stay around for a week or so and move away for a while, and back again. Sometimes there are a few children around the school, and at other times practically none.\n\nI have only had one opportunity of visiting Wolf Lake, that being last summer, and at that time there was only one scholar attending school. The teacher was desirous of continuing the school during the months of September and October, but this desire was only prompted by personal motives, as the school attendance did not warrant any such action.\n\nI will endeavor to get some reliable information from Wolf Lake regarding the number of children who would attend school this coming summer, and will make a further report to the Department at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo the Secretary of\nMinistry Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to letter No. 43-6-1 of March 30th regarding the Indian Schools at Wolf Lake, the statement that the Indians there did not attend the school very well, and that those that did attend went very irregularly, I think is quite true. I am not in a position personally to know.\n\nThe statement that the great number attending were children of white parents is absolutely untrue.\n\nOutside of Andrew Young who keeps a trading store at Wolf Lake there is not one white family living there and outside of two of his children who are of school age.\nDr. M. James\nMattawa, Ont.\n\nThere is not a white child attending the school.\n\nThere is a man named Robinson living there, whose first wife was a full-blood woman. It is his daughter by this woman who used to teach the school, and who is now an old girl. His name was in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Co., at one time, and his second wife is a full-blood Indian woman. He had a large family; most of them are now grown up. They are Indians in their habits, in their manners, in their looks, and in their modes of life. They are practically Indians.\n\nThe Indians feel very sore that false statements were made to the Chiefs about them, and on my last visit there I was told by some of them that threats had been made to them, that their school would be pulled down, and that they\nDr. M. James\nMattawa, Ont.\n\nI would call the found to be near Wolf Lake, and move to North River.\n\nFrom my personal knowledge I know if these unfortunate creatures move to North River they will not be a burden on the people or they will starve.\n\nYours truly,\nM. James.\nOTTAWA, April 11th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the question of re-opening the school at Wolf Lake.\n\nI have requested Mr. Agent Lewis, of North Temiskaming, to endeavour to get reliable information regarding the number of children who would attend school during this coming summer. It is expected that he will report at an early date, and we will then be in a position to decide the question of re-opening this school.\n\nLast summer, when this school was in operation, the attendance ranged from 1 to 4 children, although there were the names of 15 children on the register, and it was stated that of this number 8 were white children, mostly Youngs and Robinsons.\n\nI would point out that this Department is not responsible for the providing of educational facilities for half-breeds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nM. James, Esq., M.B.,\nMattawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that I have received applications from Mrs. Alfred Amesse, for the position as teacher of the Long Point summer school, and Mrs. John Pelson for the position as teacher of the summer school at Wolf Lake, Kipawa.\n\nThese are both married women without any family, and I think that they have both taught school before for the Department, before they were married. Mrs. Amesse was a Miss Maria King, and Mrs. Pelson was a Miss Jane Pelson. I do not know much about Mrs. Amesse's ability as a teacher, and I see an official letter on file here No. 35-6-1 of July 1920, by which it appears that the services of Miss Jane Pelson were not very satisfactory during the summer of 1920 while engaged as teacher of the Long Point school.\n\nI have however forwarded their request to the Rev. Father Evans, and probably he will communicate with the Department on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

He also states that he has forwarded these requests to you.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether or not these ladies should be given the positions as teachers at the above named schools for the coming summer months. I may say with reference to Mrs. Polson that in a letter from you dated July 24th, 1920, regarding the services she was performing as teacher at the Long Point school, you recommended at that time that her services be dispensed with on account of her behaviour. Before we can approve of these appointments, we will require to have your concurrence as to whether you approve of their being engaged for the coming summer or not.\n\nWe will be pleased to have an early reply in order to make arrangements for the obtaining of teachers to open the schools on or about the 1st of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Father Evain regarding this matter.\n\nThe Rev. Father states that he approves of the application of Mrs. Alfred Amesse as teacher of the school at Long Point during the coming summer, and her appointment is approved. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid last summer, viz: $75.00 per month, plus any bonus provided by law. You may inform Mrs. Amesse of her appointment, and she should arrange to be at Long Point in time to begin work on the 1st of June next. This school should be in operation during the months of June, July and August, and if weather conditions permit and the Indians children attend, it may be conducted until the end of September. If any school material is required, Mrs. Amesse should prepare a requisition, stating the requirements and giving full directions as to where it should be sent.\n\nRegarding the application of Mrs. John Polson, Father Evain states that he cannot recommend her for any school. Her services while teacher at the Long Point school during the summer of 1920 were not satisfactory. The Department cannot, therefore, approve of her appointment to the Wolf Lake summer school, but you should endeavour to obtain the services of another teacher for this school. Kindly give this matter your early attention in order that, if possible, a teacher can be secured in time to begin work at that point on the 1st of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I understand that you are engaged as private teacher at the home of Mr. D. A. Young, Trader at Wolf Lake. Mr. Young, who visited the Department yesterday, has agreed to equip an 18 x 20 classroom and to encourage the attendance of Indian children at the school. The Department is supplying books, stationery, etc., for the use of the Indian pupils.\n\nAt the end of December, March, June and September, you will please forward to Mr. Z. Casa, Indian Agent, North Temiskaming, Que., quarterly reports showing the attendance of Indian children. Mr. Casa and the Rev. Father Evain have been informed of your appointment. This last named gentleman is associated with the Department in the conduct of the Wolf Lake Indian Day School and you should be prepared to act on his advice and in the summer time to use the church for a classroom.\n\nMr. D.

Mr. D. A. Young, the trader, visited the Department and informed me of his intention to engage a private teacher for his children. The Department agreed to supplement his payments to the teacher with a grant of $25 per teaching month and we have been fortunate in securing a qualified teacher in the person of Miss Eileen Prudhomme, who is well recommended by her uncle, the Rev. Father George Prudhomme, of this city. Mr. Young has agreed to provide a classroom during the winter months and will arrange for the necessary benches, tables, etc. The Department is supplying books and other classroom stationery for the Indian pupils. Mr. Young has promised to encourage the attendance of Indian children and I have written to Chief Jos. Patrimont, urging him to see that the children of the Band attend as regularly as possible.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn that this arrangement commends itself to you and I should be grateful if you would allow the church to be used, as in the past, during the summer months. Miss Prudhomme is prepared to teach catechism to the Indian pupils. This arrangement is an experiment and will be continued if the attendance of the Indian children warrants such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Young, the trader, has arranged for a private teacher for his children and the Department has agreed to add to the salary to the teacher, provided Indian children are taught in the school. During the winter months, the classroom will be at the trading post and in the summer, subject to Rev. Father Evin's approval, at the church. Please see that all Indian children between the ages of 7 and 15, who are physically fit, attend this school as regularly as possible.

I am not at all opposed to the idea of giving him a trial. After one month of teaching, you could judge by the proficiency of the children and the way the school is conducted if it would be advantageous or not to continue.\n\nMr. Ed.

You could start and try at any time, at all, with the consent of the Department, and I am sure you will succeed.\n\nYou could write to Raynolds of Stubb-Bay, for he likes to send his children to school.\n\nI expect to be at Hunter Point the 24th of July, and then 27th at Wolf Lake.\n\nBelieve me always your faithful servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNellie Marie\nHunter's Point\nJuly 14th 1926\n\nTo the Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived a letter from Rev. J. Evans missionary to Indians at Wolf Lake, who wished me to undertake the school at that point. He is aware that I have no diploma. But studied at the Quebec Commercial Academy as early as 1876. He had met Mr. Cappa at North End camp and said he was surprised that Wolf Lake Indian School had not been opened yet. He advised me to write to the Dept. and give you some straight information about the school. The Indians have had some discussion with Mr. James, a trader there. He wants the Indians in school kept in his house, and took it on himself to bring up a teacher last fall. The Indians were not willing to take his word for it, that they were supposed to send their children across a lake two miles over...\nwide whereas they could have the school house in their village.\n\nSo they have erected the walls of a building 20 x 40 feet which will be large enough for some time to come. I am enclosing Father Evans letter. The first one of his connection if we wanted me to go and start immediately I sent word to the Chief that I had not yet an official appointment and I did not expect that school would be opened before Sept 1st. My son in conversation with Dr. A. Young said that he had told the agent that it was impossible a school at year as the Indians as soon as the hunting season starts and took away their families (if such was the case why did he take it on himself to bring up a teacher for the Indian School late last October) with regard to a diploma I was unwilling to teach by conclusion my self fully competent to start the school for a year or so for a succession if I don't quit.\n\nThe former teacher was a very good one but was badly handicapped by having no knowledge whatever of the\nIndian Language\n\nI have lived among them for at least 40 years. I was the last post-master on Kippewa Lake and they have confidence in me.\n\nThe Chief tells me that lumber and roofing paper can be purchased by them presently. Mr. Chisholm has Sandette Rue.\n\nFive windows and a door is necessary and the school will be opened on time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEd A. Robinson\n\nHunter's Point,\nQue.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the reopening of the school at Wolf Lake during the present summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the season is late and as our funds are extremely limited, we regret that it will not be possible to authorize the opening of this school. We informed Father Evain in May last, that it was doubtful if the results achieved by the rather intermittent activity at this school would warrant the expense of carrying on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Robinson, Esq.,\nHunter's Point,\nQue.\nKippawa July 30th 1926\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nThis to let you know that I have taken the liberty of opening our school at Wolf Lake on the 28th with Ed. Robinson as teacher. I have also the pleasure of informing you that 15 children attended school the day the school was opened, and 18 will be attending next week. The families are willing to live during the whole year near the school. I hope there will be no trouble to have a daily school going on as well, as the others in the vicinity. The school is going on in my house at present we are building in a central place, the walls are up, we expect help from J.R. Booth concerning the lumber for the roof & floor.

We have already built a summer shelter and am helping them to construct a school for the winter.\n\nI wish to recommend the petition addressed to you by the Chief of Wolf Lake Reserve, that you help with the funds for the building of the school. Mr. Robinson is very well liked by the Indians, and has had full success so far.\n\nIt would be opportune for you to visit Wolf Lake Reserve to make a visit at once and see the state of affairs in this locality.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Robinson is at present conducting classes until the new building is ready, in the home of the Chief.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of May 6th, last, in which you were informed that the Department did not consider the services of Mr. Robinson satisfactory because he has no qualifications. I regret that there are no funds available this year to provide for the cost of supplying the materials asked for to finish the building or to pay the salary of a teacher. We will be unable to provide any assistance this year to carry on school work at Wolf Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. L.

It is further stated that a building for school purposes is being erected, and that you request that the Department supply roofing paper, windows, door, desks, stove, etc.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that the Department has no funds available this year to pay for supplying the materials asked for to finish the building. We informed Rev. Father Evain in May last, that the services of Mr. Robinson would not be satisfactory, as it is doubtful if the results that will be achieved by the Indian children under his instruction would warrant any expense in carrying on the work at this point.

Is it the intention that the Wolf Lake School will remain closed during the three months' period that Miss McLaren would be teaching at Abitibi, or is it the intention to engage the services of a teacher to succeed her at Wolf Lake? The Department would have no objection to the arrangement proposed by yourself and Father Evans, but, before authorizing same, would like to be informed regarding the carrying on of the work at Wolf Lake if Miss McLaren is transferred to the summer school at Abitibi.

The last communication in connection with this matter was yours of September 1st, last, in which you stated that, owing to ill health, she would be unable to teach, but that her mother, Mrs. J. D. McLaren, would take charge of this school and the latter has signed the September and December quarter returns. Please let me know when Miss Katherine McLaren took charge of the Wolf Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nZ.

MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nI beg to enclose report of the Weolf Lake Indian Day School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1932. After a consultation with Rev. Father Martel, the Missionary, I have to recommend that this school be closed forever. Some 30 years ago, the Grass Lake and the Weolf Lake Indians numbered to about 300, now there are about 35 and their number is decreasing every year. Only four families have children and the teacher was telling me that it took all her time to keep them from going away last winter to a place where they could make a better living. In a separate letter to the Department I am explaining the case of these Indians and making recommendations.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, recommending that the Wolf Lake Indian Day School be closed as from June 30th last, on account of the small number of Indian families who remain at that point.\n\nIn view of your report as to the number of children remaining at Wolf Lake, the Department will approve of the discontinuance of further school activities at Wolf Lake as from the date above mentioned. You should see that all school material is properly cared for, or it may be that you could distribute same among the other schools in your Agency. You might advise the Department later as to what disposition you have made of any classroom supplies, etc., at Wolf Lake. You should also advise the teacher that this school is not to be reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nZ.

So you may, if you think well, advise Miss Agnes Robinson, a person having a good education, to be ready for next spring. In any event, if you open this school, I am prepared to assist the movement if necessary.\n\nThere is, I believe, at Hunter's Point the material of the old Indian school house that is no longer used. Could not this material be removed to Wolfe Lake? You could refer the matter to Mr. A. Renard, your agent, and I am prepared to support it as much as possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary\nOttawa, August 30th, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant; in further reference to the establishment of a summer school at Wolf Lake, and in reply, I beg to say that in the last communication received from you, dated February 16th, last, you stated that you had little confidence of the success, at the present time, of a school at this point. Owing to the very short time the children are in the neighbourhood for attendance, it is not considered that they could gain any substantial advantage from this school.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the building at Hunter's Point are noted. This building is not the property of the Department, but simply used for school purposes. I also remark that the school at this point, as well as other summer schools, was not a success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLear,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

Isadore Evans, Missionary North Timiskaming, has again brought to the attention of the Department the question of erecting a summer school at Wolfe Lake and has nominated Miss Agnes Robinson for the position of teacher. He asks that this matter be referred to you and I should be glad to receive any information that you have on the subject, together with particulars as to the qualifications of Miss Robinson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Father Emile de Lannoy has often spoke to me about a school there.\n\nUp till last summer as I understand the Indians were somewhat separate, some stayed at Wolfe Lake and some at Cassiar Lake, but now they come to an understanding of all residing at Wolfe Lake. To spend the summer months, and as per statement of Rev. Father Emile a summer school would be of some benefit to the Indians. By experience I know that any kind summer school is a benefit to the children, and I would think that it might be the same thing. As I understand that Indians has never been looked after, and I do not see any reason why more care would not be approved to see to the good of these Indians, same as any\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nIn these times of peace and all kind of hardship reigning amongst them. They are somewhat like the long town Indians who they may be placed under my care. Although I have not seen them, I have heard enough to recommend that the department should give charge to some Indian agent to see to the good of those Indians, and that some one should take a trip and see them during the summer when all at White Lake, and a true report sent to department.\n\nThe Miss Agnes Katherine Ker, further Evans state that she is competent for the position of teacher for the present time, and late of incompetent and no else could take charge of the school.\n\nI am Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\n[Signature]\nMaison des RR.PP.

Je crois que le temps est arriv\u00e9 o\u00f9 nous devons que votre agent allait se rendre sur le lieu m\u00eame de la situation de nouveau et des dispositions de cet endroit. Le meilleur lieu pour cela serait le m\u00eame lieu que nous avons choisi, un peu plus loin et qu'il est permis de construire une \u00e9glise de cette taille, pour\nMaison des R.R.P.P.

Si votre d\u00e9partement\nvoulait-il donner une aide \u00e0 ces pauvres qui sont en dehors de\nla protection de la loi? Je peux vous assurer que nous avons\nbesoin de votre aide.

Up to the present time the Indians of those parts did not agree as to the place where the school ought to be held. Last summer I succeeded in convincing them that we ought to build a new church (the old one falling into ruins at Grass Lake, ten miles farther than the new site selected). This new site is exactly at Wolf Lake; and all the Indians have agreed to have the school taught in this new church, around which they will reside during the summer months. Nevertheless, I believe that the time has come when it would be well that your agent should himself give an account of the situation, or the number, and of the views of these Indians. The best time for that would be the month of May, at the end of the month, or the month of June or July. I could inform them of the date of the visit of your agent so that all might assemble at the time of that visit. These Indians are also in a precarious condition of health; scrofula and tuberculosis are beginning to make ravages, and I believe that the visit of the physician for some days would be a great assistance to them.\n\nIf all goes well with my affairs, I intend to build my new church in spring. If your Department agrees to give a school to these Indians, who certainly are\nanxious to improve themselves, I shall be glad to supply the building and the desks on the same conditions as for Abitibi, that is to say, $5.00 rent a month. If your Department opens the school in the beginning of June, and if my building is not ready, Mr. Ed. Robinson can furnish one in the meantime; in that case it would be necessary to see that the material should be sent in time.\n\nVery humbly\n\nYour servant,\n\nIs. Evans, O.M.I.\nMissionary\n\nP.S. I believe also that Miss Agnes Robinson, over thirty years of age, having taken a course in the United States, is in a position to teach this school.\n\nI.F.\nOttawa, April 2, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 6th, last, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to incur the necessary expenditure to conduct a summer school at Wolf Lake during the coming season for the months of June, July and August and will allow Miss Robinson, should she undertake the work, a salary at the rate of $50.00 per month for these three months and will pay you $5.00 a month for the use of the church building, upon condition that desks are furnished.\n\nYou should at once communicate with Miss Robinson and, if this is satisfactory, advise the Department so that a supply of school material can be sent in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Is.

Clea.\n\nI am willing to do my share, by furnishing 800 sq. feet of rough lumber, and paying the builders, which will amount to $500.00 at least.\n\nI beg to ask the Dept. to contribute to the said building, by furnishing the roofing and flooring, the windows, doors, paper, nails, stove, etc.\n\nIf the Dept. of Indian Affairs prefers another way, I will take the engagement of\nBuilding the said school, the residence for the teacher, and of furnishing it with desks and stoves, at the condition that the Dept pays me a monthly rent of $15 during the teaching time.\n\nIt is understood that the Dept will supply the other material of the teaching, as usual.\n\nThe material necessary for this new school of Wolf Lake, as much as I can know, should consist:\n\n1. One black board\n2. One box of soft chalk\n3. One gross of lead pencils\n4. One pencil's sharpeners\n5. Six dozen of scribblers\n6. Two dozens of first readers\n7. One dozen of second readers\n8.

In reply I have to state that the Department will allow a grant of $500 for roofing, flooring, doors, sash, building paper, mails, a stove and for finishing material. Payment of our grant will be made if you will forward receipts, in duplicate, showing the expenditure incurred.\n\nA supply of stationery and readers, also blackboard, etc., will be ordered by the Department and will be shipped to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Sir,\n\nWe have in the locality of Kipawa Station five or six resident families and four or five families that reside here a great part of the year. All these families have together some fifty children, twenty-eight of whom at least are of an age to attend school. These people, not being land-owners, cannot take advantage of the provincial school municipality. That is why we beg you to give us Dominion Government assistance.\n\nMost of these children are half-breeds. It is for them especially that we ask the Indian Department to pay attention to us.\n\nAn Indian school at Wolf Lake and others have obtained from your Department a grant of $400. We have more pupils than they have, and we hope that the same favour will be granted us.\n\nIf you desire to have any particulars or information, the Rev. Father Andre Paquet, O.M.I., Mattawa, will furnish you with the same.\n\nPerhaps some of the heads of families would be able to assist a little; but their families are very numerous and they are very poor.\n\nTwo school mistresses have offered us their services,\u2014one for $25.00 a month and the other for $30.00. On adding the board, which costs at least $15 here, we shall be obliged to spend at least $40.00, without counting heating and maintenance.\nAs I am the one that is building the school,\nI trust that the Department will assist me. Negotiations\ncan be carried on with me or with the Rev. Father Paquet\nif you so prefer.\n\nCounting on a prompt reply,\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGilbert Samuel\nOttawa, April 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant requesting a grant from this Department for the establishment of a school at Kipawa Station.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this Department has no responsibility for the education of half-breed children and cannot, therefore, give your request consideration. The school at Wolfe Lake, to which you refer, is a temporary summer school for the education of Indian children during the short period in which they are located at that point. As the families on whose behalf you make this application are not Indians the Department cannot see why they are not entitled to the privileges extended to the other residents of the municipality in so far as providing for the education of their children is concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Gilbert Samuel,\nKipawa Station, Que.\nMay 6th 1912\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nChief Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Pedley,\n\nThere is great need for an Indian school at Kipawa Quebec.\n\nThere are about thirty Indian children near there and a great many more from a distance in the country north of that that will go to school in the Summer.\n\nThere would be no necessity of having the school kept open in the winter, from May until October would be sufficient.\n\nHoping you will consider the application favourably,\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. James\nOttawa, May 9, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the matter of the establishment of a school for certain families at Kipawa was brought to the attention of the Department by Gilbert Samuel, who is the head of one of the families. In the application it is stated that these children are half-breeds, not Indians, consequently this Department cannot assume any obligation for their education. Among these families were those of an operator at the station and an employee of the hotel and their children were included to make the total of 25.\n\nSo far as the Indians are concerned the summer schools in Quebec for a couple of months have not been altogether satisfactory. You will probably recollect the experience of the Department at Hunters Point, not far distant from Kipawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. James, B.C., M.D.,\nMattawa, Ont.\nMr. T. Pedley,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you may have informed you, there are today at Nepewa Lake not far from Nepawa Station, nearly ten Indian families comprising altogether 27 children in ages 6-16 years old going to school. All Indians of this tribe they seem very anxious for education but they are offered no opportunity.\nBesides several families around Hunter's Point, hearing that a school was to be erected for them at Ripervia, sent word that they would like to be also put on the list, since their school does not exist any more. Others might find also.\n\nAll these circumstances convinced me that their request was serious and that your aid would do them a great amount of good.\n\nI would be somewhat puzzled to give you a list of their family names; but if it is necessary, I can get it.\n\nAs I go to visit Ripervia on my mission regularly twice a month, you may get from me all particular information and deal with me concerning the organization and administration of the school. I don't know of any other that they could trust entirely with their interests. I am stationed generally at Mattawa, Ont.\n\nHoping you will favor me with all publicity or information necessary. I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Place]\n\n[Date]\nOttawa, May 21, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the establishing of a school for Indian families at Kipawa.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has had communication with regard to this matter, but these children are nearly all if not all half-breeds and not Indians and, of course, it is not for this Department to make provision for their education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. Paquet,\nMissionary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMonsieur,\n\nOn Nippawa, Station terminale du Pacifique canadien, vient d'\u00eatre ouverte une \u00e9cole mixte indienne-m\u00e9tisse. Le local est confortable et moderne, et une vingtaine d'enfants suivent le cours d'\u00e9cole.

The house is built and furnished; and about twenty children are frequenting the course. But the people being poor feel themselves unable to pay the continuous salary of a school mistress. As much as I could see there is about ten indian children registered. Could it not be possible for your department to help the keeping of that school by paying half of the expenses of the administration of the school? This school is situated on the Wolf Lake road so that it would be easy for your agent of North Temiskaming to make an inspection.\n\nVery humbly,\n\n[Signature]\nEvans O.M.S.\nMissionary\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nI am promised $100.00 per month for a short time each year.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, in reference to a grant to a school lately established at Kipawa, on the road leading to Wolf Lake, and in reply, I beg to say, that this matter had already been brought to the attention of the Department by the resident missionary, Rev. A. Paquet, and Mr. Gilbert Samuel, who was instrumental in having the school established.\n\nThe information received previously shows that these children are nearly all if not all Half-breeds, and in that event, of course, this Department cannot assume any obligations for the maintenance of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Isidore Duvain, O.M.I.,\nMissionary,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQuebec.\nOttawa, Nov. 6th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians and half-breeds at Nipawas Lake West-end, have gone through the expense of building a school with the help of Mr. Royal, an American sportaman. I have equipped it with desks and chairs to the amount of $70, and more. This year, Mr. Royal being away, we find no way of having a teacher. Would it be pleasing to you to allow something for teacher's salary and also to defray some of my equipping expenses. I can certify that several of the half-breeds there lead a pure Indian life and probably are entitled to the same benevolent grants from the department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTimiskaming Station\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, November 10, 1914.\n\nRev.

Father Faquet of Timiskaming Station has renewed an application made on behalf of the Kipawa Indians for the recognition of a school on their reserve. A school was in operation there for some time which was started by private subscriptions which are no longer available and Father Faquet states that there were a number of Indians as well as half-breeds and whites attending this school.\n\nThe Department would like you to visit the district, make inquiries regarding the number of Indian children who could attend this school and also how many months in the year it could be successfully operated. If there is a sufficient number of Indian children to justify the Department in making a contribution towards the salary of the teacher it will be prepared to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He was informed that the school, which was intended to be used for the education of the children and other purposes connected with the school, was paid for by private subscriptions from various Chiefs and individuals who visited the children who called at the school and funds were sent to Mr. Rogers family with the children of school age. It also appeared that the school was not large enough to accommodate all the children who could attend the school.\n\nWe are obliged to inform Mr. Rogers that he has been unable to secure the school for some time.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\n[Signature]\n\nOffice of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nIndian Office\n\nAt STURGEON FALLS\n\nMEMO.\n\nNames of Indian and Half-breed children who could attend school at Ryppen.\n\nCatherine Antoine Indian age 14\nMary \" \" \" \" 11\n\nAlbah Chandlour Half-breed age 10\nMaria \" \" \" \" 8\nMary \" \" \" \" 6\n\nC.

They have succeeded in charming away nearly 60 per cent of the Indians from Moore Fort so that we feel the necessity of building a church and opening a day school at that place which is called by Revillon Bros. \"Moose River Post\" but which we have named \"French Post\" to avoid any confusion with Moore Fort. We have secured a site and are removing the old school building at Moore Fort over there, which with some new material will make a good school church combined. I write now to notify you that we are prepared to begin the school work in April 1st, and that when in due course you decide...\nWe readily witness for this new day school, we will expect a fulfillment of the standing promise or understanding in the way of the usual Government allowances for each schools. There are fully 20 children of school age at that station all the year round, and in summer 35.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn S.

Both these returns are signed by Miss Ethel M. Bennett as teacher and show that each school was open 45 days during the said quarter. As it was impossible that she could have taught both these schools at the same time she should have only signed a return for the school at which she actually taught.\n\nThe Department would like Your Lordship to be good enough to instruct the teachers of these two schools that the quarterly returns are only to be signed by the regular teacher in charge of each, as the Auditor General would object to the paying of salary to the same teacher at both schools during the same period.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

For the sake of the few families on that side we hope that the Department will see its way to continue the usual part of the support given in this case.\n\nThe reports will be forwarded in Dec. as usual.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I have the honour to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, November 6, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to the school which is being conducted at French Post on the Moose River.\n\nIt is noted that Fred Marks has reopened this school as teacher. The Department will, for the present, continue the grant allowed for salary.\n\nAs there are only a few children at this point the Department would like to be informed whether it would not be possible to have them placed in the boarding school at Moose Fort as vacancies occur from time to time among the pupils in that school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nRev.

Then again, of late years we have had no trouble to fill the school with children either fatherless, motherless or orphans, mostly from distant homes. I have just received a letter from our Missionary at Rupert's House saying that there are a number of very poor families there and asking if it would be possible to get some of them into the Boarding School. I was obliged to reply that we were full up. We should much prefer that the School in question be allowed for the present to go on as it is, until an increase or decrease decides the matter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 28, 1916.\n\nRev.

I left instructions with the Post Master at Pagwa that he was not to give any relief to English River Indians except the ones that make their home there; a list of these Indians was left with him so that there might not be the same danger of the Indians going there when they know that they will not receive any help from the Dept.\n\nI pass the letter on to you without any recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.

In this regard I would refer you to official letter of September 14, 1937 in which you were informed that the Department was not prepared to allow any salary for a teacher if a school were conducted at Pagwa River during the present winter. In view of the decision made at that time no salary is being paid to Mr. Clarke and the return which he forwarded is enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. L.

D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nVia Moosonee, Ont.\nPagwa River Ont.\nJan. 20, 1938\n\nMr. Hoey\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nRe:- Indian Children at Pagwa School.\n\nErnest Wesley\n\nAlfred Wesley:- These boys are resident at Pagwa. Ernest was at Residential School, but since the Civil Aviation has commenced work at Pagwa River. Their father is able to get part time work, and their Mother, is able to take in washing, which keeps them off the Dept. relief account, at least so far this winter. If these boys were not at home then, Fred (their father) would have to spend half his time getting wood. Don't you think we are doing right teaching these people to be independent? If Fred went trapping instead of hauling wood, with the boys away, then Minnie (their Mother) would have to do it, and she wouldn't be able to take in the washing etc., thus cutting down their income considerably.\n\nElsie Wesley\n\nElsie's mother died last spring on the way home from hospital. Elsie has to look after, one child, and one mental deficient, she is able to attend on an average of 3 hours a day. Should she be denied an education? Other schooling would be impossible for her.\n\nGilbert Fairies\nThomas Fairies\nBoth are orphans, sons of John Jr., & Willie Fairies. These boys are small, but not too small that they can't help their grandfather, who is looking after them to trap rabbits, and help with the wood. They rightly belong to English River, but as their father can talk English well, he works when he can for the Dept. Civil Aviation. Thus trying with trapping he is trying to keep himself and the children.\n\nGdo. Spence\n\nJoe Spence: These boys are Romans and you may think it strange that they attend our school. But no child is turned away. As they all have a right to a liberal education. These children would not be sent out to school.\n\nEvelyn Sagana quib Evelyn is the only companion her widowed mother has.\n\nThese are the most outstanding cases, which I present to you. But what I want to point out, that as my letter week to you showed, that these children have got to have some training at home. Not that I am trying to belittle the Residential School system, but the boy (Simeon Taylor) whom I wrote you about, was a Residential school boy, and I find that when they return home they have learnt to smoke long before they should.\n\nThe rare prospects of Pagwa opening up, the air-port is close, a road branching off to Long-Lac is supposed to be going through shortly, the only way to keep these people self-reliant, is to have someone on the spot.\n\nThe Residential School never takes half of the children here, and until this year, no great fuss was made about them. There will always be a number of children here whom the residential will never take, owing\ndifferent circumstances, which we can reach, with a winter school.\n\nToo, there is no use trying to bluff ourselves, that last week was the first case of liquor trouble. Well the only way to stop it is to have someone right at the place.\n\nI feel that you will have to agree that, after reading this, we here are endeavouring as much as possible to follow out your own idea; which was published in the papers last summer, to make these people as much as possible self-supporting.\n\nIt is as great an interest to make these children good citizens, to us, as it is the wish of the Dent.\n\nWe have carried on this work for one quarter now, and there have been costs which we have had to meet, which are justifiable and are not out of the ordinary sphere of things, such as building desks, getting a stove, wood, and school supplies. But we did not feel justified in presenting our case until we had done some work, and you could judge for yourself, our sincerity. The children are attending school, little things are being accomplished; as I don't claim we are able to turn the world over in a day, and with this, these children are fulfilling their duties at home.\n\nThese children are not only taught the regular school lessons, but also sanitation and hygiene. The girls receive instruction in sewing, knitting, etc., from Mrs. Clark, while the boys are taught the use of the hammer and saw.\n\nI fully realize that the Dent is budgetted right to the hilt, and that any additional expenses, are almost impossible to be worked in, but there are other years, and this is only the start.\nBut I feel quite justified in asking the Dept. for assistance, as I am sure we are giving back through these people, every dollar that is spent on them.\n\nI am including a list of requirements, which you may think out of the question, or may not, but I would very much appreciate some assistance this year if it only means sending the school equipment, or part of it.\n\nHoping that I have not been too verbose in my explanations, and that you will be able to understand our position here. I know you have of the uselessness of a school, here. But I wished to produce some evidence in the way of results before putting this question to you, as it is easy to type letters, but another thing to back up one's statements, with some sort of results.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention in this matter, and hoping that you are keeping in the best of health. I remain;\n\nYours sincerely\n\nNeville R. Clarke L.Th.(Rev.)\n\nPagwa River Ontario.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI received your letter of January 20 with reference to the school conducted by you at Pagwa River during the past three months and have carefully considered the contents of your letter.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to allow you any payment for your services. Indian Agent Tyner was informed to this effect in a letter dated September 14, 1937 and no doubt advised you accordingly. Arrangements have been made, however, to forward you some scribblers, pencils etc.\n\nI am sending a copy of your letter to Indian Agent Tyner. On receipt of his report further consideration will be given to the question of operating a day school at Pagwa River each winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. N. R. Clarke, L. Th.,\nPagwa River, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 7, 1937 and our replies dated September 14, 1937 and February 1, 1938 I enclose for your information a copy of a letter that has just been received from Reverend N. R. Clarke regarding the school that he has conducted during the past few months at Pagwa River.\n\nPlease let me have your opinion regarding the contents of Mr. Clarke's letter and state if you consider there has been any change in the conditions mentioned in your letter of September 7 last. Possibly you might wish to recommend that a salary be allowed for the teacher of a school at Pagwa River during the winter of 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. L. Tyner, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nNoose Factory, Ont.\nPagwa River, Ont.\n\nFeb. 18th., 193\n\nSupt. of College & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDea Mr. Hoey;\n\nMany thanks for yours of the 12th inst. I understand the situation perfectly, and appreciate your help and sympathy.\n\nThere is another matter which I feel should be attended to now as it is near spring. The Dept. of Civil Aviation will soon be commencing work at the Beacon site, and I hold. For this job they need many labourers. The type of work done is chiefly brushing, clearing stumps, and digging ditches.\n\nLast summer some of the Indians here were able to obtain work, but much of it was done by Provincial unemployed.\n\nThis winter as far as I've been able to judge has not been very successful as regards the fur hunt. And it would be a very fine thing for these people if they were able to work instead of going on relief.\n\nFrom what I have seen before I feel that the Indian would be superior to the white man for this type of work, in this section, because they are not affected so much by the flies.\n\nIf you could take the matter up with the Hon. Mr. Howe of the Dept. of Transport, I will do everything in my power to see that they get enough men.\n\nThis would not only affect the Indians here, but would also give employment to the Indians at English River, as it is only 70 miles between the two places, and many of them come up to Pagwa during the summer.\n\nThanking you again for your support in the matter of the school, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNeville R. Clarke, L.Th.\nMoose Factory Feb. 17th 1938\n\nMr. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 1st 1938-No-44-14-1, I informed Rev. N. Clarke last fall as soon as I had your ruling that he salary would be paid so I do not see why he sent in this return except to show you the work he had been doing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Tyre\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 1937.\n\nTeacher\n\nP.O.

Ernest was at Residential School, but since the Civil Aviation has commenced work at Pagwa River. Their father is able to get part-time work, and their mother is able to take in washing, which keeps them off the Dept. relief account, at least so far this winter. If these boys were sent at once then Fred (their father) would have to spend half his time getting wood. Don't you think we are doing right teaching these people to be independent? If Fred went trapping instead of gathering wood, with the boy away, then Minnie (their mother) would have to do it, and she wouldn't be able to take in the washing etc., thus cutting down their income considerably.\n\nElate Wesley: Elate's mother died last spring on the way home from hospital. Elate has to look after one child and one mental deficient, she is able to attend on an average of 3 hours a day. Should she be denied an education? Other schooling would be impossible for her.\n\nGilbert Fairies\n\nThomas Fairies: Both are orphans, sons of John Jr. & Willie Fairies. These boys are small, but not too small that they can't help their grandfather who is looking after them to trap rabbits, and help with the wood. They rightly belong to English River, but as their father can talk English well he works when he can for the Dept. Civil Aviation. Thus trying with trapping he is trying to keep himself and the children.\n\nGeo. Spence\n\nJoe Spence: These boys are Romans and you may think it strange that they attend our school but no child is turned away as they all have a right to a liberal education. These children would not be sent out to school.\n\nEvelyn Saranacib: Evelyn is the only companion her widowed mother has.\nThese are the most outstanding cases which I present to you. But what I want to point out that as my letter week to you showed that these children have got to have some training at home. Not that I am trying to belittle the Residential School system but the boy (Simeon Taylor) whom I wrote you about was a Residential School boy and I find that when they return home they have learnt to smoke long before they should.\n\nThere are prospects of Paswa opening up the air-port is close, a road branching off to Long Lac is supposed to be going through shortly. The only way to keep these people self-reliant, is to have someone on the spot.\n\nThe Residential School never takes half of the children here and until this year no great fuss was made about them. There will always be a number of children here whom the residential will never take, owing to different circumstances which we can reach with a winter school.\n\nToo there is no use trying to bluff ourselves, that last week was the first case of liquor trouble. Well the only way to stop it is to have someone right at the place.\n\nI feel that you will have to agree that, after reading this, we here are endeavouring as much as possible to follow out your own idea which was published in the papers last summer, to make these people as much as possible self-supporting.\n\nIt is as great an interest to make these children good citizens to us as it is the wish of the Department.\n\nWe have carried on this work for one quarter now, and there have been costs which we have had to meet, which are justifiable and are not out of the ordinary sphere of things, such as building desks, getting a stove, wood, and school supplies. But we did not feel justified in presenting our case until we had done some work and you could judge for yourself our sincerity. The children are attending school. Little things are being accomplished; as I don't claim we are able to turn the world over in a day, and with this, these children are fulfilling their duties at home.\n\nThese children are not only taught the regular school lessons, but also sanitation and hygiene, every morning they are washed thoroughly. The girls receive instruction in sewing, knitting, etc., from Mrs. Clarke while the boys are taught the use of the hammer and saw.\nI fully realize that the Department is budgeted right to the hilt, and that any additional expenses are almost impossible to be worked in, but there are other years, and this is only the start, but I feel quite justified in asking the Department for assistance, as I am sure we are giving back through these people, every dollar that is spent on them.\n\nI am including a list of requirements which you may think out of the question, or may not, but I would very much appreciate some assistance, this year if it only means sending the school equipment or part of it.\n\nHoping that I have not been too verbose in my explanations, and that you will be able to understand our position here. I know you have heard of the uselessness of a school here, but I wishes to produce some evidence in the way of results before putting this question to you, as it is easy to type letters, but another thing to back up one's statements with some sort of results.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention in this matter, and hoping that you are keeping in the best of health, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n(Rev.)\n(Sgd.) Neville R. Clarke, L.Th.\nPapwa River, Ontario.\nPagwa River Ont.\nApril 21, 1938\n\nRe A. Hoey Esq.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclose please find the report for the Pagwa River school for the quarter ended March 31st.\n\nSome of the men have started work here, at the Civil Aviation and, as the Clerk was down to see me yesterday others should be starting this month.\n\nThis work has been very helpful, as we have been able to get over a very difficult period, without asking for relief.\n\nHoping that you are in the best of health, I remain;\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNeville R. Clarke L.Th. (Rev)\nSt. Clement's Pagwa River Ontario.\n\nP.S. I have enclosed a letter for Dr. Tyner. These new envelopes are very large, and must be addressed.\n\nNeville R.

Is Pagwa River a municipality or is it unorganized territory? It has occurred to me that it might be possible to receive assistance from the Department of Education for the Province of Ontario in the conducting of a school at this point. You should, therefore, make your report as complete as possible in order that the Department can decide if it would be advisable to communicate with the Provincial educational authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Lagwa River is in unorganized territory. When Clarke started teaching at Lagwa last fall I am almost sure that he made arrangements with the Ontario Department of Education that he would teach the Whites and Halfbreeds and would receive a grant for so doing, however I will make sure when I go in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.Tyner\nMr. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to the first part of your letter of April 25th No-44-14-1.\n\nThe following is a list of the Indian families who have been at Pagwa River for some years with their children of school age.\n\n| No. | Name                        | Sex | Age |\n|-----|-----------------------------|-----|-----|\n| 28  | Eng.

Tyrer inspected the school house, and ordered changes to be made, and then I was to submit the plans of the school house for your inspection. The plans are enclosed. The building is ready for equipment.\n\nWidew Saganaquib saw the Doctor at English River (she is a resident of Pagwa River) about her two girls attending the school, she was overlooked here, as she was visiting at English River, so that will mean we will need two desks more.\n\nDr. Tyrer suggested a full length blackboard on the south side, and I have marked in the position on the plans. I omitted to put the height of the room on the plan it is (ten and a half feet).\n\nThe wood-shed and wash room are not entirely completed, as I am waiting for materials, but should be, by the time this letter reaches you.\n\nDo you wish me to send in a requisition for books etc., or will you furnish what you think most suitable? If you furnish the equipment, without a requisition, would you include towels, soap, drinking cups, and if possible tooth-brushes please?\nThanking you for your kind attention in this matter, and assuring you that we will do everything in our power to justify this expense and trouble which you have gone to.

The reason for this is that the Trans-Canada Highway will have a branch which will run from Nippigon to Hearst via Klotz Lake, and possibly Pagwa River.\n\nThis road will likely run south of Pagwa River just far enough to make it inaccessible by automobile, if this road was road was brought to Pagwa River then run east, or a short branch run off the main road for 5 or 6 miles, it would open up a great tourist possibility for this section, as we have a continuous run of good water from here to James' Bay a matter of 350 miles. This would be a great boon to the Indians here and at English River, and would also help the Indians at Albany as tourists making this trip would pick up an additional guide to travel across salt water to Moose Factory.\n\nThe sale of the local handicraft would be increased too, which would be great help. It would not be at all difficult to see that the Indian received direct benefit from such a venture.\n\nI have had letters from several parties wishing to make this trip, and have not done so because of the poor train service, and not being able to use their automobiles.\n\nThere is a possibility that the road will run right into Pagwa River, but if this was assured, I feel that the effect would be well repaid, as it would give this Indians in this section some permanent summer employment and would go a long way to making them self-supporting.\n\nHoping that the matter may receive due consideration, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

Hoey\nSuperintendent Education & Welfare\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWould it be possible to get some information regarding the equipment for the school at Pagwa River. I have changed the lighting and the building has had a wash room added, and a wood shed, also painted the building. School was started on schedule, but we are under difficulties owing to the lack of equipment.\n\nI am writing to you instead of Mr. Tyrer as I imagine that the Doctor is still on James Bay, and will not be back at Moose Factory yet.\n\nI am enclosing another report which I think will be of great interest to you, also a letter for the Acting Secretary, (to save envelopes)\n\nThanking you I remain;\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Neville R. Clarke L.Th. (Rev.)\nSt. Clement's Mission\nPagwa River Ontario\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, letter received by me from Reverend Neville R. Clarke of Pagwa River, Ontario. Mr. Clarke, I may state, is a missionary teacher employed by this Department to operate an Indian day school in the Pagwa River district. His letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI am today communicating with Mr. Clarke and intimating to him that I have sent forward his letter to you, for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. M.

My understanding is that we communicated with you a few days ago with respect to this matter. It is altogether likely that the letter has reached you by this time.\n\nI am sending forward your second letter, in which you discuss the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway to the Deputy Minister of Highways, Toronto. It is my hope that the suggestion you make with respect to the construction of this road will be given serious and sympathetic consideration by the Highways Department of Ontario.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Neville R. Clarke, L. Th.,\nSt. Clement's Mission,\nPagwa River, Ont.\nMoose Factory Sept 22nd 1938\n\nMr. R. Macvey,\nSupp. Training.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing my file on the Pagwa River Day School. I am sorry you find it impossible to give a grant to the Pagwa Day School. From your letters and our discussion in Ottawa this spring I gathered that you would give a grant for the pupils I decided could attend the school.\n\nWhen I was in Pagwa I made out a list of the pupils I thought should attend the school. I also inspected the building used as a school and asked Mr. Clarke to make alterations.\n\nI would ask you to reconsider this question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Tyner\n\n[Signature]\n\nPlease return my file.\n\nW.Tyner\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with further reference to a request that we have received for the establishment of a day school at Pagwa River.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 2nd ultimo no funds were provided in our current year's appropriation for the operation of a day school at this point. In view of present regulations it is not possible to provide the necessary funds. I will, however, keep the matter in mind and endeavour to secure the amount required when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nI enclose the correspondence which you forwarded with your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. L. Tyref, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\nPegwa River Ontario:\nOct. 3, 1938\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe:- yours of the 26th inst. (44-4-1). I have waited for three mails and have not received the letter you mention. I fear that the letter must have gone astray.\n\nHoping that you are in the best of health; I remain.\n\nYours sincerely:\n\nRev. Neville R. Clarke L.Th. (Rev.)\nSt. Clement's Mission\nPegwa River Ontario\nSt. Clement's Mission\nPagwa River Ont.\nOct. 24, 1938\n\nMy Dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIt is now a month since the letter, which you wrote informing me about the grant for the school. In the meantime I have had a letter from Dr. Tyre, saying that he had tried his best to get a grant but was unsuccessful.\n\nI feel that you have been grossly unfair to us at Pagwa River. I cannot help but notice the difference in promptness with which these letters are answered and those, which had to do with getting work for the Indians and keeping them off relief.\n\nI have gone to considerable expense, in good faith, and by the instructions of Dr. Tyre at last treaty time, in painting the school and making suggested alterations. Also building a church so we would not have services in the school house, so that there would be no chance of any infect from any source this also on the Doctor's suggestion.\n\nNow you wish to close the matter, without informing me, or even answering, the letter's forwarded to you regarding this.\n\nHow much do you think has been saved the Dept. by my keeping the Indians employed at the Dept. Civil Aviation? Up until two months past. No one else kept them on, I am sure, if they had been left to their own resources. The Dept. would be paying them rations, and they would have had nothing to go trapping with. Whereas for the last year there has only be three parties receiving help, two old men, one almost blind, and a widow.\nBut we are not here to consider just a Dollar and cent value of the Indian, or are we? And not to try and help them.\n\nI fully realize in the light of recent events that finances can be and may have been tightened up, to the breaking point, but that does not excuse not answering any letters or giving a sympathetic ear to any plea.\n\nI am greatly in need of text books, writing equipment, and blackboard, this would entail opening no new account, or grant, and I hope that you will be able to do something for us. It certainly makes a difficult task more difficult, if one feels that the Dept. has no interest in the task of lifting the people to a little higher level.\n\nHoping that you are in the best of health and that you will be able to help. I remain;\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nSuperintendent\nWelfare and Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nNeville R. Clarke L.Th. (Rev.)\nSt. Clement's Mission\nPagwa River Ontario.\nOttawa, October 25, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Clarke:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st instant, in which you express regret at the failure of the Department to recognize your claims for assistance in the operation of the school at Pagwa River.\n\nIt is difficult for me to convince myself that a Civil Servant can be unfair at any time in his treatment of the teachers in charge of our schools, particularly the pioneer missionaries in the outlying sections of the Dominion. There seems to be a very widespread tendency on the part of human beings to look for the worst and it is too much perhaps to expect teachers or even clergymen to escape this tendency.\n\nRegulations governing the operation of Indian day schools were prepared and published by the Department a few months ago. I am sending forward to you a copy of these regulations for your information. You will note that, in paragraph 7, Indian day school teachers are requested to petition for supplies through the Indian agent. We have learned from experience that correspondence with Indian day school teachers and with Indian agents on matters relating to the operation of schools has led to endless dissatisfaction and confusion - hence the new regulation.\n\nIn my letter to you dated September 21, 1938, I stated: \"My understanding is that we communicated with you a few days ago with respect to this matter. It is altogether likely that the letter has reached you by this time\". The officials inform me that the letter referred to in this communication was a letter sent forward to Dr. Tyrer, Indian Agent, dated September 2, 1938.\n\nThe actual facts are that before a grant can be made -\n\nRev. Neville R. Clarke, L. Th.,\nSt. Clement's Mission,\nPagwa River, Ontario.\nbe made for the instruction of Indian children in Indian day or residential schools, such schools must be established by Order-in-Council. What is perhaps more important still is that provision for such grants must be made in the current year's estimates. Your school was not established by Order-in-Council, no provision was made in the estimates for a grant and, consequently, no grant was paid. The Indian agent was notified to this effect in departmental letters dated September 2 and October 5, 1938.\n\nThe agent himself took the position, in a letter dated March 2, 1938, that only a small number of Indian children should receive instruction at the Pagwa River School. He intimated in that communication that a few years ago a lot of Indians were sent away from Pagwa by the Department and that it would be very unfortunate indeed if any encouragement were given them to return. His request that the Department make provision for the education of children that had lived at Pagwa River for a number of years was considered after the receipt of the agent's letter by the officials. The estimates, however, for the year 1938-39 had been prepared at that time and had been sent forward for consideration by Parliament.\n\nIt is our intention to make provision for a grant to the Pagwa River School in the estimates now under consideration.\n\nI can understand the inconvenience you have experienced when you remodelled and reconstructed your school, in the hope that a departmental grant would be received. Nevertheless, I feel confident you will readily appreciate the position in which the officials here found themselves. It was simply impossible for us to make a grant, when no provision was made in the estimates for the regular establishment of this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

BAILEY\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Pagwa School reports that a number of cups, knives and forks, stoves, cooking ranges, etc., are likely to be available for transfer after the camp at Pagwa closes at the end of July. If this information is correct, I should be glad if you could secure a list of articles which may be made available so that we may have an opportunity of asking for their transfer to this Branch.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to the last paragraph of your letter of the 14th ultimo, in connection with the school at Pagua River.\n\nFrom previous correspondence I understand that this school is attended by both Indians and white children. It therefore comes under the class known as combined Indian and white schools. It is not our practice to pay any regular annual fee to the teacher of a school in this class. Besides, we are not permitted to provide the salary of a teacher of a day school which is not located on an Indian reserve.\n\nI have given very careful consideration to the question of what financial assistance we can give, and I feel that the best we can do is to allow an amount of $20.00 a year, based on the average attendance, for each Indian child that attends the Pagua River Combined School. You may, therefore, prepare a return, on the regular day school return form, showing the Indian children who were in attendance for that period. All information required by the form should be given and it should then be forwarded to Indian Agent Dr. Tyner, who will certify it, if correct, and forward here for payment of the grant promised in this letter.\n\nI may add that the allowance we are making to you is considerably larger than at other similar schools, and this increased grant is being provided in order to assist you as far as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Hoey\nSuperintendent Welfare & Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nMany thanks for your's dated July 16th. I was very glad to receive the news that we were to receive a grant, as it will help a great deal. Pagwa River no doubt presents many difficulties, which I am very much aware of.\n\nIt will interest you to know that through the Fr. V. Relief Dept. we are starting to clear land so that the half-breeds will be able to take up farming, at a later date. This has nothing directly to do with Indians here, but no doubt it will affect them as they are living side by side. The scheme is at present to allow each family about twenty acres, and that will give them enough grazing land for a couple of cows or goats. From there we hope to enlarge our scheme until we have small farms for them in which, with their winter's trappings they will be able to become independent to a much larger degree. It is a large order, but I think that it is a lot better than issuing monthly relief vouchers and not get any return or be any further ahead.\n\nThanking you again I remain;\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nJuly 31st, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal, Reverend Neville R.

If such is the case we should like to secure these for the Indian Affairs Branch. I believe Mr. Hill, the District Engineer of the above Department has already been in touch with the Principal. If these supplies are available for transfer, perhaps a Minute might then be issued so that immediate delivery might be taken by our representative.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.W.

These are being supplied on the distinct understanding that they are for the use of the Indian children only. We have no authority to expend public money for other than Indian children, as defined by the Indian Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Neville R. Clarke,\nSt. Clement's Mission,\nPagwa River, Ont.\nPagwa River, Ont., Oct.5, 1939.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received the grant for the school, and many thanks for the same. The amount was less than the $30.00 you had promised, but I was very grateful for the help, if we can receive the $30.00 per child it will help a lot, as I had ordered desks on the strength of it. I may have estimated wrongly too. I have 17 children at $30.00 making a total of $510.00. I received $365.60.\n\nHoping you are in the best of health I remain,\n\nNeville R. Clarke. L.Th. (Rev.).\nPagwa River Ontario\nOct 5, 1939\n\nMr. Phelan\nSuperintendent of School,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nYour receipt No.: L74166 for school supplies arrived only on Oct 2nd. As the same is to be returned 24hrs. or by return mail I am afraid this does not quite agree with the date of arrival of the material.\n\nI assure you that Indian Dept. material is used by Treaty Indians, although the treaty children have house word cards, and number cards which are not, or have not been supplied by the Dept. We have to use them as they come under the Prov. regulations by which we are governed.\n\nLast year I had 17 \"treaty children on record, which at the allowance of $20.00 per child which would make the grant. $510.00 Mr. Hoey quoted the rate this summer. I have bought desks for the school on the strength of Mr. Hoey's quotation. I find the grant sent is $365.60 which is a considerable reduction, and will mean that I will have some difficulty meeting my obligations. Was there some mistake about the grant?\n\nHoping to hear from you shortly, I remain.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNeville R. Clarke.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of July 26th last, file 44-14-1, relative to the surplus equipment of the Department of Transport at Parnes Airport, the Salvage Officer informs me that lists of this equipment have now been received, but due to present conditions, were first referred to the Department of National Defence for consideration. If that Department cannot use any of the items they will then be offered to us. Similar procedure is also being followed in connection with the surplus equipment at Sioux Lookout Aerodrome.

Could I get any help from the Dept. for the ones the Treaty kids will use, there are to date 21 kids attending which are treaty, at $2.76 per cwt., the freight on their desks would be $30.56. I don't think this is asking too much do you? If you think that you couldn't take care of the full $30.56 you may be assured that any portion thereof would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNeville (Clarke)\nDear borne;\n\nAnnie Wesley died at Gravenhurst, on Sat Nov.11. The hospital were going ship to body to Pagwa but I wired Dr. Stone first about it and he advised them not to.\n\nThe mounted police from Nipigon are in north of Nakina for John Mattias and family. Christie the Prov. Constable at Nakina, asked me what should they do with the family, when they had them out. I thought it would not be right for them to hang around Nakina so I told him to ship them here.\n\nI have bought 33 second-hand school desks at London Ont. they are in good condition, the freight is a big item, I have tried to get it reduced and the best I can get is $46.16. Could I get any help from the Dept. for the one the Treaty kids will use, there are to date 23 kids attending which are treaty, at $2.76 per cwt. the freight on their desks would be $30.36. I don't think this is asking too much do you? If you think that you couldn't take care of the full $30.36 you may be assured that any portion thereof would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegarding the potato question, I thought I would sow three bags for seed, and work it on the relief. The onions turnips carrots, and things which I supplied for them last summer was very successful, those who took care of their gardens have two bags of each. Could I be allowed\n$10.00 or $15.00 every spring for vegetable seeds. I would plant these in a community garden sort of thing. I found out last summer that the gardens that I kept sort of mine and had the people work them that I got greater results from. I was also thinking of getting the big cellar dug under the house instead of working on the root-house. I could then store the whole works and dish them out during the winter. This fall some of the lads sold vegetables and potatoes to these Air-pot t people, which I didn't agree with. What do you think of the idea?\n\nI received the checks thanks a lot. How's the war suiting you? Won't be long now eh., What are going to run a Clearing Station or Base Hospital.?

I took this matter up with Dr. Tyner, when he paid treaty here, and it seems that other day schools are reduced from receiving a ten-month grant to receiving a nine-month grant.\n\nIt hardly seems fair that our grant should be abolished when others are not.

I took this up immediately with the late Dr. Tyrer. He told me to open the beginning of Oct. and submit the returns to him. He pointed out that, in order to justify our existence I should endeavour to continue to keep as many families as possible off the relief rolls.\n\nSince last spring there has in this area been one ration, value $2.50 issued to an able-bodied Indian, and that was to help the widows dig up their potatoes. This has been done by finding employment, when possible, and by pushing native handicrafts.\n\nI feel that it only fair to expect the grant, for without it, we will have to curtail our work, which only means reverting to the old system of relief. In these times I don't think anyone should expect to receive remunerations for every little thing that is done, but in the case of the school, where there are expenses in maintaining it, I feel they we should be taken care of.\nThere is no need of taking up your time with lengthy arguments, but if you consult the relief accounts for here and compare them with other points I think you will agree with me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLeville A. Clarke M.H.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the school which you are conducting at Pagwa River.\n\nIt is extremely difficult, due to present regulations, to make a grant for this school. It is contrary to our policy at the present time to provide relief, education or medical services for Indians who are residing off their reserve.\n\nIt is our intention to have conditions at Pagwa River fully investigated in the near future but in the meantime it has been decided that an amount of $25.00 a month will be allowed toward your salary as teacher of this school for the period October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941. In making this payment it should be distinctly understood that this Branch does not obligate itself to continue payments to this school after the end of the current academic year. However, as stated above, it is hoped by that time to obtain a report regarding conditions and our future policy in regard to the school will then be decided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Neville R. Clarke,\nSt. Clement's Mission,\nPagwa River, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFebruary 22, 1946.\n\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto:\n\nSir:\n\nDuring the course of a recent visit to a newly formed Public School at Pagwa River (75 miles west of Hearst) my attention was drawn to the situation there with respect to Indian children. I realize that the education of these people is a matter for the Federal Government, but feel that the facts might be laid before you for any action you may deem proper.\n\nPagwa River is a small settlement which, including the airport two miles west, probably has a population of 20 white people in all. In addition there are several families of half-whites and an estimated 300-400 Indians. Instructions from the Ontario Department of Education permit the admission of non-treaty Indians only to the Public School, and in consequence an estimated 60-80 Indian children are receiving no education whatsoever.\n\nI was informed by the Indian Agent for the district some time ago, that it is desired that all Indians move to Calstock Reserve, some 55 miles east of Pagwa, where better facilities are available. From a visit to Pagwa, however, it would be my opinion that the Indians would be most reluctant to move away unless extreme pressure were brought upon them. The Pagwa River, which runs within 300 yards of a Hudson's Bay trading post, appears to have ample open water free from rapids; while the Kabinakagami River, running near Calstock would entail much portaging.\n\nAs a result of this situation many requests for admission of treaty Indian children to the Public School at Pagwa River must be refused, and the School Board itself feels that some action might be taken for the benefit of the Indians of the locality.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd.) G. L. Woodruff\n\nInspector of Public Schools\nToronto 2, February 26, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter from our Public School Inspector located at Cochrane concerning certain school affairs at Pagwa River in which Treaty Indians are concerned. If any co-operation from the Ontario Department of Education is desired with regard to the education of the Treaty Indians located at Pagwa, your proposals will receive every consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 4, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Rutherford:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing the report of Public School Inspector Woodruff concerning school affairs at Pagen River.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of Mr. Woodruff's report to our agent at Chapleau and on receipt of his reply will write to you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF. S. Rutherford, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1946.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nI have just received a letter from the Deputy Minister of Education, with which he forwards a copy of a report made by Inspector Woodruff in regard to the school situation at Pagen River. I enclose a copy of the Inspector's report and would appreciate your comments as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nChapleau Ontario\nMarch 7th, 1946\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 44-14-1 March 4th, 1946\n\nIn reply to your letter as above, regarding the school situation at Pagwa River.\n\nThe Inspector of Public Schools is quite right in saying that there are a large number of Indian children at Pagwa River who are not attending school, nor have they ever attended school, for any length of time.\n\nThis was the main reason for the establishment of the Constance Lake Reserve, but as we did not have any suitable accommodation for the families at Constance Lake no pressure has been placed on them to move, some have of their own accord, and when our housing project is completed this year I think that a number will then move to Calstock.\n\nThere are only two white people at Pagwa River itself, the remainder being at the airport, and these two white people are the ones who are creating opposition to the Indians moving from Pagwa River to Constance Lake, they are both traders, one the manager of the Hudson's Bay Co., and the other a Mr. Ericsson, if these Indians move they both lose out in their respective businesses.\n\nThe white people are not worried about the Indian children getting an education, the Indian school did function spasmodically some time ago, and at that time they would not let their children go with the Indian children to school, but now that there is a chance of the Indians moving away they are very keen to have them stay.\nThis situation is not new, but has been going on for years, and now that we are about ready to have them move the opposition is becoming more pronounced.\n\nI can appreciate Mr. Woodruff's letter as he is definitely interested in the education of all the children of his inspectorate, but I also know the Pagwa situation much better than he does, also the background.\n\nThe matter of the Pagwa River being more easily navigated than the Kabina Kagami really does not enter into question with any seriousness, all these people are moving between Pagwa River and Constance Lake a dozen times a year, and they could live at Constance Lake and go to Pagwa to use the river for travelling without any inconvenience to themselves, it is nothing more than they are doing all summer.\n\nAt Constance Lake there is work for them, they do nothing all summer at Pagwa except make a trip for the Hudson's Bay Co., portaging supplies to some of their down river posts, at Constance Lake they are within twenty miles of a Doctor and hospital, whereas at Pagwa they never see a doctor, also they will be more closely supervised with better houses and all round living conditions.\n\nI would wish to maintain the close cooperation that has existed in my agency with the Ontario Provincial Inspector, I have always found them to truly interested in the education of Indian children as well as whites, but feel that in this case it would be just another obstacle to overcome by allowing them to attend the Public school at Pagwa River, which incidentally has been closed for a considerable part of the academic year.\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 11, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Rutherford:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo and my reply of March 4, in connection with the report of Public School Inspector Woodruff on certain school matters at Pagwa River, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a report which we have just received from our Indian Agent at Chapleau, Ont.\n\nMr. Matters is very familiar with conditions in the district mentioned, and in view of his report, this Branch does not think it necessary to take any action at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF. S. Rutherford, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, March 12, 1946.\n\nMr. F.

Hoey\nSuperintendent Welfare & Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received a visit from Mr. T. Will's of Sunderland City, England. A resident of the Diocese of Durham.\n\nMr. Will's was impressed by the efforts of the school to instruct the boys in manual training, and also noted our lack of tools. He is a contractor by trade, but is retired. He is sending, on his return to England, a box of used tools. These will come as from the Lord Bishop of Durham.\n\nAll these tools will be used ones, but in good condition, with the right authority. Would you be kind enough to get in touch, or put this letter in the right hands, that the above mentioned tools might enter Canada, duty free. I understand that all equipment, used directly for missionary purposes, such as this, can enter the country duty free but did not know whom to get in touch with regarding this matter.\n\nThanking you I remain:\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNeville R.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with which you enclosed a copy of a letter dated the 19th ultimo, addressed to you by Rev. Neville R. Clarke, teacher of the Indian day school known as St. Clement's Mission, Pagwa River, Ontario, regarding the status of some used tools which Mr. T. Will's of Sunderland City, England, a contractor, contemplates sending to the school for the purpose of instructing the boys in manual training.\n\nThere is no provision in the Customs Tariff under which the tools in question may be entered free of customs duty. However, if you will state the port of entry in Canada, the Collector at that port will be advised to make a reasonable appraisal when the tools are imported.\n\nYours truly\n\nfor Commissioner of Customs.\nDear Mr. Clarke:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 19th ultimo in which you intimated that you have been able to secure from Mr. T. Willis of Sunderland City, England, a promise that he will forward to you in the immediate future a box of used tools suitable for use in the promotion of manual training at your school.\n\nIn response to your request I sent forward a copy of your communication to the Commissioner of Customs and I am enclosing herewith copy of his reply. You might, if you can do so, let me know the port of entry so that the Collector can be instructed to make a nominal evaluation of the tools for dutiable purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I understand that from people around here that appraisals are made at Cochrane for imports into this territory. But I have written asking Mr. Will to let you know when the box is coming.\n\nI sent a pair of slippers to you last month also the price list. Have you received them?\n\nI have been talking to the District Airways Engineer for Pagwa Airport, and he was telling me that I would be able to get hold of a lot of useful things such as cups, knives and forks, stoves cooking ranges etc., etc., after the camp closes the end of July.\n\nTo do this it will be necessary for you to get in touch with the Dept. of Transport, and ask them to permit Mr. Hill the District Engineer to turn over the above articles to me when the camp closes. Mr. Hill tells me that it will be necessary to get this done as soon as possible. Once I receive the required permission, I will personally see to the distribution of these goods.\n\nHave you any news, as yet regarding the school? You mentioned last year that we would be taken in on this year's estimates, which being approved the greatest need is desks etc.,\n\nI remain:\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n44-14-11 CLOSED\n\nCLOSED\nFROM TO\n19 MAY 39\n14 JUN 39\n\nPAGWA RIVER\nDAY SCHOOL\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING\nFile 43-7-1, part 1  Nipissing - Kipawa Day School - General Administration. 1912-1914, 1948\n\nFile 44-8-1, part 1  Treaty 9 - Moose River (French Post) Day School - General Administration. 1911-1918\n\nFile 44-8-5, part 1  James' Bay - Treaty 9 - Moose River (French Post) Day School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1923-1925\n\nFile 44-14-1, part 1  James' Bay - Treaty 9 - Pagwa River Day School - General Administration. 1936-1946\n\nFile 44-14-11, part 1  James' Bay - Treaty 9 - Pagwa River Day School - Vocational Training. 1939\n\nFile 44-15-1, part 1  James' Bay - Treaty 9 - Sachigo River Day School - General Administration. 1938\nFile 43-7-1, part 1  \nNipissing - Kipawa Day School - General Administration. 1912-1914, 1948\n\nFile 44-8-1, part 1  \nTreaty 9 - Moose River (French Post) Day School - General Administration. 1911-1918\n\nFile 44-8-5, part 1  \nJames' Bay - Treaty 9 - Moose River (French Post) Day School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1923-1925\n\nFile 44-14-1, part 1  \nJames' Bay - Treaty 9 - Pagwa River Day School - General Administration. 1936-1946\n\nFile 44-14-11, part 1  \nJames' Bay - Treaty 9 - Pagwa River Day School - Vocational Training. 1939\n\nFile 44-15-1, part 1  \nJames' Bay - Treaty 9 - Sachigo River Day School - General Administration. 1938\nSACHIGO RIVER EXPLORATION CO.\nLIMITED\n\nSACHIGO RIVER, ONT.\nAugust 28th, 1938.\n\nDept. of Mines and Natural Resources,\nIndian Affairs Division,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have been requested by Mrs. W.

The Indians at Lequille are part of his congregation, and he is deeply interested in their welfare.\n\nFather Grace, who is respected, and I may say beloved, by all classes and creeds at Annapolis Royal, can have no selfish motive in suggesting the establishment of a school at Lequille for the benefit of the Indian residents of that place. He is prompted solely by a desire to promote the best interests of these people, and I submit that his suggestion should not be lightly dealt with. Of course, the proposition may not be feasible, but I feel that the education of 15 children - wards of the Department - is surely worthy of your attention. I shall be glad to have your opinion of the matter in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, T.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo, regarding the request which you received from Rev. T. J. Grace, Parish Priest of Annapolis Royal, for the establishment of a school for the benefit of the Indian children at Lequille.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are not prepared to erect a school building, equip the same and provide a salary for a teacher at this point. We provide a tuition grant for the Indian children of this locality who attend the white school. The last account paid was for the half year ending January 31st, last. The return showed an attendance of eleven children. If the trustees of the section will agree to continue to provide educational facilities for all the Indian children at Lequille, we would be prepared to further increase the tuition grant at present paid. You might take this matter up with Rev. Father Grace and the school authorities, and inform them that the Department would be prepared to increase the grant which is being paid. At present we are allowing grant at the rate of $4 per pupil per annum, payable on the average attendance as shown by returns prepared by the teacher and forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent. We will increase this grant to $12 per pupil per annum on the average attendance as shown by returns which should be made out by the teacher and forwarded to the Department through the office of the local Indian Agent. This is the same rate as we allow in similar cases to white schools in the eastern provinces.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to the arrangements you have been able to make with the authorities of the white school to provide for the tuition of all the Indian children at Lequille.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They say that if the attendance will be as large as last year that they will have to open the other Department, and in that case they might be able to accommodate the Indian children, but that if only one Department will be open, that it would be impossible to take them. They claimed that $4.00 per annum was very small grant per child. They said that it was costing the station $5.00 per child for their own children. They also said that it must be as long time than $4.00 per child in the Indian school at Afton. I told them I did not know anything about that, but if it was possible for them that they should not deprive the Indian children of Heatherton the schooling they needed. They again told me that unless they opened the other Department, they would be unable to take them, but that if they could open the second Department, they would most likely take them, and again said that\nSir,\n\nThey thought that $4.00 was very small for child\nI told them that that was what the Department\nwas paying in other white schools in town Station\nthey said that was no difference to them.\nHowever they would not give a decided answer\ntill school opens to see if they will open the\nother Department place let me know if I am\nto give $7.00 per month to the orphan grand-child\nof Chief Thomas Paul although I could not make\nfinal arrangements for his attendance at school.\nHoping to hear from you in the matter I am\nyour obedient servant\n\nW.J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 19, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the trustees can provide accommodation for these children, the Department will be prepared to increase the amount first offered for their tuition fees. You may inform the trustees that the sum of $12.00 per annum for each child will be allowed based on the average attendance as shown by quarterly returns which should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded at the end of each quarter.\n\nIt is hoped that the trustees will be able to accommodate these children in their school. I will be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter at a later date. You should again take this up with the trustees and inform them of the increased rate allowed and endeavour to arrange with them for the tuition of these Indian children.\n\nThe Department will continue the amount allowed as relief to Chief Paul at the rate of $7.00 per month for the maintenance of his grandchild, whether he attends the Heatherton white school or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton,\nN. S.\nHeatherston Oct 6th\nSept 15 - 1921\nHon. J. Cameron\nHeatherston\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Board of Trustees have considered your application re the admittance of Indian children to our school and have decided to reopen the Primary Department on condition that the Dept. of Indian Affairs pay $2.50 for each pupil enrolled in the School Register. They would further insist that all fees be paid at the end.\nthe half year convenient\nto the Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec. & Trustees.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 74-45 dated August 19th 1921, I again bring the matter of getting the Indian children of Heatherton Reserve to attend the white school with the Trustee. They said they would refuse the Primary Department to accommodate the Indian children of the Department would pay $3.00 for each child enrolled in the regular but would not consider taking them for $3.00 in the average attendance. They said they could get along this year without refusing the school but would refuse it to accommodate the Indian children on the first enrollment mentioned namely $3.00 for each child in the regular, as they said it would not be their fault if the children did not attend regularly.\n\nI enclose a letter I received from the Secretary along the same lines as the conversation I had with them, awaiting a reply from you on the matter I remain your obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nAttaw\n\n[Stamp]\nOTTAWA, Sept. 21st, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Heatherton School Board regarding the tuition of the Indian children who reside at too great a distance to attend the Afton Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will agree to the terms as set forth in the letter of the Secretary-Treasurer and will pay a grant at the rate of $12.00 per annum for each Indian child in attendance. The grant will be paid quarterly, upon receipt of returns showing the attendance of Indian children. These returns should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nIt is hoped that the School Board will now arrange to re-open their primary department and accept the Indian children who will attend.\n\nThe Department will also agree to provide the Indian children with the text books, stationery, etc., required upon receipt of a requisition, which should also be prepared by the teacher, showing the supplies of the above nature required.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the Indian children avail themselves of the opportunity offered, and that they attend school regularly each day it is open. You should also see that returns are forwarded promptly at the end of each quarter, so that payment of the grant due can be made, and when forwarding these returns, you should state the name of the Secretary-Treasurer in order that cheques for the grant due can be drawn in his name.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing quarterly return for White School at Heatherton where Indian children are attending. On authority letter No. 74-46 dated Sept. 21st, 1921, you will note the school did not open till Oct. 27th and the first quarter ended in the White School Nov. 4th. The reason I did not have them sent in before now was that I had no quarterly return form. I sent for them before school opened but did not receive them and had to send a second time. They were six children attended during the past quarter but at present they are eight attending. They are attending very good and the teacher says they take quite an interest in their studies. Mr. D. H. Grant, Heatherton, is Secretary Treasurer of the School to which payment can be made. Hoping this is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nObdiently Yours,\nH. J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 3, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a return showing the attendance of the Indian children at the Heatherton White School for the term ending November 4th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for the amount of tuition fees due is being drawn in favour of D. M. Grant, Secretary Treasurer, School Board, and sent in your care.\n\nIt is noted that there are eight Indian children regularly in attendance and that they are taking an interest in their studies and availing themselves of the facilities offered in obtaining an education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N. S.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nMr. D. W. Grant, Secretary Treasuror of the White School here in which Indian children are attending, asked me to write the Department in connection with the quarterly returns for quarter ending January 27th 1922, which I sent you on that date, and for which he received cheque No. 3609 for $17.10 you will note in your letter No. 74-46 dated August 18th 1921 the Department offered $12.00 per annum based on the average attendance, the Secretary would not accept that offer, saying that could not open the Primary Department on those conditions. The Department then wrote in letter No. 74-46 dated Sept 21st 1921 that they would pay at the rate of $15.00 per annum as set forth in the letter of the Secretary Treasuror which I sent you at that time, as they were eight children in attendance during the last quarter, the Secretary claims the amount should be $24.00 instead of $17.10 a balance due them of $6.90. They said they would not open the Primary Department only on condition set forth in the Department's letter No. 74-46 dated Sept 21st 1921 hoping to hear from you in the matter I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH. J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa. February 28, 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant, I beg to say that a cheque for $6.90, being the balance due the Heatherton School for the last quarter, is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton,\nN. S.\nSir,\n\nI sent you the Quarterly Return for the Heatherton White School for quarter ending Nov. 3rd, for which I received Cheque No. 282 for $9.00 which I gave to Mr. D. W. Grant the Secretary and which he claims is not the right amount according to Letter No. 74-46 dated Sept. 21st 1922. The Department agreed to pay at the rate of $1.00 per annum for each child in attendance, which would be $3.00 per child per quarter and as there were five children in attendance, he says according to agreement the School Section should receive $15.00 for last quarter, which is a balance of $12.00 which he asked me to bring to the Department office.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nH. F. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, Nov. 25, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the amount of the cheque forwarded in payment of the grant for the Indian children in attendance at the Heatherton White School for the period ending November 3rd, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the cheque for $9.00, which was sent the Treasurer, was in payment of the grant due for one month, ending September 30th, last. It is difficult to calculate the grant due from the returns received from this school, as the periods covered by these returns do not comply with our regulations. The quarters in the year end September 30th, December 31st, March 31st and June 30th, and you should instruct the teacher and the school board to prepare their returns showing the attendance of the Indian children in compliance therewith.\n\nWill you be good enough to instruct the teacher to prepare a return at the end of the present quarter, viz: December 31st, next, and forward it to the Department when grant for the months of October, November and December will be paid. In future, these returns should be made out at the end of each quarter, as mentioned above. The grant allowed is at the rate of $12 per annum for each child in attendance. Kindly explain this to the Secretary Treasurer and request that the requirements of the Department are adhered to in the preparation of future returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N. S.\nSir,\n\nI received a cheque No. 2974 dated Oct. 12th for $6.00 payable to \"D.U. Grant\" Secretary Invermere Heatherton White School in which Indian children are attending, and he says the amount is not right. Upon letter No. 103-46 dated Nov. 25th 1922, which I sent to the School Board at the time, says the grant allowed is at the rate of $2.00 per annum for each child in attendance, and as there are five children attending during quarter ending September 30th the grant says which would be $3.00 per quarter for each child, the amount should be $18.00 and asked me to write the Department about it, awaiting a reply in the matter. I remain your obedient servant.\n\nH.J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n$2.00\n$1.60\n$1.60\nOttawa, October 29, 1923.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the cheque sent to the Secretary Treasurer of the Heatherton white school, I beg to say that the summer holidays are usually taken during the months of July and August. The Department, when paying the September quarter return, considers that there is only one school month in that quarter. Therefore, as there were six children in attendance, we forwarded a cheque for $6.00 in payment of the one month's tuition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N. S.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 105-46 dated October 29th, 1923, I referred it to Secretary of the School, and he said that was not the agreement that was made, and later he notified me that at a meeting of the School Board, they said that if the Department did not keep to the terms set forth in their letter No. 74-46 dated September 21st, 1921, that they would not accept the Indian children in their school after the present quarter. The letter which they referred to says that the Department agreed to the terms set forth in the letter of the Secretary Treasury, namely $12.00 per annum for each child in attendance, and the Secretary said at the time they would sooner have it paid quarterly, but now he says him that the Department is paying quarterly which would be $3.00 per child for quarter. That the cheque $6.00 received for the quarter ending August 30th should have been $18.00 according to agreement. I told them I would notify the Department about the matter.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nH. J. Cameron\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nAttawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files, 1920-1923 (RG 10, Volume 6025, File 46-2-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Nov. 26th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the amount of the grant paid for the tuition of the Indian children in attendance at the Heatherton white school during the quarter ended September 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that grant was paid for one month only. We are forwarding under separate cover a cheque for $12, being the balance due for the full quarter.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of September 21, 1921, grant will be allowed at the rate of $12 per annum for each Indian child in attendance as shown by returns which should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded through your office promptly at the end of each quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In sending in my return for Sept 3rd, 1924 I sent Benjy Pauls age 4\u00bd yrs which showed he was 4 yrs 5 mos. These were just one month in the difference. I sincerely hope this will not be the cause of any harm.\n\nIf there is anything to satisfy I will try and do so without going to the agent at Heatherton.\n\nPlease do not mention this to our Agent Mr. W. J. Cameron and please reply to:\n\nMarie MacLeod\nTeacher\n\nReply at once please\nOttawa, June 19, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant and in reply I have to inform you that, under Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act, every Indian child between the ages of 7 and 15 years and who is physically able should attend school for the full periods during which such school is open each year. However, in the case of your school, you may accept children who are 6 years of age. Any Indian child under that age should not be admitted.\n\nYour explanation regarding the age entered on the September quarter return, 1924, for Bennie Paul has been noted. It is considered that this child is too young to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary\n\nMiss Maria MacDonald,\nHeatherton,\nAnt. Co., N.

Grant, Secretary Treasurer of said School, Mr. Grant asked me to bring it to the attention of the Department, that they only paid at the rate of $10.00 for each child attending the School last term. He said that for the Quarter ending Sept 30th 1924 that the School Board only received $1.00 for each child attending and $3.00 for each child during the other three quarters, which made a total of $4.00 per child for the year. He says the agreement was that they were to receive $2.00 per child for the term which would make it $3.00 for each child attending for quarter, and said that they should receive $3.00 for each child on each Quarterly return that was sent in. I told him I would bring the matter to the Department's notice. I remain your obedient servant,\n\nW.J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing quarterly return for Heatherton White School in which Indian children are attending for quarter ending March 31st 1926. In Authority letter No. 105-46 dated Nov 25th 1922, Mr. D.W. Grant is Secretary Treasurer of said School.\n\nThe attendance during this quarter was not good due to the fact there was a case of Scarlet Fever on the Heatherton Reserve, and the Health Authorities thought it advisable to keep the Indian children from school for four weeks, and then the weather was stormy, but the attendance should be good during the coming quarter. I remain your\n\nAbsent Servant\n\nW. J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nAttawapiskat\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing quarterly return from Heatherton White School in which Indian children are attending for quarter ending September 30th on Authority Letter No. 105-46 dated Nov 25th 1922. Mr. D.W. Grant is Secretary Treasurer of said School.\n\nIt is very difficult to get them to attend regularly, as they are away at times with their parents, but I expect a better attendance during this quarter. I remain your obedient servant,\n\nW.J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nAttawas\nHeatherton, N. S.,\nJan 5th, 1927,\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014\n\nWe have been asked by the officials of Heatherton School Section No 25, to petition the Department of Indian Affairs for a grant of $1000.00 to be used in the construction of a new school. At first this would seem like an unreasonable request but after studying the matter, we feel that you will appreciate with us the justice of the claim.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\u2014\n\nIn Heatherton Section there are two Indian Reservations \u2014 one at Sumnerside and another approximately five miles west from the present school site. In these Reservations there are twelve Indian children of school age and this number is practically one-sixth of the total number of pupils in the section. We have permitted these children to attend our school, causing congested class room conditions, with the result that the Provincial Inspector of Schools has asked for the enlargement of the old school or the building of a new one. At a regular meeting of the ratepayers on Oct. 15th, 1926, it was decided to build a new, two-department school and $4500.00 was accordingly voted for the purpose \u2014 this amount to be supplemented by funds from other sources as it was felt that the total cost of the building would be in the vicinity of $6000.00. On the attendance basis of Indian children we feel that your Department would be justified in contributing one-sixth of this amount, or, as was stated above, $1000.00.\n\nAgain, it is the desire of the Inspector to establish an efficient, consolidated High School Department in the Heatherton school. This is in line with our wishes as well as the aims of the Department of Education. In the event of this plan materializing the adjoining sections will contribute to the general support of the school in addition to paying tuition fees per pupil. This High School Department would be open to pupils from not only the Heatherton and Sumnerside Reservations, but the Afton District as well. At the present time a High School pupil, M. L. Prosper, from the Afton Reservation, is being educated in one of the Antigonish schools at a cost of $180.00 to the Department. This cost would be greatly reduced were it convenient for Mr. Prosper to attend an up-to-date school near his home. It will be possible for him or others to do this when our new school, with an improved High School Department, is in operation, provided financial assistance is available from Dominion funds.\n\nAlthough an Indian school is maintained at Afton it will never be of service, on account of distance, to the children in the Heatherton and Sumnerside Reservations. Hence, it may be that in the near future your Department will be confronted with the question of providing a separate school for these children. From the standpoint of economy we feel that the paying of a building grant to our school, which would entitle Indian children the privilege of attending, would be favourably received by you.\n\nNo doubt, as a further provision to the paying of this grant, you will require the plans and specifications of the new building to be approved by the Department of Education and in this regard we wish to state that this provision will receive our endorseration.\n\nIt is hoped that our building program will be well under way before the end of the school year and hence we respectfully ask your early attention to this matter. Again, we earnestly trust that after your careful consideration your reply will be a favourable one.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSECRETARY OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES.\nAntigonish, N. S.,\nJan. 6th, 1927.\n\nMr. F. Scott, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter studying the contents of the attached letter I wish to confirm the appeal for a subvention from the trustees of Heatherton School Section.\n\nApart from the justifiableness of the request, which I believe to be sound, the argument that appeals to me is the one of benefits to the Indian children accruing from associating with white children during their school days. The Indians of the Heatherton and Summerside Reservations are rapidly emulating the customs and habits of the white people. This is a good and important fact in our plan, fostered by having Indian children attend Provincial Schools. The industry, application and progress in study of the white children will act as an excellent stimulus to those from the Reservations while the imitation of the native children's deportment and refinement will be salutary. For such benefits it would appear to me that your Department would be favourably disposed to assisting in a very definite way the establishing of a thoroughly modern school at Heatherton.\n\nAt any rate, being extremely interested in educational work, particularly at Heatherton, I shall anxiously await your decision in the matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPost 6 yrs\nas usual 9\nas attend 27\n\n[Handwritten note]\nAntigonish, N.S.,\nJan. 8th, 1927,\n\nMr. Scott, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter studying the contents of the attached letter I wish to confirm the appeal for a subvention from the trustees of Heatherton School Section.\n\nApart from the justifiableness of the request, which I believe to be sound, the argument that appeals to me is the one of benefits to the Indian children accruing from associating with white children during their school days.

I regret there are no funds for this purpose, but I am willing to help to some extent by increasing the fee which is allowed for the Indian children that attend this public school. If a new building is provided, I shall direct that our grant be raised from $12 to $20 per child per academic year. Please inform the Secretary of the District.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I regret that I cannot add anything to my Deputy's letter to Mr. MacDonald of the 17th ultimo. The Department of Indian Affairs does not make grants for capital expense at public schools. There are 9 or 10 Indian children attending the Heatherston Public School more or less irregularly. The average attendance for the past year was a little more than 5. Dr. Scott offered an increase in the grant which would mean a payment of $200 per year, if the new building is erected. I feel that this is all that can be done in the matter.\n\nYour correspondent finds a precedent in a grant to the St. Bruno's School, near Grocourt, Alta.

P.O.

I have since my return from Europe last Nov. (1894) written at three times & the late Inspector once at least. It is an interesting school, the children, clean, well-behaved & very attentive.\n\nA lady teacher from Boston visited it last week; she was greatly pleased at the evident tokens of it being a thoroughly well-taught school. The writing (vertical) surprised her by its excellent appearance. I am proposing to spend a week soon helping the teacher to stimulate parents & children to a higher appreciation of their school. They do appreciate but are so poor that there is always the temptation to leave for the more able pittance they can earn. They seem to be constantly impressed with the fact that the only chance for their children's rise from abject poverty lies through education. I remain\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The signature is not legible.]\nMadam,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo informing the Department that you have succeeded your late husband as Trustee to the Cole Harbour Indian School; and in reply I beg to say that the Department is much pleased with the interest you evince in the welfare of the Indians and it trusts that your efforts to awaken the Indian parents to the advantages to be derived from an education will be successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nMrs Catherine M.

Sullivan\nOttawa, 18th August, 1897.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in reference to the circular sent the teacher of the Indian School at Cole Harbour, calling for report on the school on the prescribed form, and asking what you shall do, as there is no teacher for next year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is the first intimation the department has received of Miss Langley's having severed her connection with this school. As Miss Langley was in charge of the school for some years, and taught up to the 30th June last, she should be able to give the required information, and if you knew her address you might ask her to do so.\n\nIt would be well for you to consult with the Public School Inspector, with a view to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school, at the same salary.\n\nPlease attend to this matter at once, as the school should now be opened.\n\nAnother blank form for teachers' annual reports is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

The Indians appear to have removed just prior to the expiration of the last quarter. The teacher desires to know if the Dept. intends to continue the school, after this quarter, which expires June 30th. I have written the teacher, Miss Clark, to inform me if possible, as to the whereabouts of the Indians who have left, and also if they intend to remain away.\n\nI am sending quarterly returns today and this will explain the remarks made.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nCharles M.

In reply I beg to say that if the Indians do not return, it would be better to close this school after the 30th June next, but before further considering this matter, the Department would like to know whether any arrangement might be made by which the remaining children could attend a white school in their neighborhood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.D.

I had seventeen (17) pupils. I was obliged to discontinue teaching during the month of October as the time of the lease had expired. In November I rented another Bungalow the same in which I am at present teaching.

I have been paying the rent during the year and the Indians have supplied the fuel.\n\nThere are ten (10) families in Lupton Cove - Dartmouth - at present, and eight (8)\nEducation of their children also became gold and silver medals have been offered as prizes; and the children have been working hard on this account.\n\nRev. F. Richardson\nTeacher\n\n204 Leckman St.,\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nI opened a class in September last in the Bungalow which I had been learning to another place.\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed letter, or report, relates to a matter, which arrested my attention when I visited the Indian settlement at Tuft's Cove, N.S., recently.\n\nI found a good school in operation there, conducted by a young man of leisure, who, therefore, having time on his hands, and wishing to make good use of it by assisting in some manner those most in need of help, decided to open a school among the Indians of Dartmouth at their request. He did so without hope of remuneration, or reward - other than comes to one who is conscious of having done his full duty towards fellow mortals, who may require such assistance as he is in a position to give.\n\nI visited the school and was so impressed with what I saw, that I requested Mr. Richardson to send me a statement explaining the circumstances under which the school was opened and kept in operation; and I regard it as incumbent on me to bring the matter to the notice of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 31, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a letter addressed to you by Mr. Geo. F. Richards, who has been carrying on a school on the Indian settlement at Tufts Cove N.S., and in reply I hereto say that the Department appreciates the Educational work undertaken by Mr. Richards in the interests of these Indians and will be prepared to recoup him for the outlay he has been put to for the rent of the house in which he has been holding the school if he will furnish duplicate vouchers for the rent.\n\nThe Department would also prepared to pay Mr. Richards for his services as teacher when furnished with quarterly returns showing the time the school was in operation. Blank forms of return are being sent you which Mr. Richards should fill up and forward to you for transmission to the Department after being certified by you.\n\nWhen a reserve at Tufts Cove is finally set apart, the question of the permanent establishment of a school there will be dealt with. In the mean time Mr. Richards can continue the school if the attendance will justify it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN.S.\n\nSTEWART\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Quarterly Return for the school conducted at Tufts Cove, N.S., by Mr. Geo. F. Richardson.\n\nThis is the most progressive Indian school in Nova Scotia. Mr. Richardson is enthusiastic about his work, and he has interested not only the Indians directly concerned in the school, but clergymen and some prominent outsiders as well, whose encouragement is of much assistance to the teacher, and of corresponding benefit to the school.\n\nKnowing the situation as I do, I regard it as a matter of strict duty to request that Mr. Richardson's salary be increased to at least $450 per annum.\n\nThe building in which he taught the past two terms can no longer accommodate the increased number of children attending school, and it is absolutely necessary to secure a larger building. A very suitable house can be got quite close to Tufts Cove Indian settlement for ten dollars a month rent, and I would advise renting it. An Indian owns it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nOn May 17th, 1923, Sup't. Boyd reported that a school was being operated on Tufts Cove Reserve by C.F. Richardson.\n\nOn investigation the Department decided to pay Mr. Richardson a salary of $300.00.\n\nThe reports received about the work at this school show that Mr. Richardson is making very good progress.\n\nSup't. Boyd now recommends that Mr. Richardson's salary be increased to $450.00.\n\nHowever, I think the Department would be justified, in consideration of the work which is being done, in increasing Mr. Richardson's salary to $400.00 per annum.\n\nThe June quarter return shows an enrollment of 21 with an average attendance of 13.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 20th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., recommending an increase of salary for Mr. G.F. Richardson, teacher at the Tufts' Cove School and also recommending that the Department rent a larger building for the accommodation of those attending this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to increase Mr. Richardson's salary to $400.00 per year from July 1st 1914.\n\nYour recommendation about renting a larger building is also approved and you are, hereby, authorised to rent the house which you consider will be suitable for the school. The Department notes that the rental to be paid for this house will be $10.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nMr. G. F. Richardson, teacher of the school at Tufts' Cove has applied to me for three months leave of absence dating from the first of January. Mr. Richardson is suffering from Nervous disorder and I believe needs a complete rest. As he is a very valuable teacher and takes a great interest in the work, I hope the Department will be able to grant his request.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nW. G. Foster\nSuperintendent\nOttawa, January 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant stating that Mr. G. F. Richardson, teacher of the Tufts' Cove School, has applied to you for three months leave of absence, as he is suffering from nervous disorder.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Mr. Richardson can secure a substitute to take charge of the school during his absence the Department will be prepared to allow him three months leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G.

S.\n\nJanuary 21st, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th inst No 426405/1, relating to leave of absence for Mr G. F. Richardson, teacher of the Tuft's Cove School, I beg to state that Mr. Richardson has furnished a satisfactory substitute, and the school is getting along splendidly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW. G. Foster\nSuperintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nBy letter dated July 20th, 1914 No. 426 405-1, addressed to A. J. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, River Bourgeois, N. S., the Department announced the decision to increase the salary of Mr. G. F. Richardson, teacher of the School at Tuft's Cove, to $400.00 per annum from July 1st, 1914. Mr. Richardson has not received the increase however, his quarterly cheques being on the basis of the old salary. I feel that it is only necessary to bring this matter to the attention of the Department to have it rectified.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nW. G. Foster\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, April 15, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the amount of salary paid to Mr. George F. Richardson, teacher of the Tutt's Cove School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Richardson's salary was increased from $300.00 to $400.00 per annum from the 1st of July, 1914, but through an oversight, which is regretted, he has only been paid at the former rate. A cheque for $75.00, being the amount due to complete his salary at the increased rate to March 31st, last, is being sent to his address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Foster, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nHalifax, N.S.\nSir,\n\nMr. George F. Richardson, Teacher of the Indian school at Tufts Cove, Halifax County, has applied to me for leave of absence for a period of three months, on account of ill health. He is threatened with nervous breakdown, and his physician advises him to give up teaching and all other occupations for a few months, and to take complete rest as the proper remedy in his case.\n\nHe guarantees to secure the services of a competent teacher, who will substitute for him in his absence, and I earnestly recommend that leave be granted him as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant stating that Mr. George F. Richardson, teacher of the Indian school at Tufts Cove, has applied to you for leave of absence for a period of three months on account of ill health.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Richardson may be granted leave of absence for three months on condition that he secures the services a competent teacher to take charge of the school in his absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, August 23rd, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you explain the delay in forwarding Mr. Richardson's account.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that your explanation is quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOffice of Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, W.S.,\nFeb. 7th, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nMr. Richardson, who taught the Indian school at Tufts Cove near Dartmouth, N.S., up to the end of January, has been transferred to the Wyccocomagh school, and, under present circumstances, I think it would be very advisable to keep the one he vacated in operation during Winter and early Spring.\n\nThere are nine children of school going age with the Indians encamped at Tufts Cove for the cold weather season, which does not terminate in Nova Scotia sometimes until the end of May, and the number will rather increase than diminish during that period.\n\nI would therefore strongly recommend placing this school in charge of Miss Mary E. Ahern until May 31st, with the express stipulation that she must not expect to occupy the place longer, unless circumstances clearly demand that she, or someone else should.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 14, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant stating that, under present circumstances, you think it would be advisable to keep the Tufts Cove School in operation during the winter and early spring and recommending that Miss Mary E. Ahern be placed in charge until May 31st, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, you may place Miss Ahern in charge of this school until May 31st, next, with the express stipulation that she must not expect to occupy the place longer, unless circumstances clearly demand that she, or someone else should. She will be paid at the same rate of salary as the former teacher, viz.- $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, April 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a return from Mr. George F. Richardson, teacher of the Tufts Cove Day School, for the quarter ending March 31st, last.\n\nThis return shows that the school at that point was in operation for 46 days during the quarter. It would appear that Mr. Richardson after leaving Whycoomash again resumed duties at this school on the 16th of February, last. The Department would like to be informed upon what authority he resumed duties at this school, as you were instructed by official letter of February 14th, last, that Miss Mary E. Ahern was to be placed in charge until May 31st, next, with the stipulation that she must not expect to keep the place longer. The Department would like to be informed as to why Miss Ahern did not assume the duties of teacher at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Beurgess, N.S.,\nMay 11th., 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th. ultimo,\nI beg to say that Mr. Richardson had resumed teaching\nthe Indian school at Tufts Cove of his own accord before I could notify Miss Ahern of her appointment,\nand I thought it advisable to leave him in charge,\nespecially as she was not even aware that she had been recommended for appointment as teacher of the school, and had no expectations whatever in that way.\nI was also influenced in the matter by the knowledge that he was by long odds the more successful teacher of the two.\n\nI should have informed the Department of the situation promptly, as I fully intended doing, but overlooked it in some way that I cannot account for.\nBut, in the interest of Indian education, I hope the Department will be able to confirm Mr. Richardson in his position as teacher at Tufts Cove. It was he who established the school, which has been of more benefit to Indians, from an educational point of view, than any other in Nova Scotia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 19, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant stating that Mr. Richardson had resumed teaching the Indian school at Tufts Cove of his own accord before you could notify Miss Ahern of her appointment and you thought it advisable to leave him in charge.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of Mr. Richardson again taking charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.,\nMarch 23rd., 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed returns in connection with the Indian school at Tuft's Cove, N.S., non-existent at present, are incomplete as the result of a most tragic occurrence, namely, the explosion of ammunition in the harbour of Halifax on December 6th last. The building, rented by the Department for Indian school purposes, was completely demolished and the furniture smashed. The only thing saved out of the wreckage, so far as I know, is the Register of Attendance, from which I have prepared the enclosed Return for the quarter ended December 31st. The late teacher, Mr. George F. Richardson, was killed on his way to the school.\n\nIn view of the extraordinary circumstances in this case, I recommend payment of the full quarter's salary to Mr. George Richardson, late teacher's father, 1020 Barrington Street, Halifax City.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

Richardson, the teacher, is being sent to his father.\n\nThe death of Mr. Geo. F. Richardson by the explosion in Halifax Harbour on the morning of December 6th last, is much regretted. His services as teacher of this school were performed to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nA. J.

It serves the purpose well enough during warm and temperate weather, but in order to keep the school in operation for the full term, as is desirable, the building should be improved considerably to make it habitable for the winter.\n\nAn expenditure of about $40, mostly for tar-paper, shingles, and nails, would be required to make it comfortable for pupils and teacher in the cold weather season, and I recommend that the amount be authorized by the Department for purchasing materials, as stated. The Indians would furnish the necessary labour to put the building in good condition.\n\nI recommend also that the Department furnish the school with fuel; but I do not think it necessary to appoint a janitor, because the Indians have a lively interest in the school and will, I believe, keep it clean and make a fire in the room every morning without being paid to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Soft Coal owing to the demand for shipping purposes is quite scarce.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDaniel Christopherson\nIndian agent\n\nThe coal situation in some places along the D.A.R. is becoming critical.

They range from 5 yrs to 15 yrs old, and it seems a pity that these children are growing up without getting some education.\n\nWhat is needed on this Reserve is a school house or a building that could be made into a school building so that these children would be able to go to school.\n\nI will appreciate it very much if you would consider having a school building built on this Reserve and open a school by the time school opens this fall.\n\nI will do all I can to help in any way towards this project and I trust you will take this matter up with those who have this to look after.\noften and see what can be done as to having a school building built and a teacher promised to teach these children.\n\nI have been advised by the Reverend of the Cambridge School that next year they will not be able to take any Indian children in their school on account of not having sufficient room even for their own children and this being the case this will make more children on the Reserve running around\u65e0\u6240\u4e8b\u4e8b to go and nothing for them to do or take up their time and attention. And as soon as we hire when boys and girls do not nothing to do then they find entertainment of their own which in so many ways looks to be an immoral instinct and this can be avoided if these boy and girl are given something to do to take up their time which will teach will be of some good to them when they grow up and also teach them how to do the right thing.

Indian Superintendent General,\nGrand River, Lot 14,\nPrince Edward Island.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nThe Superintendent of Education, Mr. H. Campbell of Oshawa, urges upon the ratepayers of Rocky Point School district to admit the Indian children. He pointed out that according to the school act they could not draw a color line but were legally bound to provide for all children of school age in the district. His reply was that if the law were enforced they would give them complete control of the school and keep the white children at home. That in reality they would be only a few Indian children but when they would come there in force in the spring and fall that it would become for the time practically an Indian school. There are only fifteen or four families of white people who have children to send.\n\nI am now writing to the Secretary of School trustees to try and have the children who are there for the winter months admitted and promising to have provision made for them when they become numerous. They might then cross in the ferry steamers to schools in the city, but as they have no horses they could not go in winter. There are six children there now of school age.\n\nJohn Smith\nIndian Superintendent\nOttawa, December 15, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Indian children who desire to attend the Rocky Point School.\n\nIt is noted that you are writing to the Secretary of the School Trustees to urge them to allow the children to attend school during the winter and the Department will await another letter from you before taking further action.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. J. A. McDonald,\nAssistant Indian Superintendent,\nGrand River, Lot 14,\nPrince Edward Island.\nDepartment of Education\n\nCharlottetown, P.E. Island, Sept. 11th, 1914.\n\nRev. John A. McDonald,\nGrand River.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to call your attention to the regrettable condition of affairs prevailing among the Indians at Rocky Point. There are there especially in summer a large number of Indian children of school age, but for whose education no provision is made. The ratepayers and trustees of the school district will not allow the Indian children to attend and have notified the teacher that she is not to admit them. The reasons given for this are that the Indian children come from Tuberculous families in which ordinary cleanliness is not observed and that apart from this they do not want their children taught in what would be at certain seasons of the year practically an Indian School.\n\nIt seems to me that these Indian children should certainly have an opportunity to obtain an education. Mr. Mitchell who is a sort of head man among the Indians at Rocky Point has been at the Education Office several times in reference to this matter and in my perplexity it seems to me that I cannot do better than to refer the matter to you. Is there any means by which special instruction and care can be obtained for these Indian children?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.H. Campbell\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary of School District No. 1 at Rocky Point has not yet replied to my letter asking for the admission of the Indian children into the school there. I only asked for the admission of such few children as are permanent residents and informed them that the Department would furnish them with books and pay ten or fifteen dollars by way of tax for the support of the school.\n\nI enclose the letter of the Sect. of Education received in Sept. When I called on him he said the residents threatened to keep their own children home if the law were applied to them and they were forced to admit the Indian children.\n\nThere is no other way to have these children attend school in winter time. When the harbor freezes over they are three miles from the school house and they have no horses. In any case there is no ground for objection against them which could not be used with greater reason by the parents of the children.\n\nI would be unwilling to insist on the legal right of those resident children. The Superintendent of Education admits it. I know the bench of the province would not stand for any such nonsense.\nSir,\n\nSo long as they refuse to admit any resident children, the teacher cannot get legally drawn a salary from the local government.\n\nAn objection was raised in the school (where there are some camps) against the admittance of Indian children. Two of the three trustees objected; the other one stood out for them and brought the others to consult Judge McLeod privately. He gave his opinion emphatically against any power of exclusion that they agreed to admit them. When they objected that the chiefs were willing he told them then to get their desks. There are five nice little Indian children now attending and I would recommend the paying of some contribution (ten or fifteen dollars to be divided between the teacher and the trustees) for the use of the school. The teacher, the boy over 55 white children was in favor of the Indian children and finds them as clean, neat, bright and well-behaved as any of the others.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn [illegible] Donald\nOttawa, January 5, 1915.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nIndian Superintendent McDonald, Prince Edward Island, wrote the Department sometime ago about some Indian children residing at Rocky Point who wished to attend the white school there. He has been in correspondence with the Department of Education, Charlottetown, and it appears that the trustees object to having Indian children in their school. There is no other place for them to go and I would like to know whether the Department could compel the school to receive them. These Indians live on a small reserve of three acres which was purchased for them at Rocky Point and during the winter time there are only a few children on the reserve, not enough to justify the Department in establishing a school for them. The Department is willing to pay for their tuition and supply them with school material and if you will read the correspondence you will see that both our superintendent and the Superintendent of Education are of the opinion that the trustees could be compelled to take them in. I would like to know whether you concur in this opinion or not.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir,\n\nIn further reply to your\n\nletter, I beg to state that I finally\n\nreceived a reply from the Secretary\n\nof the Board of Rocky Point District, confirming\n\ntheir refusal to admit the Indian children\n\nto their school. I answered the letter to\n\nthe Hon. John A. Macdonald, Premier and attorney\n\ngeneral, calling his attention to the fact\n\nthat the district is violating the Public\n\nSchool Act of the Province, and thereby\n\nforfeiting their right to any share of\n\nthe public monies for the support of a\n\nschool for the children of a few.\n\nThe only reason the trustees give is\n\nthat the children come from homes\n\nwhere tuberculosis exists.

The Superintendent of education is of the opinion that the trustees of the district are legally obliged to admit them. On the other hand, the force of their objection, viz., that the children should not be admitted as their parents are tuberculous, seemed reasonable to Senator Murphy who is also a medical doctor.\n\nI asked the Hon. Mr. Mathieson if in the event of the Department of Indian Affairs building a small school house, would the Education Department of the province pay for the services of a teacher. He does not discuss this in his reply. I shall call personally on the Premier shortly and try to arrive at some solution of the difficulty. I feel however that the plea of tuberculous homes, is one which is not enforced in any place with regard to white children. Mr. Mathieson and Mr. Campbell, I am sure tried to induce the ratepayers to admit the children, but they had already taken a stand, and --- they are Scotch.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nFebruary 17th, 1915.\n\nMy dear Father John,\n\nSince receiving your letter of the 26th Dec., I have not at any time lost sight of the matters therein referred to but by personal interviews with the people of the district and with the Education Department have sought to bring about an agreement for the admission of these children, but I regret to say that the opposition has not been overcome and some plan for their separate education will have to be made.\n\nI would be glad to discuss the question with you personally at your convenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J. A. Macdonald, P.P.\nIndian Superintendent,\nGRAND RIVER, Lot 14, P.E.I.\nDepartment of Education\n\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., Feb. 22nd, 1915.\n\nRev. John McDonald,\nGrand River, Lot 14.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry that your letter of some time ago concerning the education of the Indian children residing in Rocky Point Reservation has remained so long unanswered, and I fear that even now after looking into the matter pretty fully I am still unable to offer you a satisfactory solution of the difficulty.\n\nAs I understand the matter, an Indian Reservation has been established at Rocky Point. While the number of Indians residing there permanently is not very large nor the number of children of school age very great, these numbers are increased in summer considerably by transient residents.\n\nThe white people of the District object to the presence in their school of the Indian children chiefly for two reasons. First, because of the prevalence of tuberculosis in the Indian encampment and the unsanitary condition of the Indian homes the close association of the Indian children with the other children of the District might be a menace to the health of the community. Second, it is claimed that the responsibility for the education of the Indian children living on a Government Reservation rests with the Indian Department and not with the school District which may happen to be near the Reservation.\n\nAfter giving the matter careful consideration I do not think that the Education Department, though desirous that Indian children should have the very best educational facilities possible, would be justified in trying to compel the school authorities at Rocky Point to admit to the privileges of their school the Indian children living\nDepartment of Education\n\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., 191\n\non a Government Reservation.\n\nI regret that I have no better suggestion to make than that, if the Indian Department cannot make some suitable arrangement with the school trustees for the admission of Indian children, an Indian school should be established at Rocky Point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose letter received from the Superintendent of Education dealing with the education of Indian children at Rocky Point.\n\nThe matter seems to be settled as far as the local authorities are concerned.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe question of affording educational facilities for the Indian children residing at Rocky Point, Prince Edward Island, has been before the Department for some time. There is a small reserve there of three acres, which was purchased from Mr. Newson to accommodate two Indian families who had been stopping there for the past thirty years. There is a white school adjacent to the reserve and application was made to the trustees to permit the few Indian children to attend this school. The trustees refused and the matter was brought to the attention of the Prince Edward Island government. Hon. Mr. Matheson, Attorney General for the province, took the matter up personally and had an interview with the people of the district and the Education Department and has tried to bring about an agreement for the admission of these children, but he was unable to overcome the opposition of the white settlers. He is of the opinion that some plan for the separate education of these children will have to be made.\n\nRev. Father McDonald, Indian Superintendent, has just\njust forwarded a letter received by him from the Superintendent of Education for the province, in which he states that he is unable to offer any satisfactory solution of the difficulty, as he does not think they would be justified in trying to compel the school authorities there to admit Indian children to the school.\n\nThe chief objection of the white settlers is that the Indian children come from tubercular surroundings. During the summer time a number of Indians camp on this reserve and judging from the correspondence they are not an acquisition to the place, as they live in a very primitive manner and take no sanitary precautions. These visitors are from the Morell Reserve and as long as they come there nothing much can be done to improve conditions.\n\nThere are not enough Indian children resident on the three acre reserve to justify the Department in establishing a school and it would be cheaper and more to the children's advantage to place them in some residential school, if one could be found on the Island. I would suggest that Mr. Superintendent McDonald be asked if there is an institution of the kind which would accept them and, if so, on what terms.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 8, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a communication received by you from the Superintendent of Education of Prince Edward Island in further reference to the schooling of certain Indian children residing on the Rocky Point Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as there is no prospect of an arrangement being entered into with the trustees of the white school for the education of these Indian children, the Department would like to know whether there is a residential school in the province where these children could be placed and, if so, on what terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As your united efforts have failed to overcome the objection of the whites to the co-education of Indian children in their school, the Department has written to Father McDonald asking him to find out whether there is any residential school in the province where the children could be received and, if so, on what terms.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Campbell, B.E.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\nSir,\n\nIf funds sufficient were available I would like to see a small school house erected on the Reserve at Rocky Point.\n\nThere are seven or eight pupils that permanently derive of the benefits of education. A school building could be built and a teacher could be obtained for about $200. a year. It would be cheaper than to have them sent away for education and more instructively, as most of the children would be too young to be sent to boarding schools, nor sent to board where other schools. The school building could be erected on the three acres of land near the houses. Besides the permanent resident there are always many other children coming there with their parents. The school could be also used for religious instruction on Sundays.\n\nJohn Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\nSept. 15 1915.\n\nRev. J. A.

She also informs me that there is a man on the reserve (by name Peter Scully, quite an Indian name) who is a fairly good scholar and would teach there for the term if you could get him a small salary from the government. Alice herself will supply the house. Do the best you can to get them in to school as soon as you can.\n\nYours Truly,\nMaurice Mc Donald.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the question of education for the Indian children at Rocky Point I beg to enclose a letter received from the priest in charge of Ch Down parish\u2014Rev Maurice McDonald.\n\nI know Peter Skully to be a very intelligent Indian and with a very fair education. I did not receive any reply to my recommendation of a suitable school house there if the sum of $500 is under consideration. If Peter Skully were allowed at least $400 or $500 a week and make use of the parlor of Miss Mitchell's house for the present it would be a good move and do until such time as a school could be built.\n\nI feel confident that the clergy of the cathedral in Ch Down would state a special interest in assisting Mr. Skully to set to work teaching. Of course provision would have to be made for books & stationery for the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn A. Smith\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn further reference to the report on the fact of the Indian Children residing at Rocky Point, I beg to say that this question has been before the Department for some time and as the trustees of the white school in the neighbourhood object to have Indian children there, Rev. Father McDonald, Assistant Indian Superintendent, was asked to find out if there was any residential school in the Province where they could be received and, if so, on what terms. He now replies that he considers the children there to be too young to be sent to boarding school. He encloses a letter of Rev. Maurice McDonald, who is in charge of the parish in which Rocky Point is situated, recommending that an Indian, named Peter Scully, with a fair education, would be willing to start a school if he were allowed a small salary of $20.00 a month and he could have the use of a room in the house of Alice Mitchell, an Indian woman at Rocky Point. Superintendent McDonald says that he feels confident that the clergy of the Cathedrals\nin Charlottetown would take a special interest in assisting Mr. Scully in conducting this school.\n\nAs the experiment would cost very little, I would suggest that he be given a trial.\n\n[Signature]\nSupplies for the Rocky Point School - To be sent to\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. Maurice McDonald, priest in charge of Charlottetown parish, in reference to the question of education for the Indian children at Rocky Point, in which he states that there is a man on the reserve, named Peter Scully, who is a fairly good scholar and would teach there for a small salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as a room in Alice Mitchell's house can be used for school purposes, the Department has decided to give a school at this point a trial and Peter Scully may be placed in charge. He will be paid for his services at the rate of $20.00 a month for the teaching months.\n\nA small quantity of school material is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be sent to your address and if further supplies are required you will be good enough to forward a requisition to the Department in the usual way. A supply of blank requisition forms is being sent you herewith. You may purchase nine slates for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI opened the school in Rockin Point in a room in Colonel Mitchell's house. There are no desks and the children cannot practice writing. I am taking on myself to take some of the second-hand desks that were in the school house at Lacarry Island and were replaced by better ones. I stored the old ones and they will now be useful.\n\nHowever, we will need a stove fuel and some stationery. I am applying for some other books as some of the children attended school elsewhere and need some more advanced books and story books.\n\nFather Maurice M. Dumas who lives near is taking a great interest in the school and asked others of the Old Town clergy I am making a requisition in regard to form for the school material.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 5, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo stating that you opened the school at Rocky Point in a room in Alice Mitchell's house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in taking some of the second hand desks that were in the Lennox Island School and placing them in this room is approved.\n\nYou may purchase a suitable stove to heat the room the school is held in and also a sufficient quantity of fuel to last the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev.

Any applications you receive for the position should be forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Scully's remarks in reference to building a school-house I beg to say that the Department has no funds available at the present time for the erection of school buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. John A. McDonald,\nIndian Superintendent,\nGrand River,\nLot 14, P.E.I.\nSir,\n\nI visited the school at Rocky Point and found the school well conducted. There were only four pupils present, other pupils had a cold or were absent. The school and several appearances of the pupils were very clean.\n\nIn place of Peter Skelly I would suggest that Matilda Laboie of Lemon Island would be capable of taking charge though she has no license. She was a couple of years a boarder in the convent at Diginish and frequently written to the Department in connection with the house which was built for her parent Mr. & Mrs. Neil Laboie.\n\nOf course we could get a white teacher for the $200 allowed, but as the children are young and will soon know their language it would perhaps be better\n\nIndian Superintendent\nOttawa, March 22, 1916.\n\nRev.

They built a little school house and now are claiming $175.00 from the Department for it. Louis Mitchell and Peter Skully constitute themselves trustees and made matters worse. Matilda Latrobe, the girl who was teaching had a hard time. She started to board with Louis Mitchell and found the board poor also. Louis' children were tubercular. She left there and went to board at Alice Mitchell's. This gave great offense to Louis and Peter Skully. As you see by enclosed letters they state that she left the school. I went down last week to investigate and induced Miss Latrobe to go back to the school. I consulted Father Maurice McDaniel of the Cartier and found it was not true that Matilda left. She changed boarding house only and they looked the school and refused to let her enter. Peter Skully wanted to get back teaching but he is not very well educated. I concluded that it would be well to close the school altogether for the present as they cannot agree among themselves. I would recommend that Louis Mitchell be not paid as junior and that Matilda Latrobe be paid for one month. She taught three weeks and had the trouble and expense of being back last week about 80 miles.\n\nI enclose Skully's letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, November 13, 1916.\n\nRev.

Unless Miss Laube will remain in charge or some other suitable teacher secured the school will have to remain closed.\n\nYou should also inform the Indians that the Department is not prepared to pay the $175.00 for the school building which they erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I believe he would rather let the family starve than change his mind. He actually allowed a boy to die a couple of years ago rather than have it. Redwell attired. I wrote to Peter Smith that he need not change the school hours as I do not think Lewis has any sheep in portion of the reserve at Rocky Point.\n\nI have written Matilda Latrobe to go down and teach. I would suggest that the school then remain open for a part of the summer on account of so much lost time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\nOttawa, June 1, 1917.\n\nRev.

If she accepts the position the school should be re-opened at once and remain open during the summer so long as the attendance will justify. Kindly advise the Department as to whether she takes charge of this school and, if so, the date on which it is re-opened.\n\nIn reference to Lewis Mitchell, who objects to the school and has one child of school age, I beg to say that if this school is re-opened and he refuses to send his child to school action should be taken against him under section 7 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

In order to keep the school running I asked Mr. Mitchell to allow his daughters, Mary and Agnes Mitchell who has been for two years in the Mississaugas Convent to take charge of that school and the Department would send his younger daughter, Rachel to the convent in her place. I have not received a reply as yet.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Sept. 7, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing the report of Matilda Labobe covering the period which she taught the Rocky Point Day School for the quarter ending June 30th last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were advised in official letter of July 6th last, the cheque for $25, being amount of salary due, was sent to Miss Labobe. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mary Mitchell as teacher of this school and will pay her a salary at the rate of $25 per month for her services. You should arrange with Miss Mitchell to take up her duties at this school as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to your request that the Department pay fees for Rachel Mitchell to attend the Mississauga Convent to replace her sister Mary Agnes I beg to say that your suggestion cannot be approved.

If there is a sufficient number of Indian children to attend, it is considered that it would be in their interest to continue the school during the winter months. You may, therefore, use your discretion in this matter and if you consider it advisable you can instruct the teacher to continue her duties.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department as to what arrangements you make regarding the carrying on of the work during the winter months.\n\nRegarding the school at Lennox Island, I beg to say that the holidays may be taken as arranged during January and February.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The residents of the district began finding fault with her and after Miss Mitchell's resignation they signed a unanimous petition to have Peter V. Labbe appointed. As Mr. Labbe had a good education and was licensed I asked him to take charge of the school. Owing to a union among the teachers of the province and the notice of a strike it did not seem possible to secure any other teacher. There are actually 70 schools under the provincial board without teachers. I therefore thought it best to place Peter V. Labbe in charge of Rocky Point School. I instructed Miss Mitchell and Mr. Labbe to fill in the quarterly report for the number of days they each taught.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 16, 1920\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in which you report the resignation of Miss Mitchell as teacher of the Rocky Point Indian Day School at the end of July last, and that Peter H.

Mrs Marr who was formerly the teacher there, before her marriage was Matilda Labobe. She was very poor at Lennox Island and agreed to go down and take the school at Rocky Point. She was very attentive and was the best liked of all the teachers who had that school. Her husband however was not fond of steady work left the burden of supporting on her. Her mother went with her to look after the house when she was in school but she also left her. When John J. Sark had the vacation from the middle of July till the middle of August she also applied for the same which I granted.\n\nThe reason was that she was to become a mother again and she had a baby at that time. With her two young children it was impossible for her to remain any longer as her mother had left her hence the reason for leaving the school. She has gone to Nova Scotia with her husband who belongs there. She wishes the cheque for her two months salary to be sent to Alice Mitchell, Rocky Point, P.E.I.\n\nIn looking for a teacher for that school now I do not know the exact amount of salary allowed. Is it $40.00 a month? $25.00 as regular pay and $15.00 for the bonus? It will be difficult to get a teacher as some of the public schools are closed for scarcity of teachers but I may get one who has not completed her course.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, September 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing the quarterly report of the Rocky Point Day School up to the end of August, last.\n\nThis is being returned herewith, in order that the teacher can fill in the columns of the return under the heading of \"Attendance\". It is impossible to arrive at the amount of salary due, as the number of days the school was open is not stated on the return. If Mrs. Marr gave up her duties the middle of July and did not teach since that time she would only be entitled to payment for the actual number of days taught during the month of July.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to obtain the services of a suitable teacher to carry on the work at this school, in order that the children will not be deprived of an education. The amount of salary allowed would depend upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses. If the teacher secures some professional qualifications, the amount of salary allowed would be at the rate of $25.00 a month, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. You should give the matter of securing a new teacher your prompt consideration and the name, age and full particulars as to any qualifications which the teacher possesses should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nKindly have the enclosed return completed as requested and forward it to the Department as soon as possible, in order that the amount of salary and bonus due Mrs. Marr can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. John A. McDonald,\nIndian Superintendent,\nGrand River,\nLot 14,\nP.M.I.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

As stated in your letter, the only solution is to send the cheque for the actual number of days taught and send the cheque to Alice Mitchell Rocky Point as Mrs Marr requested.\n\nI am sorry for Mrs Marr for the children & liked her and sent the children regularly to school. It will be difficult to secure the services of a teacher at present. Miss Mitchell who formerly taught there is in the convent preparing herself for teaching again and it will do her good. She has the offer of a school after Christmas in New Brunswick where Jacob Sark is now teaching. She did not get along well at Rocky Point and her parents wished to have her away from there. I shall go to Rocky Point on Tuesday next and may find Denis Peters suitable to teach. It is impossible to get a white teacher as several schools are closed with salaries of $60.00 a month. I shall report as soon as I return from there.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir,\n\nI have secured the services of an ex-soldier as teacher in the Indian school at Rocky Point. His name is J. Henry Sepier. After his dismissal or rather discharge from the army he took up vocational training and spent one year in Montreal attending general education and he was for a year a pupil of John J. Clark at Lennox Island. He is a good writer and reader and well advanced in all the branches especially arithmetic. I think he will make a good teacher for the young children attending the school at Rocky Point. He is about 24 years of age and a very good character of a man. I have really written to him to take charge of the school in case he should go away before I get formal permission from the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 30, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you inform the Department that you have obtained the services of J. Henry Sepier, a returned soldier, as teacher of the Rocky Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Sepier, with salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. While he has no professional qualifications as a teacher, it is considered, in view of your recommendation regarding the qualifications he possesses, that he will be satisfactory to carry on the work at this school. You will be good enough to inform him of his appointment. It is hoped that he will meet with every success in his work. The date on which he begins duties should be stated by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. John A. McDonald,\nIndian Superintendent,\nGrand River,\nLot 14, P.E.I.\nR. J. Ledwell, M.D.\n\n107 Richmond Street\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nNovember 17, 1920.\n\nRev. J. A. McDonald,\nIndian Commissioner,\nGrand River, P. E. I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few days ago J. H. Sapier, Indian, returned soldier and a teacher in the Indian school, applied to me for treatment. I telephoned Dr. Garrison, and he informs me that Sapier's case is one of arrested tuberculosis. However, I find upon examination that some metabolic change is going on. He is carrying a temperature and suffering from a severe pain in his right side.\n\nToday I communicated with Dr. Jenkins, and am informed that he is drawing a full pension as a T.B. Therefore, I consider it quite indiscreet that he should be given the school at Rocky Point, in his own interest as well as in the interest of the colony. The conditions of the school are not hygienic or sanitary. Therefore, I would advise that he be given some other occupation, or be returned to some institution for treatment. In segregating this man you may protect others.\n\nAs you know, a landmark has passed away in the person of Louis.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDr. Ledwell wants to have J. H. Sepier prevented from teaching in the school at Rocky Point. He has made himself very busy in this matter. He consulted with Dr. Garrison who had charge of the hospital for tuberculous patients and states the case is one of arrested tuberculosis. The case of John J. Sark is similar and there are many such cases in the public schools of this province. I leave it to the judgement of the Department what to do in this case. He states that he had Joseph Scully taken to the Charlottetown for an operation. He is not on the Hospital staff.\n\nJohn A. McDonald,\nIndian Supt.\nRocky Point, P.E.I., Island,\nApril 12th, 1921\n\nTo the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a cheque for quarter ending March 31st, dated April 9th, No. 3974, amount $50.00 full payment for the quarter.\n\nIn which I have lost 19 days due to illness during the time school was closed, will it be necessary to make up time? or shall I refund the amount?\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.H. Levis.\nOttawa, April 16, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the amount of salary which you received for the December quarter last, for the period you taught the Rocky Point Indian Day School during that quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that salary was not deducted for the time you closed school on account of illness. It will not be necessary to make up the time lost through your illness.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. H.

I have to request that you will state on the return the reason this school was open for only 23 days. You should also state the number of days for which you consider the teacher should be paid.\n\nThe Department will expect full information, in order that we may be in a position to decide what salary should be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

McDonald,\nGrand River Lot 14.\n\nDear Father,\n\nEnclosed is my quarterly report. I have closed the school on the 30th.\n\nKindly let me know if it is beyond my authority to dismiss a pupil from the school for any reason.\n\nMy last payment has been delayed for about 3-1/2 weeks and was sent to Mr. Stewart and Mr. Lloyd. So I wish you could get it through directly addressed to Rocky Point.\n\nI will communicate to you before I reopen the school as it is my intention to be away somewhere.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.H. Lewis.\nSir,\n\nI enclose the reports for the schools of this inspectorate for the quarter ending June 30, 1922.\n\nThe teacher at Rocky Point notified me that he was obliged to dismiss from the school one of the pupils and that the father then withdrew his other children from the school and he was for two days without any pupils and then he had only one and he did not think it worth while to keep the school open for the sake of one pupil only. I instructed him to close the school for the summer months. The same school was closed for the two months of vacation in mid winter.\n\nI also called his attention to the fact that in a school in which there are so few pupils it seemed to me that he should be able to conduct it without resorting to such drastic measures as expelling a pupil. He replies by asking if it is beyond his authority to expel a pupil. I have not been there recently and was unable to make any enquiry as to the nature of the pupil's offense. He asks if he can dismiss a pupil and I would like to have the advice of the Department before answering this question.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 7, 1922\nOttawa, July 18, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing the June Quarter Returns from the schools in your Inspectorate, as well as a communication from the teacher of the Rocky Point Indian Day School regarding the dismissing of an unruly pupil.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that the teacher should be able to conduct this school without having recourse to such drastic action as expelling a pupil. He should have referred this case to you, with full particulars, before taking any action to dismiss the pupil in question.\n\nWe would like to have a full report from the teacher at a later date, giving his reasons for the action he took. The name and age of the child suspended should also be given.\n\nTeachers have no authority to expel pupils without obtaining the sanction of the Department, except in cases of gross breaches of discipline or on grounds of immorality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacKenzie\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is a matter which I should like to bring to your attention.\n\nThe Peter Society of St. Andrews built an orphanage at the Rocky Point Reserve and paid for everything but the building. This was in the year of 1914. It taught children there for two years 1914-1915.\n\nPeter L. MacKenzie taught for three months after that. Since then for six months, Mary Agnes Mitchell for three months, James McKeen for six months, since which time all children left the reserve.\n\nMr. MacKenzie felt that this school showed him how best for his summer home, but it was torn down in 1935 by Martin Mitchell.\n\nThe society is now seeking re-investment for the erection of this school. Kindly advise me what can be done in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nReid MacKenzie\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you state that you have received a request from Peter Scully for reimbursement of an expenditure which he claims he made in the erection of a school on the Rocky Point Reserve.\n\nOur files have been carefully reviewed and there is nothing to show that Peter Scully was authorized to erect a school building at Rocky Point. We paid several accounts in connection with the building that was used for school purposes. I think it can be presumed that if Scully had spent any large amount he would have requested payment before this time.

He will be informed that you have been authorized to make this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Virginie Dionne,\nTeacher,\nEdmundston School,\nEdmundston, N.B.\nOttawa, December 11, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss Dionne, teacher of the Edmundston Day School, has been authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $5.00 in the purchase for prizes for the pupils attending her school and she has been instructed to send the account to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. E. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N.B.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDec 11th 1911\n\nSir,\n\nWould you please allow me to incur an expenditure of $5.00 for a treat to the Edmundston School for Xmas, something similar to the Indian Point School.\n\nYours,\n\nE. Baxter\nLast term there were 13 children enrolled and for that number of children the building was large enough. Since then two other families have been added to the reserve with a consequent increase in the number of the children attending school, and now the building is too small to hold them comfortably. If this attendance is kept up there will be need for the Department to erect a suitable building.\n\nThe Playgrounds are inadequate.\n\nOwing to contracted quarters the calisthenics exercises are not able to take place in the school room and unless the weather is favourable, cannot take place outside, which I consider a drawback to the general health and development physically of the children, as where these exercises are regularly given much good results.\n\nJno. J. Ryan\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, January 5, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Edmundston Indian Day School in which you deal with the accommodation I beg to say that the information in the possession of the Department shows that this school-room is 18 by 20, providing thereby accommodation for twenty-three pupils. The returns from this school for the past three quarters show that the average attendance has been respectively 11, 12 and 16 and the highest enrolment has been 21. Under the circumstances the Department does not consider that it should be necessary to take any steps to erect a new building at the present time. It is granted that the calisthenics cannot be taken in the school-room when the full enrolment is present, but in any event whenever possible these exercises should be taken out of doors.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn from your report on this school that such satisfactory work is being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. J. Ryan,\nBupt. of Indian Schools,\nSt. Mary's Ferry, N.B.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct 26 | Paid Captain Sims, repairing windows & banking school house. | $90 |\n| Oct 31 | Paid Capt.

P. Wright\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nWhen looking over Edmonton Reserve I noticed gravel land near the schoolhouse site and I have an idea a concrete wall or foundation could be put under schoolhouse that framed the cellar and probably as cheap. A stone wall would not be well to put a cellar under schoolhouse in case you might want to install a furnace. The cellar could be used for storing the wood in. An inquiry is made if any payments will be made on school building work progressed. The carpenters say they would find it difficult to do out 10% with tenderance then to buy material and wait until building is completed before obtaining any pay can arrangement be made to be paid something as work progresses.\n\nYou have not replied to my letter asking what arrangement may make me for land for site and schoolhouse.\n\nI am obediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I am sending you, under separate cover, copies of the plans and specifications for the erection of a day school building on the Edmundston Indian Reserve.

Gagne, Edmundston, for $2,450.50\n\nThe undersigned would recommend, pursuant to the requirements of subsection 2, of section 36, of the Public Works Act, that the contract for the work be awarded to the lowest tenderor Mr. L. Gagne for the amount of his tender as above quoted namely, $2,450.50, it being reported by the Architect of the Department who examined the plans and specifications that this tender is fair and reasonable.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nTenders for erection of day school, Edmundston Reserve, New Brunswick.\n\nA rented building belonging to an Indian has been in use for school purposes on this Reserve, but it is considered advisable to have a proper building owned by the Department. Money is available for the purpose from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nThe Architect of the Department who was instructed to report with regard to the tenders states that the price of $2,450.00 is fair and reasonable.\n\nIndian Affairs, July 31, 1913.\nWHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT BEAVER BOARD\n\nDescription: Beaver Board is used chiefly for the place of lath, plaster and other wall materials for building materials. Because of its superior surface for decorating, it makes wallpaper unnecessary. It is made of wood pulp, which is mixed with water and pressed into panels. Beaver board reduces the need for lath and plaster, making walls easier to paint and maintain.\n\nApplication: Beaver Board is nailed to the studs of new rooms or directly over the lath and plaster of old rooms. The panels are easily cut with a fine tooth saw, sharp knife or chisel.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Beaver Board does not chip, crack or disintegrate.\n2. It makes rooms appear larger and more spacious.\n3. It improves with age; never needs repainting.\n4. It is easy to install.\n\nSizes: Dealers carry Beaver Board in 3', 4', 5', 6', 7', 8' and 10' widths by 4', 5', 6', 7', 8' lengths.\n\nDecoration: Beaver Board can be painted or stained to match existing decor. It can also be used as a base for wallpaper or other finishes.\n\nAccessories: Accessories such as trim, molding, plate rail, etc., can be purchased from local dealers.\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (RG 10, volume 6626, File 66-1-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI understand Mr. Philbert, your agent, has tendered for school building at Edmonton, with his certified cheque for the sum required. I am told he is a competent man, being a good carpenter and one that looks carefully after the work. I am not at all clear how I would be justified in refusing him for the contract. Some days ago, in regard to employing Mr. J.M. Richards as an agent, as he has handled building material for a good many years and has put up a good many buildings in the last five or six years, he is well fitted to undertake the work. I am enclosing a description of the Board Walls of the well to substitute in place of lath and plaster, for the school build, and see its manufacture at Ottawa, you can easily learn about the material at a reasonable price. It would be a warrant and durability it would be ahead of plaster and cement.\n\nOur obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| June 30 | To Paid Capt.

Kindly take care of these as the Department has a very limited number of them.\n\nMr. Waite states that you consider that the proportion of cement in the foundation is rather small. If the materials are first-class, and you should see that they are, the proportion authorized should be sufficient. If, however, the contractor is willing to make this foundation in the proportion of one of cement, two of sand and four of stone you may have him do so.\n\nThe contractor has not yet sent in the contract properly executed and no authority has been given to start his work. This contract was returned to him on August 19, last, and should have been in the hands of the Department before this.

The door was broken last spring and the teacher then reported the matter to Mr. Waite who promised to have it repaired, but the matter was never attended to.

Miss Michaud states that she can get the man who built the school to repair it, if the Department will pay for the repairs. I have today written Miss Michaud to have this man repair the door immediately and to send me his bill for same in duplicate, and I trust that this will be satisfactory to the Department, and that they will give me authority to have the repairs made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

It is desired to direct your attention in this connection to your letter of the 2nd March and the Department's reply of the 6th of that month. You reported that Miss Michaud of the Edmundston School asked to have the door of the building repaired, and the Department authorized the work. Nothing was said in the matter with regard to repairing furniture, and it is not understood why a charge for the same should be made in the account which you have submitted for payment.

Richards for supplies furnished the Edmundston day school.\n\nApparently no authority had been granted by the Department for these purchases. This account has been paid but, in future, it must be distinctly understood that no purchase should be made without first obtaining the Department's authority.\n\nYou will be good enough to immediately notify the teacher of this school accordingly, as unauthorized accounts will not be paid in future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN.J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth, N.B.\nSir,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\n\nIt will be obliging if you will make this matter clear to me, so that I will understand just what authority I have in matters of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 25th inst., re. voucher No. 338 amounting to $6.53 in favor of T. M. Richards for supplies furnished to the Edmundston day school and note your remarks re. same. You ask me to notify the teacher that unauthorized accounts will not be paid in future. I beg to advise you that I authorized this expenditure when I was at Edmundston some time ago, but possibly omitted writing you re. same. If at any time I should be in Edmundston or the teacher should write me from there wanting school supplies, or if the teacher from the Tobique Reserve should do likewise, as I not to grant permission to get the things that are absolutely necessary for the school at once without writing to Ottawa first? It would seem to me to be almost unnecessary that a man be appointed as Indian agent, if a three or four dollar expenditure is wanted hurriedly, that he cannot give the order without first writing away consulting the Dept. If this is the case I don't understand why an agent would be necessary at all, as the school teacher or whoever might want the goods could write direct to the Dept. and get permission direct from them.\nI beg to advise you that certain repairs are necessary on the school house at Edmonton. There are four panes of glass broken in the windows and one in the front door, the one in the front door being broken recently by the wind. I also wish to advise you that the closets were damaged by the frost last winter and require repair. The doors cannot be kept closed and the hinges are broken.

Original on 102408/6.\n\nThe school requires painting inside and the out houses white washed and repaired.\n\nThe school also requires a good washing and the grounds should be better cared for.\nOttawa, July 19, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Edmundston Indian Day School, states that the inside of the school requires to be painted and that the outhouses should be repaired and whitewashed. He also states that the floor of the schoolroom requires a good washing and that the woodwork inside should also be cleaned. He states that the grounds should be better cared for.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to obtain an estimate of the cost of having the inside walls of the school alabastined and the woodwork painted, also the outhouses whitewashed and the necessary repairs made. You should give this matter your prompt attention and forward the price you obtain for having this work done at an early date, in order that, if it is decided to go ahead with the work, it may be done during the present summer holidays.\n\nYou should at once take steps to have the floor and woodwork cleaned and also to have the ground around the school building cleaned up. The washing of the floor and woodwork and the cleaning of the grounds should be done at the lowest possible expense.\n\nThe Department will expect an early reply as to the cost of the painting and whitewashing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. J. Wootten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 66-1-5 of the 19th inst. regarding the Edmundston Indian Day School. I have been to Edmundston, and looked over the school, and find that school ceiling requires re-painting, and the walls need to be slubastined. The woodwork does not require any painting, but just a good cleaning. The out-houses need to be white-washed, and considerable repairs are also necessary. I have endeavored to get an estimate from different parties at Edmundston for doing the work, but could get only one man to furnish an estimate. His name is Honors [illegible], and he has agreed to give the ceiling of the school-room, the two coat-rooms, and the entrance, two coats of white paint, and to re-paint and calamine the walls, also to replace all broken glass in the windows of the school-room, and to repair the back door of the school, and to white-wash the two out-houses, repair the steps of same, also two doors and seat covers, also to furnish a new lock for the back door of the school house. He is to furnish all other material necessary for doing this work for the sum of $160.00. I think his estimate is a reasonable one, and I have been informed that he is a very reliable man and has the reputation of doing good work in a very satisfactory manner; therefore I trust that you will advise me by return mail as to whether you want the work done or not, as he will have to plan the other work so as to go to work on the school on the Reserve as soon as possible.\nSir,\n\nI have also made arrangements with Mrs. Noel Bernard to wash all the floors and all the woodwork in the school after the other work is completed, for the sum of $4.00.\n\nRegarding the cleaning of the grounds I will say that the grounds are not in a very bad condition, with the exception that there is some hay that requires cutting. I have arranged with Mr. Fred Michaud, of Edmundston, to clean up the ground for the privilege of cutting the hay that is on it. I trust that this will prove to your satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nNJW/MA\nOttawa, July 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of re-painting the school ceiling, having the walls alabastined, white washing the outhouses and making the repairs required at the Edmundston Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Honore Picard to do this work. He should furnish all the material required and do the work and the cost of the same should not exceed the estimate furnished by you, namely, $160.00. You should oversee the work and see that it is performed in a satisfactory manner. As soon as it is completed to your satisfaction you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the work. Painting and repairs enumerated by you should be carried out during the present school vacation in order that the school will be ready for occupation on the re-opening after the summer holidays.\n\nThe arrangements that you have made with Mrs. Noel Bernard to wash the floors and woodwork in the school after the other work is completed is satisfactory and you may furnish a voucher when she has done the work for an amount not to exceed your estimate of $4.00.\n\nIt is noted that you have made arrangements to have the hay cut on the school grounds and that this work will be done for the privilege of removing the hay. This arrangement is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. A. Wooten, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth,\nN.

Wait, Indian Agent, of Andover, N.B., came to Edmundston, and requested me to go with him down on the Indian Reserve, for the purpose of purchasing land from one Joseph Tremblay Indian, one acre and half acres of land, for the erection of the Indian School House, on the same having been purchased for, I went down to the Indian Reserve with Mr. Wait, and in my presence, the acre & half was purchased at $50. per acre, making $75. The Agent asked me to give the Indian Joe Tremblay $5.00, on act of purchase money, and I did so. The old Indian told the Agent Mr. S.P. Wait, that he was very poor at that time, and required something to eat, so the Agent authorized me to pay the old Indian for the land, he sold to the department, so the old Indian kept taking for his family and himself until the $75 was all taken up. I sent a bill of items to the Agent and I received from the Agent an act of land purchase, $10.00 leaving a balance due me on land purchase of $65.00.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory.\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.M.

I forwarded him the cheque last August at time of purchase of land. The balance was due Mr. Richards at $5.00 for which please send cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nPay 35.98\nOttawa, 10th February, 1914.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant and previous correspondence regarding the land purchased from Joseph Trombly for a school site on the Edmundston Reserve, I beg to say the account for $65.00 which you submitted from Mr. T. M. Richards, the contractor, for payment made to Joseph Trombly can not be considered, as the deed for the school site (1\u00bd acres of land) has not been completed. You were informed in the Department's letter of the 11th August last that upon the completion of the deed Joseph Trombly would be paid the balance ($65.00) due from the land. According to Mr. Richards' report, when you visited the Edmundston Reserve on the 14th August last you did not carry out the Department's instructions to pay Trombly, on account, the $10.00 sent you for him, but you gave instructions, it is understood, to Mr. Richards to furnish provisions to the Indians, and you paid to the latter the amount due Trombly. You were not justified in your action. The cheque should have been given to Joseph Trombly when he signed the agreement to sell. It is also understood that you authorized Mr. Richards to issue relief to Joseph Trombly on account of his purchase money, and it is understood from Mr. Richards that the amount has been fully used up. The land belonged to\n\nS. P. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAndover, N. B.\nto the Indian, and when the deed is completed Joseph Trombly is entitled to payment of the balance due, namely, $65.00. Mr. Richards can not be recognized by the Department in the transaction. It is necessary for you to explain why you requested Mr. Richards to pay the Indian $5.00 on account when you had in your possession a cheque for $10.00 due the Indian, and why at a later date you handed this cheque over to Mr. Richards. The money should not have been placed in the merchant's hands, particularly in view of the fact that the Indian is a responsible, sober man, and can manage his own affairs, and also is entitled, as above stated, to receive payment for his land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter, I am obliged to inform you that Mr. Richards has not yet paid me the balance due. I have already written to Mr. Richards requesting him to pay me promptly. I understand that Mr. Richards has been away on business and will be back soon. I am confident that he will honor his obligations.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the agreement between Mr. Richards and myself, which was signed last week. It outlines the terms of our arrangement and I trust that Mr. Richards will adhere to them.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nSir,\n\nOn my return from Edmonton I found Cheque for $10.00 payable to Mr. Joseph Richards. I endorsed Cheque and sent it to Mr. Richards in Edmonton. Since then, Mr. Joe has paid me $5.00 in addition to what he had paid him and has also endorsed Cheque and also wrote Joe to sign agreement. It seems Mr. Joe continued to draw for six weeks. He got his pay or land in full and Mr. Richards showed himself. I may say I know Mr. Joe for years and I know he's not truthful and I fear you send him Cheque he will not pay Mr. Richards and it would not be fair to give him any more for his land and give him a chance to cheat Mr. Richards out of the land and I do not think it is right to let him do it. I understand Mr. Maclean had completed work forwarded by Mr. Richards. It appears somebody has been giving you wrong information about Mr. Richards perhaps he has written somebody seems to be assisting officer in a scheme to cheat Mr. Richards. I would advise Cheque be sent to Mr. Richards as per October 9th.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nOttawa\nThis Indenture made this Third day of October in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirteen\n\nBETWEEN Joseph Tremblay of Edmundston, in the County of Madawaska and Province of New Brunswick, Indian,\n\nof the first part; and\n\nHis Majesty the King, George the Fifth of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, &c.\n\nof the second part;\n\nWITNESSETH, that the said party of the first part\n\nfor and in consideration of the sum of Seventy-five dollars\n\nof lawful money of Canada, to him in hand well and truly paid at or before the ensealing and delivery of these Presents, by the said party of the second part\n\nthe receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged hath granted, bargained, sold, aliened, released, conveyed and confirmed, and by these presents doth grant, bargain, sell, alien, release, convey and confirm unto the said party of the second part his successors and assigns\n\nALL that certain piece or parcel of land and premises situate lying and being in the Indian Reserve, at Edmundston, in the County of Madawaska and Province of New Brunswick, bounded and described as follows:\u2014\n\nBeginning at an iron post on the north side of the Highway Road leading from Edmundston to Grand Falls, thence north fifty-two degrees East for a distance of Three Hundred and Ninety-six (396) feet to another iron post, thence south fifty-eight degrees ten minutes East for a distance of One Hundred and seventy feet to another iron post, thence south fifty-two degrees West for a distance of Three Hundred and ninety-six (396) feet to another iron post or to above mentioned Highway Road, thence north fifty-eight degrees and ten minutes west for a distance of One hundred and seventy feet along said highway road to the place of beginning.

If the description in the first deed was not satisfactory, it was no fault of mine; I had placed in the Deed the description furnished me by the Land Surveyor employed by the Department in this matter.\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Edmundston Indian Day School for the month of May, 1914.\n\nOriginal on File 102408-7\n\nI would recommend that a small sum be appropriated for expense of levelling and grading the grounds and graveling the yard and walks. I cannot say just what it may cost, as cost would depend on amount of gravel required to haul, but would estimate cost from $25.00 to $30.00. Please advise if any or what sum can be expended for improvement of grounds as above.\n\nThe floor will remain stained and dirty unless washed often.

If we had post some 25 or more if used a more generous fence for front. Something similar to \"Royal Lawn Fence\" would cost something more about along the front of lot along the road. If decide to put up fence in spring when next it would be well to arrange for getting the post during the winter. A cheap fence could be put up by using an inferior grade wire but the best is the cheapest in the end. Before fence is put up the ground should be plowed the cellar and graded along the front the cost would probably be $30.00.\n\nI would call your attention to the school grounds at Tobique Reserve.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Sec'ty of Indian affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 1st inst advising me to furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost to raise and drain the school grounds at Edmundston, in connection with the Edmundston school, also to furnish you with an estimate of the probable cost of fencing these grounds. I have been to Edmundston, and gone into the matter as much as I possibly could, and from the condition of the ground, I firmly believe that the cost of raising and draining these grounds would very much exceed what the Department anticipates. Knowing very little about this sort of thing I could not furnish you with an estimate, as I was unable while at Edmundston to get any person who could give me an estimate of the work. No doubt the Government at Ottawa have men who make a business of this sort of thing, and by coming and looking it over could map out the work they want done in an intelligent manner, and I believe have it done more cheaply than a person who knew nothing whatever about it could do, and I believe that it would be a saving to the Department to send a man to look the situation over.\n\nThe teacher is very anxious to do a little farming, and I have given her an order to get some farming implements such as a hoe, spade, and rake also an order for some seed. She thinks that everything together will not exceed from $12.00 to $15.00, and I have given her permission to employ a farmer to plough up a piece of land in the rear of the school so that she can get her gardening done. I trust the Department will approve of my action as the season is getting so late, I could not await a reply from Ottawa before having the work done.\n\nI expect in the course of a few days to be able to furnish you with an estimate for fencing the grounds. It will take about 1500 ft. of wire, as the land is about an acre square.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nIndian Agt.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, in regard to raising and draining the school grounds at Edmundston.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is unable to give any further consideration to this matter until you furnish the estimate of the cost involved.\n\nIn regard to the school garden, the Department, under the circumstances, approves of an expenditure not exceeding $15.00 to purchase implements and seed. The Department wishes it distinctly understood, however, that, in future, you should incur no expenditure without first obtaining authority. When applying for such authority, you should in every case furnish an estimate of the expense to be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.J.

Better results would be had, it is thought, if the money now expended on the teacher's salary were applied to the maintenance of some of the children at the Boarding School.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Lordship\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan & Calgary\nCalgary N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Agent Wilson's report on the Hull Sheila's School for the month of December last; and in reply I beg to say in reference to your marginal note thereon, that His Lordship the Bishop of Calgary and Saskatchewan has written asking that this school be continued until provision has been made for more pupils at the Boarding School, to which the Department replied on the 5th instant that it does not see its way to continue this school unless a much larger attendance than has hitherto been shown can be guaranteed, and that better results would be had if the money expended on the teacher's salary were applied to maintenance of some of these children at the Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina, W.T.\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your lordship's letter of the 17th inst., and to say in reply that although I quite agree with the Department's view that the money now expended on the teacher salary would be better employed in affording the maintenance of children at the Boarding School, yet I would suggest that Bull Shield's school be kept open until such time as accommodation can be found for these children in the homes; as at present we have our full number. Another reason why I would suggest the continuance of this school is that the average attendance is increasing, being for this month 25 Jan 10; and but until accommodation can be found for these little ones, I do most strongly depreciate the idea of closing the school.\n\nYours very faithfully,\nFrank [signature]\nSchofield House\nJune 17, 1895\n\nMy dear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nYesterday I received a letter from Mr. Macdonald regarding the school in Bull Shield Camp.

F. Swainson in further reference to the Day School on Bull Shield's Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that as suggested in your letter of the 21st ultimo, the Department has made provision for 15 more pupils at the Blood Boarding School in the estimates for next year, which will give a total of 56 pupils, being the full number for which there is accommodation at the school according to the report of our Inspector and the Doctor.\n\nThe Department trusts that in view of the proposed increase that there will be no further necessity for continuing the Day School on Bull Shield's Reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nMy Lord,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHis Lordship\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary, N.W.T.\nFebruary 4, 1895\n\nTo Mr. W. H. Macdonald,\n\nSir,\n\nI have received your private information concerning the purchase of 29 cattle at a cost of $16 each, and I am pleased to inform you that the transaction has been completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDear Sir,\n\nHis Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan, Calgary, handed me your letter No. 16626 dated 27 January 1895 at Ottawa in which you say the Department has made provision for 16 more pupils at the Blood Boarding School in the Estimate for next year, which will give a total of 66 pupils, being the full number for which there is accommodation at the school according to the report of our Inspector and the Doctor. So there is not a slight clerical error, there is not need for 66 pupils. In a letter from the Secretary No. 068 dated 12 April 1893 \"the few couples known grant will be paid for each number of boys as may be admitted up to 40 this being the maximum limit, as stated in your letter, signed by D. Kennedy\" and again another letter from the Indian Commissioner No. 21 dated 9 April 1894 \"you may receive up to the number of 25 thus making in all 65 pupils, not 66.\"\n\nYour very faithfully,\n\nFrank Swanson\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the proposed closing of the Bull Shield's School I beg to say that a communication was received from His Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary, covering a letter from the Rev. Mr Swainson suggesting that this school be kept open until accommodation can be found for the pupils at the Blood Boarding School. In reply to which letter His Lordship the Bishop was informed that the Department had made provision for 15 more pupils at the Blood Boarding School for next year, being the full number for which there is accommodation at the school according to the report of our Inspector and the Doctor, and that the Department trusted that in view of the proposed increase that there could not be no further necessity for continuing the Day School on Bull Shield's Reserve. A Copy of Mr Swainson's reply is enclosed herewith, in reference to which I beg to say that Mr Inspector McGibbon's report on the Blood Agency, dated 24th April 1894, on page 37 he states that in the two boy's dormitories at the Boarding School there were 31 beds while Mr Agent Wilson in his report of the 24th April 1893, forwarded by you on the 14th of that month states that \"it was first intended to take 20 girls but upon the advice of Dr Kennedy\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina, N.W.T.\nThe Rev. Principal intends to confine himself to 22 pupils and I think after the full number is received, the home will be full enough. It will therefore be seen that by providing for 30 pupils, the Department has exceeded by 3 pupils the number allowed by these two reports.\n\nThe Department would like you to reply to the Rev. Mr Swainson in this direction and at the same time it would like you to request him to communicate directly with your office, as all correspondence connected with school matters in the Territories is has to be referred to you and by so doing delay would be avoided.\n\nI shall write His Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary in the same direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nNo 116626\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter of the 6th instant, advising me of correspondence with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary and the Rev. Mr. Swainson, relative to the proposed closing of the Bull Shields School in the Blood Agency, and to the provision made in the Estimates for 1895-6 for absorbing the pupils into the Boarding School.\n\nThe Department's impression that the Boarding School has accommodation for only 31 boys seems to have arisen from the statement made by Mr. Inspector McGibbon in his report, page 58, paragraph 216, and page 59, paragraph 217, that there were in the boy's dormitories 14 beds upstairs and 17 beds in the second dormitory, or 31 beds in all.\n\nThe Inspector's additional remark \"but there is room for 20\" in the second dormitory has, it would appear escaped the Department's notice.\n\nIn view of this, and the fact that the dimensions of each dormitory are the same, viz., 32 x 16, it will be seen\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nseen that the two dormitories for boys have accommodation for 40 boys in all.\n\nI may add that as long ago as September 1893 the Rev. Mr. Tims was authorized to admit 40 boys as earners of a $12.00 tuition Grant, 40 being the limit fixed at that time by Doctor Kennedy. At no time however has the enrolment of boys exceeded 29.\n\nAs to the number of girls in the Institution, under authority of Departmental letter of 13th February 1894 No 71138 an enrolment of 25 was permitted on the later estimate of Doctor Kennedy that the Girl's Home would accommodate 26. The requirements of this enrolment of 25 and consequent excess of 3 over the doctor's first estimate of 22 are met as indicated on page 2 of the Department's letter; while the difference of 9 boys, between the 31 for whom provision is made, and the 40 who can be accommodated at the school, is it is thought, explained above.\n\nThe Agent's Report for February 1895 shows an attendance, boys 27, girls 25, in all 52, 40 of whom are earning the $72.00 Grant and 12 the $12.00 tuition Grant.\n\nPending the Department's further instructions the reply directed to be sent to the Rev. Mr. Swainson is being held.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nfor Asst. Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have the pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in further reference to the proposed closing of Bull Shield's School and the drafting of the pupils into the Boarding School, and calling attention to Mr Inspector McTibbon's report on the Boarding School, from which it would appear that there is accommodation in the dormitories for more pupils than the number estimated for; and in reply I beg to say that the Department fears that it cannot increase the number provided for, namely 56, but it will consent to the usual rations, which they would otherwise receive on the Reserve, being supplied to pupils over that number, who may be taken into the school as earners of the tuition grant of $12 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, P.W.T.\nIndian Agents Office, Blood Agency.\n\n2nd April 1895.\n\nI have the honour to ask you for authority to give the Rev Mr Swainson the loan of all the benches belonging to the Bull Shield day school, which was closed on the 31st March last.\n\nMr Swainson says he has not desks enough for the boys in his own school.\n\nShould the Department wish at any time to re-open the school, these benches could be got back.\n\nI have, etc.,\nagd.

That as you have done so without his sanction, and contrary to the terms stated by the Department, he considers it advisable that the school should remain closed until a reply to any communication you wish to make shall have been received from the Regina Office; if you wish to keep the school open on your own responsibility, the Agent will not interfere.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPoveshell\nMany Shat ar School\nOffice of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nRegina, Aug 23rd 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst. enclosing one from Mr. Collins, teacher of the New School at School relative to the grant of the June quarter last.\n\nOn examination of the returns for the four quarters of the present year 1893-4 shows that the holidays exclusive of Saturday & Sunday allowed the school for that period were:\n\n| Quarter       | Days |\n|---------------|------|\n| September     | 1893 | 6    |\n| October       | 1893 | 7    |\n| November      | 1893 | 9    |\n| Total         |      | 22   |\n\nor four days more than the school was entitled to. This arose through an oversight when preparing the voucher in connection with the June 1894 Return, of the fact that an additional four days had been allowed Mr. Collins for the March quarter as well as the grant for that quarter up to $75.00. If the teacher or workers\nthis overpayment to him can be adjusted in connection with his next returns in the event of the school being reopened.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1893-94 the school was open:\n\n- September quarter 1893: 38 days\n- December 1893: 57 days\n- March 1894: 58 days\n- June 1894: 44 days\n\nTotal 199 days.\n\nThe school should therefore have been kept open another 16 days, in all 215 for the year ending June 30th, 1894 in order to draw a $75.00 grant for the last quarter or $300.00 for that year. Owing to there being 53 Saturdays in 1893-94 there were only 215 school days instead of 216.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Callin remarks that he asked for 20 holidays instead of 17 I would quote the following from his return: \"Please count these 17 days as holidays. It is however immaterial as to whether we sent 20 or 17 days since only 5 days were due to him though as stated above 9 were paid for.\"\nIt may here be added that Mr. Collins has in reality been over paid for 7 days holiday, since at the Bull Shield school he had 36 holidays in the first six months of the fiscal year, while only the 33 taken by his predecessor at many stations during that time were deducted from Mr. Collins' allowance of 45 days between July 1st, 1893 and June 30th, 1894.\n\nIt will thus be seen that as far from Mr. Collins having a claim against the Department he is indebted to it to the amount of 7 days' pay or \u00a38.08.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E.

Callison\nMany Shot at School\nNorth River\n\nHandwritten note:\n\nfor agent\nSir,\n\nI forward you herewith some letters received from the Regina office relative to the salary of Mr. Collin, teacher at Blackfoot Reserve School, and as to the closing of the school permanently.\n\nAs to Mr. Collin's salary last quarter was not paid in full\u201461\u00bd times all he received. On inquiry as to the cause, he was informed that he had not \"earned\" it being taken more holidays than the department allowed.\n\nNow the facts are there, as I stated them in a letter to Regina a copy of which I did not keep. In April last, the Indians\nleft the vicinity of the school, and\nthe agent told Mr. Collins to close school\nand keep it open in July, the month\ngenerally taken by teachers here for holidays.\nNow Mr. Collins acted under instructions\nfrom Mr. Agent Keep, and closed school\nwith the intention of opening school in\nJuly as he did for a time, but because\nhe acted under Agent's instructions,\na part of his salary was deducted.\n\nBecause Mr. Collins complained\nhe was told in reply (letter 066, Aug. 23\nfrom Regina to J.A.) that he had been\nas matter of fact overpaid & if he so\nworked the overpayment could be adjusted\nin connection with his next return.\n\n(A letter written in this strain seems\nhardly credible as coming from a\ngovernment office.) That Mr. Collins\nclosed school at his own accord when\nthere were children to be taught, the\nmatter would have been quite diff\nChurch Missionary Society.\n\nI am sure you will see how unjustly Mr. Collins has been treated by the Regina Office and rectify matters. The amount due to Mr. Collins for June quarter is $3.25.\n\nAs regards (a) viz., the closing of Henry Smith's school.\n\nIn July, Mr. Collins attempted to reopen school in camp according to instructions from Regina (0162, 14 Sept. '91 to 25 Oct.) but the weather being so exceedingly hot, the teacher applied for a tent to teach in, and pending a reply to the Agent again gave him instructions to close school. A reply on Sept. he received a communication from the Agent to the effect that as the school was closed it had better remain closed, and the children\nI wrote myself in reply to this communication and said that it was manifestly unfair to discharge Mr. Collins in the middle of a quarter without warning from no fault of his own, and asked that he should receive 6 months notice the time I believe required by law to be given to school teachers.\n\nIf the Dept. does not do something of this kind I shall be obliged to find Mr. Collins his salary out of my own pocket as I nominate him to the Dept. & practically expect him at $300 per ann. for the Dept.\n\nIn response to this came a letter dated Aug. 20. (165 Revise Aug. 20\" to J.A.) stating the Dept. can only pay Mr. Collins what he has earned while...\nteaching; if however he can re-open\nthe school with say 10 pupils, the\nDept. will allow it to be continued\nfor another quarter.\n\nThis is in reply to my letter in which\nI stated that owing to the Dept.'s policy\nof scattering the Indians only 5\nchildren were left in the vicinity\nof the school. And Mr. Collins is\ntold to re-open with 10 pupils.\n\nTaking the letter to mean that he\nmust go on keeping school if he expects\nthis quarter's salary, Mr. Collins\nat once re-opened school. But only\n2 children were at home as the\nrest were away with their people\ncutting hay.\n\nOn Aug. 31st Mr. Collins received\na letter from the D.A. stating\nthat as he had opened the school without\nthe Agent's sanction, and contrary to\nChurch Missionary Society\n\nthe terms stated by the Dept. be considered it advisable that the school should remain closed until a reply to any communication he wished to make should have been received from the Regina Office.\n\nNow Mr. Collin awaits further instructions from the Dept. and expects of course that he will receive his salary this quarter as a teacher under the Department and that he will receive due notice that the school is to be closed as the first intimation came to him on Aug. 22nd. It is only fair to ask that he should be retained.\nChurch Missionary Society\n\nuntil Oct. 31 or at least paid up-to that date.\n\nI met the Rev. J.M. Daly last week and spoke to him on the subject and it is at his request that I forward the correspondence to you.\n\nI may add that I entirely agree with the department's decision in deciding to close the school at Mony Shet all but if the children could be sent into the Boarding School now it would be to their benefit.

Seeing then that it was through no fault of mine that the school was not open, would you be kind enough to request the Department to forward the balance of my salary $9.23. As I receive no money from the C.M.S. the Government Grant being my whole salary, even so small a sum as $9.23 will be thankfully received.\n\nsgd. Spencer Collins.\n\nIndian Agent,\nBlackfoot Reserve.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Nov. 26th I wrote a letter to the Indian Agent requesting that the balance of my salary be forwarded which had been deducted from what was due for the quarter ending Sept. 30th. The letter was forwarded to Regina and I have received no reply so I have therefore taken the liberty of writing to you.\n\nIn the middle of quarter ending Sept. 30th I was ordered to close school at once, so the lines were cut and asked that proper notice should be given, while the correspondence was going on I opened the school three times and each time was ordered to close it by the\nAgent, owing to this I could not send the number of days required by the Department and they therefore deducted $8.23 from the Sept quarter and $2.85 from the Christmas quarter, $11.08 altogether, from my salary.\n\nI have therefore written to ask you if the money can be forwarded to me, as it was not my fault that the school was closed.\n\nHoping that you will regard my request with favour.\n\nI remain,\n\nyours obediently,\n\nSpencer Collins\n\nTo\n\nHayter Reed Esq.,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Spencer Collins, late teacher of the school, has written to the Departmental Office in Ottawa for September 1895 and October 1895 for the amount of $230.00 due him.

The application which has been informally made by the Bishop of Saskatchewan for a school at Lac la Ronge.\n\nThe census shows there are 46 Indians belonging to Lac la Ronge band, 475 of whom are returned as Anglicans and 18 as Roman Catholics. There is a day school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England. It has an enrollment of 28 pupils and an average attendance of 12. Inspector Chisholm visited the school last year and reported the teacher was not a success owing to his slight knowledge of English. He reported the building large, comfortable and in good order. As the Indians of the Lac la Ronge country lead a roving life it is impossible to secure a large attendance at the day school. When the Bishop brought the matter up you\ndid not feel that we should at present go further in the direction of providing Boarding Schools.\n\n2. Increased grant for Emmanuel College and a contribution for repairs and equipment.\n\nThis school has had a $1000.00 during the current year for repairs to the building. It is a Boarding School and gets a capitation grant of $72.00 for 32 pupils and a capitation grant of $100.00 for 20 pupils. This extra grant was allowed for the training of teachers, but the Department reports that that work has been a practical failure, and that on no other ground is the school entitled to a larger per capita grant than the ordinary boarding school, as it does not do more in the direction of manual training than other boarding schools. The request was therefore refused although pressed more than once by Mr Davis.\n\n3. Reopening of the day school on the Stony Reserve and Pattleford Agency: This school was closed at the end of 1890 with a view to having the\npupils attend the Rattleford Industrial School on the Stony Reserves. These Reserves form a group of three with a population of 86, 4 of whom are returned as Anglican and the balance as Pagans. The Church of England has a day school on Red Pheasant's Reserve in the same Agency. There is no money available for the payment of teacher if this school were reopened, and before taking steps to provide the necessary funds it might be well to have a report from the agent and inspector upon the desirability of reopening this school. Unless a fair number of the 86 Indians are settled down from a roving life, it would be hard to successfully conduct a day school.\n\n4. Increased remuneration for Mrs Matheson:\nMrs Matheson is the wife of the Principal of the Boarding School at Onion Lake. She is a qualified physician, is paid $100.00 for giving medical attendance to the Indians of Onion Lake. The Department supplies the medicines which cost about an equal amount. Mr Smart declined to give an increase\nin October last on the ground that there was no money available and the same ground now exists as the appropriation for medical work is about as heavily taxed as it can stand.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 1st May, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nAn application having been received from the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay for the re-opening of the day school on the Stony Reserve in the Battleford Agency (Eagle Hills) which was closed in 1890 with a view to having the pupils sent to the Battleford Industrial school, I am directed by the Superintendent General to request that you will be good enough to report at your earliest convenience as to the desirability of re-opening this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that an application having been received from the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay for the re-opening of the day school on the Stony Reserve (Eagle Hills) in the Battleford Agency, which was closed in 1890 with a view to having the pupils sent to the Battleford Industrial school, Mr Inspector Chisholm and the Indian Agent at Battleford have, by direction of the Superintendent General, been written to for a report as to the desirability of re-opening the school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nSecretary\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letters above quoted, regarding the reopening of the day school on the Stony reserve in this agency, I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nThere is no change in the attitude of these Indians towards the Industrial School, and it is apparent that for some time to come education cannot reach them through the medium of any class of school situated abroad from the reserve.\n\nThey have, on the other hand, repeatedly expressed a desire to have the day school reopened, and the conditions for day school work are in some respects favorable. There are at present nineteen children of school age, and eleven under six years.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe twenty-one families composing the band occupy dwellings so situated that none are more than a quarter of a mile from a central point. In about two months during laying, however, they camp at their hay swamps, from three to five miles distant, and during that period school would necessarily be suspended. A few weeks be a break from a similar cause during seeding and harvest.\n\nThe main difficulty in connection with the reopening of this school would be to procure a properly qualified and otherwise suitable teacher. Such a person should not fall below the Department's requirements in respect to education and training; he should be married, as there is no convenient place for a single person to live; and he should have a dwelling within or adjacent to the encampment. To establish a teacher where there have unusual opportunities for influencing the lives and habits of the Indians.\n\nThere is no school building or teacher's dwelling at the present encampment. The\nold school house is at the old farm, five miles distant, and could not be removed with advantage, though some of the material of which it is constructed could be utilized in the erection of a new building, as it is of course whatever place it is. The old farm house also, which is about half a mile from the school, might be taken down and the material turned to account in the building of a new school and teacher's dwelling.\n\nAssuming that none but a duly qualified teacher will be put in charge I have no hesitation in recommending the reopening of this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. Chisholm\nSuperintendent Agency,\nand acting dist. Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th June, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWhen Archdeacon Mackay was here in April last he applied, inter alia, for the re-opening of the day school on the Stony Reserve in the Battleford Agency (Eagle Hills) and by direction of the Minister Inspector Ghisholm was asked to report as to the advisability of re-opening this school. His report has now been received in which he states that the only way to educate these Indians is through the medium of a day school on the reserve as they are opposed to industrial schools. There are 15 children of school age whose parents all live within convenient distance of a central point where a school could be established, but there is no suitable place for a teacher to live nor is there a building fit for school purposes. Mr Ghisholm thinks that a properly qualified or otherwise suitable teacher would have unusual opportunities for influencing the lives and habits of these Indians.\n\nThe question now resolves itself to one of expenditure. Five hundred dollars would have to be provided for a teacher's salary and an appropriation would be required for the erection of a suitable schoolhouse and teacher's dwelling combined, which would cost a considerable amount in this isolated locality.\n\n[Signature]\n\n1901\n\n[Signature]\nEx'd.\n\nOTTAWA, 13th June, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to official letter of the last date, on the subject of the application of Ven. Archdeacon Mackay for the re-opening of a day school on the Stony Reserve (Eagle Hills) in the Battleford Agency, I am directed to inform you that Mr Inspector Chisholm having forwarded a report favoring the re-opening of this school, you may make provision in your next estimates for the salary of a teacher and also for an amount sufficient to provide for a combined schoolhouse and teacher's residence.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nStoney Reserve, Battleford\nJune 30th, 1909\n\nSir - With regards to the small attendance of children at this school, especially during the latter part of the quarter ending June 30th, 1909, I beg to offer the following explanation: Several of the Indian parents whose children had been attending regularly would have continued to do so, were allowed to go away to visit their friends, as they call them, somewhere over the mountains, and of course they took their whole families with them, including the children who should have been at school. It is only fair to add that they will return after another month or so to expect their children to attend the school for at least the latter part of the September quarter. I am not making any complaint against any person, but simply stating facts of the case so that you may know the condition of affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nBattlegord, Sask.\nDec. 28th 1911\n\nSir,\n\nThe day school on the Stony Reserve in the Battlegord agency has been for some time taught by Rev. G. McDonald of Red Pheasant's Reserve. If the Department consents to the proposal that Mr. McDonald should take the school on Red Pheasant's Reserve for a time, they may propose that, as a temporary arrangement, Peter Watience, a graduate of the Battlegord School, should take up the work until such time as the Department is able to carry out better arrangements which we hope are in prospect. Peter Watience is about to marry a very nice girl from the Battlegord School.\n\nThe teacher's house at the Stony Reserve is in poor condition, but we have repaired it so as to make it fairly comfortable for the young couple, and we hope that they will not only keep the school going for the time being, but also exercise a good influence generally among the Indians on the Reserve.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYours obediently,\nJ. A.

While the Department would have liked to receive more definite information as to the qualifications of this young man, it is prepared, on your recommendation, to make the temporary appointment, the salary to be at the rate of $200.00 per annum. You will be good enough to give Mr. Butunee such instructions as you consider necessary and the Agent will be advised of his appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The building formerly used there is still standing. Also kindly state the salary you will allow.\n\nI may say that James Wuttunee is a former pupil of this School, that he taught the school at the Little Pine's Reserve in this Agency last winter, and did good work.\n\nI have just written to him to find out if he will take the Stoney School for the winter.\n\nYours Obediently,\nE.

If, however, the building is fit for occupation and there is equipment there would appear to be no objection to the appointment for three months of James Wuttunee at the rate of $300.00 per annum for the time the school would be in operation.

D. McLEAN ESQ.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of the Moosomin Band, who recently removed to their new reserve at Murray Lake, have made an application for the establishment of a day school for the education of their children.\n\nThere are reported to be 13 children of school age on the reserve, nearly all of whom are Roman Catholics. It would appear to be necessary to make some arrangements for the education of these children and the Department would like to have a report from you, in which it would be glad to have you make any suggestions that you may see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nNORTH SASKATCHEWAN INSPECTORATE,\n\nPrince Albert, April 23rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Feb. 1st, No. 352400/1, regarding the application of the Indians of Moosomin's band for the establishment of a day school on their new reserve, I have the honour to state that on the 2nd inst. I visited the reserve and looked into the question from different points of view, and am now in a position to report on the subject.\n\nThe Indians, it is true, are anxious to have a school on the reserve, now that they are farther removed from the residential schools which in many instances their children attended in the past. The center of the reserve is about 30 miles from the Battleford Industrial School and about 50 miles from Thunderchild's Boarding School.\n\nThere are 21 children of school age on the reserve, namely, 11 boys and 10 girls, including 2 who are members of Thunderchild's band but who are likely to be permanent residents of this reserve. Of the 21 children of school age here indicated a few are approaching 16 years and would probably not attend school; so that the actual school attendance under favourable conditions would probably be 15 or 16 pupils, unless this were further reduced through some being persuaded to send their children to the boarding institutions. So long as the Indians have an option between two or more school the attendance at any one cannot be definitely counted upon.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe parents of a large majority of these children are Roman Catholics, or have a preference for that religion, although many have, I understand, at one time or another been baptized as Anglicans. Although the Indians would, themselves, probably not object to a non-denominational school, yet it is doubtful whether any school other than a Roman Catholic one would be successful. My main reasons for discussing this question, there being no question as to the religion of the majority, are that in the case of undenominational schools there is a much larger range of choice in the selection of a teacher, and that no pretext is afforded to any section to hold themselves aloof on religious grounds. These considerations are, however, so important that in case it were decided to open a day school on this reserve it might be advisable to take the matter up with his Lordship Bishop Pascal, with a view to securing, if possible, a permanent understanding regarding an undenominational school here; for if the consent of the Bishop is secured no objection will arise from the Indians.\n\nAs the dwellings of the Indians are at present distributed throughout the reserve there are 14 children at the south-west end, near the shore of Murray Lake; there are 6 about the center of the reserve; and one at the north-east end. If this were permanent a school would be best situated at the south-west end, where the majority live; but the present conditions have no appearance of permanence. It seems, in fact, fairly certain that in the near future a larger number will locate near the center of the reserve, which is 3 or 4 miles from either end; and until the Agent and Farmer get their ideas worked out more maturely and get the Indians to select farm sites and build more substantial buildings, it will be impossible to decide with any degree of certainty as to where a school can be most advantageously situated. With two or three exceptions\nthe present dwellings are all mere temporary shacks, - new and clean, it is true, but still mere shanties and in many instances not intended to be occupied longer than the first winter. Only 40 acres of land was broken last season, and at the time of my visit not more than half a dozen were fully decided as to where they would locate their farms. It seems probable that when the Indians are once settled down to their industries the center of population will be somewhere near the center of the reserve, where, partly for this reason, it has been decided to locate the farm buildings.\n\nIn view of the circumstances as described above I would respectfully recommend that though the necessity for a school on this reserve be recognized yet action toward the establishment of the same be deferred at least until next winter, when if it be deemed advisable plans can be laid for the following season.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 2, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo reporting upon the application of the Indians of the Moosomin's Band for the establishment of a day school on the new reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that locations of these Indians have not been finally decided upon, the Department will postpone action till next year, as suggested by you.\n\nYour remarks with reference to a non-denominational school are noted and will receive consideration at the proper time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nREPORT on the INSPECTION of BATTLEFORD AGENCY\n\nFrom April 1st, 1910, to Sept. 30th, 1911.\n\nDay School.\n\nThe Indians are anxious for the opening of a day school; but as this matter has already been reported on at length it is unnecessary to dwell upon it here.\n\nMadame Gingras, who once taught the school on Sweet Grass' reserve, and who is an intelligent woman and a fairly good teacher, is at present making her home with Farmer Couture's family; and I believe she would gladly accept the position of teacher.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nSgd. W. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nBattleford,\nNov. 15th, 1911.\nOttawa, January 31, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report of inspection of the Battleford Agency in which you deal with the establishment of a day school on the new reserve of Moosomin Band at Murray Lake I beg to say that the Department is prepared to take up the question of the erection of a building there. It is presumed that this building will be of logs and that the work can be done by the Indians under supervision.\n\nAt the time of your last report the location of the Indians had not been definitely decided upon. I would ask you, therefore, to go carefully into this matter and make such recommendations as you may see fit with regard to the location of the building and the best means of having the work done. As the majority of these Indians are Roman Catholics it will be necessary that the teacher be of that faith. It is understood that unless the location of these Indians has been definitely decided upon no action will be taken and the Department will expect to have a report from you before going any further into the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J.

The number of Children, of school age, who would be able to attend, is 19.\n\nThere is a good central site for this School, so that it would be conveniently near to the scholar's homes. The School would be conducted by the Roman Catholic authorities.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY & SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nTo Mr. Pelly\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nBeing in charge of the Moose Cree Indian Reserve, I beg most respectfully to ask that the Roman Catholic School promised to be built at once as soon as possible, as it is the desire of the Indians and myself to have the children attend school by next September.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Please address correspondence in care of the Indian Agent, Battleford.\nOttawa, June 29, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in reference to the erection of a school building on the new Moosomin Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Ernest Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nc/o The Indian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, June 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter to you of January 31st, last, in reference to the erection of a school building for the Mooskin Band at Murray Lake.\n\nThis matter has been brought again to the attention of the Department by Rev. Ernest Lacombe, O.M.I., Missionary on the reserve, who is asking for the establishment of an improved Catholic Day School at this point. I should be glad if you would give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nReferring to your letter quoted above, and also that of Jan. 31st, relative to the establishment of a day school on the Moosomin reserve at Murray Lake, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nThere can be no doubt as to the need for a school on this reserve, or the anxiety of the Indians to have one established. During a brief visit which I made here toward the end of March the Indians again brought up the matter. I discussed it with the Agent, who was, however, as yet too new to his duties to have a definite opinion on the subject. The main difficulty is to determine where a school can be located so as to serve to the best advantage the entire band, having some regard to probable future conditions.\n\nThe reserve is so uniform throughout in respect to facilities afforded for the industries of the band, no part being particularly well suited for either grain growing or cattle raising, that the Indians are, I judge, liable to move from time to time in an effort to improve conditions. However, such removals will only be in individual cases; and it is probable that a school situated centrally at the present time will continue to be fairly central in the future, so long as the boundaries of the reserve remain as they are at present.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the members of the band have\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nabodes in the west end of the reserve, about two miles or two and a half from Murray Lake. The farm house is located about the center of the reserve; and the remainder of the Indians are between the farm and the east end, in two small groups. However the population may fluctuate as to location, it seems most likely that the larger section of the band will continue to live within two or three miles of Murray Lake.\n\nYet for this season I would hesitate to recommend the erection of buildings of a permanent character for school purposes. Unless the school were situated conveniently near to the farm house or the mission a teacher's dwelling as well as a school house would be required, and the expense involved would be considerable, even though the buildings should be constructed of logs. Father Lacombe informs me that he has two qualified teachers in view; and he volunteers to furnish a building to serve as a school-room. I have no doubt he has communicated this offer to the Department; and I expect he has in view that the teacher should occupy the dwelling in connection with the mission, which is situated on the border of the reserve, about two and a half miles north-west from the farm house and about a mile and a half from the lake. The school-room would also be in connection with the mission; and it would thus be from half a mile to two miles from the homes of the larger portion of the band referred to above as dwelling at the west end of the reserve. I believe that with the attractions of the improved school a fair attendance of the children from this end of the reserve could be secured at a school so situated; and I would accordingly recommend that the offer and suggestion of Father Lacombe be adopted. This would furnish a fair opportunity for the Indians to show their appreciation of a school; and if the experiment proved satisfactory to the Department preparations could be made\nfor the erection, next season possibly, of suitable buildings within the limits of the reserve.\n\nIf it were necessary, from present data and indications, to select at once a site for permanent school buildings on this reserve, I would recommend a point approximately one mile south of the mission and about a mile and a half from the lake.\n\nProvided the Indians show sufficient interest in the school after a trial, it seems to me it would be advisable to construct buildings after the description of those being erected on Little Pine's reserve; for it is unlikely that henceforth any of the children of this band, except an occasional orphan, will be sent elsewhere to school, and with the present school population of this band and the number of small children coming up to school age there is increasing scope for a useful day school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th ultimo in regard to the establishment of a school on the new Moosomin Reserve at Murray Lake, I beg to say that the Department approves your recommendation in this matter and will provide the salary of a teacher. Kindly obtain information as to the qualifications, etc., when the amount of grant can be decided upon.\n\nNecessary furnishings for the building will also be provided and stationery, etc. You should advise the Department what furnishings and supplies will be needed.\n\nIt is to be understood that this is to be a temporary arrangement and the continuance of the school will depend upon the results obtained. It is also understood that the church will provide a temporary building.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW.J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, Nov. 21st 1812\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nFrom a letter of Mr. A.W. Chisholm, Inspector of Indian Affairs, Prince Albert, I understand that the Department will not be in a position to build or school this fall on economic reasons. But as I have offered a place where to have classes until the Department is able to build, will we not be allowed to start school as soon as possible and to hire a teacher at $500 per dollar salary? The place I am offering is large enough for classes, for sleeping for children, horses, etc., for the teacher's dwelling. So there is nothing why the Department should delay in giving us our improved day school, as the Indians were promised some time ago.\n\nHoping you will take this letter into consideration and do your best possible, remain yours sincerely,\n\nT. Macmillan\n\nP.O. Box\nOttawa August 27, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, in reference to the opening of the school on the new Moosemin Reserve, and in reply, I beg to say, that on the same date you wrote your letter, the Department communicated with Mr. Inspector Chisholm and instructed him to submit a list of the necessary furnishings and supplies, and to obtain information regarding the qualifications of the teacher who is available.\n\nAs soon as this list is received, authority for the purchase and the opening of the school will be given, and I have to ask you in the meantime to give definite information as to the qualifications of the proposed teacher. The amount of salary asked for will be granted, if the qualifications are satisfactory and there should then be little delay in having the school opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. E. Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nDelmas, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 21st ult., regarding the opening of a school on the Moosomin reserve, I have the honour to state that the person whom Rev. Father Lacombe recommends for appointment as teacher is Albert Edward Rotsey, who has latterly been farming near Jackfish Lake, a few miles from the reserve. Mr. Rotsey is 40 years of age, is married and has a small family, all his children being under ten years of age.\n\nFor 13 years he was a soldier in the British army, enlisting at 20 years of age and retiring of his own accord at 33. His record in the army is favourable, and during his term of service he passed an examination for promotion and was promoted to the rank of corporal. A Second Class certificate for attainments in elementary military education was issued to him on an examination embracing \"Writing to dictation; Arithmetic; Reduction of Weights and Measures; simple Practice and Proportion; Vulgar and Decimal Fractions; Percentages and Averages; arranging and balancing Regimental and other Accounts\". On enlisting he was entered as a Dentist by profession; he was assigned to a medical staff corps, and at Aldershot he passed a class of instruction for \"Qualified Cook in a Military Hospital\" and also for \"Compounder of Medicines\". He was born and brought up at Boulogne, France; and was formerly, and presumably still is, a member of the Church of England.\n\nThe foregoing information, along with much of less importance, I have from certificates of the Officers of the Regiment in which the applicant served. I know Mr. Rotsey, but not intimately. He is a man of fair intelligence; and I have a favourable impression as to his character and qualifications; but lacking as\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHe does both special training for teaching and experience in the work I could not speak with confidence regarding his success. I would think, however, it would not be amiss to give him a trial: if he only proves diligent and interested in his duties he will likely succeed.\n\nFather Lacombe is anxious that a salary allowance of $500 per annum should be made by the Department; as he claims it is impossible to secure a teacher for less. As Mr. Rotsey has considerable skill in the handling of medicines it might be that an allowance of $400 as teacher and $100 as dispenser would be an advantageous arrangement. There is at present no supply of medicines on the reserve; but as this band is now isolated and visits by the medical attendant are few and unsatisfactory, I believe that a well chosen assortment of medicines in the hands of a man with Mr. Rotsey's qualifications would be the means of effecting a great improvement in the present condition of things.\n\nI presume fuel will be supplied for the school; and Father Lacombe inquires whether the Department will make some allowance for the cooking of the children's noon meal. With regard to this matter I would suggest that an allowance of $10 per month be made so long as conditions, as to attendance, etc., appear to warrant the expenditure.\n\nThe request is also made that the conveying of the children to and from the school be provided for. However, this question might, I think, be laid over until the approach of winter. In the meantime I shall ascertain and advise the Department as to the exact dimensions of the school-room, and as to whether the entire school population could be accommodated in case a full attendance were secured.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, September 25, 1912.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant giving particulars as to the qualifications of Mr. Albert Edward Rotsey, who has been nominated by Rev. Father Lacombe as teacher of the proposed new school on the Moosomin Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department would have preferred to obtain the services of a teacher with some professional training, it realizes the difficulty in securing such in an outlying reserve such as this, and is willing to give Mr. Rotsey a trial at a salary of $300.00 per annum.\n\nIn view of his qualifications as a dispenser of medicines, the Department will supply medicines and allow him $100.00 for his services as dispenser. You will, therefore, instruct the Agent to make out a voucher quarterly for his salary at this rate per annum.\n\nWith regard to the fuel for the school it is thought that the Indians should supply this.\n\nBefore authority is given for any expenditure in connection with the noon day meal I have to ask you where it is proposed to serve this, whose services are available to supervise it and what accommodation there will be for its preparation.\n\nKindly\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nKindly advise the Agent of the action that has been taken with regard to the opening of this school and inform the Department when the teacher assumes his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nReferring to your letter quoted above, regarding the opening of a day school on the Moosomin reserve, I have the honour to report further as follows:\n\nThe building which Rev. Father Lacombe offers to loan temporarily for school purposes is situated on the SW quarter of sec. 32, tp 47, rge 16, west of the 3rd mer., and while not on either reserve is as close as possible to both the Moosomin and Saulteaux reserves. It is possible that some of the Saulteaux may be induced to avail themselves of its advantages. There are between 15 and 20 Saulteaux children of school age, some of whom live less than a mile from this building and some between 2 and 3 miles.\n\nThis building I find to be closer to the Moosomin Indians' dwellings than I formerly reported. Including a family from Bear's Hille who are making their home here, there are 22 children of school age on this reserve, of whom 14 are between half a mile and a mile from this building. The remaining 8 are from 4 to 6 miles distant, and belong to four families.\n\nThe building in question was built for church and dwelling for missionary under one roof. It is 34' x 28' in dimensions, and consists of two storeys, with a small but secure cellar. It is constructed of lumber, and is as yet unpainted. It has a substantial stone foundation, though only on the surface, being 3 feet high and 2 ft. in thickness.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe proposed class-room, which is the room provided for church services, is in the second storey and is the full size of the building, being 34' x 25' and with a ceiling averaging 9 ft. in height, being 10 ft. in the center. There are two entrances and two corresponding stairs, leading to this room.\n\nThe first storey is divided into six apartments, five of which will be available for school purposes, namely, four rooms for teacher's quarters and one for pupils' dining-room, while the remaining apartment is retained by Father Lacombe as his private room and study.\n\nThe pupils' dining-room is 15'7\" x 12', and can be provided with tables in such a way as to seat conveniently 16, or if necessary 20, children. The other rooms, including the kitchen, are 11'6\" x 8'8\".\n\nThe building is heated by stoves; and there is a well constructed brick chimney from the ground up.\n\nMrs. Rotsey, wife of the teacher whose appointment has been approved, is willing to attend to the preparation of the children's noon meal, but would expect $10 per month for this duty, as she understands that this remuneration has been allowed in some other instances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 18, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, advising the Department as to the nature of the building provided by the Rev. Father Lacombe for school purposes on the new Moosomin Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this building appears to be quite satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to the engagement of Mrs. Botsey for the preparation of the noon-day meal, I may say that the Department is prepared to make an allowance of $10.00 a month for this work from the time that it is undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW.

I may mention that I have had\nmore than one request in the same di-\nrection by these Indians both before\nand since the opening of the school that\nis at present in existence, but I did\nnot feel like moving in the matter, as\nmy action might be attributed to purely\nsectarian motives.\n\nI am however convinced that a\ndenominational school cannot be expected\nto be much of a success on this Reserve.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nAs the professing Christian Indians are about equally divided between Romanists and Protestants.\n\nThe school that has been started under Roman Catholic auspices is clearly not a success.\n\nI would therefore respectfully submit for your consideration the advisability of starting a non-denominational school, the whole control, including the appointment of the teachers, to be in the hands of the Department.

E. Rotsey, states under the heading of \"Remarks\" on the return that \"the school was closed from 17th Nov. to 24th Nov. owing to misbehaviour of a pupil named Henriet Mayou who was suspended for the present by order of Mr. Inspector Chisholm on his visit to the reserve\".\n\nThe Department would like you to furnish full particulars with reference to this matter. The age of this girl is given as ten years and the Department cannot understand why it was necessary to close the school, for the above mentioned reason. From the excuse furnished by the teacher the Department thinks this was a slight pretext for the closing of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReference your letter of 21st inst. # 352400/9\n\nI beg to report as follows.\n\nOn the 24th Nov 1913, along with Inspector Chisholm, I visited Buffalo Lake School and found it closed. We were informed by the Teacher, Mr A. E. Natesy, that the School had been closed since the 17th of that month, owing to the misbehaviour of one of the pupils Harriet Nyo. He informed us that his wife objected to having this pupil at school, on account of what she termed indecent conduct. Upon our suggestion, Mr Natesy offered to discipline the child, but his wife refused to have anything to do with the school, so long as this child remained. We were compelled to interview the parents Mr & Mrs Nyo, and in the interests of the school to request that for a while they keep the child at home.\n\nNyo brought his child to school, and she denied all charges in the presence of Mr Natesy, Inspector Chisholm and myself. Notwithstanding the statements of the Teacher and his wife that the child was acting innocently, we judged the conduct of the child was no worse than any other Indian child of her age, and could easily have been overcome with a little strict discipline.\n\nSCHOOLS BRANCH\n\nFEB 8 1914\nUpon making further inquiry we were informed from a reliable source, that the whole trouble arose from the hysterical nature of Mrs Rotsey, which we have every reason to believe was so.\n\nThere was not sufficient evidence to justify suspension, but in the interests of the school and to prevent the closing of same, we thought it advisable to get the parents to keep the child at home for the present.\n\nOn the 13th inst., the Rev Father Lecoube, who is in charge of the Catholic Schools of this Agency called at my Office to see Inspector Chisholm and myself concerning school matters. We held a long conversation over the Murray Lake School, and he made the statement that we would have to replace Mr Rotsey as teacher, in order to bring the school along successfully. Owing to the attitude of Mrs Rotsey above referred to, Mr Rotsey's usefulness as a teacher is greatly impaired, and his services cannot long be continued. I might add that Rev Father Lecoube, is in a particularly favourable position to express an opinion on this matter, owing to the fact that he resides for the greater part of his time, in the same house along with Mr and Mrs Rotsey.\n\nTrusting that this explanation will meet with your requirements,\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.B. Mclean Esq\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 5, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the closing of the Murray Lake Day School owing to the misbehaviour of a pupil named Harriet Myo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the explanation of Mr. Rotsey is not considered satisfactory and the Department agrees with you that it would be in the interests of the school to dispense with his services and would like you to consult with the Rev. Father Lacombe with a view to obtaining a successor. Mr. Rotsey should be required to leave not later than the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, February 5, 1914.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 11th ultimo with which you submitted a request from some of the Indians of the Moosomin Reserve for the establishment of an undenominational school at Murray Lake I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to comply with their request at present. I may add that the services of Mr. Rotsey, the present teacher, are being dispensed with and the Department trusts that conditions will improve under a new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nBattleford Sask\nFeb 11th 1914\n\nSir\n\nIn reference to your letter Jan 27th 1914,\n#352400-I, I have the honour to make the following report.\n\nOn a few of my visits I have found no pupils at this school. Mr Rotsey always had some excuse to make for the lack of attendance. The children were away to the hay camps, or some other similar reason.\n\nAccording to his register, the following is the report of attendance, since the opening of the school on Oct 28th 1912.\n\n| Quarter | Roll | II boys | II girls |\n|---------|------|---------|----------|\n| 1st     | do   | do      | do       |\n| 2nd     | do   | II      | do       |\n| 3rd     | do   | do      | 9        |\n| 4th     | do   | do      | 4        |\n\nDays of school in 3 quarters ended June 30th 158\nDaily average attendance for this period 10.6\n\nI again visited the school on Nov 16th and found the number on the roll to be 17, and average attendance 7.35. My last visit was on Jan 12th 1914 when the number on roll was 18.\n\nI am sorry to say that this school has made little or no progress during the last six months. As regards Mr Rotsey's services, I do not consider them as satisfactory. He appears to have little or no control over his pupils, and is not in my opinion a qualified teacher.\nI was told by Inspector Chisholm, when the Rev. Father Lacombe leased the Church to be used as a school building, the school was to be held in the same room, in which the Church services were conducted. This has not been so. They use a small unsuitable room, and the children are cramped for space to move in. I consider the whole building unsuitable for a school room, as it is very cold.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq\nAssistant Deputy And Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nBattleford Sask\nFeb 12th 1914\n\nReference your Letter Feb 5th 1914 # 352400/I\n\nI shall interview Rev Father Lacombe, at an early date, with the view of obtaining a successor to Mr Rotsey.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq\nAssistant Deputy And Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education for the year ended March 31, 1813, on page 365, Mr. J.A. Rawland, Indian agent, reports as follows on Inverness Day School:\n\n\"I am unable to report as to the progress made by these children, as on the four occasions on which I visited this school, it was closed, and there were no children present.\"\n\nNow, I beg to state that the above report is entirely false. Mr. Rawland never came to visit the school on school days, or during school hours. His visits were on holidays, or after school hours. Did the Agent make this false statement wilfully or not; it does not matter. There is a saying that \"treachery always comes back to its master.\"\n\nOn page 480 of the Report of the Agent of Indian Education for the new year ended March 31, 1813.\nMr. Chisholm, in his letter, writes the following about the mission school:\n\n\"The present school is located outside the reserve, but at such a point that it is scarcely less convenient for the mission band on that account; while it could be attended also by the children of the Ranters' reserve, which lies adjacent, should these people be willing to avail themselves of its advantages.\"\n\nThis statement is perfectly true for the present and it will be true for some years yet, until the Indians are definitely settled on their reserve.\n\nTherefore I would advise the Department to build only a temporary school, or an adjoining the Catholic Mission's quarters. A building of $600 or $700 would be all that would be necessary for many years. If the school teacher would find good accommodation in my house after some years we will see what can be effected from the Ranters, and the cases will be definitely settled each in their place of land and then it will be time to go into heavy expenses for school purposes, if found necessary. Whatever you may decide, we want new classrooms as early as possible, as the present ones are too small.\n\nOur present teacher Mr. Polley will quit teaching.\non the 1st April, and I am receiving the request of a female teacher who is engaged in teaching in the Indian schools many years and who has always had the very best reports from the inspectors. I am promising her a minimum salary of $700 = with the hope of raising it raised to $800 = in the near future. You must clearly understand that if you want to make a success of the day schools or the reserves you must have good teachers and to have good devoted teachers you must pay them a good salary. As for my part I think that $1000 = would not be too much for a really good teacher who would teach all the subjects on the programme of study, and besides teach sewing, knitting, cleanliness, etc.\n\nHoping you will take this letter into consideration, especially regarding the building of new class rooms,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Lacombe\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. F. A. Maple, whose present address is Cluny, Alberta, stating that she has been in communication with Rev. P. Lacombe in reference to her appointment to the duties of matron on Moosomin's reserve, in the Battleford Agency. I am aware that Father Lacombe has been endeavouring to secure a properly qualified teacher for that reserve; and it may be that he has taken up with the Department the question of the appointment of a matron. If such is the case, and if the Department has decided to make such an appointment and desires fuller information regarding Mrs. Maple's qualifications and experience I shall endeavour to procure it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Aug. 8th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo stating that you are in receipt of a letter from Mrs. B. A. Maple of Cluny, Alta., informing you that she has been in communication with Rev. R. Lacombe in reference to her appointment to the duties of matron on the Moosomin's Reserve, in the Battleford Agency and asking whether the Department has decided to make such an appointment and in reply, I beg to say that before doing so, it would like to have fuller information regarding Mrs. Maple's qualifications and experience and a report from you as to the necessity for the appointment of a field matron for this Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Maple, Field Matron of the Moosomin Reserve has asked the Department to supply her with a horse and driving outfit in order that she may visit different portions of the Reserve in connection with her work. The Department considers that the Farming Instructor should be able to supply Mrs. Maple with transport whenever necessary. It would seem unnecessary to go to the expense of purchasing a horse and vehicle for her. Kindly therefore, see that she is provided with transport by the farmer whenever required to visit Indians under her care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, 20th November, 1914.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, with enclosures, I beg to say that you may purchase laundry tubs, washboards, boiler, clothes pins and line for use at the Moosomin School, but the other articles for which Mrs. Maple the Field Matron, has made requisition should not be purchased.\n\nI may add that the Department will write you in a short time with regard to the subject of the distribution of interest which cannot be made for some time to come.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBattleford Sask.\n\nNovember 13th 1914\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a copy of requisition I received from Mrs. B. A. Maple the Field Matron at Moosomin Reserve.\n\nThis requisition, in my opinion is very unreasonable, and especially coming from a reserve drawing over $4000.00 Interest money per annum.\n\nBefore the Department give their consent to supply these goods as specified in list, I would like to point out that it will mean the starting of trouble and expense for themselves and this Agency. The other schools are equally entitled to consideration along with the Moosomin School, and in my opinion much more so as they have no source of income like the Interest money of Moosomin. It would mean that the Department would be compelled to clothe every Indian child in the Agency, and by doing so would take the responsibility off of the shoulders of the parents. My ambition has been to try and make this Agency as nearly self supporting as possible, instead of having the Indians rely upon the Department. I might say that I have never been approached by the other Field Matrons with any such requisition as this, and in my opinion it is not necessary. The Indians of this Agency are in a good position to clothe their children and are not in need of assistance from the Department.\nEleven yards of towelling was issued to this school about a month ago, and since then yarn cloth and clothing and knitting needles have been issued to this reserve.\n\nRe. kitchen utensils. These were supplied new two years ago and were of good quality. They were in good order on my last visit in September.\n\nThe Medical Officer does not consider it necessary to supply a Pharmacopoea.\n\nAs the Department refused to supply a cow for the use of the Littlepine and Red Pheasant Schools some time ago, I do not think it advisable to show any favour to Moosomin School.\n\nI would recommend that I be allowed to purchase Laundry tubs, washboards, boiler, clothes pins and line for the use of the school.\n\nI have also received a requisition for Drugs from Mrs. Maple, and having no knowledge of same, I am submitting it to our Medical Officer Dr. Macadam for his approval.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

We have opened the Murray Lake School for the winter, whereas we never could get satisfaction from your agent at Battleford. We have been sending requisitions after requisitions for school materials and they always have been ignored. I had no option to buy things with my own money to keep the school going. This is far from being fair.\n\nI have made up my mind to have the school succeed or to close it altogether. There is no use of keeping the day schools opened on the reserve if they are to be neglected as they have been by the last and the present Agent. It would be a criminal waste of money.\n\nNow, I am sure that you are anxious to see us get the best results possible with our Indian schools, and therefore that you are ready to give us all the help necessary to attain to that end. That is why I write.\nfor the good management of these schools, and you\nwill see the former as acting as secretary for my\nactive day schools in the Battleford agency, and\nto purchase the materials that will be found necessary\nfor their good equipment. You can try this for the\ntwo coming quarters and I am sure that you won't\nfind that I am extravagant in my expenses. This would\nbe away with thousands of remonstrances against the Indian\nAgent.\n\nFor the present quarter the daily attendance of the pupils\nis better than it ever has been, we expect to have an average\nof 12. But the cold weather is coming, and most of the\nchildren are too poorly clad to permit them to continue to\nattend regularly. I wish you would allow me to hire an\nIndian to drive the children to and from the school during\nthe cold weather. I may be able to find a man who would\nvolunteer to do the work for one dollar a day and perhaps\nfor less.\n\nThis applies to both the Murray Lake and the Pandosy Indian\nday schools.\n\nPlease give due consideration to this letter and favor me\nwith a prompt answer.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nE. Lacombe\nDumas, Sask.\n26th Nov. 1914\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs\nAttawapiskat\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am glad to see that the coming of Mrs. B. A. Mapple on the Moose River Reserve, Battleford Agency, as field worker is going to revolutionize the way and the lives of our good Indians. Mrs. Mapple is fully qualified for the work she has been given to do, and she is taking the deepest interest in her functions, and I wish you would give her all the help she will ask for.\n\nOur first care will be for the children, to keep them in good health, and for the young girls and women who have been raised in the schools. We know by experience that when the women are clean, good workers, good housekeepers, their men have to follow the example, and exert themselves to give a good living to their families. Of course, for the start we will need unusual\npreliminary help from the Department. We will start slowly, avoiding all superfluous expenses.\n\nTo make possible the work undertaken by Mr. Maple in teaching the girls and women sewing and domestic work, I have taken upon myself to build a house of 20 ft x 30 ft, lighted by 8 large windows. This house will cost me in the neighborhood of $6,300. If it is not asked too much, I would suggest that the Department pay me a monthly rent of $15 for one year, for the use of this house. The house will need some furnitures, or chairs, tables, window shades, shelves, stoves, and two sewing machines in addition to the one already bought for the Department. I wish you would authorize me to purchase these things. I think I can buy them cheaper than the agent can do. The house will be ready for Christmas, I expect.\n\nOur plan is to bring all the girls or young women of the Reserve of Micmacs to learn sewing and making all kind of clothes for themselves and their families. Also we intend to make them\nearn some money, by having them make some clothes which will try to sell, either to the Department to be distributed on other Indian Reserves, or to some other firms. It would be such a good idea, if your Department would take some contact with the Department of Militia for clothes for the soldiers! Give us a chance to try and to demonstrate what could be done in this way.\n\nIf the experience proves satisfactory you will have all the credit for having patronized the idea.\n\nPlease give this letter all the consideration it deserves, and favor me with an early reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Lacombe\nOttawa, December 1, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo requesting the Department to furnish additional assistance to Field Matron, Mrs. B. A. Maple, on the Moosomin Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Agent Rowland is being requested to report on the building which you are erecting for the matron. When this report is received the Department will consider your application for the furniture.\n\nWith regard to the recommendation that the Indian girls take a contract for sewing for the soldiers, the Department regrets that it is impossible to consider this at the present time. However, the Department wishes to encourage the teaching of sewing to the girls, agent Rowland is being requested to purchase one bolt of flannelette and one bolt of dress material.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. E. Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, December 1, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the supplies for the Murray Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that blank requisition forms are being enclosed herewith and you will be good enough to fill in these and forward to the Department.\n\nAgent Rowland is being written to with regard to the transport of the Indian children to and from the school and you will be advised at a later date.\n\nThe Department is unable to accede to your request that you be allowed to purchase the supplies for the school as all supplies are purchased through the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. E. Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, December 1, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. E. Lacombe, in which he recommends that an Indian be hired to drive the children to and from the Murray Lake and Poundmaker Schools. Kindly inform the Department the distance these children would have to drive in order to reach these schools and whether you would recommend that a man be hired to do this work.\n\nYou should also inform the Department what the cost per day would be for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nReference your letter 352400-1 Dec. 1st, 1914.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that when I visited the Moosomin Reserve on the 16th and 17th of this month I again looked into this matter. With the exception of a couple of children who live seven miles from the school, all the others are within a mile excepting two of the largest children. These two have a mile and a half to walk to attend school. There is no reason in my opinion for employing a team for the children who are seven miles from the school. We have children in Battleford, my own included, who have to walk two miles to attend school and I do not see why it should be necessary to drive Indian children a less distance. If however the Department sees fit to employ a driver, I would recommend that it should not be continued any later than the 31st of March.\n\nI might say that Rev. Father Lacombe was not at home on my visit to Moosomin, and I did not know that Father Lacombe had employed Magloire to drive the children to school at one dollar per day, until Inspector Chisholm informed me on my return. This is one of the many instances where Father Lacombe has interfered with my work, without authority from me or the Department. This agrees with his remark made to me on various occasions, \"The Government is rich so let them spend their money.\"\nPoundmaker School\n\nI visited this school on the 21st and found that the average was keeping fair. The bulk of the children are situated the same as at Littlepine, all within easy reach of the school, excepting a few stragglers who are not more than a mile and a half distant. This is a similar case to Moosomin, and I personally do not see the necessity of employing a teamster. If however the Department think otherwise, I consider that I should have some say in the employing of the teamster. I would like to employ Indians who owe accounts on our ledger and who are quite capable of performing the work.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 5, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo reporting upon the application of Rev. Father Lacombe that an Indian be hired to transport the children to and from the Murray Lake School on the Moosomin Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that, in view of your statement that all of the children with the exception of two live within easy walking distance of the school, the Department does not see the necessity for engaging a team for their transport and you will be good enough to inform Father Lacombe accordingly. I may add that he had no authority from the Department to engage a teamster, as he was informed that he would be further advised regarding his application.\n\nWith regard to the two children who are reported to be living seven miles from the school it would be better that they be sent to a residential school, as they are too far from the Murray Lake School to be driven there. The best thing that could be done for them would be to send them to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and you should endeavour to get the consent of their parents to send them there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBattleford Sask.\n\nFeb. 18, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nOn my last visit to the Moosomin Reserve Rev Father Lacombe put a proposition before me that I think worthy of consideration.\n\nMagloire an Indian of Moosomin Reserve has offered to do the following work for the Department provided that he is paid at the rate of $35.00 per month for the whole year.\n\nThe following is the work that he has offered to do.\n\nFirst,-To drive the children to and from the Moosomin School.\n\nSecond,- To provide all the wood for the School and Field Matron's residence.\n\nThird,- To drive the Matron whenever it is necessary.\n\nFourth,- To do all the other work around the school and Matron's residence, when asked to do so.\n\nFifth,- His wife would do the washing for the school.\n\nI consider this is an excellent offer, and it would remove a lot of the trouble I am having at the present time over the Moosomin School. From a financial point of view it would also be satisfactory, for the cost of supplying wood for the school and Field Matron, the cost of maintaining a horse for the Field Matron, and the cost of cleaning the school.\nand grounds would be about equal to the amount asked for by Magloire. The hauling of the children would practically amount to nothing.\n\nIf the Department see fit to accept this offer, I would recommend that one of the rules would be that Magloire keep at least ten cords of wood on hand sawn ready for use. His pay shall start from the date on which I shall notify him of your acceptance of his offer.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 8th March, 1915.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with which you submitted a report for January from Mrs. B. A. Maple, Field Matron at Moosomin's Reserve, together with a requisition for supplies and, in reply, I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that Mrs. Maple has asked for many articles which should not be supplied. The Department is not prepared to incur large expenditure in connection with the work of the field matrons, although there is no desire to handicap them in their work. Mrs. Maple will not be supplied with dispensary furniture, and, in view of the fact that the medical officer states he has given her plenty of cheese cloth, and, as apparently she has bandages, it does not appear that she will need anything further in this line. You should furnish her with a supply of absorbent cotton. As she has the medicine cabinet used by the late dispenser, it should suffice to meet her needs in the way of a cupboard. A Pharmacopoeia should not be purchased.\n\nWith reference to the requisition for furniture for the house in which Mrs. Maple is living, which matter is dealt with in your letter of the 17th ultimo (P. 352,400) I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nauthorize expenditure of this nature. You should state whether there is any reason why Mrs. Maple could not have remained in the school building, in which she resided for a time. I may say that the Department is not prepared, in the absence of further information, to either purchase or rent the house erected by Father Lacombe, as no provision has been made for expenditure of this nature, at the same time it is desired that you will make a full and definite report to Headquarters, in this matter. As you must be aware, it is not usual to either purchase or rent houses for the use of field matrons. When necessary the Department has no objection to paying board for a field matron. A woman engaged in this work should be made comfortable so that she can carry on her work successfully but the expenses connected with her duties should be kept within reasonable limits and it is not proposed to make any exception from the general rule in Mrs. Maple's case.\n\nYou should explain her statement that the teacher at the school has a sister with her, who cooks the mid-day meal for the children. Did you arrange to have the teacher's sister remain with her and are her services required?\n\nYou should also make report as to Mrs. Maple's statement that she has borrowed towels and basins from the school, wherewith to do her work. You should state whether further supplies of this nature are required.\n\nMrs. Maple has asked, in the closing part of her letter, to be furnished with vegetable and flower seeds. The Department will be glad to have you make purchase of the necessary seeds, as it is considered advisable to have\nhave the Indian women and children taught to cultivate gardens. Apparently Mrs. Maple is interested in her work and her reports indicate that she is industrious and endeavouring to further the interests of the Indians on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, in which you state that when you visited Moosomin's Reserve recently Father Lacombe recommended the employment of Magloire, an Indian of that reserve, at a wage of $35.00 a month for the whole year, in order that he might perform certain work which you have outlined; and, in reply, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to incur the proposed expenditure nor, seemingly, is it necessary to have all of the work referred to done. I may remind you that when writing on the 12th February, with regard to the Murray Lake School on Moosomin's Reserve, the Department pointed out that all the children, with the exception of two, live within easy walking distance of the school and that, therefore, there should be any necessity for engaging a team for driving children to the school.\n\nWith reference to the proposal that Magloire supply all the wood for the school and the field matron's residence, I have to refer you to the Department's letter of March 5, in which you were asked if there was any necessity for the matron living in the house in which she at present resides. With regard to driving the matron to different points on the reserve, it is thought that you should make arrangements to have this work done by some person connected with the Indian Agent. It should not be necessary to incur expense in this connection.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nIt is not understood why washing should be done for the school. The Department desires to impress upon you the necessity for observing strict economy. As already intimated, the field matron should be made comfortable so that she can carry on her work successfully but no unnecessary expenditure should be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. D. McLennan\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nAugust 6th, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that when the Rev. Father Lacombe called at this office on the 2nd inst., he informed me that Mr. R. Landreville was going to teach the Murray Lake School in the future. Mr. Landreville is the gentleman who married Miss L'Heroux in the early part of July. I do not know if this man is qualified for this position or not. Mrs. Landreville has not as yet sent in her resignation, and this is all the information I can give in the matter. Kindly advise me regarding the above mentioned matter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D.

Landreville was going to teach the Murray Lake school in the future.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if it is the intention of Mrs. Landreville, who was formerly Miss L'Heroux, to resign her position as teacher of this school she should send in her resignation at once. If it is desired to place Mr. Landreville in charge of this school I have to ask you to be good enough to furnish the Department will full information as to his qualifications and experience. In the meantime the school should be kept open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A.

I shall however on my return visit the Murray Lake School and enquire into the qualifications of Mr Landreville.

As I mentioned in my previous correspondence Inspector Chisholm informed me that the whole building was turned over to the Department, but Father Lacombe denies this. I have no writing to prove the statement of Inspector Chisholm, and I have no official authority to speak to Father Lacombe when he disputes the word of the Inspector.\n\nAs we have had considerable correspondence in connection with these buildings I would like to have the Department send me a copy of the letter where\nhe offered the buildings to be used for Departmental purposes.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

Last year I took down one partition of the house to enlarge the school room that was really too small. The Inspector seemed to be quite satisfied with this amelioration. Now he finds the school still too small, and wants me to take down another partition. I cannot afford to break my house like this without knowing whether the Department will use it for a sufficient length of time or not.\n\nTherefore, to show you my good will, I am offering without extra rent, the house which Mrs. Maple has been occupying since January. This building is 20ft. X 20ft. and is just as well lighted and just as sanitary as the average of the country schools of the surrounding district.\n\nI have notified Mr. Agent Rowland of my intention of moving the school into this other building, but as it may likely take another month before getting an answer from Ottawa, and as I feel sure that you will approve my plans, I will take upon myself to make the change at once, before the winter.\n\nI will not ask for any extra amount of fuel for the heating of this house; just give us the usual amount of wood and I will supply what we may eventually run short of.\n\nThe proposition is fair and I am sure that it will give you satisfaction.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nE. Lacoste o.m.i.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of September 16th, giving the qualifications of Mr. Landreville.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department considers these quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(Enclose his answer). I have also made him known that the Department has received my request as Malton for the Mississaugas Reserve and will give the same consideration.\n\nIf the Department wish me to begin next spring, I will be ready to start in rather into my function as Travel Malton for Mississaugas Reserve by the 15th April 1917.\nI also apply for the position as school teacher at the Mission's Home when vacant as I understand it will be next year. I beg the Department to take this matter into consideration, as it is almost impossible to live on the salary of the Field Station alone. I can be a teacher for the Indian children and also Station. It will give me plenty time after school hours to visit the homes and on Saturdays for committee service.\n\nMy previous experience with the children at school teaching their personal hygiene, and also teaching them gardening, proved to be successful, and I have no doubt that the school work will be done satisfactorily for the Department and the Indians.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer,\n\nI am respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEx.

I cannot help it, though I have always done my best to induce the parents to send their children. But they are always away from the Reserve with their families working for farmers or hunting or visiting. When they come back, it is only for two or three days and they go away again. Today there is no more than three or four families on the Reserve; others are hunting too far away, and God only knows when they come back.

They claim that there would be better control and a better attendance.\n\nThere are about 60 children on this reserve, nearly half of them of school age, and it does appear to me that the average for the past year is very small, only 4.56 as shown by my report on schools, which will reach you shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

The attendance has been very poor and the Department wishes to have your candid opinion as to the cause. Your report should also deal with the condition of the building, equipment, etc.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nReferring to your letter of November 18th, 1909.\n\nNo. 117334/1, with reference to the Day school (Okanaga) on the Keeseekowenein's reserve, I beg to report as follows:\n\nAs to the teacher Miss Maggie E Murray. She has not a Certificate, qualifying her to teach, and as far as I can judge, has not her heart in the work, although she attends the school regularly, and goes through the usual routine. She does not seem to get the sympathy of the parents or confidence of the children. This I believe, is one of the causes for such poor attendance, as the majority of the members of the Band, are very sensitive, and do not appreciate a teacher, who draws the social line between them, so that they cannot fail, but be touched by it. This of course has an effect on the attendance, as the parents who may feel that they have a grievance against the teacher, keep their children at home until the little matter has been forgotten. The teacher may offend in this way, and not know she has done so. Another cause for the poor attendance is the distance from the homes; most of the pupils having to travel two miles and over, and as the majority are under 9 years of age, their parents are not very enthusiastic about their\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\ntheir attending, the excuse being the distance, and they think that there is plenty of time for them to go to school, when they are older.\n\nThe building is a frame one, 18 x 36 with a Porch attached and is suitable for the purpose and in good repair. The windows might be improved, by putting in larger glass, the present ones are 10 x 12. The desks are very old ones, but answer the purpose very well. Might be replaced by more improved ones, if the attendance was better. There are several large maps of Canada and one of the World, showing the British Possessions, also the usual equipment, in Reading cards, slates &c.\n\nIn connection with this school I wish to state, that ex-pupils who have received training in this Day school, in previous years\u2014 I refer to girl pupils\u2014and who have not attended any Industrial or Boarding schools, have been a great credit to their teachers. A number of these girls pupils are now living on the reserve and are quite able to read and write plainly and are very good housekeepers. I might mention the daughters of Mrs. Cook, Mrs. Geo. Flett and Solomon Burns. Nearly all these young women have been and are now employed as domestic servants and give excellent satisfaction to their employers.\n\nWith reference to improving this school I would suggest that a properly qualified teacher be appointed, one who would take an interest in the Indian pupils, and who would visit their homes regularly, and in this way gain the confidence of the parents. A light mid-day meal might be provided, consisting of tea, bread and butter and rice, during the winter months. The biscuit ration would do for the summer.\nsummer. The Band should be advised if any changes are to be undertaken and made to understand, that if the attendance was not satisfactory to the Department, that the school would be closed and their children would have to be sent to the Boarding schools to be educated. I understand that a new Missionary has been appointed by the Presbyterian Church to this reserve, and that it is his intention to teach the Day school next year. The previous Missionary who taught the Day school, was not a success. The Missionaries as a rule dislike combining teaching and mission work, and the result, in my experience is that the school does not get the supervision it should.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 8th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nSometime ago a complaint was made to the Department that the teacher of the school on the Keeseekooowenin reserve (Okanase school) is inefficient, and the very poor attendance, which shows an average age of 4.56 for last year, although there are about thirty children of school age, would appear to bear out the contention of the Indians, that the teacher takes little interest in the work.\n\nThe Department is informed that the Presbyterian Church has appointed a new missionary to this reserve, and that he will also teach the school. This is not thought to be the best arrangement possible for the work.\n\nThere is a field for an energetic and efficient teacher, who can devote his or her whole time to the school work. If your Church can secure the services of such a person the Department will be prepared to pay an initial salary of $400.00 per annum. The necessary supplies to provide a mid-day meal will also be furnished.\n\nThe Department would like to see an improvement in the conditions as they exist at present and trusts that you will concur in the recommendation made to appoint a teacher whose whole time will be given to educational work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nRev. R. F. MacKay,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nJanuary 11th, 1910.\n\nMr. S. Stewart,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI have received yours No. 117334/1 expressing the preference of the Department for the appointment of a teacher at the Chawanase Reserve instead of having the missionary on the Reserve do the teaching also, and also stating the willingness of the Department to pay an initial salary of $400.00 per annum as well as necessary supplies for a mid day meal. I shall write today to Dr. Marquardson intimating this proposal and asking their consideration. I know that the Reserve has been disappointing. The Indians have not shown the interest in the school that might be reasonably expected and they have been repeatedly warned that unless they took more interest in the securing of the attendance of their children the school might be entirely closed. The thought has come from the west that possibly a colony on the Lizard Point Reserve might secure ultimately the consolidation of the work so as to make an expenditure at both Chawanase and Shoal Lake unnecessary for public school work. That, however, is a remote possibility. In the meantime I shall ask the Western Committee to report and shall let you know their mind in the matter.\n\nThanking the Department for this kind proposal in the name of our Committee,\n\nI am,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours sincerely,\nOttawa, January 17th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo reporting very fully upon the day school work on the Keesekooowenein Indian reserve, and in reply I beg to say that the Department on the 8th instant wrote to the Rev. Dr. MacKay, Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church, asking him is possible to obtain for this school a teacher who could devote his whole time to the work and offering to pay an initial salary of $400.00 per annum for a suitable person.\n\nA reply has now been received from him and he is taking the matter up with the Western Committee. The Department hopes, therefore, that before long the church may be able to recommend a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa, January 17th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reply to the Department's proposal to place a qualified teacher in charge of the Okanase day school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will await a report from the Western Committee of your Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRev. R. F. MacKay,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have a letter from Dr. Farquharson in reply to inquiries made by me as to Miss Murray's work at the Okanase school. In which you state that the average attendance is so low whereas there were 30 pupils on the Reserve. From replies received from Rev. W.W. McLaren, Mr. Dongahy, as well as from Mr. Wheatley, the Indian agent and Mr. Boyer the interpreter, the number at present on the reserve is 13. They think probably in the Department's reckoning that the Indians on the Reserve round Clearwater Lake were included, which is altogether beyond the reach of the Okanase school and where there is a school by the Roman Catholic Church. Besides the thirteen children there are nine children from the Okanase reserve at the Birtle school, which added to the nine around Clearwater Lake and the 12 on the Reserve, make about the number you reported. Of the 13 children on the Reserve they also say that some of them live as much as three miles from the school, and that during the winter it would be impossible for the children to attend in safety because the roads are then very bad.\n\nAs to Miss Murray's qualifications Mr. McLaren writes that in character and ability she is satisfactory, but that he has some doubts as to her powers of discipline. Mr. Dongahy also writes in high terms of Miss Murray's work, but says, however, that Miss Murray is not a regularly certified teacher, has had no normal training, and this may tell against her work. Dr. Farquharson adds that if the appointment of Miss Murray is not approved it may be very difficult to secure a teacher holding a regular certificate as the difficulty of getting teachers of any kind is increasingly great.\n\nIn view of these circumstances I would like to know what your judgment would be as to the continuation of her services.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.M./MBA.\nOttawa, February 25th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department would like to know by return mail the number of children of school age on the Okanase reserve and the denomination or denominations to which they belong.\n\nAt the same time you should also state the number of Indian families and children of school age on the Clear Water Lake reserve and the denomination to which they also belong.\n\nThe census return from the Birtle Agency does not show the population of the two branches of the Keesec-koowenin's Band, but, as a number of the Indians now reside permanently at the Clear Water Lake reserve, it might be practicable for you in future returns to show the population on each reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.

Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th ultimo in regard to the Okanase day school I beg to say that further inquiry has elicited the information that there are only fourteen children of school age on the reserve.\n\nIn view of the small number it is not proposed to press for the resignation of Miss Murray at present, but an opportunity will be given her to effect an improvement in the school.\n\nMiss Murray will be written to direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nIt is desired to effect some improvement in the Okanase Indian day school, of which you are at present in charge.\n\nExperience shows that it is only when teachers are thoroughly interested in their work that a large enrollment and regular attendance can be secured, and from these points of view results at the Okanase school have of late been disappointing. At the same time the difficulties encountered by teachers are fully appreciated and the Department is prepared to lend assistance to overcome them.\n\nIn the first place it is essential to obtain the confidence and good-will of the parents and to this end the teacher should visit the homes and by every means in her power impress upon them the necessity for a regular attendance of their children. The officers of the Department will also be asked to co-operate in this work.\n\nThe studies in the class-room should be made as varied and interesting as possible, and the teacher should devote a portion of her spare time to self-improvement in the latest methods and devices of her profession. The Department would be prepared to supply you with an educational publication, if desired, for this purpose.\n\nThe mid-day meal is proving in many instances a\n\nMiss Maggie E. Murray,\nTeacher,\nElphinstone, Man.\ngreat incentive to regular attendance and the necessary supplies to furnish a simple meal would be furnished, if you would undertake with the assistance of the older pupils to prepare it.\n\nThe Department is convinced that better results in your school can be obtained and would be glad to hear from you in reference to the suggestions above outlined, and also to have any opinions you may care to offer as to means of attaining the desired end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nMarch 14th\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter dated March 9th is received (no. 117334/1) and in reply will say that I agree with you in the suggestions you have made and intend to do all in my power to get the children to attend this summer. Of course I know the attendance will be much better in the summer as some are moving closer to the school. They keep moving all the time and in the winter some of them are too far away for the children to come to school, so make the attendance very small.\n\nI think it would be a very good idea to give the children lunch in the school and I am sure they would attend better. I will try to be willing to get it ready for them.\n\nI would also be very pleased to have the educational publication which would be a great help to me.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nMaggie Murray\nOkanese school teacher\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you have determined to take hold of the work at the Okanase day school with renewed vigour and trusts that your success during the coming summer will be most marked.\n\nThere will be ordered to be sent to you for the balance of this year one copy of \"The Canadian Teacher\", and, should you be in charge of the school when it re-opens after the summer holidays, you will be good enough to renew your application for this publication, provided you find it interesting and of use to you.\n\nMr. Agent Wheatley will be instructed to supply you with the necessary provisions to give a mid-day meal to the children. This of course must be of a very simple kind, the object not being to give a full meal, but rather to supplement the lunches brought by the children themselves from their homes. You will be good enough to let the Department have a report at the end of a month showing the result of the giving of this meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Maggie E. Murray,\nTeacher,\nElphinstone, Man.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to forward till the end of June, next, one copy of \"The Canadian Teacher\" to Miss Maggie E. Murray, Teacher of the Indian School, Elphinstone, Man., and forward the account, in duplicate, to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Educational Publishing Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has decided to furnish Miss Murray, teacher of the Okanase Indian school, with some simple supplies to provide a mid-day meal. You will be good enough, therefore, to purchase for her some soup meat, rice, salt, tea, sugar and beans. This meal should not cost the Department more than about 2 cents per meal or perhaps a little less. Before a second order is given Miss Murray she should send you a report for transmission to the Department showing the number of meals served and the cost per meal per pupil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI beg to inform you with reference to the mid-day meal, authorized for the Okanase Day school, that the same has been started, and is proving a drawing card, as the attendance has increased to 7 and will undoubtedly be up to 14 this summer. Owing to the difficulty in getting fresh meat, none being obtainable in Elphinstone, just at present, the meals served have been without soup. The day I visited the school the meal consisted of beans, biscuits and tea.\n\nThe teacher is considerably handicapped in the way of preparing the meal, owing to there being no proper accommodation for cooking same; as the stove in the school is a box one and only suitable for heating purposes during the winter months, and during the summer weather it will not do, for it to be used for cooking the mid-day meal. It will be necessary to purchase a small cooking stove, which can be placed in the porch attached to the school building. This porch I have looked over and it can be extended three feet, at very little expense and will answer the purpose of a cook-house for the present. The Mission house is too far away from the school and the teacher\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nteacher could not properly look after the cooking of the meal and teach at the same time. The cost of the stove will be about $13.00 and for enlarging the porch about $6.00. I have arranged with the Band to put up a fence around the school, so as a small garden could be started for the teaching of gardening to the pupils. A hoe, rake and some garden seeds have been supplied the teacher for this purpose also some flannel, needles and thread to start sewing class for the girls. I will be glad if the above expense can be incurred with reference to the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils of the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 9, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant reporting upon the work being performed at the Okanase day school and asking authority to purchase a cook stove and also to enlarge the porch to provide accommodation for giving the mid-day meal.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the satisfactory report received and of your recommendation, you are hereby authorized to expend the sum of $13.00 in the purchase of the stove and $6.00 in enlarging the porch.\n\nThe Department will be glad to have from you towards the end of the current term a further report on the work of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.

Murray, teacher of the Okanase day school on the Keeseekoowenein's reserve, is leaving at the end of June and that the school will be taken over by the Rev. James A. Donaghy, Missionary on the Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is sorry to lose the services of Miss Murray and would like to know if she could be persuaded to remain or if better inducements were offered her. If she would stay on the Department would be willing to pay her at the rate of $400.00 per year. It is preferred to have a teacher at this school who could devote his or her whole time to the school work, as it is thought that if the Missionary were teacher his other duties might interfere with the work in the school-room.\n\nBe good enough to communicate with Miss Murray and let the Department know the result as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Fee, Convenor of Foreign Mission Committee of the Minnedosa Presbytery, Newdale, Man., dated March 7th, 1911, in reference to the Birtle Boarding School, Original on File 116624/1.\n\nIn connection with the Presbyterian day school upon the Keesekooowennis Reserve we would recommend that with a view to appointing a qualified certificated teacher for the school (its chief need at present) that the school be thoroughly renovated with a view to making it habitable for the teacher and more up-to-date for efficient work. We would recommend a measure of compulsory attendance throughout the whole Agency. Parents of able bodied children over, say, ten years of age being required in the presence of the inspector at the treaty payments to give adequate reasons why their children should not be sent to some school. Practically no Indians in this Agency are opposed to education. They simply do not care to decide to surrender their children particularly if they are delicate. In this connection, particularly if the parent be a widow, old or delicate, the treaty money of the school children should not be funded. The funding of treaty money is one of the chief objections to letting the children go away.\n(Best of Mid-day meal for the month of April.)\n\nProvisions received during month.\n\nSugar - 30\u00a2\nTea - 85\u00a2\nBeans - 60\u00a2\nTotal - $1.35\n\nProvisions used up during month.\n\nSugar - 30\u00a2\nTea - 85\u00a2\nBeans - 60\u00a2\nTotal - $1.35\n\nNumber of meals given 120\nCost per meal 1\u00a2-15\u00a2\n\nMaggie Murray\nTeacher\nCost of Thursday meal for June:\n\nProvisions on hand & brought month:\n- Flour: $18.00\n- Sugar: $5.00\n- Salt: $6.50\n\nReceived during month:\n- Beans: $24.75\n- Salt: $15.00\n- Sugar: $47.00\n\nHand up during month:\n- Flour: $15.00\n- Sugar: $1.00\n- Beans: $5.00\n\nTotal meal price: $160.00\nCost per meal: $1.00\n\nTagger & Murray\nTeacher.\nCost of meals for Monthly Oct. 1911.\n\nItems received during past month:\n- Beans - $4.10\n- Sugar - $4.10\n- Tea - $2.60\n\nTotal cost - $8.80\n\nFood used up - $2.35\n\nNo. of meals since 187\n\nCost per meal - $0.44\n\nMaggie E.

This school is in very poor shape, and a change should be made at a very early date. Miss Murray has been teaching for five years at this school, but had no previous experience whatever, has no certificate and no normal training. The band complain that Miss Murray has no control of the children and never visits their homes. The condition of the school building is the same as at the date of my last report. The books and school material are in good order and appear to be well looked after.\n\nMiss Murray informed me that she had to close the school on the afternoon of the 15th, for want of wood, but a load had been delivered by the time of my visit on the 16th. I brought this matter to the attention of the band at the band meeting and they promised it would not occur again.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. S.J. Jackson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 6, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson in his annual report on the schools in his inspectorate recommends a change of teacher at the Okanase Day School. Mr. Jackson states that the Indians complain that Miss Murray has no control of the children and never visits their homes.\n\nI should be glad to have your opinion as to the advisibility of asking the Presbyterian Church to nominate another teacher for this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nIn reply to your letter, dated June, 6th, 1912, No.117334/1 re the teacher of the Okanase Day school, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nMiss Murray the teacher referred to, has no Professional Certificate to teach, and has been employed by the Presbyterian Church Authorities, for the reason I understand, that it could not secure the services of a competent teacher, with a Certificate, owing to the small salary attached. The Department has however, increased the grant to $400.00 per annum, which is supplemented by $150.00 by the Church, making the annual salary $550.00. This salary should call for a teacher with a certificate.\n\nWith reference to Miss Murray not visiting the homes of the pupils, I might state, that the Chief George Bone, on behalf of the band, mentioned this matter to me, also that she had no control of the children during the recesses. I brought this matter to her attention, and she informed me, that she did visit some of the pupil's homes, but as she could not speak in their tongue, she considered it of very little use for her to visit them. I advised her to keep on making regular visits, as it was a sure way of gaining the confidence of the parents, and a better attendance would be the result.\n\nAs Miss Murray receives part of her salary\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsalary from the Church, she should consider it her duty to visit the homes of the people.\n\nIn my opinion, a competent teacher, with a Professional Certificate should be engaged, and should be one who would take an interest in the work, visit the homes of the parents, and make them feel that the education of their children, was a duty and pleasure.\n\nThe salary, at least should be $600.00 per annum, made up as follows:- Department $450.00, Church, $150.00, or the Church to increase its grant to $200.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 19, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIt has been suggested to the Department that there should be a change of teacher at the Okanase Day School and the appointment of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Murray has been recommended.\n\nThe Department considers that a qualified teacher should, if at all possible, be obtained for this school. It would appear that Miss Murray is not meeting with the success that might be expected and it is thought that a change of teacher would have good results. I should be glad to have you look into this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P.

Edmison, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe Chief and members of the Keeseekoowenin's Band, No.61, have made the request for the reopening of the Okanase Day School, and that the teacher to be appointed to be properly qualified and to have a Certificate.\n\nThey also ask that the sum of $300.00 per annum be allowed for the purpose of providing for a conveyance to bring the children to the school, and return to their homes after the school is closed.\n\nThe Indians themselves would supply the team and rig for the above amount.\n\nIf all the children attended regularly the attendance would be 15.\n\nI advised the band, that it would be best to send their children to the Birtle Boarding school, as when the improvements to this Institution were completed, there would be room for 75 pupils. They insisted, however, that I should put this plan before the Department, as they stated, that the attendance would be regular, as all the children would attend, except of course any who were ill.

This will enable the Department to decide as to the necessity of providing means of conveyance, if any. In any event it is thought that this should be necessary only during the winter season.

Edmison,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of March the 1st, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. J. D. McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary of the Indian Department at Ottawa, came to hand yesterday.\n\nWe have been doing nothing of late in the way of trying to get a teacher for the Okanese School, for the reason that our missionary there, Mr. Donaghy, wrote me that there are not enough children on the Reserve to make it worthwhile reopening the school. We were told also that the children on the Reserve are within reasonable distance of the school at Elkhinstone, and that there are no objections to them attending school there, and that in fact several of them are actually in attendance at that school. This morning I had another letter from Mr. Donaghy, in which he states that the Indians had held a meeting recently on the Reserve, which was attended by the Government Agent and also by Mr. Donaghy. At this meeting, among other things, the Indians pressed for the reopening of the school. The Government Agent asked them how many children there were of school age among them. They claimed that there were fourteen\u2014nine boys and five girls. It turned out, however, that two of these belonged to a family that moves about so much that they could not attend school with any regularity at any point. One of the fourteen is a non-treaty Indian and therefore will not be counted by the Department. One is at present attending the Elkhinstone School and another, for some reason, will not attend, so that there is a possible number of ten who might attend. The Indians admitted that unless the children were taken to and from the school there would be no hope of regular attendance, and they asked the agent to get the Department to hire a conveyance to take the children to and from school day by day. The agent promised to submit the matter to the Department, but I understand that he has no expectation that the request will be granted. Mr. McLaren of Birtle is here today attending the meeting of the Aboriginal Home Mission Committee, and he said he believed that some of the ten children, when they count as pupils, are not in a state of health to warrant them attending the school. We may wait it seems to see until the Department makes up its mind as to whether they will undertake to convey the children to and from the School before we look out for a teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. James Farquharson.\nOttawa, March 13, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10 instant with enclosure in reference to the re-opening of the Okanase Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the contents of Mr. Farquharson's letter have been noted and I may say that the Agent has been written to in reference to the transport of the children to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant,\nSuperintendent,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBirtle, Jan.\n\nMarch 27th, 1913\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant No. 117334/1 enclosing a blue print of the Keesekoo-wenin's reserve, I have the honour to state that I have numbered the homes of parents who have children of school age, and the number at each home, which I have enclosed with the blue print.\n\nWith reference to the running of the Van during the winter months I am sure that it would be satisfactory to the band, for the reason that during the summer months a number are frequently absent from their reserve, for the purpose of gathering Seneca root, wild fruits &c., and always take their children with them, and the attendance is generally very small during the summer term. The Indians say however, that if the Van was running, that they would leave their children on the reserve with friends, during their absence, so as to have their regular attendance at school, and would not keep them away from school only in case of illness.\n\nenc. 2\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| No. | Name                  | Band No. | Age | Sex |\n|-----|-----------------------|----------|-----|-----|\n| 1   | Ambrose Bone          |          |     | Boy |\n| 2   | Joseph Boyer          | 20       |     | Girls |\n| 3   | Herbert Keechewaymay  | 37       |     |     |\n| 4   | John Blackbird        | 39       |     |     |\n| 5   | John L.

At that time you submitted a statement of the number of children of school age and also their locations on the reserve. About the same time the authorities of the Presbyterian Church suggested that the children on this reserve might attend the day school at Elphinstone and that in fact some of them were doing so. No action was taken and the Department would like to hear further from you regarding the re-opening of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant No. 117334/1, regarding the re-opening of the Okanese Day school, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nI returned from visiting the Keesekoowemin's reserve on the 15th instant, and at a meeting of the band, held in Chief George Bone's house, the matter of opening the school was discussed. The band was in favour of having the school opened, with the understanding, that a properly qualified teacher be employed. The attendance however would be very small, and as the Birtle Boarding school has been improved so as to accommodate 65 or 90 pupils, it would not in my opinion be in the interests of the band to open the day school at present, as there will be some difficulty in getting pupils to fill the Birtle school, and as the matter stands at present, the Indians are willing to send their children to Birtle.\n\nThe Rev. W.W. McLaren, the late Principal has informed the band, that the Presbyterian Church does not intend to supply a teacher for the Day school, as it cannot get a qualified teacher, and wish their children to enter the Birtle Boarding school.\n\nWith reference to the reserve children attending the Public school, I wish to say, that it will not work, as the white parents object to their attending.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 30, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the proposed re-opening of the Okanase Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that the children on this reserve should be sent to the Birtle School and it would like you to use your best endeavours to have this recommendation carried into effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nOn the 22nd of July this year I had a joint meeting of the Rolling River and Keseekoonenin Bands, held on the Riding Mountain Reserve, where they were having a Sports day.\n\nBoth the Bands desire to have a day school built on their Reserves, so as they can have the children educated on the Reserve and have them at home at the same time. In my opinion this is a very reasonable request.\n\nRiding Mountain Reserve adjoins the town of Elginstone, and that would be an ideal place to have the children attend the white day school there, as none of them would be over three miles from the school, providing an agreement could be arrived at to finance it between the local School Board and the Department, and also providing they had room in the school, which I am afraid is already crowded.\n\nBoth Bands state that they will not send their children back to Birtle Residential School after the holidays unless a new principal is appointed, as they do not like Mr. Rusaw, the present Principal.\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Rusaw is very capable, though also very strict. He runs a very good school and gets on well with the children, and the children are well cared for. The Indians however do not like him. He has very little to do with them and is very strict about the parents visiting the children, except on Saturday afternoons. They also complain that there is no place for them to stay when visiting their children in winter, which is correct.\n\nI sympathize with the parents in this respect but\nbut of course the Principal has to be strict in this respect,\nor it would be impossible to operate the school efficiently.\n\nA.G.

It is exactly the plan that the Oak River School was constructed on, and the only way that I was able to seat the pupils in that building was to order a number of single seats, and when these are placed, I\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\nam sure it will not provide as much room, with as little waste space as the plan I have already furnished you. There are sufficient desks in the present school building which can be removed to the new building if one erected so no new ones will be required.

I think it is 20x34, and therefore only 24 feet less floor space than the plan attached, but the door and windows are so placed in the Oak River School that the desks cannot be conveniently arranged. I think that 8 feet less width and 2 or 4 feet more length much better suited for school purposes and the door and windows so placed that the former not opposite the desks and that latter so that there is good light and space for blackboard and maps.\n\nI have not included lumber for lining inside.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\ninside, as in my opinion these buildings should be whitewashed once each year and as well to do this on the legs.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nNo.2.\n\nAnother Boarding school is greatly needed in that part of the country, either on Snake Plain reserve, or perhaps preferably on some school lands near Shellbrook, as to this the Snake Plain Indians asked me to press for it on their reserve. The I.D. has some nice buildings there, but not enough for a boarding school. It is a lovely spot & a pretty good site for a farm. This boarding school is needed for Snake Plain, Sandy Lake and Big River Reserves, John Smith's, La Corne, Struson Lake & New Reserve, & for the Battleford Reserves unless Union Lake School is enlarged. I think it would easily obtain from 20 th 50 boarders, besides day pupils. But many think that it is better that a boarding school be not on a reserve & that near Shellbrook would be more central for this district. There should be a boarding school somewhere for the Carlton County.\n\nWhile on this subject I would plead for an Industrial school for Northern Saskatchewan, where suitable elder pupils might go. The Indian boys will not all make farmers occasionally we find them fit for College & a profession or business, & more often for carpenters, blacksmiths or other mechanics or tradesmen. In such cases nothing comes of their boarding school. They drift & are useless for hunting even. In an industrial school they might be prepared for some trade or business. Normal School or college & the best might be helped to do really well in life, & the girls likewise for something beyond Indian housekeeping. The Indians value education more now & are asking for industrial training. Under the present method most of the money spent by the I.D. on education is thrown away while spending a little more would save the whole. See how well commissioner Graham's boys are doing. Wm. Bear (the young Indian of whom I spoke above of New Reserve) who has been through all this and failed to get industrial training or college who is successful as a farmer, is very full of thought about these matters & strongly urges one such school for the picked pupils of both sexes. Please think of it.\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan Bishop\nJuly 14th, 1919.\n\nMy dear Bishop Newnham,\n\nI regret that it is not possible to consider the extension of our boarding or industrial school system in northern Saskatchewan at the present time, as the funds at our disposal are very limited and very little can be done in the way of building. There are several existing schools where rebuilding or extensive repairs must be undertaken before any new work can be given consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.J.

Newnham D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nBishop Thorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nDecember 16th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have been quite unable until now to write the suggested letters to you as to some of the matters we discussed. I beg you to lay the following requests and comments before you. I shall not repeat some points discussed and dropped as impossible at present, because I want to have them on your file, as a reminder of what is desired and that I fully believe is due to your Indian work.\n\n---\n\nNo. 5. There is great and pressing need for another Boarding School to accommodate the following reserves: Mistawasis (Snake Plain), Sandy Lake, Strurgeon Lake and Low Reserve, John Smith's, James Smith's, Big Head's and perhaps Montreal Lake, - 7 or 8 reserves. I understand that many of those interested in the Indians believe in increasing the number of Boarding Schools and decreasing that of Day Schools.\n\n---\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A.

This remark will also apply to nearly all the schools in the northern Saskatchewan district.\n\nI cannot see how day schools will ever be a success under existing conditions, and I hope that it will not be long until the Department will be able to establish an industrial school in northern Saskatchewan, which will take care of the education of all Indian children in that district. One good school properly managed will solve the problem and then the day schools could be closed up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq., Deputy Supt.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nAugust 20th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEver since the opening of the Roman Catholic School at Duck Lake and the special efforts of the Roman Catholics to bring all the Indians together Protestant as well as R.C. for the opening of that institution there has been a perfect ferment amongst the Indians on our reserves urging the necessity of the resident school for the Church of England between Prince Albert and Battleford, to take the place of those two Church of England schools which were closed.\n\nThis school has been promised for some time past and we were under the impression it was to be built on Mistawasis reserve, but some of the officials think it would be better if placed nearer to the Junction at Shellbrook.\n\nThe figures given to me from the reserve indicate that twenty-three children have come from the church of England reserve at Mistawasis to the old Presbyterian school; also that twenty-three others are in the Gordon school in the diocese of Qu'Appelle, and a large number from James Smith's, John Smith's, and the New Reserve at Sturgeon Lake have been sent some distance away.\n\nThe new ruling of the Department declining to pay the railway expenses of children coming on holiday is going to be a very serious inducement to the Indians to put their children into Duck Lake school because they can drive there and back. This very seriously affects about nine of our Church of England reserves and I would urge very strongly that this resident school at Mistawasis is long overdue. We have had nothing to take the place of the two Church of England schools at Battleford and Prince Albert which have been closed for many years. I feel sure that this urgent claim will receive the earnest consideration of the Department.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nSuperintendent Scott\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 26, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, urging the establishment of a residential school in the Shellbrook area, near the Mistawasis Reserve. There are many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education and it is impossible to foretell when funds can be provided for this activity. Your Lordship's request will be kept in mind when we are preparing our future Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDecember 19, 1925.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFollowing a conference between the members of the Indian and Eskimo Commission, M. S. C. C., and the Saskatchewan Diocesan Authorities, it was urged that a new school of 125 capacity should be provided as soon as possible for the central portion of the Diocese. Original request is on 160-2.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nExtract from Commissioner Graham's letter dated February 19, 1926.\n\nOn the whole I would say that these Day Schools (Sturgeon Lake, Big River, Ahtahkakoopa and Mistawasis) are not satisfactory, and it seems to me that another school, the size of the Onion Lake Boarding School situated at some point near Leask or Prince Albert will have to be built before we have the proper educational facilities for the Anglican children. The Roman Catholic children are well provided for, but we have no Anglican School outside of the small one at Onion Lake, and there are a large number of Anglican children on the various reserves in northern Saskatchewan.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOctober 9th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, October 18th and 19th, and I should like to come in and see you during the morning of the 19th in order to discuss matters affecting the Indian work in this Diocese. I have no particular object to urge, but I would like to discuss the future possibilities of -\n\nThe central Residential School to take the place of the two schools which have been closed at Battleford and Prince Albert. This was to have been placed at Mistawasis half way between the two points, and I understood that it has been promised before some of those recently built.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

M., in which you very kindly and generously offer a site on your reserve for a boarding school, and I very cordially wish to thank you for the same. The question, however, of the erection of a boarding school in that part of the province of Saskatchewan must finally be decided by the Department of Indian Affairs, and the site will be chosen by them also.\n\nOur Church has felt for some time that their Indian adherents in the central part of Saskatchewan should be provided with a boarding school, and they are hoping that this may be accomplished within the next few years, although no definite action so far as I am aware has as yet been taken. I will keep your letter on file, and forward copies of the same to the higher authorities both in the church and in the government, so that they may have the information it contains before them when the time comes to make a final decision in this matter.\n\nAssuring you and your colleagues, and all the people on your reserve, of the best of goodwill on the part of our Society, believe me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nField Secretary, H.B.C.C.\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nDavis P.O., Sask.,\nApril 2nd 1927.\n\nRev.

Morrison\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nR\u00e9gina, Sask., Dec. 23, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the five day schools in the Clifton Agency.\n\nI have been of the opinion for a long time that there should be an Anglican Boarding school in the northern part of this province to take care of the large number of children who are getting a very indifferent education in Day schools.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nLa Loonge, Sask.\nAug. 27, 1928\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to a matter concerning the present needs and future welfare of our Northern Indians, and particularly our young Indians. I feel that, in our present school methods we are not adequately performing the duties and responsibilities placed on us of equipping our young Indians to take their place in the industrial world.\n\nIn the past the great danger has been for our efforts to be wasted by the graduates of our schools returning to their natural and original life. That danger still exists, but it has become intensified by the fact that the natural and original life does not any longer hold a livelihood for the Indians, and as the years go by the difficulty will become more and more acute. The question therefore asked is, \"What is to become of our Northern Indians?\" Now, as one who has spent much upon twenty years in the Indian school work, I feel justified in offering an opinion, firstly with a view to furthering the cause of lifting the original inhabitants of this country to their rightful place in the world, and secondly, because the encouragements which have met us in our work demand the very best efforts and methods possible.\n\nThe Northern Indian must change his mode of living in order to exist. This is evidenced by the fact that trapping and hunting no longer hold out a means of livelihood for the Indians, and proofs if required may be obtained from the Hudson's Bay Company and Revillon Freres Trading Company in their present day trapping returns as compared with former years. Moreover, this means of making a living will never return, because civilisation is pushing North in the form of prospectors and miners, who bring in their wake the mining industry.\n\nThis trouble arising from the decline of fur would not be so acute if the North held any prospects for farming or ranching. But it does not, and anyone who knows the North will agree with me on this matter. At our school, which accommodates one hundred pupils, and which is full to capacity, we have three acres of land under cultivation.\nThis has been obtained at a great price. Not in money, but by labour, for hundreds of tons of rock have been removed from these three acres, and hundreds of loads of earth have been brought in; packed in sacks, hauled by team or transported by canoe.\n\nHow best to deal with the situation is the question which must be solved. I am not very well informed as to the amount of land held for farming purposes for our Northern Indians. But I do know that much of it is unoccupied, and that a great number of our strong, likely young Indians are not taking advantage of this means of making a living. Also I am equally sure that these young Indians would take to the farm life if they received the right encouragement. But, not many will under the present circumstances. They would rather idle away the days and weeks or die of starvation than risk the uncertainty of an uncertain change.\n\nMy suggestion is that an educational and training institution be established in the vicinity of Prince Albert. Near enough to a High School to enable a promising young pupil to climb in the educational sphere of life, and yet to be in a centre of Indian farming activities. This institution should be modern, and it should be large enough to accommodate at least two hundred pupils, as it would have clustered around it, eleven reserves of Indians most of whom adhere to the Anglican Church.\n\nIt should be within easy reach of the land which shall in time become the home of these children, so that a pupil in his graduation year shall take an interest in the plot of land which he shall in future cultivate and call his own, and his home.\n\nOne other factor in the adoption of such a scheme. In the Jas. Roberts band, with which I am well acquainted, a girl can hardly marry a man more distantly related than cousin. This is a very serious matter, and bound to become more serious unless we can bring about unions with other bands.\n\nI would not recommend that Lac la Ronge be entirely closed, though I believe it would cause a great deal less anxiety and expense to the Church Society if it were made a primary school with a pupilage of fifty, and as these pupils attain the age of eleven or twelve, draft them down to the new school.\nI have spoken to a number of the Lac la Ronge Indians on this matter, as well as Indians of other reserves, and all are very much in favour of the scheme I have tried to suggest above.\n\nI do believe that the farm holds out the best prospects for the Indians. I would strongly recommend that no lands belonging to the Indians be disposed of, but that more if possible be secured for them.\n\nWe do our best in the school work, but our best is so often wasted under the present conditions, and it does seem such a pity not to be able to follow up our school boys and girls until they attain to true useful manhood and womanhood. With this idea in view, I submit this for your earnest consideration, with a hope that you will let me hear of its reception, and also with an earnest hope that you may see fit to endorse it.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nChas. F. Hives (Signed)\nPrincipal\n\nRev. H.B.R. Eastgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Winnipeg.\nSeptember 6, 1928.\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIn a letter recently received from the Rev. G.F. Hives, Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, he states that during his interview with you in Regina, you requested him to furnish you with a statement of his opinion with regard to the future of the Indians in the \"north country\". In response to this request, he has forwarded to me the enclosed letter, with the suggestion that I should lay the same before you, along with any recommendations I might wish to make.\n\nThe question raised in Mr. Hives' letter is undoubtedly one of pressing importance, but I should not feel justified in offering any specific recommendation with regard to it before I have had an opportunity of carefully considering it in conjunction with those who are responsible for the administration of the affairs of our Society.\n\nThe diminishment of revenue from fur, the increasing precariousness of obtaining a livelihood by their natural and accustomed means, the establishment of the new Government Park north of Prince Albert and the probable necessity of altering the reservation of the Indians at the south end of Montreal Lake, the discovery of minerals in the Lac la Ronge area, etc., etc., all bear directly on the question of the future of the Indians in the north land, and indicate the necessity of the adoption of a definite line of action after careful and mature deliberation.\n\nFor my own part, I am not prepared to say at the present time, that the removal of the Indians from the bush country to the plains would be feasible, or whether it would satisfactorily solve the problem. Something, I think, is done along that line, and the situation now existing in northern Saskatchewan seems to me to present as favourable an opportunity as may likely to arise to try the experiment.\nThe establishment of a training institution in the vicinity of Prince Albert has been part of our Society's programme for a number of years, but so far funds have not been provided by Parliament for this purpose. With this part of Mr. Hiven's statement I find myself in close agreement. I fail to see, however, that the activities now carried on by the Lac la Ronge School could well be diminished, and would be very strongly opposed to their being completely relinquished. The schools which are now costing our Society so much anxiety on account of the cost of maintenance are schools of the class he suggests should take the place of the existing institution. Any school with an enrolment of less than 100 pupils is a heavy expense to our Society, and it is the Society's policy to eliminate wherever possible all such institutions by having them converted, or amalgamated into schools of the larger class. To my mind, therefore, any suggestion that the Lac la Ronge School be reduced from its present status would not be acceptable to our Society.\n\nThe whole problem has indeed its difficulties, but I can assure you that any help which our Society may be able to furnish in the way of finding a suitable solution, will be very willingly rendered.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.B.C.C.\nNovember 27th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Commissioner:\n\nAt your request the Rev. Charles Hives of the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge sent you an article or letter with regard to the future of the Indians in the northern part of this province. A copy was sent to the Indian and Eskimo Commission in Winnipeg, and a copy reached me in due course.\n\nAs this subject is a very much larger one than the residential schools even although it deals with them primarily, I want to put you in possession of my own views stated as clearly as possible where I agree and disagree with the article written by Mr. Hives.\n\n1. There can be no question now that trapping hunting and fishing no longer holds out any prospect of a livelihood for the Indians in Northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The change to civilized conditions surrounding the Indian reserves is coming very rapidly.\n\n2. The results of spending $49,000 in these three residential schools of Lac la Ronge, MacKay, and Onion Lake, is wholly inadequate, and that through no fault of the staffs of these schools.\n\n3. The intermarriage going on in these small bands of Indians will soon reduce them to a thoroughly unwholesome state leading to extinction.\n\n4. The salvaging of the product of these three residence schools is agriculture and taking them away from present tribal relationships.\n\nThus far I agree wholly with what Mr. Hives says. The point on which I disagree are as follows:\n\n(a) We do not need another educational institution in the vicinity of Prince Albert.\n\n(b) Nothing of an expensive permanent and modern character is needed at all.\n(c) I doubt if accommodation is needed for anything like two hundred pupils.\n\n(d) I disagree entirely from the suggestion to change the school in Lac la Ronge in any way whatever, unless it is to increase it to one hundred and twenty pupils.\n\nNow let me outline what I think would fully meet all Mr. Hives suggestions without the drawbacks I have objected to.\n\nI. If it is for the advancement of their children, John Smith's band twenty miles from Prince Albert could easily be induced to move over to James Smith's, Fort la Corne Reserve.\n\nII. On the thirty odd square miles of John Smith's Reserve, erect buildings of a non permanent character.\n\nIII. Take all the graduates of these three schools, Lac la Ronge, Onion Lake and MacKay, both boys and girls, and put them into this non permanent institution under a good Principal, with a good matron and a good farm instructor, and no other help.\n\nIV. Survey the whole reserve into 100 acre lots and let the young fellows do the actual farm work on each plot under the direction of the Principal and farm instructor, holding out to them the inducement as a prize that if their three years instruction work is well done they should be put in a little cottage with a minimum of implements necessary to start on their own.\n\nV. While this period of three or four years training for the young men is going on, the corresponding number of girls under the direction of the matron should be doing all the house work, and a sufficient number of four-holed stoves should be provided that all the cooking should be done for the institution in exactly the same way they will do it in their own cottages. In the same way with the washing and mending. All electric appliances and new-fangled methods now supplied to the Indian schools should be absolutely taboo and they should be required to do everything exactly as we expect them to do it in the cottages.\n\nVI. Then bring all sorts of moral pressure to bear that the young men at the end of their course should select one or other of these girls so trained, and start in on their own hundred acres.\nVII. The temporary buildings should be only large enough to take the average graduation of these three schools and should be so constructed as to last for the estimated time of filling up the whole reserve in the method described above. In other words the number of hundred acre plots less common hay lands divided by the average number of male graduates of these three schools would give the number of years the buildings would be required.\n\nAll this should be held out to the pupils of the present residential schools as a prize to be worked for and earned, and in a very little while the Indian problem would gradually solve itself. We do not want a fourth residential school, but we do want this training school to gather in the results of the teaching in the three residential schools.\n\nIt need not cost a great deal, in fact the less it costs down to the level of three instructors and little farm cottages, the better. I sincerely hope that an attempt will be made this coming summer to put such a scheme into operation on John Smith's Reserve.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nG. E.

Scott, M.A., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn September 7th, I forwarded to you a copy of a letter which the Rev. C. E. Hives, Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, had prepared in response to a request from Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, dealing with the question of the condition of the Indians in northern Saskatchewan. This letter was accompanied by a copy of my own covering letter, dated September 6th, which I forwarded to the Indian Commissioner at the same time.\n\nWhen striking off a copy of Mr. Hives' letter for you, I had an extra copy struck off at the same time for the Bishop of Saskatchewan, as I knew that he was deeply interested in the Indian peoples in his Diocese, and that it was due to him to be informed of the suggestions which Mr. Hives' letter contained.\n\nThe Bishop, after receiving this communication, addressed a letter to the Indian Commissioner on November 27th, and very kindly forwarded a copy of the same to me. I presented this letter to our Commission at a meeting held on the 4th inst., and was instructed to forward a copy of the same to you for your information, and you will find this copy enclosed herewith.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to giving the Indian Graduates from Residential Schools in Saskatchewan some training in farming and an opportunity to start in farming.\n\nThis matter was brought up at the Mission Board on the 19th instant, and the suggestion of the Bishop of Saskatchewan was again commended. This suggestion deals with the possibility of establishing an Agricultural School, at John Smith's reserve, or at some other point, somewhere within reasonable distance of Prince Albert.\n\nThe idea is to give to each graduate of a residential School who has satisfactorily gone through the course at the Agricultural School, a plot of land of say 120 acres. The pupils should be moved from the Residential School to the Agricultural School at about the age of sixteen. It is thought that the buildings need not be of a very expensive character, but rather of such a kind as would teach them to carry on the best type of home which they could reasonably expect to have in the future.\n\nThis suggestion does not mean that we wish the land to be expropriated from any Indians who wish to keep it, but that some arrangement should be made with the Indians which would be acceptable to them.\n\nOf course there would be many details to be worked out, but we are not attempting to do this until we know that the Department agrees with the general principles of the scheme.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFebruary 22nd, 1930\nOttawa, March 3, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to a colony of graduates of Church of England Indian residential schools.

C., 32-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man., dated October 21, 1935.\n\nNew School for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe need of this institution was set before you in my letter of February 18th, last, in the following terms:\n\n\"In the Province of Saskatchewan, for instance, I note from the report of your Department for the year ended March 31st, 1934, (page 64) that the number of Anglican Indians in that Province is 3,904, and the number of Roman Catholic Indians is 6,637. From the same Report (page 64) I note that the number of Anglican Indian Residential Schools in that Province is 3, while the number of Roman Catholic Schools of the same class is 9. If a correct proportion was maintained the number of Anglican Indian Residential Schools would be at least 3 to the 9 provided for the Roman Catholics. If the Roman Catholics contend, as I have heard they do, that they should have a school for every Protestant School, whether Anglican, United Church or Presbyterian, then the figures given in the Report for 1934 (page 64) namely -\n\nAnglicans . . . . . . 3,904\nUnited Church . . . . 1,111\nPresbyterian . . . . . 165\n\na total of 5,179 against the 6,637 listed as Roman Catholics, clearly indicate that the number of Protestant Indian Residential Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan should be at least 3 when the Roman Catholics have 9. At present the Protestant Churches have only 5 or little more than half the number to which they are entitled if a fair proportion is to be maintained between the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches\".\n\nIt is the desire of our Society that this school should be centrally located, possibly on the John Smith Reserve or adjacent centre. From information received from our Church's missionaries, and the authorities in the Diocese of Saskatchewan, it is clear that there is a sufficiently large Anglican Indian population to justify the building of a school with a capacity of not less than 150 pupils. I have before me a list of the Reserves and Indian centres showing the location of at least 150 Anglican Indian children, for whom no Indian Residential School facilities are available. As the R.C. Church has been provided with 9 schools for 6,637 Indians, it does not appear to be fair that the Church of England should be left with only 3 schools for 3,904 Indians who are adherents of our Church.\"\nJanuary 18th, 1936.\n\nBishopthorpe,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Davis:\n\nFollowing up our conversation of yesterday I submit\nthe data regarding the urgent necessity for the erection of an\nAnglican Indian Residential School in the Prince Albert area.\n\nIndian population of Saskatchewan - Proportion - Residential Schools\n\n| Anglican | Roman Catholic |\n|----------|----------------|\n| 3904     | 5627           |\n| 3        | 4.3            |\n\nIt will readily be seen that the proportion of\nAnglican Schools is only 50% of what it should be in accordance\nwith population.\n\nThe situation in northern Saskatchewan is as follows:\n\n| Anglican Schools - Pupils | Roman Catholic - Pupils |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Lac la Ronge              | Beauval                 |\n| 126                       | 94                      |\n| Onion Lake                | Onion Lake              |\n| 114                       | 133                     |\n| Delmas                    | Delmas                  |\n| Duck Lake                 | Duck Lake               |\n|                           |                         |\n| 240                       | 513                     |\n\nNot only is there no school for the Anglican reserves in\ncentral Saskatchewan but the Anglican school at the Pas, which\nwas burned down, has not been replaced.\n\nThe reserves to be served by a Residential School\nin the Prince Albert area are as follows:\n\n| Reserve         | Anglican population |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Sturgeon Lake   | 126                 |\n| Big River       | 67                  |\n| Chetler         | 15                  |\n| Ahtahakoope     | 264                 |\n| John Smith's    | 172                 |\n| James Smith's   | 318                 |\n| Red Earth       | 163                 |\n| Shoal Lake      | 96                  |\n| Cumberland      | 106                 |\n|                 | **Total:**          |\n|                 | **1310**            |\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Diocese as seen in the\nattached resolution, suggest that facilities be arranged for\nindustrial and high school education.

Further, the provision of teachers for the Anglican day schools in the diocese of Saskatchewan is in the hands of His Lordship.\n\nEven if funds were available for its purchase, I doubt if the building formerly operated as a ladies' college at Prince Albert would prove suitable for Indian residential school purposes. Besides, there is no land connected therewith, for farm purposes.\n\nHonourable T. C. Davis,\nAttorney General,\nRegina,\nSask.\nfarm purposes. Should the Department favourably consider the request of His Lordship for the establishment of an Indian residential school for the Anglican Indian children in the Prince Albert area, it would involve the closing of several of the day schools which have been in operation for many years and have been quite successful. In addition, considerable capital expenditure would be necessary, and it is not possible to provide the funds for this purpose at the present time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n598. J. A. Currie\nDIocese OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nVen. W. E. J. Paul, B.A., LL.B.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan\n\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\n\nMarch 12th, 1936.\n\nHon. T. C. Davis,\nAttorney General,\nRegina.\n\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nThe Bishop was here for a few days this week and left for the coast yesterday.\n\nAs he is not yet well, he asked me to answer your letter of Feb. 6th, re the proposed Indian Residential School in the Prince Albert area.\n\nHe has noted the contents of the Superintendent General's letter to you, and wished me to say that he would not propose the establishment of a Residential School instead of the Day Schools, which are doing good work. But that we feel that the Residential School is needed in addition, and for the following reasons:\n\n1. Onion Lake Anglican School is more than full, and has a waiting list. This school could be filled from the Onion Lake and Battleford Agencies, but at present they have 17 pupils from the Carlton Agency, and 17 from the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nWe feel that these 34 children could well be accommodated at a school in the Prince Albert area.\n\n2. At John Smith's Reserve 11 children are attending residential schools, and of these nine are at United Church schools, one at an Anglican School, and one at a Roman Catholic School.\n\nTherefore we feel that this Reserve would send ten or more children to such a school as is proposed, as some of the children live about four miles from the Day School.\n\n3. James Smith's Reserve is sending some 30 or more children to residential schools besides those attending Onion Lake.\n\n4. Cumberland Reserve has 26 children of school age, and no day school. The Mackay School at The Pas was very convenient for them.\nfor them, but since it was burnt they need a school. Since the parents live by trapping, a residential school within reach would meet the need better than a day school. Some of these children could come to the proposed new school.\n\n5. Lac la Ronge School is more than full, and needs all its accommodation for children from the Lac la Ronge, Stanley and Pelican Narrows bands.\n\n6. There are belonging to the Reserves in the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies on which the Anglican Church is working; according to the census contained in the Indian Department Report of 1934, 387 children of school age.\n\nOf these 219 are on the roll of the day schools and about 100 at residential schools, leaving about 78 unprovided for, in most cases because they are too far from a day school to attend.\n\nI should add that that part of the Pas Agency which is in the Province of Saskatchewan is included in above figures.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the school we requested would have at least 150 pupils without closing any of the Day Schools, and if it were established near Prince Albert, the senior pupils would have the opportunity of High School education.\n\nWe also thought it would be possible at such a school to introduce industrial education, in order to help the Indians to become self-supporting and independent.\n\nThanking you for the interest you are taking in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) W. E. J. Paul\n\nCommissary for the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\nRegina, Sask.,\nMarch 14th, 1936.\n\nHon. T. A. Crerar,\nSuperintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI wish you would refer to your letter to me of January 27th, in connection with the application of the Bishop of Saskatchewan for the establishment of a residential school for Indians at Prince Albert.\n\nI sent your letter on to the Bishop, but, unfortunately, he was away ill, and just returned the other day, when my letter was replied to by Archdeacon Paul, under date of March 12th, which letter I enclose herewith.\n\nI would be glad if you would return this with your comments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

Paul, Prince Albert, Sask., relative to the request made in January, last, by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, for the establishment of a residential school, to be conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church at Prince Albert.\n\nI have noted Archdeacon Paul's opinion, that owing to an increased population on the reserves that would be benefited by the establishment of a residential school, there would be a sufficient number of Anglican Indian children to fill the school, over and above the accommodation now provided in the present day schools in operation on the reserves in the Carlton, Battleford, Duck Lake and Pas agencies.\n\nThe problem of providing educational facilities for the increasing number of children on a large number of the reserves will have to be met in the near future. Owing, however, at the present time, to the need of effecting every economy in expenditure, it will not be possible to give favourable consideration to the request of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Venerable Archdeacon Paul, to provide the funds required in the establishment of a residential school in the Prince Albert area. The request of His Lordship will be kept in mind, in connection with any extension in the educational facilities for the Indian children in the Prince Albert area.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable T. C. Davis,\nAttorney General,\nRegina, Sask.\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND\nIN CANADA\n\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, 5, Ont.,\nJanuary 13, 1943.\n\nThe Hon. T. A. Crear,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe very greatly appreciate your kindness in meeting our deputation yesterday and in taking the time in your busy life to go so carefully and sympathetically into the subjects which we laid before you. In accordance with your request we are now writing to give further details regarding the Prince Albert proposal.\n\nWe are greatly concerned about the children on the Indian reserves in the neighbourhood of Prince Albert. Within a radius of a hundred miles of that city there are, as you know, ten reserves, namely:\n\nMontreal Lake\nLittle Red River\nSturgeon Lake\nSandy Lake\nMistawasis\nRound Plain\nJohn Smith's\nFort a la Corne\nDuck Lake\nChagonesse\n\nOn these reserves there are some 400 Indian families affiliated with the Church of England.\n\nWhile there are day schools on most of these reserves they do not fully meet the needs of the children. This is true partly because many of the children live at such distances from the schools as to make it impossible for them to attend them; partly because some of them lack parental control in their homes; and partly because some of them have lost their parents. Furthermore, among these children who are attending the day schools there are those who are qualified and anxious to continue their studies in grades higher than are now provided by the day schools but for whom there is not now an opportunity. For these children we believe there is urgent need for residential school accommodation.\n\nAt present there are two residential schools in northern Saskatchewan under the direction of the Church of England. The first is at Lac la Ronge, some 200 miles to the north of Prince Albert. It is not readily accessible to children from the Prince Albert area; furthermore it is already filled with children from the Stanley reserve and the area to the north. The second is situated at Onion Lake, 220 miles west of Prince Albert. It is already overcrowded and many of the children from the Onion Lake and Battleford Agencies have to be excluded.\n\nFurthermore -\nFurthermore, we would point out that the Indians on these reserves around Prince Albert - that is to say in the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies - are mixing more and more with white people. They are working for whites and doing business with them in stores where Cree is not spoken. This practice is bound to increase rather than decrease. It is important therefore that the Indians, in order to adjust themselves to this situation, should be familiar with English and able to manage their business affairs.\n\nIn view of these considerations we feel that there is urgent need for additional residential school accommodation for Anglican children in this area. We wish to ask therefore that provision be made for an additional residential school for Anglican children and that it be located in Prince Albert.\n\nWe believe that the advantages of a school in this location would include the following:\n\n1. It would provide more adequate accommodation for Anglican children in Northern Saskatchewan. The returns for this area show that in proportion to their numbers there is not sufficient accommodation at present.\n\n2. It would make elementary education available for those younger children on the ten reserves who, for a variety of reasons, cannot be accommodated in the day schools.\n\n3. It would enable promising students in the day schools on the reserves to have the opportunity of further training in High School grades, and especially in manual training and domestic science.\n\n4. It would be within sufficiently easy reach of the children's homes to enable them to go home for holidays.\n\nWe would further propose and recommend that such a school be housed in a building already available in Prince Albert, known as St. George's, formerly a residential school for girls. This building is the property of the Diocese of Saskatchewan. It is situated on a piece of land measuring 250 feet by 250 feet, on a hill overlooking the city, and quite near the Prince Albert Collegiate High School.\n\nWe believe this building and property would be well suited to the purposes of the school. The building is of brick construction throughout. The cubic contents are 234,800 cubic feet. It is 46 ft. high and has two wings measuring 79' x 32' and 72' x 39' respectively. It is equipped with steam heating, hot water, sanitary plumbing and electric light. It would accommodate from 75 to 100 children and necessary staff. It is in good repair throughout, but would require certain plastering, redecorating, etc., that would not cost more than $2,000.\n\nThe property, as stated, belongs to the Diocese of Saskatchewan. If the Government should prefer to take\n\np.t.o.\nit over, it would be available at a reasonable valuation. If the Government should prefer that it remain in the possession of the Church, it would be available at a rental to be agreed upon.\n\nWe are anxious then to commend and recommend this proposal to your sympathetic and favourable consideration. We feel sure that it would prove a great gain to the Indians of the Prince Albert area. And we feel sure also that the service to the Indians which it would make possible - and at a relatively small initial cost - would be fully in keeping with the existing policies of the Government in furthering the welfare of its Indian wards.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.)

The limited funds, however, at the disposal of the Department for the construction of new buildings in recent years, coupled with the fact that Indian day schools have been established on a large number of the reserves in the Prince Albert district, has resulted in the postponement, from time to time, of a definite decision on this matter. I feel sure you will agree with me that conditions confronting us at the moment are even more difficult and exacting than the conditions confronting my immediate predecessors.\n\nYou are aware, no doubt, that a number of Indian day and residential schools have been destroyed by fire in recent years. I refer particularly to the Carcross Residential School and to the classroom buildings at the Alberni and File Hills Residential Schools. The large senior day school building on the Caughnawaga Reserve was also recently destroyed by fire. The officials feel - and I am disposed to agree with them - that the reserves where these schools were in operation should have the first claim on any funds that may be available in the immediate future.

It would appear, therefore, that the operation of the school at Prince Albert cannot as a practical proposal be seriously considered at this time. I am disposed to think, however, that the matter is one that might be carefully reviewed when the extension of our building program is under consideration in the immediate post-war period. It would appear that at that time we shall have at our disposal large quantities of surplus building materials, equipment and supplies, which might be very profitably used in providing additional educational facilities for our Indian population.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nOttawa, January 22, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Operation of St. George's Anglican School, Prince Albert, as Indian Residential School.\n\nI am returning herewith letter received by the Minister from the Reverend Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., D.D., and the Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan, the Right Reverend Henry D. Martin.\n\nIn this letter both Canon Dixon and Bishop Martin discuss the desirability of establishing a residential school for Indian pupils of the Anglican faith in northern Saskatchewan, particularly pupils of the reserve in close proximity to the city of Prince Albert. It is emphasized in the letter that there are 400 Indian families affiliated with the Church of England on 10 Indian reserves in the Prince Albert district.\n\nThe records here indicate that the question of establishing a residential school in the Prince Albert district has been under consideration by the Department for at least 25 years. Late Commissioner Graham, in a letter dated April 15, 1920, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, strongly advocated the establishment of such a school.\n\nIf it is the policy and intention of the Government to establish and operate additional residential schools, the claims of the Prince Albert district for such a school are certainly as urgent as any other district with which we are familiar. The officials of this Branch are convinced, however, that we should first aim at the rebuilding of the Indian day and residential schools recently destroyed by fire. These officials have in mind the Carcross Residential School (Anglican), the classroom buildings at the Alberni and File Hills Residential Schools and the Back Settlement Day School, in the Carcross Agency.\nOntario, and also the large senior school on the Caughnawaga Reserve, Quebec. The cost of operating the Anglican Ladies' College at Prince Albert as a residential school would amount to approximately $20,000.00 per annum, a sum almost equal to the amount necessary for the construction of classrooms at Alberni and File Hills. I should state also that no provision has been made in the 1943-44 estimates for the amount required to operate an additional residential school. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, I do not feel that the proposal submitted by Canon Dixon and Bishop Martin can be seriously considered at this time.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 11,\nOttawa, January 28, 1945.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 13, in which you and Bishop Martin submit, for departmental consideration, a summary of a plan for the operation of the St. George's College at Prince Albert as an Indian residential school.\n\nI was interested to learn from the records here that the desirability of establishing an Indian residential school in the Prince Albert area has been under consideration by succeeding Ministers for a period of at least 25 years.

He says there are about twenty-five children of school age and he would like to know whether the Department would furnish the necessary school material and also mentions the sum of Five Dollars per week during the school term to furnish them with a noon meal.\n\nI wrote him to the effect that I thought the Department would be willing to furnish him the school material, but I doubted the wisdom of establishing a noon meal on such a small reserve. However, I would like the opinion of the Department on this proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTP/JM.\n\n23 children of school age\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWhat answer shall I make to the Rev. Mr. Ferrier regarding the establishment of a day school for the Paul Band? The census returns show that there are 23 children of school age there. These Indians are Stones and out of a total population of 152, 131 are Methodists and the remainder are Roman Catholics. If a school is established there it should be under the charge of the Methodist Church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.B. [Signature]\n\nHave a word with Mr. Ferrier.\n\nHas a building?\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 6, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo regarding the establishment of a day school for the Paul Band in the Edmonton Agency I beg to say that the Department is making inquiries and as soon as a reply is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nDept. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, March 6, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nAn application has been made for the establishment of a day school for the Paul Band in the Edmonton Agency and, in order that the matter may be dealt with, the Department would like you to make a full report on the number of children of school age on the reserve, exclusive of those who are at residential schools, placing them under the religious denominations to which they belong. The Department would also like you to express your opinion as to the probable success of a day school if one were established there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of above letter and to say that I have been expecting such an one for some time for the reason that Mr. Clements and others are much in favor of this scheme Mr. Clements going so far as to tell the Indians not to send their children to the boarding school as if they keep them at home the Department will have to build a day school. The Department knows Mr. Clements well and the trouble he has caused in the Wabamun district, without any further comment for me.\n\nThe number of children of school age belonging to the Methodist church are 15 and to the Catholic denomination 9 all for whom boarding and other schools are provided.\n\nSo far as day schools are concerned I am in a position to speak with knowledge and experience for I taught an Indian day school on the Blackfoot reserve from Jan. 1896 to Dec. 1898 and it is not too little to say that the whole thing was an absolute farce. The children make no progress worth speaking of in their studies, mostly because of their erratic and irregular attendance. Their moral training is impossible whilst living in the camp and the endeavour to inculcate the white man's methods to children under the direct influence of their Indian parents is out of the question, ergo the establishment of a day school on the Paul's reserve would from my view point prove a failure.\nThat these children urgently need training is most evident but I would prefer to see them in an industrial school and kept there from the time they entered till of an age to be discharged. I do not believe in the long holidays spent in the camps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith further reference to the application made by Rev. Mr. Ferrier for the establishment of a day school for the Paul Band I beg to say that Mr. Agent Race, who was written to on this subject, has sent in a report, which is not in favour of the establishment of a day school on this reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, March 25, 1915.\nMarch 31st, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nReferring to your communication of February 13th, last, in regard to the establishment of a day school on Paul's Reserve, I beg to say that after giving this matter full consideration I am of opinion that it is in the best interests of the Methodist children on this reserve that they should be sent to the Red Deer Industrial School.\n\nRev. Mr. Clements in his letter to you stated that there were about 25 children of school age, but in a report recently received from the Indian Agent he states that there are only 15. I hardly think that a day school would be a success.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhen speaking to you of the trouble that has arisen at Paul's Reserve, between your farming instructor and Mr. Clements, the question of building a Boarding School for the Roman Catholics was not entered into.\n\nFrom all the facts in the case, I do not think there could be any justification for giving a grant to build a day school to be placed under the management and control of the Roman Catholic Church. If it is an absolute necessity that there be a day school there, the Methodist Church is prepared to handle it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./J.M.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFerrier\nAugust 17th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the situation of Paul's Reserve, and note what you say with reference to the establishment of schools in this locality.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Mr. Clement wanted me to make application to supply a hot meal at noon, and I wrote him to the effect that the Department would not entertain such a proposition among such a small number of people. I will write him and let him know the decision of the Department.\n\nT. Ferrier,\nDuffield, Alta.\nJuly 26, 1917\n\nRe Day School on Paul's Reserve\n\nDear Mr. Dewitt,\n\nI hereby make application for the following whereby I wish to operate the day school which has been authorized by the Indian Department at Edmonton.\n\n- 2 outdoor closets\n- 1 well\n- 1 complete set of kindergarten material\n- \u00bd dozen slates\n- 3 \u00d7 \" brushes (blackboard)\n- 6 \u00bd yds Blackboard cloth\n- 2 boxes white crayon\n- 1 box colored crayon\n- \u00bc wash basin\n- 1 quantity of soap - \u00bd lb cost $1.50\n- 1 quantity of towelling - 12 yds\n- 1 numerical frame (hand)\n- 2 boxes slate pencils\n- 1 \" lead \"\n- 1 map of Canada\n- 1 \" Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba\"\n\n(Registry of alphabet)\n\n1 stamping outfit (large cutters types)\n2 doz. large sheet white cardboard\n10 dozen from Arabic - 1\u00bd\n\u00bd doz. drinking cups\n2 jugs 9 quarts\nI shall also need a quantity of disinfectant, sufficient to sprinkle floor as three pints each to cleaned Indians I have seen.\n\nI shall also be glad to know what arrangements can be made as to sweeping and scrubbing the floor.

Mr. Dodson gave us first-class service as teacher in the Red River Industrial School and he has been stationed at Paul's Nosewa, Alta., with the hope that he will be able to make a success of this day school. The Department will no doubt assist him in every way possible so that we will give him all the encouragement within our power. To this end, I trust that this request will receive favorable consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

It has been in operation for the last two years and taught by our missionary. When Mr. Arnpup and myself were in Mr. Scott's office last May this was one of the items of business that we discussed and it was agreed that we should send a first-class teacher there and give it a fair trial. This we have done in the person of F. J. Dodson, who is one of our most resourceful and successful teachers. He has given us excellent service at the Red Deer Institute for several years.\n\nIt is just possible that I overlooked writing the Department regarding this school after my visit to Ottawa, but it was consented to by Mr. Scott.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GF\nOttawa, August 28, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in further reference to the day school on Paul's Reserve, Alberta.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. F. J. Dodson, and it is hoped that he will meet with every success in his work at this point and that a good attendance will be maintained.\n\nThe Department would like to be informed as to what arrangement you have made with Mr. Dodson regarding salary and the amount that he should receive.\n\nA supply of school material is being requisitioned from the Government Stationary Office to be sent Mr. Dodson and the agent will be instructed to purchase the other supplies required.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, August 28, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Mr. F. J. Dodson as teacher of the day school for the Paul's Band in the Edmonton Agency. This appointment was made at the request of the Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools.\n\nIt is the wish of the Department to give the school at this point a fair trial and it is hoped that you will grant Mr. Dodson every assistance in your power to that end. You will be informed later as to the amount of salary to be paid the teacher for his services. Requisitions have been received from Mr. Dodson for the school material and supplies required by him and the articles considered necessary have been ordered to be sent to the teacher from the Government Stationary Office.\n\nYou will be good enough to purchase the following articles for the use of this school and see that they are delivered as soon as possible, namely, two dozen slates, two wash basins, two pounds of castile soap, twelve yards of towelling, six drinking cups, two granite pails and also a small quantity of disinfectant to sprinkle the floors.\n\nThe Department will allow a salary at the\n\nGeo. H. Rice, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nrate of $30.00 per year for janitor's services and you will be good enough, after consultation with the teacher, to secure the services of a competent Indian to do this work. He will be expected to do the sweeping and scrubbing of floors at regular intervals and light the fires during the winter. Vouchers in payment for this service should be forwarded by you at the end of each quarter.\n\nYou will also be good enough to instruct the teacher to forward quarterly returns promptly at the end of the quarter through your office for transmission to the Department.\n\nMr. Dodson has also requested that an outdoor closet be built for the school and you will be good enough to state the cost of erecting a suitable building for this purpose.\n\nIt is considered that some arrangement can be made to secure the water required for the use of the school as the Department has no funds to have a well bored at the present time.\n\nWith reference to the complete set of Kindergarten material asked for by the teacher, I have to request that you will be good enough to have Mr. Dodson make a list of the various articles which he requires, and upon receipt of this information a reasonable quantity of Kindergarten material will be provided.\n\nKindly give these matters your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir,\n\nIn reference to above letter I beg to say that immediately on receipt of same I paid a visit to the Methodist mission on the Paul Reserve and found Mr. Dobson the Teacher in residence and he had the school open and 13 children were present. There were 15 on the roll.\n\nMr. Dobson seems to be a competent teacher and it is my opinion that the children\u2014if they attend regularly\u2014will make some progress in the way of learning to speak English and possibly learn other things too. I notice he has no proper register for recording the attendance of the school pupils. This is necessary; perhaps one could be supplied with the other stationary to be sent from Ottawa.\n\nThe slates, wash basins &c mentioned in above letter were all ordered from Connell & Co. of Edmonton who will send them all in one lot by express to Duffield Station at once\u2014probably they are there now.\n\nIt was suggested by me that one of the larger boys be selected to act as janitor for the school to do the necessary work about the place as mentioned and Mr. Dobson agreed with me that it would be preferable to having any one else.\n\nThe erection of two closets for use of the pupils was taken up and the carpenters who are now doing some work on the mission house are to let me know what they will cost and later I will write again.\n\nThere is a well in connection with the Mission house and some 300 yards from the school from which water can be procured. It will not hurt the children to carry\nwhat water is need that distance.\n\nA list of Kindergarten material is to be supplied by Mr. Dobson which will be sent on as soon as received.\n\nThe following things are also asked for:\n- Biscuits for the pupils as used to be customary with the day schools,\n- A cupboard for the keeping of books and school materials,\n- Blackboard cloth about 8 yards by 1 yard wide,\n- 12 lights or glass,\n- 12\" x 10\" to repair broken and cracked windows,\n- A broom, dust pan and axe and a water barrel.\n\nThe question of fuel was also raised by the Teacher; he asks for 10 cords of firewood and about 5 tons of coal.\n\nIt was also mentioned that there were some small school desks at the Red Deer School which could be shipped up to Duffield if the Department would pay the freight on same. The desks now in the school are too high for the smaller children.\n\nA supply of Day school quarterly return forms will also be needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n---\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant containing a report of the recent visit made by you to the Methodist School on the Paul's Reserve, and requesting that some further supplies be provided for the use of this school.\n\nWith reference to the erection of two closets, I beg to say that the Department will await your report regarding the cost of erecting a suitable building for this purpose. You should have the carpenters build a cupboard in the school-room in which to keep the books and other school material. A suitable cupboard with a lock and key should be built, sufficient for the needs of this school, at a price not exceeding $10 or $12. The blackboard cloth will be ordered to be sent from the Government Stationery Office, and you may purchase 12 lights of glass required, and have the windows repaired. You may also purchase 1 broom, a dust-pan, an axe, and a water barrel for this school.\n\nWith reference to the fuel required I beg to say that the Department will furnish the fuel needed for the use of the school-room only, and you may purchase the quantity required. The Department will look to you to make the best arrangements in regard to prices. If the teacher lives in a residence other than in the school, fuel cannot be supplied for his use.\n\nYou may make arrangements to have the small school desks at the Red Deer School shipped for this school, and the Department will pay the freight on same on receipt of properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure. The supply\n\nGeo. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nsupply of quarterly return forms will be sent. I may say that the register has been sent to the teacher addressed, Duffield, Alberta, where other supplies requisitioned for by him will be sent.\n\nWith reference to the biscuits required, I beg to say that you should furnish the Department with an estimate of the quantity that would be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLEAN\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nPermit me to express my appreciation of your kindness and co-operation regarding the Day-school on this Reserve. I am very grateful indeed and will do my utmost to make it a success.\n\nI shall be glad to receive copies of the yearly Blue Book if my name be put on mailing list.\n\nDoes my position as teacher alter the fact that in the eyes of the Department I am \"an outsider\"?\n\nAgain thanking you for your sympathetic interest, I am,\n\nsincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: Salary $600]\nExtract of letter received from Rev.

Original on File 116818-21.\n\n==============================\n\nUpon receipt from Mr. Race of Edmonton, I am sending\n18 of our old school seats to Mr. Dodson of Duffield.\nThese seats have been out of service for some time here\nbut will do for the present at Duffield, and will save\nthe Department any other outlay than that of the freight,\nwhich Mr. Race said the Department would pay.\n\n(Sgd.) J. F.

J.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal,\nIndustrial School,\nRed Deer, Alberta.\nFred J. Dodson\nMissionary Teacher\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been thinking of a plan by which we might help the children of this Reserve Day School. At present there is no mid-day meal provided and nothing is sent to give the children any sort of meal or drink except water.\n\nWe have been giving them some of our own milk from our one cow. At present we are giving them some bread and something on it besides the milk. Just a little to keep them in fair shape to attend school. They take none home of course. The children should not be punished for their parents' sins. Besides this we believe the food they get is a drawing card.\n\nNow, I have thought if the Department would supply us with a cow so that we could have two cows on the property we could exchange values in this way. Have one cow freshen in the spring, the other in the fall. Thus we would have a supply of milk the year round. When the School Cow was dry, the Parsons' cow could provide the milk and vice versa. We would take care of the cow and provide feed for her in exchange for her use and her milk in the exchange of value. Thus the school children would receive good milk all the year round and in addition there would be some for any sick who might be in need of it. One cow cannot be expected to furnish milk and butter for our own family and the children as well. This plan might be feasible in lieu of a mid-day meal. There is pasture sufficient on the Church Property for two cows and winter food can easily be secured here on the Reserve. Then if we were given some biscuits we could get along very well I think till such time as the school progresses to demand further attention. If this plan meets with your approval I would suggest buying A Jersey cow as it will be milk we will be after not beef or stock.\n\nWe would make some butter, too, which would be used on the biscuits.\n\nI might mention in passing that at present we are holding school in part of our own house as the school building is too cold in winter and it would take too much fuel to warm it up.\n\nHoping to have your thought on the above plan at your earliest convenience, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nEnclosed I beg to forward letter from Mr. Dodson teacher of the Paul Day School in which he asks for a cow, such an animal as he requires will cost in the neighbourhood of $150.\n\nSome time ago I asked for biscuits for the school and it was intimated that they would be supplied. Up to the time of writing none have come to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 17th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a letter from Mr. Dodson, teacher of the Paul's day school, in which he requests that the Department purchase a cow.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is unable to grant his request.\n\nIn regard to supplying biscuits for this school, I would direct your attention to official letter of September 17th, last, in which you were requested to furnish an estimate of the quantity of biscuits required before authorizing these biscuits, the Department must have the above information, also, directions stating to what point they should be shipped.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nGeo. H. Ross, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nRef. letter No.117758-1 of Feb.16th.1918\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above letter re difficulties for the Paul Day School I beg to say that last return had an average attendance of 6.4 so I presume about 100 lbs will last very nearly if not quite 6 months as the average at present is very low only about two a day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. Please address to:\nDr. J.J. Bolen\nSuffield Station, P.C.P.\nAlberta.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to state that the 200 lbs. of biscuit asked for the Paul's Bay School in your estimates for the fiscal year 1918-1919 will be sent to Mr. F. J. Dodson, at Duffield Station, as soon as possible. This quantity is intended to fill the requirements of that school for the entire fiscal year, unless the average attendance increases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Race Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDuffield, Alberta,\nJanuary 30, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Arnup:\n\nIt will be a source of gratification to you as it was to me to know that John House, the one who was so antagonistic towards us last summer, is now working tooth and nail for the good of the school here. He was here this noon also, asking for the children who were not coming, and when he was told he said he would go after them. The other people are coming around to us too. We are so pleased to note the change of atmosphere and we thank God our good Father who is surely guiding us.\n\nThe chief reason, I believe, for the non-attendance of children was the fear that they would be forcibly sent to Red Deer at thirteen years. This fear I have endeavored to dispel though I have told them that it is the best place for them. We have had a good number for this Reserve, though, Mr. Arnup, it is hard for some of school age to come. Some are halt, maimed and almost blind.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Ferrier suggesting that someone be sent to go with me into every home and see things at first hand. Then both Church and State would see things as they really are. I would suggest someone who knows neither the missionary, government officials or Indians,-a total outsider.\n\nI have been wondering whether if some sort of amalgamation could be carried out since the flu has depleted our Indian population so much, it would be better for Reserves and save much money in buildings. We have had only seven deaths on this Reserve from flu. Three of these were Methodists.\n\nAm happy to advise that last week we had a visit from Dr. John Park, Edmonton, re tuberculosis. I think what he found justified our request. Besides the number of victims which he found, and some were off the Reserve and could not be reached, the deaths since we came up here have been ten from this disease alone. Now, this Reserve is only one and so I am hoping for some concerted definite action.\n\nWe are not discouraged as yet with the work. Our progress has been slow but we realize our limitations. We are only ordinary individuals and not geniuses. It is a big job and we earnestly expect your prayers that we may be obedient to the mission. I really think, though, Mr. Arnup, that a school here will never be a notorious success. For one reason there are not enough children. And this awful tuberculosis is making such havoc with the people. The\nchildren are certain to get the infection. I would suggest careful consideration re this Reserve ere anything definite is decided upon. But the school is picking up this year and we hope for better results than last year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Fred J. Dodson.\nFebruary 4th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn view of the number of letters of different character which we sometimes receive from men who are working under conditions of isolation and difficulty on Indian Reserves, I thought you would be interested in the enclosed copy of a letter from Mr. F. J. Dodson, from the Paul's Reserve, at Duffield, Alberta.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJHA/M\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nFebruary 26, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have read with interest letter from Mr. F. J. Dodson, dated the 30th of January, which you kindly sent me under cover of your letter of the 4th of February. I had also read carefully Dr. J. Parks' report. I was surprised to see that there were a considerable number of healthy Indians on the Poveshull reserve there are, of course, some cases that should be attended to; and it is my intention to take action at once to relieve the situation as far as possible. I was struck with what he said about day schools. It is an opinion of growing strength that we are wasting our money on these schools on Indian reserves, and I have a serious intention forming to close them, and to promote the interests of our residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Arnup, B.A.,\nAssistant Secretary,\nForeign Missions,\nThe Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nI wish to express my appreciation of the fact that the feeling and relationships between the Indian Agent, Mr. Hace, and the Farm Instructor, Mr. Pattison and myself as Missionary of the Methodist Church on Paul's Band, are cordial and harmonious. I have always found them willing to co-operate with me in my work.\n\nI also appreciate the Department's forbearance with the Day School on this Reserve. The attendance has been very low, the people are not very interested, and the average for the year ending March 31, 1920 was only 1.5. I would respectfully suggest that if the Department could see its way clear to continue the school till the new Industrial School is opened in Edmonton, or, say till July 1921, and then transfer the pupils to the Industrial School and close the Day School here, for good, I think it would be a wise move.

J. Johnson\nMissionary Teacher\nOttawa, April 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the continuing of the Paul's Day School until the new industrial school is opened in Edmonton.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has delayed replying to your letter until the quarterly return was received for the March quarter, last. The average attendance at this school during the past year has been very small and during the March quarter, last, was less than one.\n\nIt is considered, from the results obtained, that the Department would not be warranted in continuing this school after the end of the present quarter, and it is, therefore, to be closed on that date. The Rev. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, Mr. Agent Ross and Mr. Commissioner Graham are being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Dodson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nPaul's Indian Day School,\nBuffield, Alta.\nOttawa, April 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe returns received from the Paul's Bay School during the past year show that the attendance of Indian children is very small and that the Indians do not avail themselves of the privileges afforded them for the education of their children.\n\nThe Department would not be warranted in continuing the expense involved in carrying on this school, and it has, therefore, been decided to close the school at the end of the present quarter, namely, the 30th of June, next. Mr. Dodson, the teacher, has been informed accordingly, and also the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, and Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The programme we had in view was to keep this school open until the new school was opened in Edmonton and Mr. Dodson the teacher is to be the assistant principal of the Edmonton school. We were in hopes that this policy would bring the bulk of the school age children into the Edmonton school. So my plea is that the Department will give it yet another year that it may bear fruit well and after that it may be cut down.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon\nOttawa, May 18, 1920.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the continuing of the day school on the Paul's Reserve until such time as the new industrial school is open near Edmonton.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report that if the day school is continued the children on the Paul's Reserve would be held in readiness to enter the new industrial school, the Department will consent to the continuance of the Paul's Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GF\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWith the closing of the present month the Day School at Paul's Reserve Duffield, Alta., ceases to exist. This is the decision of the Indian Department of the Federal Government and the Methodist Church (U.S.A.) wish to place on record our deep appreciation of the friendliness and hearty support that has been ours from your Department. During the four years which we have been here we have received very considerate treatment from the Department of Indian Affairs. We have met much kindness and we wish to convey our sincere gratitude for such treatment.\n\nWe also wish to express our appreciation of the cooperation in our work that has been given by Agent Race and Divine Instructor Patterson.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFred J. Dodson\nMissionary Teacher\n\nJune 16, 1921\nWe have been in the Indian work now twelve years and have come to think that there is a missing link in our system.\n\nOur Industrial School graduates almost invariably fail upon their coming home to the Reserve life. This is patent to you and not elaborate upon it. Could some scheme as the following be carried out?\n\nSecure a Reserve for the graduates only, similar in many respects to the Idle Hills Colony Sect. Such Reserve to be under the direct supervision of a sympathetic farmer-missionary who would be a Government appointee but a nominee of the Methodist Church.\n\nIf the Indians from some of the smaller Reserves be moved together, it would leave a Reserve for the colony. Or the land might be secured for the purpose. The colony could be started.\n\nThanking you, personally, for your kindly interest in us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFred. J. Dodson\nOTTAWA, June 24th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in which you state that you are closing the Paul's Indian Day School at the close of the current quarter.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been so small that it would hardly warrant the Department in continuing the school.\n\nYour views regarding the placing of graduates from Industrial and Boarding Schools on a Reserve under direct supervision will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred J.

Dodson, teacher of the Paul's Indian Day School, in which he states that he is closing the school at the end of the current quarter.\n\nAs the attendance at this school has been so small, it would hardly warrant the Department in continuing the school.\n\nThe building should be securely fastened up, and any school supplies on hand should be stored.\n\nMr. Dodson should prepare his quarterly returns up to the end of the present quarter and should forward them through your office in order that payment of salary and bonus due him can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

THUR FARMER\n1140 - 16th Avenue N.W., Calgary, Alta.\nTO CANADIAN INDIANS\n\nJune 5th 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just returned from our Conference gathering in Edmonton. Rev. Mr. Newton, our Missionary at Duffield, west of Edmonton, spoke to me about the old log building in which school has been conducted more or less for many years. This building has also been used for church purposes until recently, when the Methodist Missionary Society, in September 1922, erected a fine church which cost about $2500.00.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge the Government and the Missionary Society have both put grants of money into the old building throughout the years and who owns it I cannot tell. Maybe you have information in your files regarding this. In any case, I am now making a request that the Department allow us to move the building to the back of the reserve so that it may be used as a stable or shed by the Indians. It seems to be quite clear that this building will never be used again for school purposes and as it now stands, it is not only in the way, but will become a menace from the standpoint of fire.\n\nI shall be much obliged if you will give me permission to have this building used as above suggested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Farmer\nSuperintendent of Indian Missions for the Methodist Church.\n\np.s. The building to which I refer is of logs with shingle roof but it is old and not in good repair. Nearly all the logs could be used as I suggest.\n\nA.B.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, requesting permission to move the old log building formerly used for school purposes in connection with the Paul's Indian Day School on the White Whale Lake Reserve to the back of the lot on which the new church building is erected.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring this matter to Mr. Geo. H. Race, Indian Agent, Edmonton, Alta., and requesting him to deal with your request as he considers advisable, and to communicate with you in the matter. This old building will, no doubt, not be required for school purposes in future, as, when the new Edmonton Industrial School is completed, the Methodist Indian children of school age will be sent there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Arthur Burner,\n1140 - 16th Ave. N.W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the Methodist Church authorities requesting permission to move the old log building formerly used for school purposes in connection with Paul's Indian Day School, on the White Whale Lake Reserve, to the back of the lot behind the new church, so that it may be fitted up and used as a stable or shed by the Indians. The Church authorities have erected a new church building, and it would appear that the old log building formerly used for school purposes will not now be required. We are of the opinion that both the Government and the Methodist Missionary Society have put grants of money into building and repairing this old log building, and it is doubtful as to who are the real owners. As the building now stands, it might become a menace from the standpoint of fire.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will look into the request made by the Church authorities for the removal of this old building, and, if you consider that it should be complied with, you should inform the Rev. Arthur Burner, 1140 - 16th Ave., N.W., Calgary, Alta. That letter will be left in the hands of yourself and the Rev. Arthur Burner, to take such action as is deemed advisable. I shall be pleased to be advised at a later date as to what decision you arrived at in this matter, and whether the building has been moved or not.\n\nWhen the new Edmonton Industrial School is completed, the Methodist Indian children of school age from the above named reserve will be sent there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A large stone building has been rented at Birtle; a substantial frame building costing about $1800 at the Crowland, and a stone building costing $1700 (of which the Indian Department contributes $450) well advanced towards completion at the Sile Hills. It is expected that each of these schools will accommodate from 20 to 25 pupils.\n\nWe would support our request for assistance by the following considerations:\n\n1. The\n1. The satisfactory nature of the work done in boarding schools as compared with day schools. On this point the Commissioner says in his last annual report: \"I am disposed to think that more real benefit has accrued to the Indian children from the expenditure of something less than $1500 during the past year in assisting boarding schools than from the sum of $10,500 which approximates our expenditure on Day schools.\n\n2. The fact that aid equal in amount to that for which we ask, and in some cases larger, has already been granted to a considerable number of Indian schools by the Department. Even if our request is granted, the proportion of aid received from the Government will be much less than the Government gives to aid schools for white children in the Territories. Statistics compiled by the Board of Education show that 7/8 per cent of the teachers salaries in these schools is paid by the Government. What we ask is only that the Government pay part of the cost of boarding the children. The Church pays the remainder of the cost of boarding, pays (etc.)\nin a few cases) the whole cost of the buildings, and pays also the whole cost of the teaching.\n\n3. The Dominion Parliament voted money two and a half years ago for the building of an Industrial School for Indians to be placed under the care of the Presbyterian Church. The erection of that building has not been begun yet and we are of opinion that since the Government has been unable to provide us with the promised and needed appliances, we may fairly claim that it should help us to maintain the children in cases where we provide the appliances ourselves. We would therefore respectfully urge upon the Government the advisability of granting assistance to these three schools at the rate of not less than $60 per caput. per annum for the months such schools may be open during the current fiscal year.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\n[Signature]\nThomas Hard [illegible]\n\n[Signature]\nAndrew B.

J. B. Baird on behalf of the Presbyterian Church Mission Board in respect to the capitulation grant for twenty-five pupils at each of the boarding schools proposed to be established at Crowfoot, Butte and File Hills, that in the event of the attendance being less than twenty-five at any one school, and exceeding that number at another, the\nthe grant not acquired in the former case be applied to cover the expenses of the excess of pupils in the latter.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the chief concern in your views in this matter that there need be no difficulty in complying with the request provided that in the returns sent to the Dept. proper references are made from one Return to another for the surplus in one school being paid for in order to make up the deficiency in another, but this action is not to form a precedent for similar procedure in regard to other boarding or day schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDann\nIndian Agents Office\nFort Pelly\n9th February 1869\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report for your information as to the boarding-school in connection with the Cote reserve under the direction of the Presbyterian Church and in the charge of the Revd Geo Laird.\n\nVisited the school on the 24 ultimo and found the building just completed; it is a most comfortable one, lathed and plastered, and well finished inside.\n\nOn the 25 ultimo previous to the relief being issued at Cote I had a long talk with the Indians, and gave them distinctly to understand, that as the Department was willing to go to such a large expense, it was expected.\n\nThe Indian Commr\nRegina.\nExpected that the children would attend the school, and this at the opening.\n\nOn the 28th ultimo the school was opened with an attendance of 21 pupils; on the 8th I again visited the school, and found an attendance of 29. This I think is as large a number as can be housed in the building; the children looked clean tidy, and seemed perfectly happy; no doubt the number can be increased, if they had greater accommodations. Mr. Laire is anxious to get the old school house on the reserve, so as to remove it to his school house; I told Mr. Laire I had no objection, but on giving the matter some after thought, I do not think it would be advisable, for the reason that the Indians of the Reserve have some claim to it viz., in cutting the logs, and it is their timber.\n\nFurther.\nThe terms addressed appearing to be valid, the appeal for consideration of this consent to removal has been approved. He has been told that such consent should not have been given in the first instance without reference to the Dept.\n\nFurther, they do not like to have a building once on their reserve removed from it; it would give them a chance for a big grievance. A secondary consideration is that it will be required in the spring for our own use, there being no other vacant building.\n\nThey could not remove the old school, plaster it, and have it fit to occupy before 2 or 3 months, so they would have to wait until spring. So far as the logs are concerned, others could be got out in time at a nominal cost, whereas, if they get the old school, they will expect it for nothing.\n\nIn regard to the excess of that number provided for by the order in Council, I hope you will be able to extend to them the same privileges, if not, I should think the Presbyterian church refuse to take more than the number first mentioned, we authorized the Presbyterian union to apply any unclaimed portion of the grant above to supply deficiencies elsewhere, but that no increase of that kind seems probable, all this matters being if you think it would not establish a precedent.\nAgent has been told that Drifts rule be\nsent to make applications for a list of all sick given by\nit.\n\nActing Agent\n\nI would respectfully\nrequest that you send the children\nsome Girls and Boys' shoes, for the\nuse in early spring, it would prevent\na lot of sickness etc etc.\n\nHave any of the Industrial\nSchools come to share, or will you al-\nlow me to purchase them?\n\nWill you kindly direct that the forms\nbe sent me pertaining to Boarding\nSchools, also copies of any circulars\nbearing upon them, also the agree-\nment there is between the Department\nand them.\n\nShare\netc etc\n\n(Signed) W.E.

The undersigned begs to report, that the assistance of Mr. Browne,\n\nSuperintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\nfunds has been rendered up to the present time by the debt in the construction of buildings used for boarding schools in the N.W.T.

Ch. among the Indians of the N.W., & in connection with an application for a grant towards the erection of a school building at or near Coteo Rlo, you set forth certain considerations for the Ministry to take cognizance of.\n\nThis having been done, the S.G. finds himself unable to accede to the application made in the above behalf as amongst reasons, it is not considered that it\nwe be further to expend such money or buildings situated on land which does not belong to us but as stated. The further matter referred to in Mr. Letter, viz an increased p. c. grant to the Board who conducted under the auspices of the P. C., in connection with what appears to me to warrant the increase being made, I am to remind you that the instructions to us, the larger amount of $100 per pupil is contributed for the Indians type & the best in teaching this larger grant to them regardless of the denominations who conduct them that they should give instruction in trades & other lines of industry therein, whereas no such requirement is made in the case of boarding schools conducted by Mr. & other denominations.\n\nThe S.

Baird respecting grants to Indian Boarding Schools conducted by the Presbyterian Church, in reply thereto I enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to the Reverend Baird on the subject.\nHon Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Synod's Committee on Indian missions to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th inst (No 52/549) and to say that it has received the attention of the Committee.\n\nIn respect to that part of the letter in which you decline to grant assistance to erect a school building for the Crowstand mission adjoining Cote's Reserve on the ground that a Government building ought not to be erected on land not belonging to the Government, I am instructed to say that the Committee is willing to convey to the Government a site for the building in the hope that when this difficulty is removed, the Government will no longer decline to grant assistance to a school which has been so successful and in the case of which the whole cost of the erection of buildings to the amount of $2700 has thus far been borne by the Church without assistance from the Government.\n\nWith this offer we renew our application for a grant of $1000 to be expended in erecting a stone building\u2014ground floor to be used as a school room and the upper floor dormitory for boys.\n\nWe would suggest that the site be selected by the Rev G.A. Laird, the missionary, and Mr Jones, the agent.\nIn respect to the second part of your letter in which you remind us that the Department requires of schools which receive $100 per pupil that they shall give instruction in trades and other lines of industry, whereas no such requirement is made in the case of our schools which receive $60 per pupil, I am instructed to say that neither in efficiency nor in expensiveness of management is there the difference which your letter seems to imply between our schools and those which receive $100 per pupil.\n\nAs far as regards \"trades\" the requirement which you say is exacted of schools of the industrial type is not complied with - and if it were it would be a matter for regret. Many of the pupils in these schools are girls to whom it is not desirable to teach trades. Of the boys a considerable proportion are under the age of twelve years and so too young to learn trades; and further, we venture to call your attention to the fact that in some of the schools which receive $100 per pupil not even a pretense is made of teaching trades.\n\nAs regards \"other lines of industry,\" a great prominence is given in our schools to this department; and the utmost pains are taken by providing careful, patient and well qualified instructors, to give Indian children the training without which no amount of book learning would be of permanent advantage to them. The children in our schools receive instruction in industrial pur-\nYour letter seems to imply that the larger grant is given to schools in which more expensive teaching is given. At present that is not the case. An examination of the recently published report of the Indian Department will show that no teachers receive higher salaries than those in schools under the care of the Presbyterian Church and presumably, the teaching is not less efficient.\n\nWe hope therefore that in view of these facts and in view of the considerations indicated in my former letter, the present discrimination against the Presbyterian Church will be removed and the grant to the before named schools increased from $60 to $100 per pupil.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nHon Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAndrew B. Baird\n\nSupt General Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ONT.\nRev. A. B. Baird B.A.\nWinnepeg,\nMan.\n\nMarch 8, 1890\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor\nby direction of the late\nLord of Indian Affairs\nto act in the name of\nthe Church of the South,\nundertaking the collection\nfor the Church in Canada\nfor funds towards\nthe work of that\nChurch among the\nIndians of the North\nWest; and I am\nto state that all\nthe Estimates for the\npresent and ensuing\nyear have been settled.\n\n[Signature]\nthat no further change can be made this year.\n\nThe undersigned\n\ntherefore request that he is not in a position to comply with your application at present.\n\n[Signature]\nWinnipeg, 7th April, 1890\n\nMy dear Dewdney:\n\nI wish to draw your attention to a request recently made by the Presbyterian Church for an increase from $60 to $100 for pupils in the Indian Schools and also for a grant of $1000 to erect a school building at Fort Pelly. I trust that you will manage to meet their views in this matter and bring the amounts down in the supplementary estimates.\n\nWith regard to the extra grant to pupils I understand that the ground taken by the Government is that the Anglican and Roman Catholic schools which are receiving grants of $100 per pupil are getting it on the ground that they are teaching the children trades as well as giving them other education. The fact remains however and I think has been placed before you that many of the children in these schools are girls and many of the boys are too young to learn trades, yet the $100 is given for each pupil. I also understand that the Presbyterians offer to teach trades to whom they can be taught in other schools.\n\nI think you are aware that the Presbyterians have done really more work without Government aid than any other religious body and I trust that in both requests they have made you will be able to meet their views.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHon. K.D. Woney,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: Mr. Vanhoutte, Esq., Department of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, 10 Oct. 1893\n\nLetter of Mr. Smith referred to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Scott\nSir,\n\nI am instructed to acknowledge the receipt through Mr Hayter Read of the letter in which you state that you fear you will be unable at all events this year, to provide funds for the erection of an addition to the Crow Stand school.\n\nWhile we note with a degree of pleasure that you admit the reasonableness of our request in your implied willingness to provide the funds next year, we regret that you do not promise to recommend a grant in the estimates now about to be submitted and I am instructed to urge our request once more upon your favorable consideration.\n\nWe have removed the only objection you have alleged against the grant, viz., the inexpediency of erecting such a building on land not controlled by the Government. Moreover the positive arguments in support of our request are strong. We have carried on a school in this place for some fourteen years in buildings provided by ourselves. We have spent $2700 in the past two years in the erection of more commodious premises and for this purpose we received no help whatever from the Government. We have now in operation an Industrial boarding school which has an average attendance of 50 pupils and the management of which has won strong\ncommendations from the officers of the Indian Department. The future extension of the work which is urgently demanded, is hindered by want of room and we venture to think that our request for $1000 to erect a stone building to be used as a school room and a dormitory for boys, is an extremely modest one under the circumstances.\n\nNothing is said in the letter we have received about the increase we asked for in the annual grant to pupils in five of our industrial boarding schools. I am instructed to press the necessity for this increase once more upon your attention. Let me urge the following considerations. The lengthy and varied character of your experience in such matters makes it unnecessary that I should do more than mention them.\n\n(1st) Any proposed solution of the Indian problem must treat the education of the young as one of its most important elements and there is no means of education practicable in the North West that equals in value the system of industrial boarding schools. This general principle is urged so forcibly and so frequently in your own official reports that I make no attempt to prove it.\n\n(2nd) These schools for which assistance is asked are now in successful operation and have been favorably reported upon.\nby your inspectors. In regard to other schools, even before a stone was turned the Government has in some cases promised large grants to erect buildings and an annual rate of $100 per pupil.\n\nWe do not ask as much as this. We have shown that we are capable of doing such work and are doing it and now we ask for an adequate grant.\n\n(3rd) As the case stands now the Government bears a much less proportion of the expense in our industrial boarding schools than in the case of other schools of any class carried on by any organization among the Indians. The $60 per pupil which we now receive scarcely covers the cost of food and clothing, to say nothing of fuel, light and other expenses and to say nothing especially of teaching.\n\n(4th) The Government has already admitted the justice of the arguments upon which we base our request by making grants of $100 per pupil to similar schools under the care of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England.\n\nThese considerations you will remember I have not only repeatedly laid before the Commissioner, but I have also submitted them to yourself in my letter of the 14th of February. In your reply no answer is offered to arguments No 1, 2 and 3. No 4 is met by saying that the schools which receive $100 per pupil are of the industrial type and are required to teach trades and\nother branches of industry, whereas ours are of the boarding school type and no such requirement is exacted of us.\n\nIn reply to this I am instructed to say again that in the schools which receive $100 per pupil, a large proportion of the scholars are girls in whose case teaching a trade is out of the question. Of the boys a considerable number are under twelve years of age and therefore too young to be apprenticed to trades. In regard to the few who remain it is not desirable to teach them trades in such schools; they should rather be transferred to the large government industrial schools where with a considerable number of pupils teachers of trades can be profitably employed. This is so obviously the case that none of the schools which receive $100 per pupil do nothing more in the way of industrial teaching than is done in our schools in which the industrial element is made a very important part of the training both of boys and girls and where all the industrial training is given that the pupils are capable of receiving with advantage.\n\nIn connection with this distinction between schools of the industrial type and schools of the boarding school type which has been twice made in letters to this committee, I am instructed to call your attention to the fact that in the annual report of the Indian Department for last year, no classification of\nthis kind is made; and in a volume which contains so much detailed information, such an omission is significant. We would be sorry to think that the distinction is employed by the Indian Department only in its correspondence with the Presbyterian Church and has no place elsewhere.\n\nMr Reid says in the letter in which he conveys to us your decision about the Crow Stand school that a return is being brought before the House by which it will be seen that the Presbyterian Church is not faring badly in comparison with some others. This is in reply to our statement that unjust discriminations exist against the Presbyterian Church. In reply I am to say that however large the sum total granted to the Presbyterian Church may be, compared with that granted to others, the comparison is quite fallacious if it leaves out or slight the fact that among the treaty Indians of the North West the Presbyterian Church has two or three times as many industrial boarding schools as any other and spends an amount of money very largely in excess of that expended by any other denomination.\n\nThe committee has instructed me to express its regret that our attempt to secure the grants for which we asked have hitherto been unsuccessful either in having our arguments answered or in having our wishes complied with. And I am instructed to say\nthat if what we feel keenly to be an injustice is allowed to continue, we will feel obliged, by laying the correspondence on the subject before the General Assembly or by invoking the aid of public opinion in some way, to make further endeavors to secure the amount of public support to which our schools are entitled.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Superintendent General of\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ONT.\nJune 15, 1890\n\nThe Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nIn submitting the accompanying guarantee for the erection of a schoolhouse in connection with the Cowtand Mission, I venture to lay before you an ample justification of the case upon which we base our request. A day school was carried on at the Cowtand for more than two years. About a year and a half ago this was changed into an industrial boarding school. Within the last two years building costing $2700 have been erected and wholly at the expense of the Church. The school has now an average attendance of 50 children and is overcrowded. It is desired that an additional building be erected to provide accommodation for the increasing attendance. The site on which it is proposed to erect the building is homesteaded by the Proprietor, although the patent has not yet been issued. The Lynden Foreign Mission Committee kindly promises that steps will be taken to secure a patent, and that when such patent is secured a joint interest in the ownership in the land will be given to the Government.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n69170\nIn consideration of the sum of one thousand dollars ($1000) granted to the Presbyterian Church in Canada by the Indian Department of the Dominion of Canada for the erection of a stone building in connection with the Crow Child Mission adjoining Cold River in the North West Territory, it is hereby guaranteed by the undersigned that a stone building will be erected. The ground floor suited for use as a school room and the upper floor as a dormitory; that the work promised will commence before the first of August and be completed before the thirty-first of December, 1890; and that the sum of one thousand dollars will be expended in erecting and furnishing the building.\n\nOttawa, June 15th,\n1890\n\n[Signature]\nThomas Hart\n[Signature]\nJohn de Vries\n[Signature]\nAndrew B. Davies\nOttawa. June 27th, 1876.\n\nDear Mr. Vankoughnet,\n\nIn reply to your note of the 25th instant, I think you had better have a Memorandum drawn up for Council authorizing the payment of the $1000 in aid of the Pelly Boarding School from an unexpended Day School vote for the current year.\n\nCould you not pay them the $1000 on the production of accounts showing an expenditure as stated by Mr. Baird of $2,700 on the present buildings, instead of withholding the grant until the proposed addition is under weigh or completed? When the Department obtains the joint interest in the property it will have a claim on all the buildings included in the new addition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Vankoughnet, Esq.\n\n[Signature]\nFeb'y, 17, 1861.\n\nSir,\n\nI am instructed to lay before you the following requests for assistance to enable the Presbyterian church to carry on its work among the Indians during the fiscal year, for which estimates are not being prepared:\n\n1. Crowstand's, for completion of school building, $1700.00\n2. Birtle, for new building, $10000.00\n3. Increase of number of pupils to whom per capita grant is given in the Industrial schools so as to make the number equal to the probable average attendance.\n4. That the per capita grant be increased from $60 per annum to at least $75.\n5. That the day school among the Sioux at Prince Albert receive a grant to the amount of $300 per annum for the payment of the teacher's salary.\n\nAllow me to say a word about each of these items.\n\n1. Crowstand's.\nLast summer the church undertook to extend the Crowstand buildings by the erection of a stone school building 30 x 40 feet in size, the ground floor to contain two school rooms and two private rooms for teachers and the upper floor to be a dormitory for the children. This building was very much needed, as shown by the crowded condition of the building already in use and by the number of children seeking admission to the school. The Hon. Mr. Bowring, last June, promised to a deputation of the General Assembly, then in session at Ottawa, that a grant of $1,000 would be made towards the erection of this building, and at that time it was believed that $1,000 would cover the whole cost. By the time the actual work of building was undertaken, however, it was seen by the increase of the school that a more costly building would have to be erected, and even after the stone walls had been carried up to a considerable height the Committee was prevailed upon by officers of the Indian Department and by the minister to add another story to the building and so make two dormitory floors instead of one. The building will therefore cost $2,000 instead of $1,000 and it is asked that the Government bear the whole expense, paying, that is, $1,000 during the current year.\n$1,700 during the coming year. The building has the roof on and will be ready for occupation at an early date.\n\nThe church has already expended $2,700 within the last three years in the erection of buildings for this school and the Government has not yet expended anything at all.\n\nIn an institution so successful as this, where there has been already an average attendance of more than 60 pupils and where another building is likely to be filled as soon as completed, there is surely every reason that the Government bear, at least half the cost of the erection of the necessary buildings.\n\n2. Nirtle.\n\na. The Presbyterian church has carried on an Industrial school at Nirtle for two years and a half in a stone building which was formerly the public school of the town and for which the church pays $300 a year as rent. The expectation was that the Government would buy this building and place it at the disposal of the church for use as an Indian school and a sum was inserted in the estimates last year for this purpose but it failed to pass the Council on the ground, it is said, that there was not a suitable amount of land at hand to make the institution available as an Industrial school. The building, besides is not well arranged.\nfor the purpose for which it is being used and would require a large amount of money to effect the necessary alterations, to erect out-buildings, etc. The church therefore asks now that the sum of $10,000 be appropriated for the purpose of purchasing the necessary amount of land somewhere in the neighborhood of Birtle and the erection of good buildings in which the work of a school may be carried on.\n\nIn spite of the disadvantage of being altogether too near a town and of being inconveniently housed the school has been successful. The Principal and Matron have secured in a very high degree, the good will both of the officers of the Indian Department and of the Indians and there is every reason to believe that if money is granted it will prove an excellent investment.\n\n2. The estimated attendance at each of the 7 Industrial schools under the care of the Presbyterian church is as follows:\n\n| Location       | Estimated Attendance | Cost per Student | Total Cost |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Crowstand      | 75                   | $75              | $5,625     |\n| Round Lake     | 58                   | $75              | $4,350     |\n| Moscow Potung  | 40                   | $75              | $3,000     |\n| File Hills     | 30                   | $75              | $2,250     |\n| Birtle         | 30                   | $75              | $2,250     |\n| P. La Prairie  | 12                   | $50 + $300       | $900       |\n| Edmonton       | 12                   | $50 + $300       | $900       |\n\nEquated at $75 per capita\nThe Committee asks that a per caput grant be estimated in accordance with these figures.\n\n4. The present grant at the Crowstand, Round Lake, Muscow Potung, Mile Hills and Little schools is at the rate of $60 per caput per annum. The Committee reiterates its conviction that this sum is too small and asks that it be increased to at least $75 per caput.\n\na. There is too great a difference in the grants made to these schools and to those that receive $100 per caput per annum. The additional instruction in trades for instance, which the latter schools give does not cost anything like the difference in the grant.\n\nb. Schools like that at Portage La Prairie or that at Athabasca, which receive $60 per caput and a grant of $300 to the teacher's salary are in a better position than those which receive $60 per caput without the grant to the teacher's salary, because in the case of these two schools, at which the average attendance is small, the total grant approximates about $85 per caput which is even more than we ask for the larger schools. It will thus be seen that the schools for which we are asking a larger grant are the worst supported schools that the Government has under its care. The Government Industrial schools, with their practically un-\nlimited revenue, the Industrial schools that receive $100 per caput and the small schools that receive $50 per caput and $300 on salary are all decidedly better off.\n\n6. The $50 per caput which the Government gives these schools is not sufficient to pay for the food and clothing, to say nothing of teaching, and the church is obliged to make a grant of some $10 per caput to pay for maintenance, in addition to paying the salaries of all the teachers. It is surely not unreasonable to claim, that since Industrial schools are the best fitted for the work of Indian education they should be better supported than this.\n\n5. The church has erected a school building, without assistance from the Government, on the north side of the Saskatchewan River, opposite Prince Albert, for the education of the Band of Sioux Indians that makes its headquarters there. This school has been carried on since last summer. It is true that these Indians are not on a reserve but they live at this place more constantly than many Indians that are nominally on a reserve, and besides the church is willing to follow them with a school whenever they move to a reserve. It is surely a pity that for this merely technical reason, which is not observed in all cases, the grant should be refused, and the Committee therefore repeats its request.\nfor a grant of $500 per annum, to be paid to the teacher of this day school, and that the payment of the grant date from the opening of the school.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nSYNOD OF MANITOBA AND THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nWinnipeg, Feb 17, 1891\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit to you herewith a copy of a letter which I have today sent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Regina.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrews Baird\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nCopy by Mr. Maclean will reach Canada by next mail.
