He claimed that in taking over from our district such a large number of representatives, it would be impossible for him to adequately represent them all. This latter claim seems to be well founded, for he has been unable to get a fair share of votes from his constituents.\n\nThe question, therefore, that seems to arise is, can we not re-arrange the districts so as to give each member a fair share of votes?\n\nTaking Saskatchewan's average per member\u201440\u2014Assiniboia would be entitled to 16 members.\n\nTaking Assiniboia's average\u201430\u2014Saskatchewan would be entitled to 14 members.\n\nTaking Alberta's average\u201425\u2014Saskatchewan would be entitled to 14 members.\n\nTAKING SASKATCHEWAN'S DISTRICT.\n\nNew that immigrants are arriving in Winnipeg, and that they will be seeking opportunity to settle, we think it nothing more natural than to distribute the advantages this district offers to those who propose to follow the present system of settlement.\n\nThe one great drawback to the settlement here, in the past, has been the fact that we were further away from the centre of population in the east than any other part. The result has been that our prospect for settlement have not yet been realized.\n\nThe further back we go into the wilderness within this district it naturally draws us towards the east instead of settling anywhere else.\n\nThis has been the case ever since the opening of the C.P.R., or were preceeded from distance alone, but now with the advance of two railways towards the borderlands to this district, and the town of Prince Albert will have excellent communication with the east.\n\nBut still the fact that a railway passes through our district is of great importance, as it enables us to be nearer to the east than any other part. We are also better situated for settlement then any other part, and our position on the North Saskatchewan river will enable us to take advantage of the navigable waterway along this river.\n\nWe will now turn our attention to the capital of the new Province of Saskatchewan, and will apply all the advances which these new communications will bring with them.\n\nBut there is another important consideration which we must take into account before establishing this district entirely independent from the others.\n\nThe question, therefore, that arises is, can we not make a fair adjustment of the districts so as to give each member a fair share of votes?\n\nTaking Saskatchewan's average per member\u201440\u2014Assiniboia would be entitled to 16 members.\n\nTaking Assiniboia's average\u201430\u2014Saskatchewan would be entitled to 14 members.\n\nTaking Alberta's average\u201425\u2014Saskatchewan would be entitled to 14 members.\n\nTAKING SASKATCHEWAN'S DISTRICT.\n\nNew that immigrants are arriving in Winnipeg, and that they will be seeking opportunity to settle, we think it nothing more natural than to distribute the advantages this district offers to those who propose to follow the present system of settlement.\n\nThe one great drawback to the settlement here, in the past, has been the fact that we were further away from the centre of population in the east than any other part.

F. Chamberlain, a member of the State Board of Health, assisted by Prof. Edward G. Lowe, the well-known United States chemist.\n\nThe official report shows that a large number of the powders examined were found to contain alum or lime, many of them being so strongly charged as to be seriously objectionable for use in the preparation of human food.\n\nAlum was found to be a very nice sam- pling drug employed in baking powders to sharpen their cost. The presence of the same was attributed to the addition of tartar in small quantities to their manufacture. Such cream of tartar was also analyzed, and found to be adulterated with alum to the extent of 35 per cent. of their entire weight.\n\nAll the powders passed the test of the presence of tartar in their manufacture. The cost of this chemically pure cream of tartar is greatly reduced, and the effect of the account of this greater cost is used in making baking powder but the \"Royal.\"\n\nThe only baking powder yet found by chemical analysis to be entirely free from alum and tartar is the \"Royal.\"\n\nThis perfectly pure results from the exclusive use of cream of tartar specially prepared for the purpose by patent processes which totally remove the impurities of lime and other impurities. The cost of this chemically pure cream of tartar is greatly reduced, and the effect of the account of this greater cost is used in making baking powder but the \"Royal.\"\n\nThe undersigned, and many others, are of the opinion that the best results of the baking powders for the New York State Board of Health, as well as for the Government, says of the purity and quality of these powders.\n\n\"We are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security, LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nMORRIS & MACDOWALL\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\nShingles, $6 50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security, LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nMORRIS & MACDOWALL\nAGRICULTURAL.\n\nFlax Culture.\n\nIn reply to a question from \"H.R.\", Prince Albert, asking for information about the culture of flax, the \"New West Farmer\" says:\u2014The first thing to ensure success in growing flax is to choose the right variety and if so, to what advantage. It has been successfully grown here in Ontario, but Major Smith at Lindsay claims he could produce a tall different variety. A slight summer frost would spoil a season crop, and anything for cattle a paltry sum to be obtained for seed. If it is not as profitable as some people allege. I own as, when it is in its new breaking stage, it will make a good fence. It is also said to soil from rotting properly, and so spoil the land for several crops afterward. He can say that he has had a crop worth early in June or late in May, and find how it prospered on that scale. He may wish to try it again, but he will have to retire for another year and let us know in November what success he has achieved.\n\nThe weather is now getting warmer, and the crops can begin to grow. Why the seed should not be put in before the last of May or early in June, when other crops are just beginning to show their heads? If summer frost affect the crop, and it only takes fourteen weeks to mature, then the loss will be great. Flax is the least likely, in this district, to be spoiled. Besides, if flax will thrive as far north as the Red River Colony (N.W.T.), why not in the Canadian North-West. But, admitting that flax will thrive as far north as the Red River Colony, the question arises whether it would pay to grow it there. The answer is, it has, however, been made a reliable and profitable crop in Ontario and it will also raise in advantageously in Manitoba. Why not in the Saskatchewan country? Of course, the main consideration is the market. England and Ireland are the chief markets for flax. Last year Great Britain used over 100,000 tons of flax, of which nearly 85,000 tons were imported from France. Besides, she bought flax and tow, or cordage, to the value of $26,417,963, and paid out altogether $3,000,000 for raw material in flax. The manufacture of linseed oil has also been commenced in Winnipeg, and the value of the oil exported to the value of $23,127 was exported, besides the quantity used for local consumption. The value of the amount $15,216 went to England. Flax is valued at from $200 to $70 per ton according to the quality. Taking into account the production of European countries as a criterion 8 acres will raise a ton of decent flax, which would give an average return much better than any in this country. With the opening of the Hudson's Bay Company, we do not see why there is no prospect of advantage from supplying the flax mills of Great Britain with all the raw material they require. We have now climbed the ladder of water, and scouting machines of the best quality are always obtainable. In view of the advantages which would accrue, it would be well for the farmers to try a small area of flax this year, and satisfy themselves by practical test as to whether flax will pay them. Our opinion, however, is that it will.\n\nPrime Essay on Butter Making.\n\nFrom the \"New West Farmer.\"\n\nThe following essay on prime butter making won the prize of $10 at the Wisconsin dairyman's convention, Richland Center. The essay was written by Mr. W. H. Nash, of this city.\n\nTo make good butter, all having care of cows and milk should work intelligently, conscientiously and harmoniously, each doing his part to make his best\u2014very best\u2014and do it every day.\n\nThen having good butter cows, they may adopt the following plan with success:\n\n1. Keep cows in clean, warm, ventilated stables in winter.\n\n2. Treat gently, feed water and milk regularly.\n\n3. Feed in winter: corn, oats, ground, mix with bran, meal and salt occasionally; also carrots, parsnips, turnips, celery, clover and straw stalks. Avoid turnips, cabbage and decaying vegetables.\n\n4. Feed in summer: good pasture and feeding troughs.\n\n5. Pure water at all seasons.\n\n6. Scrupulous cleaning of all utensils. [We add here freedom from stable odor, cleanliness of all ill-ventilated cellars.\u2014Ed. N.W.F.]\n\n7. Milk rapidly and quietly in a pail that strains while milking, or cover pan with folds of mosquito netting; re strain through both wire and cloth into deep case.\n\n8. Reduce and hold temperature at 50 degrees.\n\n9. Skin sweet.\n\n10. Keep cream at moderate temperature until thickened, which indicates proper curdling.\n\n11. Air by frequent stirring.\n\n12. Churn in summer in early morning every other day, Sundays excepted. In winter not less than once weekly. Temperature 60 degrees.\n\n13. Stop churning when in granular state, draw buttermilk and sell. Add twice, in pure, white cream, thin with brine, then remove butter to pan. Gather cream, drain, repeat operation on traces of buttermilk.\n\n14.
