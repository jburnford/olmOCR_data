Dugas\nPrincipal\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the requisition for drugs which you submitted recently for use on behalf of the girls of the Spanish River School; and in reply I beg to say that as the requisition is somewhat large, the Department desires to be informed how long you estimate that these drugs will last. I beg to point out that the total expenditure during the fiscal year 1914-15 for drugs for use at the Spanish River School amounted to $247.38. It is not considered advisable to buy in large quantities, as certain of the articles may deteriorate when kept on hand for any length of time. When your report in this matter is received, action will be taken.\n\nI may say that the Department is considering the question of ordering the drugs required from a local druggist. Kindly state the names of druggists in the neighbouring towns who would be in a position to fill an order if given. The Department does not wish to deal with any firm which could not furnish fresh drugs of the best quality at reasonable rates. It is desired to curtail expenditure, compatible with the receipt of a satisfactory supply of drugs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. L. V.

Palmer\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou have probably wondered at my not writing to you since January. The reason is that my new quiet mode of life in this school has brought on me so much constant headache that I was often unable to do even my official correspondence. I have now come to beg your benevolent advice on a very important question for us.\n\nThe discouragingly high cost of living, and the lack of outside resources, have made it extremely hard, not to say impossible for us, to continue the sustenance of the material management of the two sections of our school. We have many Brothers and Sisters very anxious to continue to devote their lives to the great work of which you have the general direction; but material means are wanting. Would your Department\nbe disposed to buy our two schools and their farms, and employ us at the intellectual and spiritual management of them; as you are doing for these Western Industrial schools, owned by the Oblate Fathers?\n\nA word of answer would greatly oblige.\n\nYour very humble and grateful servant,\n\nEug. A. Papineau, O.F.M.\nPrincipal\nAugust 30, 1917.\n\nMy dear Father Papineau,\n\nI was very sorry to learn from your letter of the 18th instant that you are not in good health and have been suffering from headaches. When one considers the many details that you have to attend to and the worries of such a large institution, one sympathizes with you very heartily. I hope now that you may be feeling better. As you are no doubt aware, we have increased the per capita grant for the Spanish River school by $10.00 for the current fiscal year, and this is the best we can do. It would be impossible for us to finance the purchase of your properties, even if the Government were to consider your suggestion favourably. We are not undertaking any new building operations or the acquisition of any new establishments. You might at some convenient time, however, let me know at what amount you value the properties.\n\nWith kind regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Eug. A.

And I will proceed to explain.\n\nIn my experience as the information of this establishment for the past 6 years, it has been necessary to do a considerable amount of extraction of teeth owing to not having the necessary tools fit for filling teeth (which branch of mine have considerable experience). It has been my observation to have to extract many teeth all which could have stood many years had only had the necessary instruments etc. to have saved them by filling.\n\nSo I would ask you to kindly make inquiries to whether the Department could supply me with a metal outfit for the purpose of saving many of the teeth as possible as I find that fills keep when less traumatic teeth are hampered by considerably on account of malnutrition.\n\nCan I rely on your satisfaction and will you fall in with my request for medicines?\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours sincerely in Jesus Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nChildren have entered our school this year in larger number than any previous year. We have already 96 boys, 96 girls; a few more are to come soon, and I have requested girls to number for want of room and not to exceed the number of 208 for both institutions.\n\nComes the question if we should profit our school to accommodate a larger number of children or not. We are ready to do it if the Department of Indian Affairs would guarantee the ordinary grant for a number of children not exceeding 250, boys and girls. The girls school is large enough for all its parts for 125 children. The dormitory can contain only 100 beds, but this can be enlarged by adding half of the third story of the loft building. All other parts of the house are large enough for 125 children.\n\nIt is my opinion that the boarding school will be more and more the means of educating the Indians of this part of the Country. The day schools have not reached great many Indian children. The proportion of those who attend these day schools seems rather to decrease, and the some of the many reasons are the following: The Indians are not...\nAs before grouped in villages, they rather tend to disperse all over their respective preserves for farming purposes. The high wages in saw mills and lumber camps, the berry picking, sugar making keeps always many families shifting about. For these reasons, some schools around here have to close periodically, so Serpent River School, Spanish River (Magamook), South Bay, Whitefish Lake.\n\nThe new location of our boarding school has afforded school facilities to many band of Indians who had never previously sent children to Rekemukay. We now receive children from adjoining, other bands, from Abitibi, Mohawk and we have application from Lake Superior Indians. I have already refused quite a number of children and some are orphans or destitute children.\n\nIf the Indian Department allows us to increase the number of our boarders, we will prepare to answer all the Applications.\n\nVery sincerely Yours,\n\nMr. Martin Benson\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nT.

We tried to give the children the best medical and nursing attendance we could in these circumstances. We had the help of one physician from the hospital and of two from Montreal.\n\nI do not believe a letter from Mr. Agent of the Indian Affairs, in which he quoted the following statement from Mr. J. Stuart of the Board of Health, \"Replying to your letter of the 20th reporting outbreak by tuberculosis at the Industrial School at Pointe-au-Pic, the Department approves Dr. McDermott's engagement to attend these cases, and you should see that every attention is paid to nourishing and medical attendance to your patients.\" I concluded from this that Mr. Dr. McDermott was at the charge of the sick. In addition, he has regular visits to the sick at our schools, mostly every day. He has shown ability and devotionness in the fulfillment of his duties.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nWe have been doing more than ordinary infirmary work; we had real hospital work and we had to undergo some extra expenses. I appeal to the kindness of the Department to help us to solve our expenses at least the bill of the extra infirmaries which will amount to $150.00.\n\nWe hope to start teaching in a few days after the washing and disinfection of the buildings is finished.\n\nYou will find enclosed the Admission Papers of Ernestine Cobine and Basil Micah Mingina. They entered on the date marked on their papers.\n\nThree boys who have completed their course of study last summer, asked to stay a few months more in the school to learn some trade in their respective trade. Isaiah Beausrais was a shoemaker.\n\nJoseph Martin applied himself to carpentry and cabinet work. Auguste Beausrais applied himself to farm work especially to ploughing. They wish now to be discharged, and I beg for their discharge by the Almighty in their best interests.\n\nNo. 419 Joseph Martin 16 years, St Regis, entered Sept 28, 1913\n\nNo. 387 Auguste Beausrais, 15 years, Laughlinaga, entered October 3, 1912.\n\nHereunder is the certificate of health of Peter Johnson. Owing to his predisposition, this boy was badly dying of the influenza, he will be able to attend his regular school duties this year. I should advise to discharge him too.\n\nNo. 416 Peter Johnson 16 years, St Regis.\n\nI suppose these boys are entitled to their fair pay by the Department.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nT. A. Desjardins, A. I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is satisfied that every care and attention was given them by yourself and members of your staff as well as Dr. McDermott. It is hoped that the pupils are now all on a fair way to recovery and that no further deaths will occur. The class work should be resumed again as soon as the disinfection and cleaning is completed.\n\nThe expenses incurred by you in the employment of the extra infirmarians to the amount of $150.00 will be paid and you should forward vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure to the above amount.\n\nWith reference to the request for the discharge of pupils Nos. 419, Joseph Martin and 367, Angus Ignatius Beuvaisi, I beg to say that enquiries are being made from the agents at St. Regis and Caughnawaga as to what disposition is to be made of these boys when they arrive home. As soon as a reply is received you will be given further instructions. The cost of their transport will be paid by the Department.\n\nWith reference to pupil No. 416, Peter Johnson, I have to acknowledge the receipt of a certificate from Dr. McDermott regarding the health of this boy and recommending that he be discharged from the school. As the parents of this boy are dead, enquiry is being made as to what arrangements can be made for his care if it is decided to return him to St. Regis. I have to request that you will be good enough to have Dr. McDermott furnish a report as to whether he considers this boy would be likely to benefit if he were sent to a sanatorium. If there is a reasonable hope that he will recover his health arrangements might be made to have him placed in a sanatorium. However, before any action is taken Dr. McDermott should give a report and also state whether he considers that it would be advisable to have him sent to a sanatorium.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of applications and certificates of health for the admission of Ernestine Corbiere and Basil Nishibinjima, and in reply I beg to say that the admission of these two children is approved. The application of Ernestine Corbiere is returned herewith as the signature of the witness has not been filled in and this should be done and the application returned to the Department. In future, the Department would like you to forward all applications for admission to the agent of the band to which the children belong for his approval before the applications are sent in to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev.

This quantity seems to us to be considerably more than is necessary and besides it is very doubtful if we could procure this quantity as it is very scarce and the price is $2.25 per ounce.\n\nBefore shipping this order we would be pleased to hear from you as to whether the quantity is correct or not.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to letter to you of the 13th instant, relative to drugs which were ordered from the National Drug & Chemical Co., for use on behalf of pupils of the Spanish River Industrial School, I beg to transmit herewith the account in duplicate amounting to $107.05 from the said firm for the drugs in question. You will observe that the first item therein has been cancelled. This is owing to the fact that the drug requested is very expensive and difficult to obtain. If the drugs for which charge has been made were received by you in good order, you should certify this account and re-enclose it to the Department without delay in order that payment may be made.\n\nThe Department desires to emphasize the statement contained in official letter of the 13th instant to the effect that all requisition for drugs should be submitted in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

So, if you find useless passages in this chapter, I shall not be offended if you cut out them. The same about the correction of language as I have not the pretension to be a scholar in English language.\n\nAs you will notice, the boys have been granted a typewriter, and the girls have none, and they are anxious to have it also. The teacher of the girls' senior class, Miss Jenkins, told me many times she would be delighted to teach her typewriting to the girls. I think it would be a step more towards progress and an advantage for the girls if they learn typewriting, thus they would run a chance of getting a better position than housemaids, etc., they would associate with a higher class of people than they do in hotels where so many Indian girls are inclined to engage them. If the Department, after kindly considering this matter, decides to grant this favour, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nT.A. Desautels\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nIn your requisition for drugs you ask for 2 oz. Codeine Sulphate which costs $11.55 an ounce, and as the quantity asked for is considered altogether too much, it will not be supplied until an explanation is received from you as to the necessity for such a large quantity.\n\nThe quantity of Rubber Sheeting asked for, viz:- 15 yds. appears large and will not be supplied in the absence of explanations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.H.

Possibly you will note a slight advance in the extension of several items over that on former invoice sent you; this is accounted for by extra quantity in weight.\n\nWe are unable to supply:\n- Cohen's Powder Blower\n- Hartman's forceps\n- Great Western Fumigators.\n\nCHLORAZENE Tablets are being shipped direct from the manufacturers.\n\nTrusting this shipment will reach the School promptly and in good order, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"PLEASE ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE COMPANY NOT TO INDIVIDUALS\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nIn accordance with your instructions I visited the Spanish River Industrial School, while on my recent trip in that section.\n\nThe principal of the school was absent at the time of my visit, having gone to Little Current on business in connection with the school. His assistant showed me through the various buildings and did everything possible to give me an insight into their work and method of handling their pupils.\n\nIn visiting the boys' dormitory I found that the beds were well provided with bedding and although it was in the latter part of the week when I made my visit, the bed clothing was clean. Considerable difficulty was found in keeping some of the beds in proper condition on account of bedewing by some of the smaller boys. Rubber sheets are used on these beds but the quality of rubber sheeting was very poor and thin. The greater part of the beds were not made up at the time I saw them, about ten A.M. The Asst. Principal explained that this was on account of the necessity of airing the beds.\n\nThe boys are provided with plain but warm clothing and have a change of underwear every week. They sleep in their underwear. All the boys get a bath once a week and their heads are kept close cropped.\n\nTheir food consists of, for breakfast porridge, milk, bread and butter; dinner, meat, potatoes, bread; on Fridays they have macaroni instead of meat; for supper beans or corn porridge, bread and butter. But they get only once a day. The bread is a sort of black bread made from a formula obtained from some medical man who is known to them. It is objected to by the pupils, some of whom say that they cannot eat it at all.\n\nThe boys take turns at the outside work. Seven or eight are required for milking. Four work at shoe making and repairing. Three work at carpentering. In summer some work in the garden and some five on the farm. The work is done during one hour after breakfast and one hour before supper. I do not think that any are overworked. The older boys help with the thrashing.\n\nThe school location does not appear to me to be a good one from a health standpoint. It is low and boggy. Land that has been cleared for some time is still very boggy. In the mornings there is always a mist hanging over the place. It seems to me to be about the worst possible location for any person who is at all subject to tubercular troubles of any kind.\nI found the girl's school to be in much better condition than the boys'. The building is a better one and is kept much cleaner. The location, however, has the same fault as that of the other school, both being built on the low land down near the lake.\n\nI noticed, when passing the cemetery that there appeared to be quite a number of graves. By looking over the fence I could count over 60 graves and there were probably some others which I could not see on account of the tall grass. That seems to be a great many for such a short time as the school has been in existence.\n\nI saw the Simon boys and they appeared to be in good health and not suffering from being underfed. I asked them if they wanted to leave the school and they said not. They may have been influenced by the presence of the teacher at the time.\n\nFrom what I saw, while at the school, I would consider that the unfortunate location was the greatest fault. It seems to me that there is bound to be sickness on this account. The food provided, while plain enough, of great variety, is not stinted in quantity. The only complaint in regard to quality might be in the matter of the bread. The clothing provided is sufficient and cleanliness of body is well looked after.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember 18, 1920.\n\nDear Doctor McGill,\n\nI am sending herewith for analysis a loaf of bread such as is supplied the pupils at one of our large industrial schools in the province of Ontario. Some complaint has been made by the parents as to the quality of the food supplied at this school, and I shall be pleased if you will have this loaf analysed, and let me have a report as to its food value.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nAnthony McGill, Esq., B.A., B.Sc., LL.D.,\nChief Analyst,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nREPORT ON A SAMPLE OF BREAD RECEIVED FROM DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, COMPLAINT AS TO NUTRITIVE VALUE.\n\nL. F. 116. Lab. No. 3746 28/12/20.\n\nMoisture 35.30%\nAsh (Mineral Matter) 1.68%\nFat 1.18%\nCrude Fibre 0.77%\nProtein (N x 6.25) 11.58%\nCarbohydrates (Nitrogen free Extract) 49.59%\n\nCalorific Value per pound 1168 calories\nAcidity (cc n/10 alkali per 10 grs. bread) =3cc.\n\nThe nutritive value (1168 calories per lb) is about the average though the protein and fibre are slightly higher than usual. This is probably due to the use of a flour containing more of the bran, though otherwise it is just as nutritious as a finer flour. The acidity and taste indicate that the bread is slightly sour, but the analysis does not indicate that the bread should cause ill health.\n\nDominion Analyst.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\nCANADA\n\nOTTAWA December 27, 1920.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAnswering yours of the 18th instant with sample of bread to be analysed, I beg to enclose copy of the report furnished by Mr. Collier of this staff.\n\nEncl. Yours truly,\n\nA. LeMoine\nAsst. Chief Analyst.\nJanuary 3rd, 1921.\n\nRev. and dear Sir,\n\nAs you are aware, the Department received some complaints as to the quality of the bread that was being furnished the pupils of the Spanish River Industrial school, and Mr. Phelan was requested, when he visited the institution, to bring home with him a sample loaf which you were kind enough to give to him.\n\nThe loaf was submitted to the Chief Government Analyst, of the Department of Trade and Commerce, and I think I cannot do better than to enclose herewith a copy of the report received.\n\nOne of the claims made to the Department was that the bread was very often sour. You will notice that the report of the Analyst shows that, while the nutritive value of the sample sent in is about the average, there was evidence of sourness.\n\nAs bread is one of the staple articles of diet in all institutions of this kind the greatest care should be taken to see that only that of the best quality is furnished the children. I am sure that you will exercise the necessary care to see that the wishes of the Department in this respect are carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. V. Gravel, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish Industrial School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant; and in answer I beg to say:\n\n1. That we use no second grade flour in our bread nor any substitute other than\n\n2. Two and a half or three bags of brown or whole wheat flour.\n\n3. That this small quantity of brown or whole wheat flour was added to the flour at the request of our Doctor. Many children who are not used to eat bread at home, suffer from constipation when they are here; and to do away with this, which after a while becomes suffocating, Dr. MacDermott told me that we should return to the brown bread.\n\nIf the Doctor thinks that we should give the children pure white bread only, I am ready to give it to them; it was not a question of economy that prompted me to give them brown bread; but a question of health. Practically there is no economy as children eat more of the brown than of the pure white bread. I can say that I have never heard a boy or a girl complain about it either. They prefer the brown to the white. I can also say that to my knowledge we never gave our bread to the children.\n\nNow may I ask the Chief Government Analyst when the analysis of this loaf of bread was begun? We never give to the children, nor to the staff, any brown bread more than three or four days old; because we know that, on account of the bran especially, this bread becomes sour in a short time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nThe sample given to Mr. Phelan had been baked exactly 40 hours before it left the house. Therefore I would be glad to know when the analysis was started in order to explain why it was found slightly sour.\n\nYour letter makes me think that there are other complaints as you say that \"one of the claims made to the Dept. was that the tree was very often sour.\"\n\nI would be most grateful to you if you would kindly let me know of these other claims.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nV. Grant, S.S. Principal\nIndustrial School,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nMr. Duncan C Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nJanuary 14, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was at Guelph the early part of this week, taking over some supplies from the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment. Among other things I obtained a number of manual training sets consisting of the bench and necessary tools. Four of these sets I ordered to be shipped to you, freight charges collect. There will be no charge for the goods themselves. I am sure that you will find these of great value in your work with the boys of your institution. We are taking over some other supplies, which will be distributed at a later date. Will you kindly advise the Department when this shipment arrives.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nThe Principal,\nSpanish River Industrial School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish River Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Aboriginal Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated July 2, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Spanish Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [September 30, 1943].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [October 1, 1943]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Month, Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 1, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended... 1944\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When going to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sipekneak Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... School for the Quarter ended... September 30... 19... Principal... Dated... October 2... 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1944\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 2 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings below.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 2, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will recourse be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential (Boys) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal (Rev.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School (Held) School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal (Rev.) J.R. Oliver\n\nDated December 31st 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n(Rev.) J.R. Oliver\n\nDated at Spanish Ontario this December 31st 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. L.A. 403\nRepu.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School (Boys) School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal (Rev.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19...........\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19...........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................this.........................................................19...........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal Miss F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential (Boys) School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated September 30th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Spanish, Ontario\n\nthis September 30th, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 21, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Apanah, Ontario\n\nthis 1st day of January 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Spanish School] for the Quarter ended [date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Spanish Ontario this 30th September 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential Boys' School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal (R.S.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return, and is arrived at by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which pupils are present in school or camp and is arrived at by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal (Signature)\n\nDated June 30, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n(Signature)\n\nDated at Spanish Ontario this 30th day of June, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 01072           | Mary Ann Johnston | 18  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01075           | Annie Beshadogon | 19  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01088           | Kathleen Southern| 16  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01107           | Joyce Solomon    | 13  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01125           | Patricia Belkabose | 15 |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01126           | Violet Sherrard   | 16  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01127           | Jane Fiedman     | 16  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01130           | Susan Kwananakwa | 16  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01132           | Lillian Kitching | 17  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01135           | Myrlin Johnston  | 15  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01136           | Melvina Johnston | 15  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01137           | Evaelynne Dewl   | 15  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01139           | Shirley Cross    | 15  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01142           | Lucy Nekhewa     | 16  |          |                |                  |                        |                           |            |\n| 01152           | Mary E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal (Res.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, so called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and should be obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Boarding School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 25th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Spanish, Ontario this 25th day of October 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which any pupil appears on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Spanish Indian Residential (Boy) School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 31st day of March 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Spanish Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Indian Residential Boys School at Spanish on Ontario Reserve for Quarter ended March 31st 1950.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1485            | Brought Forward | 157 |     |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1486            | Smoky Fox       | 13  | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1487            | James Fox       | 11  | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1488            | Philip McGregor | 8   | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1489            | Cecil Naganabe  | 16  | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1490            | Boniface Harrington | 14 | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1491            | Andrew Southwind | 8   | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1492            | Gordon Naganabe | 12  | V   |      |                |                   |                        |                             |            |\n| 1493            | James H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at:

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School (B) School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Appin, Ontario this 30th September, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Dec 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nthis 31st Dec., 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils were present (irrespective of whether they attended or not), adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School Boys School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal. (Signature)\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n(Signature)\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Spanish Station this 31st December 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-4, part 1)\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish Ontario\nAugust 6th 1948\n\nDear Mr Neary;\nSince all of our grade ten boys are coming back to the school here for grade eleven, we must requisition books for that grade. Under Mr Bulger's guidance we are arranging our program for grades nine and ten in such wise that they will be combined for social studies science and English. This offers no difficulty since the Social Studies for ten does not in any way \"depend\" on the course done in nine. Likewise for the Science I and II, and so for the play prose and comp taken in the two grades. There are some subjects in which the ten pre-supposes a background from nine, these will be taught as formerly separately. As a result of this plan which will permit of more thoroughness (and for that reason was advocated by Inspector Bulger) we need the following to have all our nine and ten texts set for the year. I am taking it for granted that all the nines are continuing and that the pupils who passed entrance will be back plus two more for high school, one St Regis and one Shishigewaning.\n\nNumber required\nGrades nine and ten...\nGeography for Today Book II Longmans Green... 15...\nHistory of Canadian People Wallace Copp Clarke... requisitioned but not received..................32\nParlez Vous Francais Copp Clark.............6\nLatin for Secondary Schools....................25\n\n.................................cont'd......2\nAugust 11, 1948.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have your requisition of August 6th requesting a quantity of Text books for High School pupils.\n\nPlease be advised that it will be in order to purchase the necessary books locally in order to have them on hand when the school opens in September.

Neary Superintendent Education Attention of Mr Doucet.\n\nDear Mr Neary:\n\nReference to letter under above file number dated December 15th our ent\u2014Our teachers will compile a list of good and less valuable points on the \"Our Vocabulary Spellers\" when they return. Two of them have, I think, put their summaries in writing. We shall get them completed and sent within the week after re-opening of school. From what I heard of the speller it is excellent for oral composition, is considered \"not complete enough\" by those dealing with entrance pupils since the entrance group find a great number of words lacking in the Pupil's Own Vocabulary Spellers which words inevitably pop up on entrance examinations. But the teachers who have been very interested in this matter and who are not all agreed will send in their own findings.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Rev) J.R.

(RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-4, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREVIEW OF BOOK II\n\nSuitability for Grades V and VI\n\nMETHOD OF STUDY:\n\nThe method of study introduced in the speller is easily followed and interesting to the pupils. My pupils enjoy reading the short stories in each exercise and finding the new words in these stories.\n\nDICTIONARY:\n\nThe dictionary is the most interesting and productive feature in this book. Pupils soon began to consult it, without being told, for meanings and pronunciation.\n\nKNOW YOUR WORDS:\n\nThis feature is unbeatable for correlating spelling and English. It helps the pupils to read ideas instead of words. They get a clearer understanding of words when they learn how a word is made up. The type of questions in this exercise help develop the pupil's reasoning powers.\n\nCORRELATIONS AND PUPIL INTEREST:\n\nBecause of the wide range of topics in this book, spelling can be correlated with every subject in the course of studies. I have found it especially useful in paragraph study and story telling.\n\nRESULTS IN SPELLING:\n\nUsing your progress chart I have found a great improvement in the pupils' ability not only to spell the words correctly but also to use the words correctly.\n\nTeacher: E.J. McCart\nGrades V VI\nI find THE PUPILS' OWN VOCABULARY SPELLER\n\n(Book 3)....a great help to supplement the old textbook.\n\nIt is performing a function that the other did not attempt as it is rather a list of words intended first of all, to have the pupil learn the spelling, word by word.\n\nIn my opinion, if used in connection with the Standard Speller, it will hasten the pupil's understanding and mastery of the words. It will then be natural to use them in composition in their proper sense.\n\nTeacher Brother J.B. Menseau S.J.\nAuxiliary teacher\nGrades VII VIII\nREVIEWS OF JURIST'S OWN VOCABULARY...Sellers...Bk I.\n\nFrom the point of view of teacher of Ont. High School Entrance teacher; under subheadings of (a) Modern Trends (b) Pedagogical Method (c) Division of Work (Units) (d) Suitability to Ont. Course as at Present Outlined.\n\nMODERN TRENDS: In this regard the text appears perfectly sound. The choice of words is adapted to, and chosen from the activities of our stream-lined age. The fact that pupils absorb words from the paragraph and incidentally gain a knowledge of their meaning is in keeping with \"learn by doing\" philosophy of Ed.\n\nPEDAGOGICAL METHOD: Much to be commended as it makes use of problem motivation...The \"KNOW YOUR WORDS SECTION\" of the lesson unit, perhaps a little too long, gives the pupil skill in the application of his new words. The derivation of new words from root words, the study of vowels, diphthongs and consonants is to be highly commended. The differently stressed syllables on \"desert\" (noun) and desert (verb) develop skill in knowledge and use of words.\n\nDIVISION OF WORK: Since each unit is meant to cover one week, this is rather an underestimate of ability of each child of normal age and grade. Two to three days with an active class could cover each unit.\n\nSUITABILITY TO PRESENT ONT. COURSE: The vocabulary is not the same as is used in the modern Ont. Course as now outlined. A careful study of five years HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE PAPERS (based on Ont. Speller) shows that out of approximately 500 words asked on these papers with about a 70% frequency each year, 80 to 100 of these words were not listed at all.\n\nOMISSIONS: The names of the Days of the Week, and Months of the Year, with some of their difficulties, should have been inserted. Certain common abbreviations and names of nationalities, and organizations would have been valuable.\n\nCONCLUSION: The choice of vocabulary taken from science, progress, transportation, art, history, and sports, etc., is excellent.\n\nCONCLUSION: The text as a whole is excellent for a supplementary text book, but not as a preparatory daily text for the Ont. H.S. Entrance examinations.\n\nJ. Sammon B.A.\n\nTeacher Joseph Sammon B.A.\nGrades VII VIII\n\nIndian Affairs.

Here is the ideal decorating medium for schools, homescraft work, recreational projects and professional use. It is unsurpassed for opaque surfaces and is equally satisfying for transparent or semi-transparent effects. DEK-ALL can be applied with many techniques. Since the colors are gloriously bright, smooth flowing and easy to apply, you will have no trouble in using them with your favorite craft, whether it be card painting, free drawing, silk screening, china or airbrushing. DEK-ALL colors are resistant to sunlight, alcohol, acids and soaps. Working in warm water is easy and quick.\n\nDEK-ALL is DIFFERENT! DEK-ALL is a thermosetting color which forms a strong bond with the painted surface. DEK-ALL colors do not require any over coating.\n\nNow add new permanent beauty and charming color to glass, china, porcelain, metal, and similar surfaces.\n\nTRY DEK-ALL!\n\nNo. 1278 Set\u20145 small jars Dek-All Colors, Transparent Mix, brush and directions.\n\nNo. 1278 Party Set\u2014Includes 5 Plastic Shapes for Decorating\n\nNo. 1280 Set\u20145 3/4-oz. jars Dek-All Colors, Transparent Mix, Cleaner, Thinner, cleaning sheet, brush and directions.\n\nIn Bulk\u20143/4-oz.

(RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-4, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nStep 1 Clean the Surface\n\nIt is extremely important that all surfaces to be painted be thoroughly cleaned to remove all traces of grease, oil or film. Use our #1291 Thinner Cleaner, or one of the Energine type. Merely washing with soap and water is not sufficient.\n\nHand perspiration on the surface should be guarded against. This can be overcome by wearing thin gloves.\n\nStep 2 Now the Design\n\nOne method is that of tracing it from a drawing or sketch. This process is easy if the object is glass; the design is then slipped inside with the paper pressed close to the surface. Scotch tape can be used to hold the design in place. It can then be used as a guide for applying the color.\n\nOn other objects, designs can be sketched lightly on the surface itself using a G8 Charcoal Marking Pencil or the softer type lead. These pencils have been designed for marking on glazed surfaces making it easy to \"block in\" your motif.\n\nWe recommend the use of a new hard copy paper especially made for this purpose. The sketch or actual sketch of your motif on a light weight tracing paper. The copy paper is slipped between this paper design and the surface being decorated. Then the design is traced with a hard pencil producing very sharp outlines on the surface or glass. Any tracing outline that still remains is readily wiped off with a soft cloth.\n\nIf a stencil is used it is cut with the design and attached to the surface with scotch tape.\n\nStep 3 Apply the Colors\n\nNote\u2014Dek-All colors mix readily to produce other colors (blue and yellow make an attractive green, etc.) or variations of the same color. Stir the colors well before using. During the painting the brushes must be cleaned with our thinner #1291 but to avoid clogging of the brush, they should be given a final cleaning with turpentine and then washed with soap and water before putting the brushes aside for future use.\n\nHand Painting or Free Brush Work:\n\nFor opaque and glossy effects load your brush with color. Apply with a slow deliberate brush stroke. When the brush is nearly empty, set it aside until the next stroke is needed. Quick application of the one-stroke technique (free brush technique) results in a more transparent and less glossy appearance. In most designs it is advisable to paint the entire area with the brush, allowing it to \"set\" for a few minutes and then fill in the other color with a brush. This outline acts as a retaining wall for the larger areas of color.\n\nFor \"Heavy Duty Use\" (that is where the decorated item will be subjected to heavy usage wear) a more or less continuous wash ing is important to \"flow\" the colors together so that they form a smooth, even continuous coat, which can then be \"polymerized\" by the application of heat into one unbroken bond, as described below.\n\nStenciling:\n\nDesigns may be stenciled readily with ordinary stencil brushes but for more satisfactory results its achieved by using the \"pad\" process as this allows you to cover evenly and yet show crisp edges. Method: A piece of silk or nylon is stretched over a small pod of cotton. Spread the color thinly over a flat piece of glass or large board. Then press the silk into the desired color and apply to the surface being decorated.\n\nColor Etching:\n\nAfter the color is applied thinly and evenly it is simple to produce a transparent etched effect after the color has dried, etched lines are cut into the design with a pointed end of a pin or other sharp object. This adds to the attractiveness of the translucent effect and many variations of the above are possible.\n\nAir Brush Painting:\n\nThese colors can be used in the air brush technique, thinning with #1291 thinner or turpentine. Especially in the case of thinning with turpentine, it is important to pre-check carefully for desired color permanency as below.\n\nStep 4 Make it Durable\n\nAfter DEK-ALL has been allowed to air dry for several days, the painted design will prove quite durable and will stand a reasonable amount of abrasion. Air drying will prove satisfactory. It is recommended that all decorative pieces such as mirrors, antiques and other surfaces not requiring constant washing and heavy handling. Warm water and mild soaps are recommended for such washings.\n\n\"Heavy Duty Use\"\n\nTo produce an extra degree of permanency, finished pieces should be baked in a regular kitchen oven or kiln. Allow one hour to 24 hours. Set the decorated articles in the cold oven and allow the temperature to gradually reach 300\u00b0F. Hold this temperature for 15 minutes, then turn off the heat, allowing the painted articles to remain in the oven till cool.\n\nAn attractive range of color will be obtained both with and without the application of heat. An extreme degree of heat will cause a change in the hue of certain colors, but in the case of items to be subjected to \"Heavy Duty Use,\" more heat is advisable than not enough, right up to the point, just below where discoloring begins.\n\nStep 5 Many Interesting Effects\n\nOne of the most interesting ways to use the colors is to apply them on the bottom or reverse side of a glass object so that the colors are seen through the glass. This filters and softens the design and gives a wonderful two and three-dimensional effect. For example, a colored design painted on the underside of an ash tray gives it a most artistic appearance.\n\nTRANS-MIX\u2014By adding Trans-Mix to your colors, lovely translucent or stained glass effects can be achieved.\n\nFor ash trays or similar objects subject to hard usage an over-coating of Trans-Mix is recommended. Again heat-treat as above.\n\nDEK-ALL Colors may be superimposed over each other, and this feature makes possible some very interesting plating and effects. By using medium value or pastel tones on dark surfaced objects attractive color effects are obtained. Less design decoration is needed when painted on dark surfaces.\n\nTHINNING COLORS\u2014If colors stand and become thick, add a tiny bit of Dek-All Thinner (medicine dropper is recommended). Caution: Too much Thinner reduces the permanency of the colors\u2014the less used, the better. Many customers use Trans-Mix for a similar purpose.\n\nA Professional Tip!\n\nExperienced craftsmen always pre-test surfaces to be painted before proceeding with production runs.\nPRANG TEXTILE COLORS ARE PERFECTLY ADAPTED FOR THESE TECHNIQUES\n\nFor instructions on any of these processes send self-addressed, stamped envelope.\n\n**Stencil**\nThe easiest method of applying Prang Textile Colors\u2014no experience necessary\u2014results are fascinating.\n\n**Air Brush**\nThe professional may obtain very lovely effects with an air brush.\n\n**Silk Screen**\nFor quick reproduction of a design a great number of times, the silk screen method is ideal.\n\n**Free Brush**\nIf you enjoy painting in water color or oil you will enjoy this method.\n\n**Hand Block**\nIf you like hand blocking you will find PRANG TEXTILE COLORS a perfect medium.\n\nHere are two books with hundreds of suggestions and ideas for the craft worker and artist, that will be particularly valuable to the textile worker. They are both written by Professor Anna Zworyck, noted designer and lecturer.\n\n**HANDS AT WORK**\nA book of simple decorative projects for craft workers.

School,\nSpanish, Ont.,\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have finally reached Ottawa and have consulted our files in reference to school supplies that were requisitioned for delivery to the Spanish School.\n\nOn checking with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery they advised me that almost all of the supplies have been forwarded. Any outstanding items will be reaching you shortly.\n\nWhile at Spanish I discussed general school problems with the different teachers and I made a number of notes on the requirements that the teachers brought to my attention. However, on going over my notes I find that I have my notes on the boys and girls schools confused. I am preparing one requisition for action by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery and I am sending it in care of the boys school, therefore, I would appreciate it if on receipt of these supplies you would arrange to distribute them as required.\n\nThe Supplementary readers, language books, black cover No. 285, typewriter paper, writing pads, marking ink are for the boys school. The Social Studies readers, ink wells, map of the world, duplicators, brushes, and blackboards are for the girls school. I am also forwarding fifteen hectograph workbooks. These are workbooks that should be used for the primary grades in both schools as they are adaptable by means of tearing out a page and running off the necessary copies.\nIn connection with the larger art paper, oil paints and pastels, the Department is working on suitable materials for this type of work, however, we are not meeting with very much success at present. As soon as we get something arranged you will be receiving your quota.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Some you may find will be of very little use. We know that you will be able to make the best of these articles, hence the reason for sending them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J.

I cannot find some of the information requested, and this I shall be able to obtain from the boys. I shall send the report in as soon as possible after the opening of the school year.\n\nYou mentioned that you could obtain maps for me. We need at least three (3) sets of maps for each continent, one of the world, one of Canada and one of the British Isles.\n\nIn the requisition sent in last Spring, apparently not enough requests were made for several texts. I have made a thorough check on all texts and we need the following texts:\n\nDisraeli (13) Silas Marner (20)\nIvanhoe (15) English Highway (40)\n\nI don't know if it is possible to obtain these texts at this late date, but I would appreciate it very much if you could do something.\n\nWe are busy preparing for the arrival of the boys. I hope to have everything under control before very long.\n\nI shall be looking forward to seeing you on your next visit.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nFather Wm. P. Maurice S.J.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may seem rather large, but in checking our supplies I have found that these are necessary and that we do not have either enough or that the copies we have are not usable or that we just have no copies. For instance, I am running into added difficulties because of the new Latin for Secondary schools. We are using everything we have and as a result some of the classes have the old and some the new and the two differ considerably. Mr. Sammon made out the list of English texts he needs and said that he would have put them on the requisition of last Spring if he had had the courses of study at hand.\n\nIf you think the whole list cannot be filled will you please advise me of what you think are not necessary.\n\nI am including a list of vocational guidance material I think I need. Mr. Taylor of the Vocational Guidance Department of the Department of Education listed only the essential requirements.\n\nThe annual Report for last year will be sent to you shortly.\n\nTrusting to hear from you soon, I am\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part ii)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nQuotation for Laundry Machinery for Spanish River Industrial School.\n\nReceivable until noon February 10th, 1932.\nTWO MACHINES IN ONE!\n\nThe Prosperity Palm Beach and Wool Combination\n\nIn the Prosperity, you have a properly padded ironing head which is used only for ironing and the lower buck is used for steaming. That is why you get a bone dry garment with lasting crease but without shine. Other machines try to have the upper head do two things at once, steam and iron, and the result is that it does neither so the garment is not properly ironed or properly steamed.\n\nThis machine is also provided with a highly polished nickeled upper ironing head, and is used by thousands of cleaners for ironing Palm Beach suits, silks and general work other than woolens.\n\nTHE PROSPERITY COMPANY, Inc., SYRACUSE, N.Y.\nTwo 38-inch Prosperity Presses in Tandem\n\nTraq-Prosperity Presses may be combined in a tandem unit as a combination of any two machines; one releases while the other locks.\nFollow the arrows in the above cut of the Prosperity Garment Press and you can readily trace the movement of the steam through the ironing head, buck, separator, condenser, and back to the main return.\n\nThis is our positive circulating system which insures uniform and ample heat at all times. The steam is taken from the intake pipe and passes through one side of the flexible joint and goes directly to the highest point in the ironing head. The steam fills the upper buck forcing out all dead air and condensation and then passes into the opposite side of the swivel steam joint.\n\nIt passes from there into the highest chamber of the lower buck, and after gravitating to the lower chambers it passes into the separator. All condensation and air are carried direct into the return line. You can see that the heating principle of the Prosperity Garment Press is one perfect unit,\u2014in other words, our system is a two-pipe system through which all steam must pass. This positive circulating system makes possible a vapor vacuum which enables us to draw steam through the ironing head at such speed and with such force that it is practically impossible for any condensation to take place in the ironing head.\nThis view shows the flexible steam joint of the Prosperity Garment Press.\n\nThe arrows indicate the intake and return of the steam through the same joint.\n\nSprings on the side show how contraction and expansion of steam packing is automatically taken care of, thereby positively eliminating leaks.\nThis is a very important factor in the heating system of the Prosperity Garment Press. This invention is decidedly unique as both intake and return are embodied in one joint, so constructed that steam is drawn and forced through one passage and out another passage as shown in the illustration.\n\nNote the space for taking up on joint which is sufficient to make your packing last a very long time under severe usage\u2014because you get the maximum efficiency of your packing.\n\nThis joint is really \"the lungs\" of the Prosperity Garment Press, as the steam is drawn and forced through one passage into the machine and through the other passage in coming out.\n\n---\n\n**THE PROSPERITY PRESSURE MECHANISM**\n\nThe development of a simple toggle and lever construction which will lock while the toggle joint is \"on center\" is a marked step forward in making the pressing machine a popular machine with the employees, as it eliminates jar and rebound and avoids wasted effort.\n\n\"On center\" is the position for a toggle joint at which it will exert its greatest possible pressure; mechanical science proves that this is true and, furthermore, proves that the position \"before center\" and the position \"beyond center\" gives undeveloped pressure in the former case and diminished pressure in the latter case. The Prosperity Press has a latch which locks in perfect synchronism with the position of the toggle joint when \"on center\" and holds it there until the machine is released by operator.\n\nThe feature of synchronizing the locking function of the lock mechanism with the \"on center\" position of the toggle joint is patentable and an exclusive Prosperity feature. Other presses, although they may have complicated leverage or cam systems for controlling pressure do not have this synchronized action, and the result is insufficient pressure either on account of locking \"before center\" or wasted effort plus insufficient pressure by reason of going \"beyond center.\" Complicated leverage and cam systems wear quickly and soon lose whatever degree of efficiency they may have originally possessed.\n\nHow well the Prosperity aim \"the simplest is always the best\" has here, too, succeeded can best be told by the operators who benefit by this wonderful design and prefer working on the Prosperity machine. Jar and rebound are eliminated which means the minimum of wear on the press combined with ease of operation.\nThe ironing head of the Prosperity Press is perfectly balanced by means of equalized weights. Of course, spring tension is also provided on either side of the swinging arm so as to bring in any of the finer adjustments required by the individual operator or by the particular class of work, and the result is that this balanced construction adds wonderfully to the popularity of this press with the employees.\n\nThe ratio of leverage on the Prosperity Garment Press combined with the simplified single toggle joint construction gives to this machine greater pressure than is possible in other presses. The ratio on this machine is one to eleven which is over 52% more than any other on the market.\n\nThis combination of single toggle joint construction and simple leverage is the most efficient it has been possible for mechanical engineers to devise. It eliminates over 65% of moving parts used on older type machines and that means a minimum of trouble and upkeep cost.\n\nTHREE-POINT SUSPENSION\n\nWhen you have material of varying thickness to iron you need flexibility in the press, and this is insured to you in the Prosperity Garment Press. Compensation of the ironing head is automatically taken care of through the novel three-point suspension of the head on the yoke. Because of this construction the machine will allow for the thickness in the long way of ironing as well as the narrow way. This is not true of other presses.\n\nIt is an admitted fact that three-point bearing or suspension will adjust itself to an uneven surface with a great deal more flexibility than any other construction.\nWith this fact in mind the designers of Prosperity Garment Press worked out the plans so that we have a three point suspension of the legs, three-point suspension of steam separator to table, three-point suspension of the lower buck to the steam separator and a three-point suspension of the upper buck to the yoke.\n\nThe combining of these several items of three-point suspension, and the novel method of applying the three-point suspension to the upper buck, gives to the Prosperity Garment Press a flexibility not possessed by the older types of machines.\n\nNote the size and weight of frame which will absolutely withstand any quantity of work the machine might be expected to do covering a period of many years. Also note the balanced construction; the head and counterweight are evenly balanced so that practically a typewriter touch will start the motion either up or down.\n\nNote that it possesses strength, where strength counts. Note that there is nothing complicated about its mechanism and remember that in machinery the fewer the parts the stronger the machine.\n\nEach and every part of the Prosperity Press is accessible\u2014interchangeable\u2014replaceable, but the wearing parts are so few that the first expense is practically the last.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nLength of ironing head, 39 inches; width at large end, 13\u00bd inches; width at small end, 8\u00bd inches; floor space, front to back, 53 inches, left to right, 56 inches; weight, 950 pounds.\nSingle Roll, Flat Work Ironer\n\nMADE IN FOUR LENGTHS, 48, 64, 75 AND 90 INCHES\n\nFor covering see page 144.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nToronto Standard Flat Work Ironer\n\nThe cut on the opposite page shows our \"TORONTO\" STEAM-HEATED ROTARY FLAT WORK IRONER, which is recognized as a favorite with public Laundries, Hotels and Institutions. It has a steam cylinder 16 inches in diameter running in combination with three auxiliary padded rolls, covered with heavy wool covering, which absorbs the moisture and protects the hems of the goods. The machine presents a radiating surface of from 2500 to 5000 square inches (according to length of cylinder), sufficient to dry and iron the goods taken directly from the extractor.\n\nThe gears are covered with shields and safety guard on feeding side, so arranged as to reduce all possible danger to a minimum.\n\nAn especially desirable feature of this machine is that the steam inlet and drain are, by an improved device, both at one end of machine. We guarantee by this improved device on trap system to be freer of condensation than any other Mangle on the market today.\n\nThe advantages of this feature render it by far the most desirable Mangle every offered to public Laundries, Hotels, and Institutions.\n\nThe construction of this Mangle throughout is of the best material, including cut gears, steel shaft, and is finished in nickel and brass.\n\nThis machine has been so improved that the auxiliary rolls are all driven from one large gear on end of cylinder, doing away with the train of gears on end of Mangle opposite driving end, thereby removing all unequal strain. These machines are all properly adjusted and tested before leaving our factory.\n\nThe machine operates with a single belt, and is started or stopped by means of a lever operated clutch. In addition to these safety devices above mentioned, the pressure is applied to the roll by means of a lever, and this pressure is relieved and the rolls drop free of each other by merely moving this lever a few inches.\nStarch Extractor\n\nThis Starch Extractor is designed to remove surplus starch from dipped goods, by centrifugal force. The basket controlling mechanism and the basket are similar to those of our Solid Curb Extractors previously described. The outer shell is of heavy copper, tempered on the inside and is detachable. It is but a moment's work to take off the shell.\n\nWhen this is removed every portion of the basket is entirely accessible and may be thoroughly and quickly cleaned. This extractor is durable, easy to keep clean and will prove useful in any laundry. It is made in two sizes, with either detached or attached counter-shaft. Belt or motor driven.\n\n20-inch Basket\n\nThe countershaft should make 440 revolutions per minute. The tight and loose pulleys on countershaft are 6 inches, with 3 inch face. Floor space, 28x15 inches. Weight, 650 pounds.\n\n24-inch Basket\n\nThe countershaft should make 400 revolutions per minute. The tight and loose pulleys on the countershaft are 8 inches in diameter, with 3 inch face. Floor space, 33 x 41 inches. Weight, 1,000 pounds.\nImperial Washer\n\nThis is our special washer designed to carry the heaviest kind of a load with the least amount of belt power, and it is so constructed that this machine can be turned over with a belt one-quarter of the size that is used on what is termed the ordinary Standard Washing Machine.\n\nIn construction it is similar to all of our other washers, the outside shell being made of the very best grade of clear cypress, 2-inch stock. It is made with either iron or wood heads, but preferably of wood, as while there has been a great demand for iron heads in the past, the expense is not warranted where machines are made with self-supporting iron end frames, as used in all of our different types of machines.\n\nThe inside cylinder is made regularly from clear heart stock yellow pine, but can be furnished in maple, when desired.\n\nThe Automatic Reverse Movement is simplicity itself and absolutely positive in its reversing action.\n\nAll loose pulleys are fitted with grease cups, while tight pulleys, pinions and gears are accurately key-seated. Every feature of this machine is of the very highest type and we invite comparison with other makes.\nBrass Washer Cylinders\n\nThese are made in diameters of 3\u00bd\" and 4\u00bd\" and in lengths of 12\", 18\", 24\", and 36\". Brass cylinders are not carried in stock, as most work of this kind is special and, therefore, we prefer to build to specifications.\n\nWe can furnish these cylinders in either numbers 12 or 13 half hard brass and with any number of file desired.\n\nThe catches and locks on door are of very simple form; of ample width and so arranged that new springs can be easily inserted. The hinges are extra heavy and are so arranged that when the door closes it laps under the back of the cylinder and takes the strain off of the hinge pins.\n\nCylinders are made with or without par- tition and with one or more doors, and the door can be made full length of the cylinder when desired, but poorer to manufacture as shown in the cut, as this style of construction lends stability to the cylinder.\n| ITEM | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                                                 | UNIT PRICE | EXTENSION |\n|------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n|      |          | **LAUNDRY MACHINERY FOR SPANISH RIVER INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL - SPANISH - ONTARIO** |            |           |\n| 1    |          | 36\" x 54\" Sterilizing Washer as manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co.

Paget,\nPurchasing Agent, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa \u2014\u2014 Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have tendered on the Laundry Equipment for the Spanish River Industrial School, but possibly our tender will require a little explanation.\n\nWe have heretofore been selling exclusively the Toronto Laundry Machine Co. Limited's machinery but unfortunately, owing to the death of the President of that Company, Mr. John O'Reilly, M.P., the Laundry Machine business has been disposed of to the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Limited, and we have, therefore, been compelled to get other Agencies. We have made an agreement with the Lutes-Similair Co. of Benton Harbor, Michigan, to sell their machinery temporarily. This machinery ranks highest for quality and durability. We sold a large number of their machines in the West some years ago and they have given wonderful satisfactions. We have also changed from the Canadian Hoff-Man Company's Presses to the Prosperity Press because these machines showed so great superiority over any other make of Press that we have examined.\n\nNow, the arrangements mentioned above are only temporary. It is our intention, if we can make the necessary arrangements, to manufacture a high grade line of Laundry Machinery ourselves. This will be much to the benefit of everyone interested in Laundry Machinery including your selves, as otherwise there would be absolutely no competitive firm in Canada to the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. It will, however, take us two or three months to get on a producing basis, and in the meantime would ask you to give consideration to the tender we have placed herewith, and we can assure you that the machinery quoted on this is absolutely first class and made by reputable firms of long standing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE BEAVER SOAP CO.

The Principal acknowledging the generosity of the Department in supplying the machinery has returned me the account minus the labor and part of the material.

Moreover, a detailed list of material could not be prepared at one time.

(RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\nOctober 25, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nFrom time to time, as funds were available, different Indian residential schools have received an increase in pupilage. I am strongly in favour of granting such increases, when possible, if the required accommodation is available in the individual institutions already existing dormitories. I believe it to be in the interest of economy for both Department and Churches if we fill the existing residential schools to the limit of their accommodation. I am pleased to report that for the fiscal year ended March 1923, there were on the roll at residential schools a total of 5847 pupils - an increase of 564 in the past two years.\n\nI have had a lengthy discussion with the Rev. Father J. B. Smith, S.J., the new incumbent at the Spanish Residential School, and I have urged upon him the acceptance of pupils up to the limit of his accommodation. He has made a report since his return to the school, and is willing to accept 112 boys and a like number of girls - a total of 224, or an increase of 54. Air space in dormitories and classrooms is more than sufficient for the added number of pupils.\n\nThe Rev. Principal understands that, if we increase the pupilage, the institution will open its doors to the orphan and destitute children of Gaugamela, St. Regis and Oks. Last year the Rev. Father Arnot hindered the Department's efforts to place our wards from these reserves in the Spanish School, in spite of the fact that certain cases were very urgent.\n\nIn view of the new Principal's readiness to meet the Department's wishes, I shall be pleased to have your authority to grant his request that we increase the pupilage to 224 by purchase for the institution 54 beds, complete with mattresses (expense in connection with the purchase estimated $180).\n\nI should also be pleased to have your authority to supply five sewing machines to this school. The Rev. Principal has asked for eight. There is no record that the Department has ever supplied sewing machines to the Spanish School. These five machines will cost in the neighborhood of $310.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that the Department does not supply baseball outfits to residential schools. We are not prepared to supply the punching bags and tennis outfit.\n\nRegarding the band instruments, I beg to say that there are no funds specially provided for the purchase of equipment of this nature. I shall be pleased, however, if you will furnish a list of the instruments which you require and the approximate cost of the same. Consideration would be given to the providing of funds necessary to purchase the same in next year's appropriation.\n\nThe 6 footballs and 2 volley ball equipments mentioned above are all the Department is prepared to provide at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | 3\u00bd dz.

Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Letourneau, of Caughnawaga, has forwarded a letter which Frank Labache, a pupil of the Spanish Residential School, sent to his sister requesting that he be supplied with a glass eye to replace the one which he had broken. In this connection I have to request that you will arrange to have this boy fitted with a glass eye. It might be well, at the same time, to obtain an extra eye which could be used to replace any damage. It may be necessary to have this boy sent to Sudbury or the Soo to an optician. If so, no unnecessary expense should be incurred. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the boy fitted with a glass eye and at the lowest possible cost. You should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the eye and also for any expense which may be incurred in taking the boy to an optician.\n\nThis matter should receive your early attention, and I shall be pleased to hear as to what action you have taken to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. B. Sauve, S. J.,\nPrincipal, Spanish Res. School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have been in constant use for many years and are worn out. We would need seating accommodation, single desks, especially for 60 of the older boys as follows:\n\n10 rows with 5 seats in each row\nalso 10 rears and 6 fronts for pupils aged as follows:\n10 for pupils 10 to 12\n35 \" 12 \" 14\n15 \" 15 \" 17\n\nThe above will improve the appearance of the class room as urgently needed; single desks are a great help for discipline and would render the teacher's task easier in class.\n\nIt would be of a great assistance to the School if they were supplied by the Department.\n\nI would be pleased to receive them as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bahnson\nGeneral Manager\nThe building has three stories above a basement that is at least 10 ft above the ground. There is a central stairway and one inside at one end. They have ropes at the upstairs windows but in case of fire they would be useless for girls. Their only means of escape would be the end stairway and this is above the kitchen they would be cut off in case of fire.\n\nA fire escape at one end along with wide with a hand rail on each side so that the girls could descend two abreast would be satisfactory. The height inside each room on each story is about 12 ft. Such a fire escape would be around 45 ft or maybe a little more. This however is only a rough estimate.\n\nThere is nothing like a fire escape in case of fire. If such an escape happened the inside present conditions of it commenced in the basement on the west end of the house the occupants would be caught as in a trap. The dormitories on the top floor.\n\nThe corporation is now in debt in their effort to educate and train Indian girls and I feel that the Department should assist at least in the erection of a fire escape at least end the building. The long central corridor on each floor would lead to it and all would be set at rest.\n\nI feel this is urgent as any confusion even the least would also mean grave concern if a fire resulted.\n\nI feel that you will consider it favorably.\n\nJ.M. Bennett\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the SPANISH RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, September 4, 1924.\n\nI have been encouraging a fire escape to be placed on at least one end of this building as they have an inside stair on the other end as well as a centre stair. The expense of carrying the school plant has already placed the corporation in quite a debt and they simply cannot afford the money for a fire escape. I and the Department as well as the corporation would be severely criticized in case of disaster. Could not the Department at least help toward the cost?\n\nJ. M.

The site of the School is near the mouth of the Spanish River and the School authorities make considerable use of boats and consequently require a channel to their boat-house. We understand that owing to various reasons this channel has become blocked and if it remains so it will necessitate the school authorities moving their wharf a considerable distance from the school.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informs us that if a channel about \u00bd mile long, 30 feet wide and 6 feet deep, all in sand, were dredged it would not be necessary for them to move their wharf. He further states that he has already discussed the matter of dredging with your Agent Mr. Fuller at SaultSte. Marie.\n\nThis Department would be pleased if you would give the above matter careful consideration and if possible arrange for the dredging desired by the Principal.\n\nAny correspondence to the Principal of the school should be addressed - Reverend Charles Belanger, S.J., Principal, Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\nThe Condition of the Power and Heating Apparatus at the present time and the suggested Changes.\n\nThe boilers at present are not the right type. They are Cast-Iron sectional, good for Coal, but very badly suited for wood in comparison with the return horizontal tubular boilers.\n\nThere are three boilers of this Cast-Iron type in the Girls' Building and two in the Boys' which means that for heating purposes only, regardless of heating domestic water or generating steam to operate the Laundry, they are operating five fires and also a hot air furnace in the chapel.\n\nOwing to the way the boilers are installed in the Boys' building it is necessary to light both of the boilers to heat the entire building, even the mildest weather.\n\nRegarding the operation of the Laundry in the Girls' Building, they are not able to properly utilize the Laundry Equipment owing to the fact that the Boiler is entirely too small to operate the engine which runs the machinery and the drying room. Owing to this it is impossible to properly ventilate the dryer during the drying operation; the bad results from this are showing on the clothes.\n\nThe hot water used for Laundry purposes and for domestic use in general is heated with a Jacket Heater connected to a 100 gal. storage tank; both the Jacket Heater and the storage tank are a great deal too small for the work they have to do; the result is that the heater runs with all the drafts open to try heating enough water, which is impossible for it to do. Coal is burned in this Heater at quite a loss.\n\nIt will be seen by the above stated facts that the condition of the hot water heating, the domestic water heating and the steam power plant at these buildings are in a very bad condition.\n1---That the right type of boilers are not used.\n2---That the Steam and Domestic Heating Equipment are not near large enough.\n3---The boilers in the Boys' building are in separate units.\n4---That 2 Sections of the boilers are defective. One section in No 3 Boiler in the Girls' building and one in No 2 Boiler in the Boys'.\n\nSuch is the condition of the plant in the present time, and it has caused a great deal of trouble this last winter.\n\nTo remedy the above, the following is suggested:\n\nInstall a Central Steam Plant in a separate building and generate enough steam to heat the two buildings and also to supply the Laundry and Domestic hot water, which is essential to good results and economical operation in a Laundry.\n\nIn the new plant there will be but one fire used during the greater portion of the heating season; in the very severe weather it would be necessary to light the second boiler but the greater portion of the time one will suffice in place of eight as now required. It is quite readily seen the savings which will occur both in operation and fuel with this installation and furthermore it will be possible at any time to install a small Steam Driven Generating Set to provide enough power for Light and Laundry purposes and use the exhaust steam for heating; the plans have been drawn with this in view.\n\nThe plan shows three boilers; the two large boilers are for winter use, one acting as an auxiliary to the other; the small boiler for the Laundry work in the summer.\nThe boilers are to be of H.R.T. type, brick set, hung front and rear, of dimensions as shown on plan; to be complete with all necessary trimming including twin safety valves, blow off valves, flue cleanout doors; Cast-Iron Fronts; shaking grates; Cyclone or equal and are to be constructed for a working pressure of a hundred pounds in accordance with the Ontario Boiler Act for operation in Ontario.\n\nThe two large boilers are to be hung as shown on plan from one cross steel beam with necessary upright supports. The small boiler to be independently erected in a similar manner and all to comply with the Ontario Boiler Act.\n\nPlans of brick setting are to be furnished with the boilers; all internal walls from three courses below the grates are to be lined with the approved fire bricks dipped in fire clay, the external walls will be built of cement or clay brick as approved, laid in cement mortar.\n\nThe smoke breeching is to be constructed of 14 gage sheet steel shaped as shown on plan and to be stiffened with necessary angles and T irons. Cleanout sliding doors of ample size to be placed where shown.\n\nThis pump is to be of sufficient capacity to handle all the return condensation from the entire plant; it is to be duplex, brass lined with bronze covered pistons, rods fitted with a mechanical lubricator; the pump is to be mounted on a Cast-Iron base and connected to a Cast-Iron receiving tank three ft. by 24 inches and is to be automatic; it is to be for high pressure as well, as low pressure work and is to operate anywhere between 5 to 100 lbs.\nCONVERTERS\n\nThere are to be 2 steam converters each one of sufficient capacity to heat 7000 sq. ft. of direct hot water radiation independent of mains. Shell to be Cast-Iron or steel with floating heads and U tubes. Tubes to be brass. Simms, Kelly or Many or equal. Capacity to be based on steam at 5% lbs. pressure. Each heater is to be furnished with a low pressure steam trap; this trap is to discharge into a main return and may be Squiers, Wright, Bundy or equal.\n\nPRESSURE REDUCING VALVES\n\nPressure reducing valves to be as shown on plans and of sizes indicated 2\u00bd in. and over to be flanged; 2 in. and under to be screwed. Mason, Darling Bros., Crane or equal.\n\nBACK PRESSURE VALVES\n\nBack pressure valves are to be placed on the exhaust from the engine in the Laundry and on the exhaust on the return pump in the boiler room, 2\u00bd in. on the engine and 2 in. on the pump Iron body screwed No 384 Crane catalogue or equal.\n\nOIL SEPARATORS\n\nOil separators to be placed on exhaust from pump and engine 2\u00bd in. and 2 in. Crane Cat. No 01 or equal,\n\nDrip traps of ample capacity are to be placed on the steam main leaving building on the returns from the Laundry machinery and dryer and are to be Bundy, Darling, Crane or equal.\n\nDischarge of all traps are to be connected to main return line.\nSTEEL TANKS\n\nTo save the expense of excavating and to secure proper drainage it is the intention to install a steel tank to set the pump and receiver in, to secure gravity return to same. This tank is to be made of 1/2 in. steel plate riveted and sealed tight and is to have a 3 in. angle iron riveted on top; this angle iron is to be drilled at corners for anchor bolts 1/2 in. which are to be furnished with tank. This tank is to be set in position as shown on plan, previous to the installation of the concrete floor in the pump room.\n\nDOMESTIC HEATER FOR LAUNDRY\n\nA 500 gal. storage tank and heater is to be installed in the Laundry, horizontal type, steel shell, with brass tubes, Simms, Kelly, Darling Bros., or equal, with Powers or Sarco Automatic temperature control. This tank is to have a safety valve 1/2 in. dia. set at 75 lbs. also a mercury thermometer. This heater is to be of ample capacity to heat 500 gal. of water per hour from 45 degrees to 180 with steam at 5 lb. pressure and is to be connected to the exhaust of the engine in the Laundry room, also to leave steam main and to the present Jacket heater.\n\nPIPING & WORK IN GENERAL\n\nThe Cast-Iron boilers in the boys' building (3) to be removed and the mains and returns to be grouped together in two headers. These headers are each to have an 8 in. branch for connection to converter, with valves on same. The valves on the mains are to be left as at present. Run the necessary steam and returns from boiler room and connect to converter as shown on details.\n\nNo 3 boiler in the girls' building is to be removed and the present header arranged to provide an 8 in. outlet for connection for Converters. Install the necessary steam and return piping to Laundry Engine Room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe piping to the dryer and other laundry equipment will also start from the Laundry engine room where the duct from the central heating plant enters building.\n\nThe piping in general is to be run as shown on the plan unless otherwise ordered and is to be of the sizes marked. All pipe is to be Standard Steel pipe except that in the duct which is to be extra heavy. All fittings are to be Standard Cast-Iron, screwed up to and including 2 in. and flanged 2\u00bd in. and over unless otherwise ordered.\n\nCare is to be taken regarding expansion.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada in charge of the Indian Residential School at Spanish, beg to submit the following remarks to your kind attention.\n\nThe heating system of the large school buildings, always more or less defective from the start; has become so unsatisfactory and expensive, that it is in absolute need of renewal or complete repair. In the cold weather the furnace of the girls' school, worked to its utmost capacity, cannot raise the temperature higher than 600 Fahrenheit. Some sections of the boilers in all furnaces are completely out of order.\n\nThe total absence of unit connections makes it necessary to light the eight fires even in mild weather and thus increase enormously the fuel expense.\n\nWe have had these conditions examined by some of the best experts in heating systems and they have at once declared that the only economical device would be a Central System that would heat the two school buildings and operate satisfactorily the laundry equipment as well as the electrical generators which your Department has so generously installed, three years ago.\n\nWe herewith submit plans and specifications of these experts. As explained in the said plans and specifications the cost of the material for the additional building, boilers, pipes, duct etc for the whole system would be approximately $23,346.00.\n\nAs particular circumstances have added to our staff expert craftsmen who can reliably execute the work under whatever supervision you might decide upon, we could take charge of the whole installation provided your Department would supply the material required. We therefore make an official request for said material under conditions above referred to.\n\nWe realize that we are asking for a great favor but it is a case of absolute necessity for the welfare of\nthe Department's wards. We have taken the liberty of making this demand in consideration of the work carried on by us and the heavy expenses incurred by our institution. May we be allowed to mention that since the foundation of our school in 1870 we have always endeavored to serve the Department with devoted fidelity. Amongst other things we would state that we have always gladly accepted whatever number of Iroquois children were sent to us.\n\nSince 1913, we have invested over $240,000.00 in the present buildings and farms at Spanish. With a staff of 16 men and 18 women we are now educating 237 Indian children to the very best advantage of the Indians and the greatest economy for the Department.\n\nNow we understand that the Department is not presently in a position to give us financial help out of this year's estimates but we beg to propose the following plan: We would agree to borrow sufficient money to cover the whole cost and undertake the work. In the course of the next fiscal year when the estimates of the Department would be voted we could present for reimbursement all bills for material duly paid by us.\n\nWith keen hopes of a favorable answer, we have the honor, Dear Sir, to remain\n\nYour humble servants,\n\nTHE JESUIT FATHERS OF UPPER CANADA\n\nper\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Rev. Principal of the Spanish Indian Residential School, I beg to report that I have examined the plans and specifications for a new heating system for these buildings. The present system consists of three hot water boilers in the girls' building and two in the boys', also a boiler for heating the domestic water supply for the building and steam for the laundry. The chapel is heated by a hot air furnace. The main defects in the present system are that the boilers, being cast iron section type, are not suitable for burning wood; that the steam and the domestic heating equipment are not large enough to meet the requirements of the buildings; and that the firing of so many boilers is both uneconomical and unsatisfactory.\n\nIn order to remedy the above it is suggested to install a central steam heating plant in a separate building, and generate enough steam to heat the two buildings and also to supply the laundry, and it is proposed to install in this separate building two large fire box return tubular boilers, which are suitable for burning wood as well as coal. The Reverend Principal states that the staff of the school will take charge of the whole installation, providing the Department will supply the materials. They estimate the cost at $23,546.00, and it would appear that this estimate is reasonable, but I cannot state definitely what the cost would be without visiting the school and making a careful examination of the existing system, and checking up the plans for the new work in the buildings.\n\nThe Principal states further that since 1915 they have invested over $240,000.00 in the present building and farms at Spanish. They have a staff of 16 men and 18 women, and are now educating 237 Indian children. He states further that if the Department is not in a position to give financial help out of this year's estimates, that they will agree to borrow sufficient money to cover the cost of the work, the amount to be refunded to them next year. They would present bills for all materials used.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. H.

As you are aware there is no money provided in the Estimates for the improvement in the heating apparatus for your building, and just at this juncture I could hardly ask the Government to take the important step of guaranteeing that any would be available in next year's Estimates to cover the cost of the work.

Therefore, I have advised the local Superior, Reverend Father Belanger, to have the actual heating plant thoroughly overhauled and repaired. This, I think can be done with satisfactory results for less than $5,000.\n\nThe increase of 92 cts. a month per capita for the pupils in residence will hardly solve our financial difficulties, but I wish to assure you, Sir, that we appreciate this token of that good-will we have always met with in the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI remain, Honourable Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While not criticizing hand work which we believe is beneficial, we think you will realize this is becoming less and less used in a commercial way, and in order to be able to secure employment in any modern repair shop the operator is versed in the handling of Machine work, which phrase has been considered by the Department of Justice in installing Machinery in the Penitentiaries and by the D.S.C.R. in vocational re-establishment work.\n\nWe are taking the liberty of forwarding you under separate cover a copy of our latest Goodyear Welt Shoe Repairing Machinery catalogue which illustrates the various Shoe Repair Outfits we can supply built in our Montreal factory and would be pleased to have you look these over.\nIf there is other information or details concerning this proposition that we can supply that would be of assistance to you in reaching a decision if you will kindly advise your inquiry will have our careful attention.\n\nTrusting we may have the pleasure of supplying equipment for the School.\n\nYours very truly\n\nUNITED SHOE MACHINERY CO OF CANADA LTD\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.M.

This meter is very desirable because of its strength. It is the one best suited to the work in hand, though perhaps somewhat expensive.\n\nThe United Shoe Co. informs me that they propose to the Department a finishing machine. Should I dare mark Figure E, 1024?\n\nAs for the meter it must, if it is to be useful here, be an electric one.

Measurements will be sent when we know the strength required.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some changes are absolutely necessary on account of the new addition added to our school to provide for a better accommodation for the children, principally in the dormitories.\n\nThe Department very kindly provided a sum in their estimates this year but, as we were not prepared to go ahead with the heating, they kindly promised consideration for necessary changes that were made in the lighting arrangements.\n\nEnclosed is an estimate received from Crane Limited, which shows that the proposed changes would amount to about $3,101.00. In addition there would be expenses of about $875.00 making a total of a little over $4,000.00.\n\nAs the expenses of this new addition are very high for our poor means, I dare once more, to beg from our generous benefactors who showed a great interest in our common work \"the betterment of the poor Indians.\"\n\nI would respectfully request the Department to make provisions for this expenditure in the estimates for the fiscal year 1927-28. I can assure you that, if this is made, your kindness will be greatly appreciated and the improvements that will be effected in the heating arrangements will not only be very beneficial but are absolutely necessary.\n\nThanking you for past favours and hoping that my present request will meet with approval.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Improvements to plumbing and heating, a new hull for the school launch and smaller items amounting to approximately $4,500 have been allowed.\n\nWhen the Rev.

In addition, there has been an expenditure of over $600 for desks, fire fighting equipment, etc. I regret that it will not be possible to give favourable consideration to reimbursing you for the entire costs of the ice house; and the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that you provide the labour. The materials and freight costs amount to $652.01 and a cheque for this will be forwarded to you under separate cover. I am returning the receipts for labour.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The trouble is that they are not the same as those furnished two years ago; then they were all cherry color, the new ones are backs and seats white and the table cherry, so it spoils the good appearance of the class. Could anything be done to have all the same color.\n\nI am sorry to give you this useless trouble.

Unless the quantities are fairly large, this is quite expensive.\n\nThe objection to a cherry finish for the backs and seats is the fact that when these become scratched, through time, the marks show more prominently on the cherry than on the natural finish.\n\nWe have asked our factory to advise us if they could make this exchange, and as soon as they let us know we will write you further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. N. Moyer Company Limited,\nGeneral Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Chas. Belanger, Spanish, Ontario.\n\nWe trust this is the information you desire and that everything may be found in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTaylor-Forbes Company, Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nCashier.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 2)\nDear sir. Would it be too abuse of your kindness than to present again this an estimate of the expenses for the next year, in order to give a better accommodation to the Indian children?\n\nTill now the Department has been so kind, that I am afraid be excessive in our petitions.\n\nThese are the things absolutary necessary, I would ask you to take them in consideration:\n\n1. One boiler for the laundry: Taylor-Forbes. $1361.75.\n2. 2 sets of batteries: Delco Light $770.00 each. $1540.00\n3. 9 fire-hose and fittings: Crane or Taylor. $360.00\n4. 58 steps for stairs: B\u00e9langer Co. $2.00 each. $116.00\n5. Metallic veneer: Eastern Steel Products Preston. $1206.20\n6. Hard wood flooring 1000' $165.00. Evans, Sudbury $1050.00\n\nTotal. $5633.95.\n\nThese are the principal items.\n\nThanking in advance for this and many past favours.\n\nYours very sincerely and obliged,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWe would be very obliged if the Department could tell us about better batteries than the Delco. Since three years only and they are completely out of use. Such an expense every three years.\nThe boiler is for the laundry, as the old one is far too small, it cannot furnish the steam for the dryer, and it has to be repaired having many tubes defective.\n\nHard wood floor (maple) birch would be cheaper, but it does not last with the heavy use of our children. $9500 is the price of birch.\n\nC.B.S.J.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. [signature]\n\nYou will remember that Father Belanger, principal of the Spanish Indian Residential School, when in Ottawa a few weeks ago, left receipts showing expenditure of over $5,000. for mechanical plant at the boys' school new wing and expenditure of over $2,000. for repairs to the plumbing and laundry equipment at the girls' wing. You instructed me to have this put in order and to bring the matter to your attention again.\n\nThere is an item of $4,000. for this purpose in the main estimates for the current fiscal year but, in view of the large expenditure for the new boys' wing, I am recommending reimbursement to the extent of $4,850.99. The papers which are attached to the explanatory voucher are now in order.\n\n[signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nNovember 24, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART,\n\nA year ago, the Provincial Superior of the Jesuit Order intimated that he was arranging to build, this year, an addition to the boys' wing at the Indian Residential School at Spanish, Ont. He requested that the Department assist by securing an appropriation to cover the cost of the plumbing and heating. I, accordingly, placed an item of $6,000.00 in the Main Estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe addition has been completed and receipts have been forwarded to the Department, showing an expenditure of over $5,000.00 for mechanical plant. In view of the heavy expense undertaken by the Order at this school, I wish to recommend that the Department make reimbursement to the extent of $4,850.99. The papers showing an expenditure of this amount are in order and the funds are now available in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nNovember 26th, 1928.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention of Mr. J. D. McLean.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe Your File 36-0-5.\n\nReferring further to our letter of November 21st, our factory has intimated that they would be willing to make an exchange in the wood parts on the desks which were supplied to Spanish in October.\n\nThis will require a special run and will take a little longer than for ordinary finish, but if it is your wish that these be exchanged we will be pleased to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. N. MOYER COMPANY LIMITED,\nGeneral Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 2)\nOttawa, November 28, 1928.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, informing the Department that you are willing to make an exchange in the wood parts of the desks which were supplied to the Spanish Indian Residential School in October, last.\n\nWe are informing Rev. Chas. Belanger, the Principal, accordingly. I shall be pleased if you will take this matter up with him, and, when ready to make the exchange in the wood parts on the backs and seats, supplying same in cherry finish, he will return the present wood parts. It is presumed that this exchange will be made without cost to this Department. I shall be pleased if this matter will receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. E. H. Moyer Co., Ltd.,\n106-108 York St.,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nOttawa, November 28, 1925.\n\nRev.

We are requesting this firm to notify you when they will make the exchange. You should then arrange to return the backs and seats which are in white and they will send you this equipment in cherry finish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The Department has been in correspondence with the Taylor-Forbes Co., Limited, with a view to having the papers put in proper order. I am pleased to inform you that authority has been secured for reimbursement of $4,850.99, and a cheque for that amount is being directed to you under separate cover.\n\nI have also your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the improvements that you contemplate next year. A note has been made for estimates, and, if the Department can assist, you will be advised.

As our bank book does not seem to enjoy such an expense, having only to show poor figures nearly all the time, may we trust in the kindness of the Department to help us out? The boat that we have now is 20 years old, and so does not want to go to any new operation, or in the ribs, or on the nose. He claims that he did enough, and we must give his eternal rest.\n\nI do not think that we can have anything for less than $6, or $700.00. We need a safe boat so that the children are not exposed in time of storms.\n\nHoping that this new begging will not bother you too much, and thanking you in advance.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely grateful,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 2)\nOttawa, August 7, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to replacing the boat at the Spanish Indian Residential School. I understand that this is the boat that it towed behind the launch for transporting children.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to state that the Department will provide the materials necessary for this boat, and you may forward an account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm supplying the lumber, etc. I take it for granted that not more than $400 will be needed for the materials. The school is expected to provide the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Chas.

So this year, the whole heating system of the girl's school has to be repaid. Already over $1500 has been paid for pipes and one new furnace, to replace an old one that is completely out of order, and $800 has to be paid for new added radiators.\n\nAs you are aware, our means are very small to face such a great expense. Would it be to abuse of the kindness of the Department, than to ask help to defray these debts? You may be assured that every penny received is strictly employed for these two schools.\n\nKnowing your past generosity towards our institutions, I am assured that you will take this petition into consideration.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nC.

Boys school:\n   a. A new boat $750. Necessary for the transportation of the children to and from the school for holidays, and also for holiday's pic-nics, it is to be hauled by the gasoline launch. The Department kindly promised by official letter of the 7th Aug., 1929 $400. for the purchase of this boat, but as I could not secure one for that price, I beg the Department, if possible, to allow the whole amount required, $750.\n\n   Also one row boat, to provide for accidents, on the trip, being hauled also by the same launch, $30.00.\n\n   b. An auxiliary furnace and boiler to supply hot water for baths $450. This is necessary to provide for hot water for baths, at any time of the year.\n\n2. Girls school:\n\n   Heating plant repaired and one new furnace, and work. All\nAll these repairs were absolutely necessary. The proximate amount is $4300.\n\nThanking you in advance for this great favour and the past one.\n\nYours very sincerely, and obliged.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be pleased if you will, at your earliest opportunity, consult Rev. Father Papineau who may be able to place them in some of the Indian day schools in which he is interested. If he requires these desks, the Department would pay the cost of shipping them upon receipt of an account, in duplicate, from you, together with a receipt attached for the shipping charges paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Would you please advise us if this school is in connection with your Department.\n\nWe are interested from a credit standpoint, and are anxious to know who is responsible for the payment of any order which we may ship to this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBEARDMORE LEATHERS LIMITED.\n\nper\n\nHT/H\n\nTANNERS IN CANADA SINCE 1844.\nOttawa, October 25, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant, I beg to say that the Indian residential school at Spanish, Ont., is conducted by the Jesuit Order in conjunction with the Department of Indian Affairs. The Reverend Principal of this school is responsible for payment of all accounts, and you may have no hesitation in filling any orders that you receive from the Spanish School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nHearldmore Leathers Limited,\n37 Front St. E.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nWater Supply:\n\nThe water supply for the Spanish School is obtained from a spring situated two hundred yards back of the school. From this spring the water runs to reservoirs situated near the respective schools and, from these reservoirs, the water is pumped by windmills to the tanks on the top floor of each building. Father Howitt stated that, during the past month, a number of the boys have, apparently, not been as well as could be expected and he rather suspected the water. As a result, he arranged with the Ontario Provincial Health Officer residing at Blind River to test the water. He advised Father Howitt that the water was not as good as it should be, although he did not actually condemn it. He stated that, in his consideration, the water in the reservoirs was becoming slightly contaminated by surface water. Another sample of water had just been sent and Father Howitt stated that, in the event of it not being an improvement on the previous sample, he would advise the Department.\n\nI had an opportunity of seeing both the boys and girls at meal time and found that both were receiving good food in ample quantity.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                        | AMOUNT   |\n|------------|--------------------------------|----------|\n|            | Furnaces repairs               |          |\n|            | Robertson Co.                  | $6,360.55|\n|            | Canadian Asbestos Co.          | $107.95  |\n|            | Brathwaite                     | $96.81   |\n|            | Steel Trough and Machine Co.   | $16.50   |\n|            | John Carri\u00e8re material         | $55.40   |\n|            | \" work                         | $280.00  |\n|            | A.O.

The balconies are made of pipe bent and welded in place.\n\nBefore having the welding done I asked quotations from a local garage man who has a welding outfit. He wanted 25cts per weld of which there are 180 i.e. $45.00. The four platforms i.e. cutting, drilling, welding the iron plate etc was estimated at $15.00 each.\n\nInstead of paying this sum of $105.00 I thought it better to buy an outfit at the special rate the Canadian Liquid Air Co extends to schools and thus have the added advantage of teaching the boys something of this trade.\n\nBills for the amount which I would like refunded are enclosed.

The engineer, Mr. Jacoby, tells me to strike out the Water Pump Co $14.00 as this was for repairs on the old pump. Also to omit sundries $25.00 for these small items are scattered over several bills.
