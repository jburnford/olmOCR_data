It is Understanding, from the ground up, of how to make School Furniture that has made Rhodes-Curry Desks so well known and so satisfactory to the hundreds of Schools wherein they are in use throughout the Maritime Provinces.\n\nIn buying Desks you are buying something for your School which should last a life time; for this reason the matter of price should be the last consideration. The real cost of School Furniture is not always the price you pay, but the use you get.\n\nOur idea in connection with the manufacture of School Furniture is to make as comfortable a Desk and give the very best value we can for your money. In buying Rhodes-Curry Desks this is just what you will get.\n\nOur Silent Sanitary type in both fixed or adjustable style is the last word in School Desks, and our Commercial Desk and Chair is widely used for High Schools, Colleges and similar Institutions. For Country Schools and places where the greatest seating capacity for the lowest expenditure is necessary, it is impossible to get anything better than the Paragon Double Seats and Desks.\n\nThe following pages will give you all the information that you will require regarding sizes, designs, prices, etc., but we will be very glad to answer any further questions that might occur to you. Look at the several letters thru the price list from a few of our satisfied customers.\n\nThe prices quoted are all f.o.b. Amherst, tax free, and we ask you to bear this in mind when comparing our quotations with Upper Canadian figures, as the freight will be considerably less from Amherst to any point in the Maritime Provinces, and in addition you will get quicker deliveries.\n\nIn hundreds of lines, no better products than those offered by Maritime concerns can be obtained anywhere. These Desks are as good or better than you can get in Upper Canada, therefore we say to you that in buying Maritime Desks, you are not only helping us, but helping yourselves.\n\nBUY MARITIME PRODUCTS; keep MARITIME money at home; help increase MARITIME employment and thus insure the present and future prosperity of the MARITIME PROVINCES.\n\nRHODES, CURRY LIMITED\nFEATURES OF SUPERIORITY IN THE\n\nSilent Sanitary School Desks\n\nIt is Sanitary.\u2014The one-piece standard with its perfect shield for the book-box presents no dust pockets or germ-breeding ledges, either inside or outside. Even the feet have been filled in so that a round surface is presented where dust and germ cannot lodge.\n\nBeauty of Design.\u2014The prevailing idea of simplicity is splendidly carried out. The proportions are unusually graceful, and the desks present an appearance in the school room.\n\nComfort Curves.\u2014The seat and back are so shaped that they insure restfulness, at the same time keeping the pupil's body in a hygienic position.\n\nStrength-Construction.\u2014By scientific calculation and practical test, we have distributed the weight so that the weight is borne by the greatest strain comes. This construction insures the essential feature of any school desk\u2014absolute rigidity.\n\nFoot Rest and Protection Board.\u2014This is thoroughly protected. Each end rests in an iron socket in the leg, and is further secured by screws passing through the iron standard into the floor. The foot rest is placed in a slanting position so that the desk slips off the casters automatically. This also acts as a protection board, preventing one pupil from annoying the pupil in front and soiling his or her clothing.\n\nBook Shelf.\u2014Unusually roomy, so that a quantity of books can be easily accommodated. The sanitary standard prevents the books from becoming cleanliness. No foreign matter can be thrown into the book-box and interfere with the passage up and down the aisle. The book shelf is screwed permanently into place.\n\nIndividual Sizes.\u2014Every casting is made from an individual pattern, giving exact and symmetrical proportions to the various sizes.\n\nSpace Economy.\u2014Every possible saving of space has been reduced to a minimum, yet sufficient space has been left to prevent the catching or pinching of any part of the body.\n\nScrew Holes.\u2014The screw holes are not cast, but are machine drilled, and counter-sunk.\n\nSweeping Room.\u2014The arch in the casting gives ample space for thorough sweeping\u2014no excuse for dirt being left under the desk.\n\nNoiseless, Automatic Seat Hinge\n\nFIGURE A\n\nThe Automatic Seat Hinge is absolutely noiseless and will not loosen. In operation, the parts automatically tighten themselves.\n\nFigure \"A\" shows the parts of the \"sanitary Noiseless\" Hinge.\n\nThe ball in the inside of the seat arm casting (1) rests in the socket in the hub of the desk casting (2). A hardened steel roller (3) runs in the hollow (4) of the hub. This roller bears against the eccentric (5) as the seat is lowered or raised. The bolt (6) passes through the seat arm casting and the hub, and is held in place by the nut (7). The nut lock (8) prevents the nut (7) from working loose from the bolt (6).\n\nThe seat arm casting operates entirely within the hub, and the bolt is used only to hold the parts in place. The construction of the hardened steel roller permits the gradual increase of friction between the hardened steel roller working against the eccentric, given a gradually increasing resistance until the seat is brought to a full stop. This permits the perfect adjustment of all parts that the hinge is absolutely frictionless and noiseless. The greater strain on the seat is when the seat is lowered, and the roller is naturally located where the eccentrics are located. With this hinge any spreading where the eccentrics are located forces the hinge-strap more securely in place than the operation of the hinges, therefore, simplifies the manufacture of the ingenious parts.\n\nFigure \"B\" shows the hinge with parts of the seat arm removed so that you can see the position of the hardened steel roller and the eccentrics when the seat is lowered. Like metal, working against like metal, would rapidly wear away. The resilient steel roller, however, permits a slight yielding so that there is no grinding or crushing of the parts. The hinge is absolutely noiseless, and its ingenious construction forces it to tighten itself when in operation.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that our Silent Sanitary non-adjustable, also Silent Sanitary Adjustable and Commercial Desk and Chair are always shipped knocked down to save weight. If required shipped set up, an extra charge of 35c. per desk is made. It is a very simple matter to put the desks together.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGES OF A MODERN DESK ARE PLAIN TO ALL\n\n(PAGE TWO)\nSilent Sanitary School Desks\n\nHow Many Will Your School Room Seat?\n\nThe plan and table on this page have been prepared for your convenience in figuring the number of desks you need. Also space may vary being governed by local laws and conditions. The builders have suggested the standard aisle widths. The suggested width of the outer aisle is designated \"A\" (the inner aisle is \"B\"). The distance from the top of the desk by \"D\" and the distance from the back of one desk to the back of the next desk by \"E\". This table was prepared using these measurements of the Silent Sanitary but will apply to any style of our desks by using the measurements given in connection with the description of the various styles.\n\nIn setting the desks in rows, it will be advisable to place the desks close together so that they will be wanted before you screw any of them to the floor. If, then, you find that the rows is too long, you can possibly gain some extra space you need by raising up slightly the space you have intended to reserve for the aisle. To accommodate the normal child the seat ordinarily should project about an inch beyond the desk top. Circumstances, however, might alter this rule.\n\nHow to Determine the Number of Rows Across the Room\n\nFrom the width of your room, subtract one wall aisle space. Then add twice the distance across the top of a desk, plus an inner aisle space. The result will be the number of rows of desks.\n\nWhen figuring in the outer aisle will measure exactly the same as an inner aisle. You may want to widen this and you can, of course, adjust the aisle space accordingly. The number of rows, generally, will depend a great deal on the size of your room, or may be governed by local laws.\n\nInstallation of Desks in School Room\n\nWe find that in many instances desks are not properly placed in the school room. One size of desks only should be placed in a row, otherwise the advantage of using a modern desk is destroyed.\n\nPlease note that our Silent Sanitary non-adjustable, also Silent Sanitary Adjustable and Commercial Desk and Chair are always shipped knocked down to save freight. If required shipped set up, an extra charge of $5c. per desk is made. It is a very simple matter to put the desks together.\n\nStrong, Safe, Rigid, Noiseless, Durable, Sanitary.\n\n(PAGE THREE)\n## Sizes and Dimensions of Single Seats and Desks\n\n| No. | Length | Height of Seat from Floor | Width of Top | Height of Top of Desk from Floor | Floor Space | Age of Pupil | Price |\n|-----|--------|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1   | 24 Inch| 17 Inch                   | 15 Inch     | 28 Inch                         | 16 to 21    | $7.50        |\n| 2   | 24 Inch| 16 Inch                   | 15 Inch     | 27 Inch                         | 15 to 18    | 7.50         |\n| 3   | 22 Inch| 15 Inch                   | 14 Inch     | 26 Inch                         | 14 to 14    | 7.25         |\n| 4   | 22 Inch| 14 Inch                   | 14 Inch     | 25 Inch                         | 14 to 15    | 7.25         |\n| 5   | 20 Inch| 13 Inch                   | 13 Inch     | 24 Inch                         | 13 to 15    | 7.00         |\n| 6   | 20 Inch| 12 Inch                   | 13 Inch     | 23 Inch                         | 12 to 15    | 7.00         |\n\nRear Seats to match\u2014all sizes ................................................................. 6.50\n\nFront Desks to match\u2014all sizes .................................................................. 6.50\n\n## Sizes and Dimensions of Double Seats and Desks\n\n| No. | Length | Height of Seat from Floor | Width of Top | Height of Top of Desk from Floor | Floor Space | Age of Pupil | Price |\n|-----|--------|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1   | 40 Inch| 17 Inch                   | 15 Inch     | 28 Inch                         | 16 to 21    | $9.00        |\n| 2   | 40 Inch| 16 Inch                   | 15 Inch     | 27 Inch                         | 15 to 18    | 9.00         |\n| 3   | 38 Inch| 15 Inch                   | 14 Inch     | 26 Inch                         | 14 to 14    | 8.75         |\n| 4   | 38 Inch| 14 Inch                   | 14 Inch     | 25 Inch                         | 14 to 15    | 8.75         |\n| 5   | 36 Inch| 13 Inch                   | 13 Inch     | 24 Inch                         | 13 to 15    | 8.50         |\n| 6   | 36 Inch| 12 Inch                   | 13 Inch     | 23 Inch                         | 12 to 15    | 8.50         |\n\nRear Seats to match\u2014all sizes .................................................................. 7.50\n\nFront Desks to match all sizes .................................................................. 7.50\n\nTHE ABOVE PRICES ARE ALL TAX FREE F.

AMHERST\n\nInkwells are included in all sizes without extra charge.\n\nHOW TO SET UP SILENT SANITARY SEATS AND DESKS\n\nFirst\u2014Sort up all sizes of Desk Woods putting all woods of each size together. Remember that there are only three different sizes of woods and six sizes of castings. Nos. 1 and 2 Castings take the largest size of wood; Nos. 3 and 4 Castings take the medium size woods and No. 5 and 6 Castings take the smallest size of woods.\n\nSecond\u2014Connect a pair of Desk Standards or Castings with a foot rest of proper size. Put in the bolts but do not tighten up fully.\n\nThird\u2014Put on the back. In putting the \"worming\" of the casting into the \"serpentine groove\" of the wood it should be about one half inch from its final position. Then using a leather faced block and hammer tap the back on its top edge till the worm and groove are in a position so that the back cannot be loosened by pulling forward, or in other words, till it is driven \"home.\"\n\nFourth\u2014Put the book shelf in place. Be sure that the ends of the book shelf fit perfectly in the grooves of the casting intended for it.\n\nFifth\u2014Put on the top. When the groove in the wood is dropped on to the worming of the casting it should leave the top of the desk about one half inch from the back. When the top is on properly drive it forward with the block and hammer until it fits snugly against the back.\n\nSixth\u2014Put on the seat in the same manner and then draw the foot rest bolts tight and the desk will hold together perfectly till the screws are put in.\n\nSeventh\u2014Put two \u00bd in. screws in the bottom of the back. Put two \u00bd in. screws in the outside edge of the top through the projections in the castings. Put two \u00bd in. screws in their proper place in the seat. Use two 1 in. screws to fasten the top to the back. Hose for these screws are drilled angle wise in the under side of the top. Use \u00bd in. screws to fasten desks to the floor.\n\nWE INVITE COMPARISON WITH ANY ADJUSTABLE DESKS MADE\nADJUSTABLE\n\nCommercial Desk and Chair\n\nThe Commercial Adjustable Box Desk and Chair is designed especially for use in Normal Schools, Colleges, Commercial Schools and other similar places requiring desks of great utility. The desk provides the maximum of comfort and efficiency. It can be adjusted to suit any pupil, large or small.

It is a simple matter to saw them and hang them to the framework or over the old wall.\n\nWRITING SURFACE EXCELLENT\nThe writing surface of Beaver Blackboard is carefully hand-plated with a series of liquid shellac varnishes. Chalk marks and erases, two of the hardest abrasives known, are used to develop this surface which takes the chalk easily and cleans equally. As proof of the durability of this surface, 51,000 chalk-marks and erasures were made on the same spot and the surface of the Beaver Blackboard was still good.\n\nBeaver Blackboard is made in either of two colors\u2014black or green. Either has the same quality of writing surface and both are non-glaring and restful to the eyes.\n\nFREE SAMPLES BLACK OR GREEN GLADLY MAILED ON REQUEST\n\n(PAGE ELEVEN)\nMr. Secretary of School Trustees!\n\nPOST YOURSELF BY POST!\n\nHERE IS YOUR 1923 PRICE LIST ON SCHOOL EQUIPMENT.

Il est fabriqu\u00e9 en cuivre rouge travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 froid, bruni en dehors et rev\u00eatu en dedans d'un enduit inattaquable aux acides.\n\nLa cage de la partie sup\u00e9rieure contient une bouteille d'acide sulfurique \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 pleine. Le r\u00e9servoir est rempli avec une solution de bicarbonate de soude et d'eau.\n\nLes extincteurs ECLIPSE ont une action instantan\u00e9e.\n\nPour les mettre en \u0153uvre, on ouvre l'extincteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9tiquette. En faisant cela, le bouchon de plomb de la bouteille d'acide tombe et l'acide se r\u00e9pand dans la solution de bicarbonate de soude, formant une \u00e9ruption de l'acide carbonique avec une pression suffisante pour projeter les deux gallons et demi de soude \u00e0 quarante pieds.\n\nEn retournant l'extincteur, le jet peut \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9.\n\nLes extincteurs ECLIPSE sont soigneusement v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s \u00e0 la manufacture sous une pression de 350 livres, mais une pression de 100 livres seulement est produite quand ils sont en op\u00e9ration.\n\nLes extincteurs ECLIPSE sont fournis complets, avec une cha\u00eene chimique et crochets pour les mettre en place.\n\nRECHARGE\n\nNous recommandons le bicarbonate de soude et l'acide sulfurique ECLIPSE pour recharger les extincteurs ECLIPSE.

It is specially adapted for use on a fire in such machines, being instantaneous in action; it will extinguish almost any fire if used during the first few minutes. All fires are small fires at first; many conflagrations can be averted if caught in time and extinguished with ECLIPSE extinguishers.\n\nECLIPSE extinguishers are approved and labeled by the Underwriters Laboratories and are essential equipment in offices, schools, theatres, buildings, etc.\n\nThe ECLIPSE extinguisher is well designed. It is made of cold rolled copper, burnished outside and heavily plated inside with non-corrosive plating.\n\nThe cage in the head holds a bottle of sulphuric acid half filled. The tank is filled with a solution of bicarbonate of soda and water.\n\nECLIPSE extinguishers are instantaneous in their action.\n\nTo operate turn extinguisher upside down. By doing so the lead stopper in the acid bottle falls out and the acid mixing with the solution of bicarbonate of soda and water generates carbon dioxide gas with sufficient pressure to throw the two and one half gallons of solution forty feet.\n\nBy turning the extinguisher right side up the stream can be shut off.\n\nECLIPSE extinguishers are thoroughly tested at the factory to 350 pounds pressure but when in operation about 100 pounds pressure only is generated.\n\nECLIPSE extinguishers are supplied complete with chemical charge and brackets for hanging.\n\nRECHARGES\n\nWe recommend the ECLIPSE soda and acid recharges as they are carefully made up and contain the proper proportions of soda and acid. They can also be used for any standard type of soda and acid extinguisher.\n\nLes Extincteurs ECLIPSE sont le dernier perfectionnement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans les machines \u00e0 bicarbonate de soude et acide sulphurique. Cet extincteur est sp\u00e9cialement adapt\u00e9 pour les premiers stades d'un incendie \u00e9tant d'une action prompte et s\u00fbre.

The Department will be informed of any corrections in approved lists, and shall, on its part, advise the Committee of any requests for tender forms which it may receive.\n\n(2) The Committee will scrutinize the requisition, and either fill same with goods surplus in other departments or, after examination of the list, return the file to the Department with instructions.\n\n(3) The Department shall call tenders, returnable to the Committee, fixing a due date which will give reasonable time to the trade to prepare quotations. An envelope addressed to the Government Contracts Supervision Committee, Ottawa, bearing in the lower left hand corner the name of the Department, subject and due date, shall be enclosed with the tender forms. Arrangements will be made between the Committee and the Department to fix one or more days per week (and hour) on which tenders will always fall due.\n(4) Responses to invitations to tender received by the Committee shall be safeguarded until the due date, when they shall be opened by a representative of the Committee and of the Department. All replies shall be time and date stamped. They shall also be initialed by both representatives and scheduled in duplicate, each copy being signed by both. One copy of the schedule will be retained by the Committee and the other copy, together with all replies will be laid immediately before the Department by its representative.\n\n(5) Tenders shall be examined by the Department, recommendation prepared, and the complete file submitted to the Committee. The transaction is to be approved at this stage by the Honourable the Minister, unless the original requisition has already been so approved when first submitted to the Committee.\n\nThe lowest tender in conformity with specification shall be recommended. If the lowest tender is not considered the most favourable good and sufficient reasons for passing over lower quotations must be stated in the recommendation.\n\nPreference shall be given to Canadian made goods whenever prices and conditions permit. When Canadian products are not available, or cannot be recommended, goods of British origin shall be given preference.\n\n(6) The decision of the Committee shall be communicated to the Department with the least possible delay, on receipt of which action as indicated shall be taken by the Department.\n\nThe Department shall anticipate and report its requirements to the Committee so far as possible in order to facilitate transfers of goods surplus in other departments, consolidate similar requirements, and enable the Committee to avoid overlapping, effect economies and ensure uniformity and standardization of purchases as between the several departments of the Government.\nPending the reduction of the $1,000.00 minimum, any special price arrangements made by the Committee and communicated to the Department, and any other rulings in respect to special lines of goods, procedure or policy, shall be exceptions to the foregoing regulations, irrespective of the amount involved (e.g., See Circular Letter from the Committee dated Sept. 19th, 1923, concerning the purchase of Ford Cars).\n\nIn filling requisitions involving an expenditure of less than $1,000.00, the Department shall invite sealed tenders from the best available sources of supply. Such tenders shall be safeguarded, and opened on the due date by two representatives of the Department. The lowest tender in conformity with specification shall be accepted, unless good and sufficient reasons for departure from this procedure can be given, of which record shall be kept for reference. Preference shall be given to Canadian and British made goods, as already mentioned; also to firms situated in the locality in which goods are required, provided tenders are equally favourable.\n\nLists of sources of supply approved by the Committee for purchases over $1,000.00 shall be used for purchases under that amount, whenever practicable. If any doubt exists as to sources of supply, the Committee shall be consulted before tenders are called.\n\nA monthly statement, showing total aggregate purchases, shall be submitted to the Committee, which will review same periodically and issue any instructions deemed advisable to prevent overlapping, effect economies and ensure uniformity, as above mentioned. Such monthly total amount shall be subdivided under the following heads:\n\n1. Provisions & Forage.\n2. Fuel.\n3. Dry Goods, Clothing, Hats & Caps, Beds & Bedding, Tents & Camp Equipment, Fire Hose.\n4. Leather Goods, including Leather Footwear & Harness.\n5.

Miscellaneous.\nFor purchases involving amounts less than $100.00, or as may be arranged with the Department, competition shall be secured, either by sealed tenders, by letter, by telephone or verbally, except in case of purchases of a petty cash nature, when no competition is necessary.\n\nThe Department shall advise the name and title of the officer who is authorized to deal with the Committee in connection with purchases, and the names of the person or persons authorized to act in connection with the opening of tenders.\n\nFull details of unsatisfactory filling of contracts shall be reported to the Committee.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nWill you please have a ruling given by the Finance Department on the matter of payment of sales tax on purchases made by Principals of Indian Schools which are not taken over by the Government. This point has recently come up in connection with purchases made by the Principal of the Clayoquot Industrial School.

Ltd., Cornwall, Ont.\n\nUpon inspection it was found that the sample submitted by the Ives Bedding Co. was of a superior quality of material.\n\nSamples of tubing used in the manufacture of institution beds and of the link used in the manufacture of the link fabric springs were also received.\nApril 11, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham gives rise to certain general questions relative to the laundry and its equipment at Indian residential schools. The activity in the laundry serves a dual purpose - the washing for the institution is done and the older girls receive instruction.\n\nIn a modern institution of 100 pupils and staff, a sufficient number of labour-saving machines should be installed to permit the washing and sterilizing of the clothes to be done with enough despatch to eliminate the irksomeness attendant upon too many days' labour per week. I believe that power machines for washing, extracting and drying are desirable in the larger institutions. The washer should be fitted with steam connections, so that the clothes may be sterilized. A small steam boiler also is therefore required. This equipment is used for the regular bi-weekly washing of bed clothing, under clothing, shirts, dresses, aprons, etc.\n\nThe officer in charge of the laundry regularly gives the girls instruction in the steps to be taken with an ordinary domestic washing. An assortment of articles to be washed is put through by hand for instructional purposes. Further, the girls will receive other experience as in an institution there are certain articles that can best be done by hand and frequently there is clothing to be boiled and washed at short notice. There is plenty of opportunity for instructing the laundry girls in ironing as this is all done by hand.\n\nFor the work that is being undertaken by hand the laundry should be equipped with a receptacle for boiling small quantities of clothes, flat iron, a box stove for heating them, stationary tubs and two or three hand wringers. Large wooden receptacles for soiled clothes and tables for ironing and sorting complete the equipment.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe Mattresses.\n\nIn future, when purchasing mattresses for Indian residential schools the specifications as previously used should be changed as it was found that the mattresses supplied were of an inferior quality. When making purchases in future, equipment as unsatisfactory as that supplied the Edmonton School should not be considered. For correspondence regarding the mattresses previously supplied see letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham dated April 1, 1924, and the department's reply thereto of this 7th of the same month, File No. 110-6-12A.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1924.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe Agent for the Globe Furniture Co., in British Columbia is Cines Limited, 1150 Hamilton St., Vancouver. This information was supplied by the representative of the Globe Furniture Company who visited the Department today.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that a representative of the Simmons Bed Company called on me, with reference to mattresses, etc., for the various schools which the Dept. has operating. They have submitted some splendid samples, which I am attaching herewith for your examination. It seems to me that the Department would be wise when buying for these schools to pay a few dollars more and get a durable article.\n\nI took up with the representative the matter of arranging to build a bed with some special receptacle for holding the clothes of the pupils, which receptacle would be fitted to the back of the bed and form a seat as well as a box to hold the clothes. They are having a draft made of this at their plant and when I receive it I will send it or to you. It seems to me that we could improve considerably on our present methods of handling the boys' clothing in the dormitories; I refer to the sleeping bag which the boys take off at night; they have either got to have chairs by the bed, which is not always possible owing to lack of space, or put their clothes on the floor which, of course, is neither sanitary nor tidy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 100-4A of the 5th instant, with reference to the beds and mattresses supplied to Indian residential schools. I am pleased to inform you that, following your report on the mattresses supplied Edmonton, the authority of the Deputy Superintendent General was secured to supply in future a better grade of mattress. The Department will look forward, with interest, to receiving the sketch of a bed suitable for our work, which is being prepared by the Simmons Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Orr,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. L. E. Thouret, our Ottawa representative, advises us that your Department will probably be in the market shortly for some Institution beds and mattress ticking for the Indian School at Kamloops, and repeats your request for a sample of a good serviceable ticking.\n\nWe enclose herewith a sample of our S.M. grade of ticking. This is the cheapest grade of ticking which is washable and which will retain its colour for years. We quote hereunder prices f.o.b. Kamloops, B.C. on mattress cases made up in this ticking to the following sizes:\n\n- $2'6\" x 4'6\" - $1.50 each.\n- $2'6\" x 5'0\" - 1.75 \"\n- $2'6\" x 6'0\" - 2.00 \"\n\nIf you so desire, we can quote you on a cheaper grade of ticking, but we do not think it would stand laundering for more than one or two years.\n\nHoping this is the information you desire, and trusting to receive your valued order, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIMMONS LIMITED.\n\n(Sgd.)

N. MOYER COMPANY, LIMITED\nTORONTO = WINNIPEG = EDMONTON\n\nQuality goes in before the name \"Moyer\" goes on\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF \"A BREATH OF AIR\"\n\nTo sustain life and health, a person breathes 2,800 gallons of fresh, clean air each hour; only one gallon of pure food and water combined.\n\nOne can live for weeks without food, but only three minutes without air. We breathe constantly.\n\nConsumption is almost entirely the result of breathing dusty, poisonous air and is preventable with the use of fresh, clean air, proper ventilation.\n\nLEWIS W. LEEDS\nConsulting Engineer Treasury Dept., U. S. A.\n\nNEED PURE AIR IN SCHOOLS\nChildren Must Be Protected From Disease, Say Health Department Authorities\n\nThe importance of proper ventilation and other sanitary precautions in schools emphasized by Dr. J. H. Miller, chief of the Division of Public Health.\n\n\"Inasmuch as it is compulsory that children between the ages of 6 and 14 years attend school, it devolves upon a community through its constituted authorities to see that its children are not forced into surroundings which endanger their health.\"\n\n\"Children are compelled to attend school during that period of life when they are peculiarly susceptible to certain contagious and infectious diseases. The school child is more liable to contract disease while attending school than at any other period of life, and by far the greater part of the illness of that age was of the preventable sort. The school child undoubtedly represents the future intelligence of the school district.\"\n\n\"It is a matter of tremendous importance that safeguards be thrown around the school building to protect the children from all influences detrimental to their welfare. There is nothing of more far-reaching importance than proper ventilation of the school building. Pure air will do more to eliminate the causes of infantile paralysis than any other single factor.\"\n\n\"An unventilated, poorly heated schoolroom is an incubator for disease, and a constant destroyer of physical and mental efficiency.\"\n\nHealth Department, April, 1913.\n\nTHIS PICTURE REQUIRES THOUGHT\u2014MERE WORDS FAIL\n\nA photograph of a School Room using a STANDARD CLEAN AIR SYSTEM, supplying fresh, balmy, clean air; God's most generous gift to mankind. We are just beginning to value properly its relation to better school work, to comfort, preservation of health and mental vigor, and life itself.\n\nNot a question of money alone but your duty to the children first.\n\nTHE BEST THAT MONEY CAN BUY\n\nA \"CLEAN AIR SYSTEM\" HEALTH RESORT, COMFORT AND IDEAL CLIMATE\n\nThe log cabin era is past, with the chimneys supplying the fresh air and the fireplaces furnishing the heat. Today we must build practically airtight buildings and must provide means for getting an outdoor cleansing air, which we constantly require. The soft balmy air is provided by our vapor pan which keeps the water boiling and supplies the correct amount of humidity, always.\n\nThe MOYER'S CLEAN AIR SYSTEM is on legs, so that it is simple to move about the room without stopping, as described on next page. The ash pit and pan is large and roomy, the inside air control doors with lever attached, show how the inside air is relocated over night or closed during the day, thus saving fuel.\n\nThe TWO-PIECE FIRE POT, showing the Non-Cracking Joint, is an invention of the Moyer Company. It is made of heavy cast iron and is the most durable construction ever made. The non-cracking joint allows for expansion and contraction and cannot crack or burn out, as you know from experience.\n\nTHE MOYER'S CLEAN AIR SYSTEM is the only GENUINE SCHOOL ROOM HEATER ever offered to the public.\n\nThe firepot, then the firebox, and next the body of the stove or heater gives out first. We use nothing but the very best material throughout and guarantee the firebox and firepot to be free from cracks. Our fireboxes are fully twice as heavy as the grates in other heaters. The FIREPOT in the MOYER'S CLEAN AIR SYSTEM is GUARANTEED for five years, which no other maker offers to do.\n\nMADE ON HONOR\u2014SOLD ON BOND. QUALITY GOES IN BEFORE THE NAME MOYER GOES ON.\n\nThe Celebrated Standard Non-Cracking Fire Pot\n\nInside view\u2014Cannot Crack\n\nDon't you remember seeing the Fire Pots crack around the center? The top of the fire pot, often called the boiler, and expands, which soon causes a crack around the pot near the center, as the lower part is cooler. This is due to the unequal expansion of the fire pot and also the side being exposed to the draft through the ash pit and grate as well as the cool air striking the lower part of the pot. The cup joint provides for this unequal expansion and avoids cracking.\n\nA separated view\u2014Will Not Burn Out\n\nThe only non-cracking fire pot in any Room Heater.\n\nHeavy, Massive and Perfect in every detail. Extra large capacity; perfect oxygen supply over the grate and over the fire surface, which is double that of others.\n\nBetter Combustion\u2014More Heat\u2014Less Fuel. The Celebrated Standard Two-Piece Fire Pot remains air tight, fire proof and cannot crack.\nThe Celebrated Sanitary \"Clean Air System,\" showing Automatic\u2014Clean Air and Foul Air\u2014Control, also Storm Shutters\n\nHeating and Ventilation generally are subject to peculiar and unusual conditions due to changing temperature and winds. A Standard \"Clean Air\" system absolutely controls air currents; therefore, dusty, poisonous air cannot re-heat\u2014cold outdoor air cannot blow down through the floor. Hot air cannot be syphoned out through the outside air duct by a high wind from the opposite side of the house.\n\nThe Complete outside Fresh Air and Inside Foul Air control is also shown. Pushing forward the lever will partly or entirely close off the Outside Air and open the Inside Air circuit as desired, day or night. Pushing toward the lever will partly or entirely close off the Outside Air and entirely close the Inside Air as desired; giving perfect control of the air current, inside, outside, or part each, as desired. As the lever closes the one, it opens the other. Both the inside and outside air control doors remain closed when the outside air control is one-half open.\n\nYOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY\u2014YOU CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO BUY\n\nWRITE FOR PRICES AND CATALOG\nHow to Install our Clean Air System\n\nSave Time and Inconveniences by following our Instructions\n\n1. Open All Packages and Assort Them.\n\n2. Fresh Air Intake.\n\n   Cut the hole for the Fresh Air Intake through the wall, starting it not less than 3\u00bd ft. from the side wall and 9 inches from the floor level. The following are the net sizes of the openings after frame has been put in.\n\n   Furnace No. C\u201412 x 12 in.\n   \" D\u201412 x 16 in.\n   \" E\u201415\u00bd x 17\u00bd in.\n   Furnace No. F\u201415\u00bd x 20\u00bd in.\n   \" G\u201415 x 22 in.\n   \" H\u201418 x 24 in.\n\n3. Chimney.\n\n   Build the Chimney at the entrance end of the building, inside the class-room, and as near the centre of the partition wall between the class-room and the cloak-room, as possible, the flue of the chimney must begin not less than 8 in. below the floor, build perpendicular if possible, and 4 ft. above the peak of the roof or any other obstructions. The Foul Air Openings in the chimney must start level with the floor.\n\n   Flue for No. C\u201412 x 16 in.\n   \" D\u201412 x 16 in.\n   \" E\u201416 x 16 in.\n   Flue for No. F\u201416 x 20 in.\n   \" G\u201420 x 24 in.\n   \" H\u201424 x 24 in.\n\n   Flue to have three air openings, if possible, at the bottom of the Chimney, beginning level with the top of the floor.\n\n   Bottom of smoke pipe hole in the Chimney, 7\u00bd feet from the floor level.\n\n4. Asbestos Paper.\n\n   Put the Asbestos Sheets where the furnace is to stand.\n\n5. Floor Iron.\n\n   Over the Asbestos Sheet put the Iron Sheet. Keep it 15 inches from the back wall, and extend equally distant on each side of the Furnace and nail it to the floor.\n\n6. Feet.\n\n   Bolt the Feet to the base, put it in place and level it, keeping it at least 30 inches from the wall until the Intake Pipe is put in place, when it will be put to its proper place. Be sure that it stands level.\n7. Ashpit.\n\nSet the Ash-pit in place and see that it is not only level, but even in front with the shield base rim; that done, take it off again and put Asbestos cement under the edges so as to make it air tight.\n\n8. Firepot.\n\nSet the Firepots level, solid and in cement.\n\n9. Control Doors.\n\nStraighten the Control Doors if necessary and tighten the Bolts through the base-rim.\n\n10. Bottom Inside Shield.\n\nPut on the Bottom Inside Shield marked \"A,\" fasten with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch bolts near each end of both control door frames and two in front to hold the ends together.\n\n11. Outside Shield\n\nPut it on the Furnace in its proper place, buckle behind. Put on the two door frames and be sure to shove the bottom one into its proper place, as well as the one above it. Mark the holes on the Shield, then lay the Shield flat on the floor with the outside up, punch the frame holes in the Shield. Set the casing on the bottom end and bolt the frames on, then put the Shield with the frames in its proper place, buckle the lower and upper straps behind.\n\n12. Rings.\n\nLay the inside centre ring into the outer centre ring on a level floor. See that they are both level and round before putting them on the Shield. Then bolt them as per holes made in the Shield.\n\n13. Intake.\n\nBolt on the intake flue, setting the bottom inside of the shield and the sides and top outside. Put in a bolt or two, couple the control rods to the intake damper. The dampers must be made to work easily and fastened so as to stay, by putting on two nuts on the coupling rod fasteners.\n\n14. Place Furnace.\n\nThe intake being bolted on properly, the damper and control doors working properly, set the Furnace so that the back will be not less than 16 inches from the wall.\n\n15. Cement.\n\nPut Asbestos Cement in the inside and outside of the ash-pit and fire-pot grooves.\n\n16. Fire Dome.\n\nFill the fire-pot groove with cement. Put on the fire dome in the centre, level it, and see that it does not tilt, and set it so that the fire door frame will be parallel and perpendicular with the Ash-pit door frame.\n17. **Baffle.**\n   Put in the baffle.\n\n18. **Top Shield.**\n   Put the top inside shield, marked \"C,\" on the Furnace and bolt it to the shield, and put the ring on.\n\n19. **Top Outside Shield.**\n   Put on the top outside shield the same as the bottom outside shield, and bolt the top ring to the shield.\n\n20. **Doors.**\n   Put on the doors, frame, see that it is parallel and perpendicular. Mark your door frame holes, then take it off and handle it the same as you did the lower shield. Put on the top rings and fasten them, as you will find holes in the rings.\n\n21. **Top Screen.**\n   Put the screen on top of the Furnace.\n\n22. **Smoke Pipe and Damper.**\n   Put the damper into the piece of pipe with the holes in, put on the extension rod, then put up the pipe properly. (See Cut No. 3).\n\n23. **Intake Collar.**\n   Put the collar on the intake flue on the side next to the Furnace, and nail it to the wall.\n\n24. **Foul Air Damper.**\n   Put the foul air dampers on the bottom of the chimney.\n\n25. **Hood.**\n   Fasten the Hood on the outside over the intake opening. (Electro No. 7).\n\n26. **Fire.**\n   Close the foul air dampers at bottom of chimney, put on a slow fire. Open doors and windows and burn off all the parafine.\n\n27. **Operating Sheet.**\n   Nail operating sheet to the wall securely, and see that instructions are followed.\n28. Test.\n\nAfter you get some heat, open the foul air dampers, light pieces of paper and drop them to the bottom of the chimney openings and see what a draft you will get up the chimney, which is a positive test that the foul air on the floor is being taken up the chimney.\n\nTHE E.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File No. 1-1-12.\n\nWe are not in a position to supply you with box stoves and galvanized iron casings.\n\nThis system was tried out by a number of County Inspectors in the Province of Ontario, and it was an absolute failure.\n\nWhat they did was to copy as nearly as possible our system, minus the fresh-air intake and the foul-air outlet.\n\nWithout these two important features, we know you are only wasting money placing a case around your stove for ventilation.\n\nIn our Clean Air System you can burn wood equally successfully as coal, and we do not know of anyone who is manufacturing a system similar to what you refer to. The few that were made in different Counties were copied after our system by local hardware men and tinsmiths working together under the instructions of the County Inspectors.\n\nAttached you will find further literature in connection with Moyer's Clean Air System, and will be pleased to serve you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. N. MOYER COMPANY LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe can supply you with a large Box Stove with galvanized iron casing for heating and ventilating purposes. Some years ago we built a number of these for a wood section of the country and they proved entirely satisfactory in every detail.\n\nThe sketches, enclosed, will give you an idea of the type of construction. The stove used was our Algoma Box which is 39\" long and has a fire door 10 x 15 in size. This is large enough to provide plenty of heat for the average one-roomed school.\n\nYou will note that the outlet for the heat is at the top of the jacket through which the smoke pipe passes. This opening is covered with sand screen to prevent pupils from dropping stuff inside of the jacket. The openings at the bottom and the sides are for recirculating the air in the school room. It is recommended that this system be used during the time that school is not in session. During school hours the cold air is brought in from outside and admitted to the heater directly underneath, through the register which can be closed when air is being recirculated.\n\nIn order to make the ventilation complete it is necessary to have a foul air stack installed at a convenient place in the room and extending through the roof with a cowl top. This takes the foul air from the flue and provides for a complete circulation. To give you an idea of what we mean, we are mailing, under separate cover, booklet illustrating the heater supplied for schools in Alberta Province.\n\nThe jacket recommended is of Galvanized Iron, neatly and substantially constructed. All parts can be supplied direct from our factory, including vent stack and cowl, if desired. The approximate cost of a heater of this sort, not including vent stack, would be $70.00. This price covers stove, register, galvanized jacket and smoke pipe extending through jacket.\n\nDecember 5th, 1924\n\nFindlay Bros. Co.

At the present writing, the business is being given to the firms mentioned in the letter:\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has placed an order with the Horn Brothers Woollen Co., Limited, of Lindsay, Ont., for 250 yards of their \"Leader\" wool sheeting, 72\" wide (32 oz. per yd.) and an order with the Dominion Textile Company, 10 Victoria Sq., Montreal, for 700 yards of their 8/4 S. 22 cotton sheeting, 72\" wide. This wool and cotton sheeting, which is being supplied at prices of . . . and . . . per yard, respectively, both prices f. o. b. . . . will be shipped to you freight prepaid. When you receive the goods, you should compare them with the samples which are enclosed with this letter and, if satisfactory, certify to the accounts in duplicate from the firms who have been asked to direct them to you.\n\nThe wool sheeting should be cut up for bed covering and the cotton for sheets and pillow cases. The 72\" width in each case will be sufficient for the length of the beds. The Department supplies this type of equipment when furnishing new Indian residential schools; but replacements must be made in future from school earnings.\nOttawa, March 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 305-11A of the 12th instant, with reference to the bed equipment that has been supplied for the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. I have read the enclosed copy of the Rev. Principal's letter. In reply I have to inform you that the Department has given careful consideration to this question, and, after consulting with several principals of experience in Indian residential schools, it has been decided not to supply a regular mattress in future.\n\nA cheap mattress is unsatisfactory from several standpoints - see your 405-11A of April 1, last - and an expensive article soon becomes unsanitary, especially on certain beds, and is then a total loss.\n\nTicking, filled with hay or oat straw, has been found satisfactory except in matter of appearance and it is now departmental policy to supply a good grade ticking instead of mattresses. The filling can be changed as often as necessary and the covering boiled. In this way the beds can be kept clean and sanitary.\n\nSeveral principals, when requesting bed equipment, asked us not to supply regular mattresses, and I then looked carefully into the question. Please inform the Rev. Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School of the Department's practice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW.

We will, therefore, be unable to accept your offer of the above mentioned desks which you have for disposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. E. H. Moyer Co.

I may say that the contract has not yet been let for the erection of the last named school. The name of your firm has been placed on our list and, when desks are required in the western provinces, you will be asked to quote.\n\nThe sample of the lithoplate which you forwarded has been received. I may say that in our new residential school buildings the furnishing of blackboards is included in the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

In this connection I would be pleased if you would state the name of the manufacturer of the desks which you assemble. If possible, please forward your catalogue of same.

It is the practice of the Department to give Messrs. J. S. Tait & Company, of Vancouver, an opportunity to quote on all school desks required in B.C. The only reason that this manufacturer has not secured more of the Indian school business is that his prices were not the lowest. I agree that local manufacturers should get the preference if prices are equal.\n\nI am informed that the Department will call for prices in the near future on desks required for the Indian residential school at Kamloops, and, of course, Messrs. J. S. Tait & Company will be asked to quote.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBrig. Gen. J. A.

I enclose herewith catalogue issued by the Tkit Pine & Foundry Co., Ltd., which gives interesting data in regard to school desks manufactured in Vancouver. I feel sure that your Department will be well satisfied with any purchases from this company.\n\nI understand that this company has been asked to tender twice but has lost out on a small margin of not more than 5% to Eastern manufacturers. This seems a very small margin and if one considers freight and other expense it probably would be just as economical to give the business to local manufacturers. Apparently, the British Columbia Government and the schools throughout the province find this to be the case and are awarding their business to this company.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) J.A.

The operating mechanism is entirely encased\u2014nothing to rust, corrode or wear. The revolving fan or rotor is die cast from metal impervious to atmospheric conditions. The motor housing and stator are cast in one piece of aluminum. The horns and weather housing over the entire unit are stainless steel. The bracket is adjustable so that the Siren may be attached anywhere and sound directed as desired. Oil is supplied to the two motor bearings through patented spring cap wick-oilers. Perfect lubrication of motor assured with only two or three oilings a year.\nFederal Electric Company\n8700 South State Street\nChicago\n\nAugust 12, 1925.\n\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Type \"A\" Federal Siren has great advantages for use in conducting fire drills at schools, as the distinctive tone of the Federal Siren cuts through all other sounds, making itself heard where any other signal would fail.\n\nIt cannot be mistaken for steam whistles, bells or any other signals whatever. It is ideal for conducting fire drills, by means of which the students can be trained to vacate the building in a very few moments, thus in case of a fire, protecting the lives of the school children and saving the school property as well.\n\nAnyone hearing the Federal Siren knows instinctively that it means fire, as the Siren tone is universally known and recognized as a fire alarm.\n\nIn order that you may acquaint yourself with the advantages of the Federal Siren conveniently and without obligations, if you will send us your order for one of our Type \"A\" Sirens, we will ship it promptly, subject to thirty days trial, with the understanding that you can try it out in various locations, thus determining the total number of Sirens needed and the places you want to locate them.\n\nAny number of them can be installed in various locations to operate from the same switch or from several switches, if desired.\n\nWe will ship the siren promptly upon receipt of your order with the understanding that if not satisfactory in every way, you may return it within thirty days, prepaid, for credit.\n\nIn ordering out this sample machine for trial and examination, please state voltage and finish desired.\n\nOSB*SA\n\nYours for safe signaling,\n\nFEDERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\n\n[Signature]\n\nSiren Dept.\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to supply 6 Singer Sewing Machines for the use of the Indian residential school at Kamloops, B.C.

We have branches in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Saskatoon, where a large stock is being carried, and our representatives at these points (The T. N. Moyer Co. Ltd.) are somewhat discouraged about submitting prices even.\n\nWe believe we are the only Manufacturers of School Furniture carrying stock in the West, and feel that we are entitled to some consideration, for this reason if no other, as orders can be filled promptly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (66-10), Volume 6016, File 1-1-12, part 1)\nOttawa, November 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant, I beg to say that when calling for prices for school furniture (desks, etc.) required for the Indian schools in the western provinces, the branch office of your representatives, the E. N. Moyer Co. Ltd., nearest the point where the supplies are required, is, along with other firms, given the opportunity to quote. The order is placed with the firm quoting the lowest price. I can assure you that your representatives will be given the opportunity to quote on all our future requirements, and if their quotation is the lowest received they will be given the order.\n\nSeveral of the other manufacturers of school furniture also have western representatives who keep stocks on hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

I have communicated to the Principal the contents of your letter.\n\nI can only say that I am disappointed at the view the Department is taking of this matter. I am today in receipt of a communication from the Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Boarding School in which he asks me if we have any mattresses that he could buy with his own earnings to replace old mattresses in use at his school, and he assures me that he will never use these straw-filled casings in his institution, and I do not blame him for this stand. Father Poulet will no doubt buy mattresses with his own earnings also instead of using these casings. I have had several conversations with the Sisters at these institutions, and I also know from personal observation that these straw mattresses can never be a success in Indian schools.\n\nI hope that the Department will not buy casings for use in the Onion Lake and new Blood Schools and then in a year's time decide that we have to resort to mattresses. It would only be a waste of money if it were decided to buy mattresses at a later date.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI think you have sufficient evidence before you to enable you to decide whether mattresses or mattress casings should be supplied. I consider that Father Delmas and Father Poulet are well qualified to give opinions on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMom, I tell the evidence was clear principal in this matter.\nEXTRACT FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S LETTER, #312-11A,\ndated December 9, 1925.\n\nMy opinion is that the Department's attitude in regard to the matter of not supplying mattresses for these institutions is most impractical and unreasonable. I have a letter from Father Delmas of Duck Lake, asking if I could buy him some mattresses. This system may be the means of having the principals buy their own mattresses, but as for economy and efficiency, there is neither.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWhen ordering desks in British Columbia, the following firms should be asked to quote:\n\n- Clines, Ltd., 1150 Hamilton St., \u2014 Vancouver, B.C.

H. Saget, Esq.,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agt.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are taking the liberty of calling your attention to the fact that while formerly we were getting some business in School Furniture from your Department, we have this year lost out in every instance although tendering exceedingly low prices. In fact, in our attempt to secure at least one order, our last quotation for New Brunswick was so very low that we cannot understand how any competitor could have gone lower without losing money.\n\nWe are the largest School Furniture manufacturers in Canada and the quality of our goods cannot be questioned.\n\nNow, our experience this year leads us to ask if there has not been some mistake in your Office in stipulating the type of desk required. We have this year in every instance been asked to quote on Box Desks which cost and are listed much higher than the ordinary combination desks.\n\nTrusting you will appreciate the spirit in which we are asking for information and favor us with an early reply, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE W.

It is regretted that in our letter of the 3rd instant asking you to quote the word \"Box\" was used in describing the desk. I note that you quote a very reasonable price on your Imperial Single Desk, and in requesting quotations from you in future this type of desk will be specified.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nF.

I enclose, for your information, pages from the catalogues of several of the firms whom we ask to quote.

As far as we are aware, they are claimed by each manufacturer to be equal to a similar type of desk made by other manufacturers. It was through oversight which is regretted\u2014that you were asked to quote on a box type of desk for Tobique Narrows. We are now asking for a quotation on school desks of the types as shown in the catalogues enclosed, for delivery at Oscar Station, Ont.

PAGE,\n\nRelative to future purchases of school desks for Indian schools, I have to say that during the past summer when prices have been asked for from the different dealers they all quoted practically the same. As the desks of the various manufacturers appear to be equal in all respects, I would beg to suggest that, instead of sending out tender forms and asking for quotations when desks are required, that the business be as fairly divided as possible among the different manufacturers and dealers.\n\nWe recently asked for quotations on a large order to be delivered at Kenora for the use of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. Some five firms were asked to quote, and their prices were as follows:\n\nGlobe Furniture Co., Style No. 10 Single Desk, Size 2, $7.50 ea.,\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 3, 7.25 \"\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 4, 7.25 \"\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 5, 7.00 \"\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 6, 7.00 \"\n\nAll fronts and rear seats $6.50 each.\n\nThe Canada Foundries & Forgings Ltd., Brockville, quote exactly the same price, as did also the E. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., Winnipeg, who are the Western Agents for the desks made by the W. F. Vilas Co., Cowansville. McGill Chairs, Limited, Cornwall, who have recently entered the business of manufacturing desks, furnished a slightly higher quotation. Christie School Supply, who handle the desks manufactured by the Canadian Office & School Furniture Company, quoted a few cents less per desk, front and rear seat than the others. This may have been on account of the freight charges, as all quotations were F.O.B. point of requirement.\n\nThere is a requisition at the present time for 32 single desks and 5 fronts and 5 rears for delivery at Bothwell, Ont., and I would recommend that, instead of obtaining prices, the order be placed with the Canada Foundries & Forgings Ltd., Brockville, as this firm has quoted on the three last occasions and did not receive an order.\n\nI have been told by Agents of the various firms manufacturing school desks in Ontario and Eastern Canada that their prices on all school desks are now the same.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSINGER EDUCATIONAL PUBLICATIONS\nFOR TEACHERS OF HOME ECONOMICS\n\nTEACHERS' TEXT BOOKS\n\nFORM 1876 \"MACHINE SEWING\"\nFORM 1945 \"HOW TO MAKE DRESSES.\" (PRICE 10\u00a2 TO PUPILS)\nFORM 1917 \"SHORT CUTS TO HOME SEWING\"\nFORM 1976 \"HOW TO MAKE CHILDREN'S CLOTHES.\" (PRICE 10\u00a2 TO PUPILS)\nFORM E.D. 62 EDUCATIONAL FEATURES OF THE SINGER NO. 20\nFORM E.D. 63 DRILLS FOR PRACTICE WORK ON THE SINGER NO. 20\nFORM E.D. 64 GRADED PROJECTS FOR THE SINGER NO. 20\n\nFOR STUDENTS\n\nFORM 1689 \"A MANUAL OF FAMILY SEWING MACHINES\"\nFORM E.D. 61 STITCHING CHARTS FOR PRACTICE WORK\nFORM E.D. 68 TEST CHART\u2014OUTLINE OF NO. 66 MACHINE HEAD\nFORM 1972 SELECTING AND ALTERING PATTERNS\n\nFOR CLASSROOM\u2014WALL CHARTS\n\nNO. 1686 VIBRATING SHUTTLE, LOCK STITCH MACHINE NO. 127\nNO. 1698 HORIZONTAL OSCILLATING HOOK, LOCK STITCH MACHINE NO. 66\nNO. 1797 SINGLE THREAD ELASTIC, CHAIN STITCH MACHINE NO. 24\nNO. 1708 VERTICAL OSCILLATING SHUTTLE, LOCK STITCH MACHINE NO. 15\nNO. 1709 VERTICAL ROTARY HOOK, LOCK STITCH MACHINE NO. 115\n\nWall Charts are of value only when they correspond with the machines you have in use.

When we learned that this school had received that quantity of school desks, we requested the manager of our Regina office, to interview Mr. Graham, and to find out why we have not been given an opportunity to submit a price for this order. We also instructed him to find out whether in his requisition, Mr. Graham has recommended any special make of desk, or whether it is the rule to leave the selection of the make of the desks to your Department.\n\nWe are informed today, by our Regina office, that in reply to our enquiry, Mr. Graham mentioned that as far as he knew, his requisition never specified any par-\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\n\nticular make of school desks, and that the selection is made, and the order given by your Department.\n\nOn request which our manager of our Regina office made, that our name be listed amongst those whom you are from time to time inviting to submit quotations for the requirements of school desks, Mr. Graham replied that this could be done only after permission to do so has been obtained from Ottawa.\n\nWe have been in correspondence with your Department since a number of years; that is to say, we took the liberty of drawing your attention to the fact that we sell school furniture and blackboards, and we requested your Department, to be given an opportunity to submit our quotations for your requirements.\n\nSeveral schools have been built, such as in Brandon, St. Paul des Metas, and others before, and your Department overlooked us consistently and in spite of all promises to the contrary, we have not received any request to submit our prices.\n\nAlthough we are not manufacturers, we are in a position to submit prices which in many cases, will be found lower than those which your Department may have to pay in buying directly from Eastern factories.\n\nThis can be explained through the fact that\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\n\nthere is an understanding amongst Eastern manufacturers as to their sale prices, and furthermore, the freight charges for small quantities shipped by L.C.L. are considerably higher than those for carload shipments. Since we receive our school furniture in complete carload shipments, our cost in Winnipeg is such, that we can underquote Eastern factories for your requirements of smaller quantities than carload lots.\n\nSuch being the case, we must express our surprise, that 40 desks have been ordered by your Department for the Indian Industrial School of Fort Alexander, Man., without our being given an opportunity to submit a price.\n\nAs a matter of fact, and although we are established in Regina since 10 years, we have not received from Mr. Graham, during that time, a single order for school furniture or blackboard, nor have we ever been invited to quote a price.\n\nWe shall appreciate indeed, to receive a reply to the above, and remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY\n\nPER\n\nFG/AZ\nOttawa, March 7th, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the desks recently supplied for the use of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department was informed by the local Indian Agent that the desks in use at this school were those manufactured by the Canadian Office and School Furniture Co. Ltd., Preston, Ont., and, as it is necessary to have uniformity in seating equipment, the recent order for supplying the forty desks required was placed with the above firm. As the prices furnished this Department by manufacturers of school desks are similar, all recent orders have been distributed as evenly as possible among the various manufacturers.\n\nWhen the new school building at Brandon is being furnished, which, it is expected, will be in the very near future, your firm will not be overlooked. The contract for the new school at St. Paul's Cree Metis has not yet been awarded, and it will therefore be considerable time before furnishings will be required for that school. The Department notes that your firm is in a position to fill orders for school furniture at lower rates on smaller quantities than carload lots for Western requirements than Eastern manufacturers, and your firm will be given an opportunity to quote on future requirements for school desks in the Prairie Provinces.\n\nWe note you are the Western Agents for the Canada Foundries & Forgings Limited, Brockville, Ont., which firm, I may say, has received a fair proportion of the orders for school desks during the past year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWestern Seating Company,\n179 Bannatyne Ave. E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY\n\nWestern Agents\nCANADA FOUNDRIES & FORGINGS LTD.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., file No.1-1-12, contents of which we have carefully noted.\n\nIn reply, beg to say that as far as Fort Alexander Indian Residential School is concerned, and the order which has been placed recently for 40 desks, for same, this quantity was evidently used to furnish completely a classroom. Consequently, we cannot quite follow your argument that it was necessary to have uniformity in seating equipment. Of course, if this quantity of 40 desks had been ordered to complete the seating accommodation in a number of different classrooms, in which were already school desks of that particular make, we could understand that you were more or less compelled to place an order for the same make, so as to have the uniformity of which you are speaking. However, in accordance with our own information, this quantity of desks was used entirely for one classroom, and it seems to us that our, or any other make, would have been suitable. All we are complaining of is that we have not been given an\nopportunity to submit our prices.\n\nWe repeat that we receive our desks in complete carloads, and your Department could have saved the difference in freight rate, which amounts to about 40 to 50 cents a desk. Although we are the Western distributors of the Canada Foundries & Forgings, Ltd., of Brockville, Ont., you can buy from us this make of desks at a cheaper price for Western requirements than you can get them from the factory. This fact may be explained by the difference in freight rate as mentioned further above.\n\nWe regret, indeed, that there is not one word mentioned in your letter in regard to Mr. Graham, Indian Agent at Regina. We complained of the fact that this gentleman has not given us a single opportunity to submit our prices during the last ten years. Whenever our representative calls, he gets the same answer; that nothing is required.\n\nWe notice, furthermore, that you overlooked to answer in regard to blackboard. We sell ordinary pulp blackboard, as well as imitation and real slate, and we know that your Department requires frequently this class of goods.\n\nWe thank you for the assurance that our prices will be obtained for the new schools at Brandon and at St. Paul des M\u00e9tis. We beg to remind you that there is also a new school at Punnichy.\n\nWe remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY.\n\nPER\nOttawa, March 18, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to classroom desks for Indian schools, and I wish to write again that you will be given an opportunity to quote on future requirements of this Department in the prairie provinces. It is true that we require blackboards from time to time, but these are either installed by contractors who are erecting our buildings or are ordered by the King's Printer. The amount of blackboard ordered direct by this Department is inconsiderable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Up until lately it has been necessary for the medical profession for a great extent to send out of the Dominion for these uniforms and so we feel sure that you will appreciate the fact that we are trying to do everything we can to keep the business within the limits of the Dominion.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, we beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nINTER-PROVINCIAL DISTRIBUTORS LTD.,\nL. Isaacs.\n\nLI:LF.\nOttawa, February 5, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, requesting to be supplied with a list of Indian schools in Canada, and enclosing your illustrated catalogue of professional attire.\n\nIn reply I have to say that a list of the Indian residential schools in Canada, with post office addresses, is enclosed herewith. There are medical officers who visit the schools and a member of the staff carries out nursing duties. The Department does not furnish them with uniforms. I may add that at the Indian day schools all cases of serious illness are sent to hospital or treated at their homes. There would be no advantage to you in having a mailing list of the day schools.\n\nThe stamped envelope which you enclosed is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Scott, Deputy Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou may possibly recall a short interview you accorded the writer when you were in Winnipeg last November, which resulted in a further interview with our manager at Regina, together with District Commissioner Graham, relative to the furnishing of bedding, etc., for the Indian Schools.\n\nAs a result of these interviews our Regina manager submitted specifications to you, covering beds, mattresses, pillows, bedsprings, etc., which were drawn up with a view to making doubtful points clear, and to avoid reference to the products of any one manufacturing company. The writer was informed at that time that this action met with your entire approval and that you were satisfied with the specifications as redrawn.\n\nOn reviewing our files we noted no inquiries for beds or bedding have been received from you since that date, but, at first, concluded this was due to the usual seasonal inactivities. We were the other day, however, informed by a department manager of one of our large department stores that recent tenders received by them for bedding to be supplied to your Department were definitely refused products manufactured by the Simmons Company, and the tenders worded in such a manner that the firm tendering would conclude there was no advantage to be gained by quoting merchandise manufactured by any other concern.\n\nWe can scarcely credit the accuracy of this statement, knowing the fairness of the Dominion Government officials in general and, furthermore, since having had the privilege of meeting you, do not believe you would personally countenance such unfair action.\n\nMay we be favored with an early reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPARKHILL BEDDING LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nFeb. 23, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, with reference to the furnishing of beds, etc., for the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when tenders are being invited for this equipment you will be given an opportunity of submitting a tender.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAs P.

BUSKARD,\n\nLast spring, the Department, wishing to supply blankets to the Mussewquan Indian Residential School, held a competition, pursuant to your memorandum of April 2nd. The grey blankets were awarded to Ayres Limited, of Lacimie Mills, Que., and the white blankets, to Bates & Innes, Limited, of Carleton Place, Ont. Considerable care was taken to make sure that the purchase was made to the best advantage, an expert having been called in for the purposes of comparison.\n\nThe Department now wishes to supply blankets for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, near St. Paul, Alberta, and there may be additional small orders to be placed from time to time during the next few months. Would it be satisfactory to use the results of the competition referred to and award this business as before? This would be both economical and satisfactory. Of course, I do not refer to the large order of \"Contract Blankets\".\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, September 19, 1931.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nWith reference to the supply of blankets for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that this order will not be sufficiently large to warrant the Department in calling for tenders. It may be placed with:\n\nAyers Limited, Lachute Mills, Que.\nBates & Innes, Limited, Carleton Place, Ont.\n\nAny additional orders necessary during the next few months may also be given to the same firms, provided, of course, that they are not extensive enough to justify the Department in calling for new prices.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nJanuary 30, 1932.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen purchasing window blinds in any quantity, it would be well to specify \"Royal Canadian, Shade 813\", as manufactured by Fred G.

If the record is incomplete it shows, unless the watchman can give a satisfactory explanation, that he failed in his duty. Its evidence is permanent and conclusive, and is available not only to the employer but also to the watchman, in case his faithfulness is questioned.\n\nWatchmen are charged with great responsibility. They should be picked men of good character, intelligent, courageous and physically active. Watchmen who have not these characteristics cannot be made competent by providing them with any kind of a clock. But a competent watchman provided with a dependable watchman's clock gives real protection.\n\nThe Employers Must Provide the Competent Watchmen: We Provide the Dependable Clocks\nThe Highest Standard for Reliability Has Been Established For D-P PORTABLE WATCHMEN'S CLOCKS\n\nPortable Clocks are made in accordance with the following specifications. In them the fundamental principles which have stood the test of experience for many years are combined with improvements found in no other clock.\n\n**Movement**\n\nSpecially designed to meet the conditions of use by watchmen, with eleven jewels, heavy tool steel pinions, cut gears and flat non-magnetic hair spring.\n\nAn accurate time keeper, capable of running seventy-two hours without rewinding.\n\nAttached to the case in such manner as to minimize the effect of shocks.\n\nCan be readily removed and replaced by another movement if mechanical attention becomes necessary, thereby reducing to a minimum the time when the clock is out of service.\n\n**Recording Mechanism**\n\nLocated entirely within the case, and tamper-proof.\n\nProvided with a key-house which turns with each key in making a record, thereby eliminating wear on the key shank and securing perfect alignment.\n\nImpresses a clear, legible record on the paper dial.\n\nThe keys are made of rust-proof material and are designed according to an intricate system of combinations which prevents duplications or collusion among watchmen.\n\nAll parts are standardized so that any necessary replacements can be furnished on receipt of the number of the clock.\n\n**Station Box**\n\nOf unique and ornamental design. Made of pressed steel, galvanized and heavily enamelled in black.\n\nSteel key chain, rust-proof and so tempered that the links break if opened. Secured to the station box by a sealed attachment. Tensile strength, one hundred and sixty-five pounds.\n\n**Record Dial**\n\nMade of special rag paper, with lithographed design adapted specially for D-P clocks.\n\n**Underwriters Approval**\n\nD-P Portable Watchmen's Clocks have been given the formal approval of the authorized representatives of the Underwriters, both stock companies and mutuals. The purchase of our clocks are therefore assured of obtaining the reduction in insurance rates which are granted for approved watchmen's clock service.\n\nWe are prepared to furnish expert advice in connection with all problems relating to watchmen's service.\n\nA Three-Year Guarantee Accompanies Each of our Clocks\n\nStandard Clock Sizes\n\n6 - 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 Stations\nMarch 28th, 1932.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOffice of the Architect,\nMr. R.

Payment is made by the church authorities, from the per capita allowance provided by this Department or from church funds. The purchase is looked after entirely by the school authorities and no part of the cost is paid by accounts rendered the Department.\n\nWith reference to fuel for day schools, in the prairie provinces and in British Columbia wood is the chief fuel used.

Snarr has asked us to prepare for you copy of instructions for charging fire extinguishers.\n\nYou will find these attached and trust that they will fulfill your purposes satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nGCB/DP\nEnclosures\nMAINTENANCE & INSPECTION\n\nThe extinguisher must be kept full at all times and be refilled immediately after use in order to maintain the life of this unit. The Underwriters' Laboratories recommend that all extinguishers should be examined and tested at least once a year.\n\nIt is a mistaken idea that Pyrene Fire Extinguishers may be left hanging upon a wall or in an automobile, truck, bus or boat for an indefinite period without an occasional inspection, as it is a piece of mechanism to be used in an emergency and it should be tested periodically to prove its worthiness for the same reason that all other mechanisms are so tested despite their excellence of design. We know of no piece of apparatus, especially one immersed in a chemical, however properly designed, that should not be tested at least once a year, and fire extinguishers as a group may not be considered exempt from this.\n\nTO REMOVE FROM BRACKET FOR TEST: Place thumb of right hand at left point of the handle as the extinguisher faces you and with the index finger on the inside right hand of the handle turn the handle with a slight forward movement. This motion not only disengages the extinguisher with perfect ease from the bracket but also unlocks the handle and gives you the extinguisher ready for operation.\n\nIt is not necessary when testing these extinguishers that the liquid be ejected or wasted. Test of the pump may be conveniently made by placing index finger of the left hand over the nozzle, withdraw piston about one-third of its length, then remove finger and continue to withdraw piston to about one-half point to see if back action sufficiently expels liquid. We do not recommend or suggest any method of lubrication of the piston because if the extinguisher is entirely filled, the liquid provides its own lubrication. The test may be continued by reaching the index finger over nozzle, forcing piston down again to within one third of the seat, remove finger to see stream and seat handle, locking same as directed on label. Shake extinguisher after testing to remove small amount of liquid left in discharge tube. If tested as above, the amount of liquid lost should not be more than half an ounce.\n\nWARNING: When wholly or partially discharged, refill immediately with Pyrene Fire Extinguishing Liquid only, which can be obtained from your auto accessory or hardware dealer. Do not use water or other substitutes as liquid other than Pyrene Fire Extinguishing Liquid will injure the mechanism by corroding, freezing, etc., and render use on electrical devices dangerous.\n\nThe above warning appears on all the labels of Pyrene Extinguishers and disregard of this will certainly mean damage to the extinguisher and render same ineffective in an emergency. In the manufacture of these extinguishers we take great pains to keep moisture away from the mechanism and liquid and it must be stated here that a few drops of water will produce an acid chemical reaction, causing deterioration in a short time.\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\nThis extinguisher should be recharged annually or whenever used. If the machine has not been used, remove acid bottle, handling carefully, and destroy. Balance of contents should also be poured out, then machine thoroughly washed, hose examined and sprinkler examined to see that they are perfectly clear of any blockage.\n\nFollowing are instructions for recharging:\n\nFIRST:\nCarefully remove the cover from the can. Empty the dry karbaloy into an empty clean bucket of over Two Gallons Capacity.\n\nLift out tube that is packed in the dry karbaloy, and place temporarily to one side.\n\nSECOND:\nThe can from which you emptied the DRY Karbaloy has been made to exact size for use in measuring the water required to make the proper solution\u2014\n\nFill this can level FULL of water, pour this water into bucket containing dry karbaloy. Stir with a stick until thoroughly dissolved. NOTE: when the DRY Karbaloy is mixed with water it GENERATES HEAT.\n\nTHIRD:\nWhen solution has cooled\u2014unscrew ring top of extinguisher and lift out acid bottle cage\u2014then pour karbaloy solution into extinguisher up to filling mark on inside.\n\nFOURTH:\nThe tube you removed from Dry Karbaloy Can contains the ACID BOTTLE. Now carefully remove cap from this tube, lift out the acid bottle and remove paper wrapping. The PAPER in which bottle is packed should be THROWN AWAY.\n\nFIFTH:\nHold acid bottle cage in left hand and slide acid bottle into the cage with the RED END of bottle up.\n\nSIXTH:\nPlace cage in extinguisher and screw the ring top on tight\u2014record date on tag attached to extinguisher.\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURE NO COMPANY\nOF CANADA LIMITED\nFIVE GALLON PUMP TANKS\n\nCharge in this machine is permanent except for possibility of slight evaporation should machine be exposed to an exceedingly warm temperature. If this happens simply replace evaporation with water.\n\nContents should be stirred every few months to make sure that there is no sediment in the bottom.\n\nFor recharging purposes use the required amount of water, four imperial gallons, to this add Accurate Non-freeze charge, stirring same in slowly, and make sure that it is thoroughly dissolved.\n\nPIRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada Limited\nThe Mis-Can-Ada Manufacturing Co., Limited\n\nCONSTRUCTION, MECHANICAL, AND ENGINEERING WORK OF ALL KINDS\n\n41-43 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE\n\nGeneral Construction Work\nStructural Steel Fabrication\nHeating Installation\nAsbestos Roofing Supplies, Etc.\n\nAll Agreements, Contingent upon, Failure, Strikes, Accidents, Changes in Customs Tariff or other causes beyond our control.\n\nFebruary 10th, 1933\n\nMr. J.D.

The wringer does away with the necessity of an expensive extractor.\n\nIf the drain, water supply and wiring are reasonably handy it is very simple to install, usually taking only a day with a couple of men. One of these Machines has recently been installed in the Parliamentary Restaurant here, and also in other Institutions and has effected a tremendous saving and will undoubtedly do the same in similar Institutions and Schools.\n\nThe fact that we recently shipped a Machine to an Indian School near Hudson Bay that had to be transported by truck, team and scow, is testimony as to the ruggedness of the Machine.\n\nIf you will take time to look into the question, we feel satisfied that it will meet every requirement.\n\nWe will be glad to furnish any further information you may require.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE MIS-CAN-ADA MANUFACTURING CO.

These were for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to my letter of September 11th, 1934, and Department Letter No. 126-1-5 dated September 21st, 1934. Seven firms were asked to quote and Gillis & Warren were fourth highest, therefore their quotation was not accepted.\n\nI trust the above information will meet the requirements of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter No. 1-1-12, dated the 29th ultimo, and note that the Honourable the Minister has requested information concerning the purchase of storage batteries in Saskatchewan.\n\nSince being placed in charge of this Province I have only upon two occasions been requested to purchase storage batteries, both occasions being during the past summer. Pursuant to instructions contained in department letters Nos. 121-5-5 and 121-1-5, dated July 4th, I invited quotations from the following firms for batteries for the Muscowequan and Gordon's Residential Schools:\n\nLorne Electric Company, Regina\nMagneto Service Station, Regina\nHall & Cameron Electric Co., Winnipeg\nGillis & Warren, Winnipeg\nNorthern Engineering & Development Co. Ltd., Winnipeg\nD. Ackland & Son, Winnipeg\nMumford-Medland Co., Winnipeg\n\nLater, under cover of department letter No. 121-5-5, dated July 26th, I was instructed to obtain a quotation from the electric equipment company Limited, Saskatoon, in connection with the battery for the Muscowequan School. I am enclosing herewith the quotations received concerning both schools.\n\nIn each instance Messrs. Gillis and Warren, Winnipeg, were invited to quote and you will note from their letters attached that they referred my invitation to quote to Messrs. Bowman Bros. Limited, Regina, who are the Willard battery distributors for the Province of Saskatchewan. In view of Messrs. Bowman Brothers' name not appearing on the preferred list in this office, I did not feel that I was at liberty to enter into negotiations with them with regard to these plants. You will note from the discrepancy in prices, that Bowman Bros. have quoted on a lighter battery than the other companies. Had I been in a position to consider their quotations I would have directed this to their attention. From information I have obtained from men who should know, the load carried by the batteries at both the Gordon's and Muscowequan schools requires a heavy duty battery. Had Messrs. Gillis and Warren intimated that Bowman Brothers acting as their distributors and the business was going through them, I would have submitted this matter to the department for decision.\n\nWhen inviting\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhen inviting quotations on the batteries I at the same time requested that the firms give me an estimate on the cost of overhauling the 6 K.W. and 3 K.W. Lister Automatic engines. Messrs. Mumford, Medland Limited are distributors for this particular unit and was advised by the Electric Equipment Limited that it would be more satisfactory to have the distributors of the plant overhaul the engines. Apart from Messrs. Mumford, Medland Limited submitting the most satisfactory offer they also stated that it was difficult to ascertain the cost of overhauling the engine but would do the work at cost plus 15%. I therefore instructed them to supply the batteries and overhaul the engines and trust that my action has been in accordance with the wishes of the Department. I would be glad if you would return these quotations for my files when you have examined them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSeptember 10, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

I understand this refers more especially to the purchase of desks and classroom equipment.\n\nThe greater number of our schools are well equipped with desks and it is only necessary to purchase any additional desks due to an increase in enrolment. It is not intended to purchase any desks for use in Alberta or Saskatchewan during the balance of the present fiscal year, except it may be in the case of a desk or two which may be required to replace equipment or provide extra seating accommodation. The Department has during the past purchased a considerable number of desks from F. E. Osborne, Calgary, who is agent for the desks made by the Globe Furniture Company, Limited, Waterloo, Ont.\n\nRegarding classroom supplies, such as books, stationery, etc., these are secured on requisition from this Department, through the Government Stationery Office. The greater portion of the articles ordered is kept in stock by the Stationery Office. However, should we require some special articles which are not stocked, it is usual to give the name of a supply house from which they can be obtained. These never amount to any large order, and all the school supply houses on the approved list receive a fair share of the orders.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nFOR BEDS.\n\nSTAFF BED - 3'3\" wide, 2\" round continuous posts.

In connection with the latter, we would draw your attention in particular to the chairs illustrated in the following pages of this letter.\n\nYour inquiries will receive prompt attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMETAL FABRICATORS LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGen. Manager & Secty Treas.\nAt Long Last \u2014 THE ANSWER!\nTo A Thousand Seating Problems\n\nSTAN-STEEL NESTING CHAIRS\n\nNo matter who you are or where your interests may lie, may we suggest that you read very carefully the information in this folder\u2014it cannot help but interest you.\n\nThe Story . . . . . . .\n\nFor years there has been a steadily increasing demand for a chair which, while being decently comfortable and reasonably good looking, could be put away in a small space in a short time with a minimum amount of labour\u2014Stan-Steel Nesting Chairs more than answer that demand. Light in weight (under 10 lbs.) they can be nested in stacks of up to 15 chairs, which stacks are wheeled on an inexpensive dolly\u2014the time required to clear a large floor is thus amazingly short\u2014much shorter than by any other method now known. Mere words cannot describe this great new idea\u2014please write and let us arrange a demonstration. These chairs are companions to the famous Stan-Steel line of furniture and hospital equipment and are thus backed by a great reputation.\n\nMETAL FABRICATORS LIMITED\nWOODSTOCK, ONTARIO\n\nFeatures . . . . . . .\n\nStan-Steel Nesting Chairs are made from top quality electric-welded steel tubing, welded into a single unit which makes them practically indestructible\u2014seats and backs are shellacked five-ply veneer, form fitted to ensure lasting comfort, and attached to the frame with bright plated countersunk screws. This construction makes for an eye-pleasing, easy-to-stil-in chair of great durability. Dimensions are 16\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" overall width by 32\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" height. They will be finished in any colour you desire with highest class materials. Dollies for handling stacks are of sturdy, all-metal construction and cost very little. Write for price on chairs and dollies. We can quote more intelligently from your enquiry.\n\nMETAL FABRICATORS LIMITED\nWOODSTOCK, ONTARIO\n\nAlso in Gangs . . . . . . .\n\nWhere the individuality of a single chair is not important, we can supply these chairs in gangs of 2, 3, 4 or 5. This arrangement makes for added speed and convenience in handling. Prices on gangs will be supplied promptly on application.\nPresenting!\n\nSTAN-STEEL LADDERS\n\nMetal Fabricators Limited takes great pride in presenting this line of tubular steel ladders. These ladders are the answer to a problem which has long been a thorn in the side of the safety-minded. They are in so many ways more satisfactory than the outmoded wooden type of ladder that we look forward to their enthusiastic reception by thinking buyers and we particularly bring them to the attention of employers, heads of institutions and all those who are entrusted with the safety of others. May we point out that your inquiry regarding these ladders will place all our facilities at your disposal.\n\nThe material used in Stan-Steel ladders is an especially formed tubing made from extra hard 50 gauge steel. Front risers are 9/16\" tube; back risers are 13/16\" tube; rungs are made from 18 gauge 1/2\" tube. All step treads will be natural fir varnished or shellacked.\n\nTube ends will be capped or fitted with a wooden plug to allow fitting of the Stan-Steel Safety Foot\u2014we might add that this wooden plug itself constitutes an excellent anti-slip device.\n\nSTAN-STEEL FACTORY TRUCKS\n\nWe are also manufacturing a complete line of tubular steel factory trucks\u2014which we consider fills a long-felt need in industry. There will be several standard types such as utility hand trucks, barrel and bale trucks, balance and push type flat trucks, scrap trucks, box trucks, tote pan trucks and other special purpose jobs as well as dead and semi-live skids and pallets. These standard types will be augmented from time to time by other types for which there is a demand. We are also ready to quote on any special idea in materials handling equipment which may be brought forward.\n\nMETAL FABRICATORS is a specialty organization, ready and willing to do a myriad of interesting jobs in metal.

Our most successful and satisfied customers are those who employ a special treatment with approved dishwashing compounds similar to HTH-15 which contains a Chlorine base and is very instrumental in removing a bad stained condition when experienced and under normal operating conditions has little or no ill effect upon Plastic ware.\n\n(2) As a manufacturer, we are constantly endeavouring to secure very definite experienced figures on breakage as compared with China ware, and although this varies considerably with almost each individual user, we are of the general belief that our Tableware sustains between 90% and 95% less breakage in standard service.\n\n(3) Four standard colors are generally available from stock or on very short delivery and these are in attractive shades of Coral, Yellow, Green or Ivory.\n\nWe trust you will be more than interested in exploring the practical and economical use of \"MAPLEX\" Tableware throughout your various departments, and trust we may have the pleasure of hearing further from you regarding your requirements in this field.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMAPLE LEAF PLASTICS LIMITED,\n\n(Signed) F.

St. Vincent de Paul, Quebec, exclusive of sales tax and crating, which applied to your previous order.\n\nIf this quotation is acceptable, early receipt of covering purchase order will be appreciated. In the meantime materials are being ordered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nC. SAVANT, Inspector\nActing Superintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\n615 Jackson Building,\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 24, 1947.\n\nDr. W. L. Falconer,\nAssistant Director,\nIndian Health Services,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Falconer:\n\nAt last it has been possible to check up in regard to the Starmatic Dairy equipment. Our Mr. Edmonds has done considerable work over a period of years in regard to milk supplies, pasteurization etc., and his comments are attached hereto.\n\nCHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH ENGINEERING DIVISION\nWith reference to the attached illustrated folder on pasteurization equipment known as the \"Starmatic Dairy\" the following comments are offered:\n\nThe \"Starmatic Dairy\" does apparently embody the essential features of a complete dairy, even to the extent of including homogenization, cooling and wash vats for sterilization of dairy utensils. Heat for pasteurization is supplied in the standard machines by immersion electric type heater or if desired by steam coils where such construction is preferable where steam would be the appropriate form of heating. In each case the temperature is thermostatically controlled.\n\nUntil an opportunity is afforded of examining a complete dairy unit of Starmatic type it is not possible to arrive at any definite conclusion as to its desirability or its usefulness, for isolated establishments, where pasteurized milk or pasteurized dairy products are not readily available. From the description as outlined in their folder it would appear to be serviceable in many instances.\n\nThere may however, be certain features of this compact dairy unit that should receive some consideration before determining its usefulness such as:\n\n(a) It is highly developed mechanical unit which may at times require servicing and replacement of parts.\n(b) Being an American product of a type which has some limitation in its demand, replacement parts may not be readily available.\n(c) If such equipment is to be used in isolated areas servicing as required may not be readily obtainable.\n(d) Where temperatures are thermostatically controlled too much reliance should not be placed upon the accuracy of thermostats to give true temperatures at all times, which is most essential and within a definite range limit 143\u00b0-145\u00b0F for pasteurization process.\nWith reference to prices quoted or listed on the back of the folder it would appear that a high price is being asked for relatively low capacity units, or essentially one is paying a high premium for a highly specialized mechanical unit of a compact type.\n\nIt is possible for one to secure a small 50 gallon pasteurizer equipped with stirring device, valves, indicator thermometer, milk pump and a small surface cooler through which brine could be pumped for cooling purposes at much lower cost and such equipment would serve essentially the same purpose other than homogenization which in itself may not be of prime importance. While no definite figures are at the moment available, the items mentioned above would be secured for less than $1000.00. This of course would be exclusive of steam heating equipment which would most likely be available. More exact figures could be obtained if so desired.\n\nW.R. Edmonds,\nSr. Sanitary Engineer.\nHerewith is an illustrated folder on pasteurization equipment which it is thought might be useful in some of the residential schools of the Indian Affairs branch. Many of the residential schools at present have no facilities for pasteurization.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give us your opinion on this equipment both as to its usefulness and price.\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Director, Indian Health Services.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\n28 January, 1947.\n\nColonel E.E. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Pasteurizing Equipment for Indian Schools\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAt your suggestion Mr. Blackburn came to see Miss Lock regarding the equipment illustrated in the attached folder. This type of question regarding the usefulness of that particular equipment should be referred to the Sanitary Engineers and the Public Health Officers of the Indian Health Services rather than to the Nutrition Division. Since it is not clear whether this has already been done, I am returning it to you in the belief that you can get it re-routed into the proper channel.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n\nLBP/AJS\n\nChief Public Health 6/21 Jackson\nWHAT MAKES THE STAROMATIC DAIRY WORK?\n\nThe STAROMATIC DAIRY produces Fresh, Pure, Flavory Milk, Cream, Ice Cream Mix... FOR LESS MONEY.\n\n\"Skimmed Milk Powder + Water + Butterfat = MILK\" ... the STAROMATIC DAIRY way.\n\nThe STAROMATIC DAIRY is an all automatic machine requiring no attention whatsoever except to put the ingredients in the mixing and pasteurizing tank and clean up at the end of the day, an exceedingly simple process requiring only a few minutes. The Dairy starts itself and stops itself when the run is finished, producing milk, cream, and ice cream mix untouched by human hands. Completely enclosed, contamination is avoided. Sterile in operation, it satisfies the most rigid health requirements.\n\nNOT TOUCHED BY HUMAN HANDS... all enclosed, avoiding risk of infection, the STAROMATIC DAIRY reaches a standard of sanitation not possible to attain any other way. Can even work under dusty conditions.\n\nStaromatic Division Star Metal MFG. CO.,\nTrenton Ave. and Ann St. Phila. 34, Pa., U.S.A.\nELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT\n\nThe STAROMATIC DAIRY is built with standard electrical equipment. We can supply DC or AC equipment with appropriate cables and phase. The STAROMATIC DAIRY consumes 4 kw per hour in the twenty gallon size and proportionately more and less in the larger and smaller sizes (See table inside.) The heater will automatically shut off when pasteurization temperature is reached and automatically turn on when temperature starts to fall. This heater will start again automatically. The standard STAROMATIC DAIRY is built with three motors: the agitator motor, homogenizer drive and compressor motor (Sizes and types furnished to fit application.)\n\nThe STAROMATIC DAIRY is built in:\n\n5 10 20 40 100 gallons per hour sizes\n\nAll automatic\u2014all same basic design and principles\n\nDETERGENT AND BACTERICIDE\n\nOur research department has originated a combination detergent and bactericide which is non-toxic, non-injurious to the skin and non-corrosive. It has three times the bactericidal action of pure carbolic acid. The detergent qualities remove the films left by the milk or cream dissolving instantly on contact. The bactericide renders the parts absolutely sterile. This permits the use of clean parts of the equipment, but not removable parts (homogenizer, defoamer etc.) into the mixing tank cover with warm water, add two handfuls of compound, allow parts to remain in solution about five minutes. Drain off solution and rinse. The same method can be used to sterilize the cooler tank. Rinse with cold water from a pail and warm water from a kettle at intervals around ten and about five minutes. Observe all caution and care.\n\nREFRIGERATION\n\nRefrigeration is provided by air-cooled compressors in the 5-10-20 gallon sizes and by either air or water-cooled compressors as needed and catered to the larger sizes. The standard Dairy is self-contained requiring only connection to an electrical outlet and drain pipe. However we can furnish STAROMATIC DAIRIES to be attached to existing refrigeration lines providing there is sufficient refrigerating capacity.\n\nSalt Butter may be readily employed by utilizing a simple process which will remove practically all the salt. This requires no extra equipment. We will gladly furnish complete information.\n\nSTAROMATIC ECONOMICS\n\n(Amortization is figured on a five year basis; however, the life of a STAROMATIC DAIRY is far beyond that)\n\nSince the greatest part of the cost of milk delivered to the user is made up of transportation and labor costs, you can cut your dairy bill in half by using the STAROMATIC DAIRY.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nTo produce ten gallons of high grade homogenized milk with 3\u00bd% butterfat you will use:\n\n| Normal | Spring 1945 |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Cost   | Cost        |\n| 74 lbs. 11 oz. of water | nil | nil |\n| 7 lbs. 14\u00bd oz. of milk powder | .60 | 1.26 |\n| 3 lbs. 9\u00bd oz. of butter | .86 | 1.60 |\n| Current consumption 2 kw. @ 2\u00a2 | .04 | .04 |\n| Labor 10 min. total (inc. cleaning) | .15 | .15 |\n| Interest | .00375 | .00375 |\n| Amortization (five years) | .015 | .015 |\n| Repairs & Replacements | .001 | .001 |\n\nTotal | $1.67 | $3.07 |\nCost per gallon | $0.167 | $0.307 |\n\nThe same general proportions hold good when cream is produced; for example, to produce ten gallons of 20% cream you will use: Butter, $.48; Skim milk powder, .49\u00a2; incidentals, 25\u00a2, or a total of $.557 in normal times or $.557 per gallon. Let us now look at war time prices: Butter, $.95; Skim milk powder, $.113; incidentals, 25\u00a2, or a total of $.1043 or $.104 per gallon for 20% cream.\n\nN.B. It should be noted that in continuous operation the labor cost per gallon drops substantially since only one cleaning job is required, in which event the sole labor involved is filling the mixing and pasteurizing tank.\n\nBecause the STAROMATIC DAIRY homogenizes the entire mixture (except the flavor) it will produce the smoothest ice cream in the world. All costs included, a 12\u00bd% butterfat ice cream can be produced with the STAROMATIC DAIRY for 8\u00bd\u00a2 per gallon at present prices (Spring of 1945) for materials and in normal times for proportionately less.\n\nThe STAROMATIC DAIRY produces a milk to order of any desired degree of richness. It may be used as a carrier for vitamins or needed minerals. STAROMATIC DAIRY can even produce the equivalent of mothers' milk, simplifying the dietician's problem. Nutrition experts readily concede the food value of reconstituted milk since the caloric value is equal to the natural product of each gram. The vitamin loss in reconstitution is negligible, viz: 13% of the thiamin chloride and no loss of riboflavin. The complex cholesterol derivation commonly known as Vitamin \"A\" is contributed by the butter. For practical purposes, ascorbic acid is absent in both the natural and the reconstituted product.\nUNE VACHE AUTOMATIQUE\n\nLA VACHE AUTOMATIQUE EST\nune LAITERIE COMPL\u00c8TE en un SEUL APPAREIL comprenant:\n\u2014 un syst\u00e8me de chauffage\n\u2014 un pasteurisateur avec agitateur\n\u2014 un homog\u00e9n\u00e9isateur \u00e0 tr\u00e8s grande vitesse\n\u2014 un d\u00e9mousseur - refroidisseur\n\nLA VACHE AUTOMATIQUE EST\n\u00c9conomique\u2014Pratique\u2014D'un encombrement minimum\u2014Facile \u00e0 nettoyer\u2014Ne n\u00e9cessitant aucun technicien\u2014Branch\u00e9e sur le courant \u00e9lectrique, elle fonctionne presque sans surveillance; l'op\u00e9rateur n'ayant qu'\u00e0 peser et mesurer exactement les quantit\u00e9s d\u00e9termin\u00e9es de lait en poudre, de cr\u00e8me ou d'autres ingr\u00e9dients, et d'eau pour obtenir le lait, la cr\u00e8me, ou le m\u00e9lange pour cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e d\u00e9sir\u00e9s.\n\nQUAND vous aurez VU FONCTIONNER une VACHE AUTOMATIQUE . . .

June 24th, 1907\n\n585508\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThere is considerable dentistry work to be done at the Fila Hills Boarding School, also at Round Lake, Crooked Lake Boarding Schools, Muscowequane, and Borden's Boarding School, and perhaps at some of the other Day Schools.\n\nThe nurses report also from time to time that the teeth of the school children are in need of attention.\n\nI have been looking around to locate a man whom I can send to do this work, and am pleased to say that I happened upon a young man, Verne Lane, who has just graduated from McGill University, and who is willing to take on the work for two months at $150.00 a month.

No letter of transmittal need accompany this requisition. If more space is required for describing the work, for stating the special qualifications, or for any other purpose, use additional sheets attached thereto.\n\n2.

File this requisition with the Civil Service Commission for each vacancy in a temporary position. For permanent or seasonal places use the requisition forms provided.\n\n4.

Sm.-9-22.\nJune 29, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that the Indian Commissioner has recommended that a dentist be employed to examine and fix the teeth of the children of the Round Lake, Cowesses, Muscogeeans, File Hills and Gordon's Boarding schools, in the Province of Saskatchewan, and possibly some other schools, as dental work is urgently needed in many cases. He states that the services of Mr. Verna Lane, a graduate of McGill University would be available and that he would be willing to do the work for $150 per month.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a temporary requisition and would ask that you have a certificate issued for a period of two months, in favour of Dr. Lane, at a salary of $150 per month. I would appreciate your giving the matter immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. M.

I think it would be well to apply for the certificate now, as it would take two months to finish the work.\n\nYou state that I do not mention whether the salary offered to Mr. Lane, namely $150.00 per month, would include the cost of material required for fillings, and in reply, I would say that the salary does not include the cost of material. The estimate is based on about $50.00 or $75.00 buying the material wholesale here; we would be required to pay his living expenses at the various schools, $1.50 a day. The travelling would not be great as most of the places could be reached in about half a day; probably $60.00 would cover this. I might say that if we get the work done for the above estimate, it will be very cheap.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would be glad to have your approval. In the meantime, I have told Mr. Lane that he would be employed for a month and arrangements are being made to employ him for two months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

He said that after looking around for a man who would be suitable to do this work, he happened on a young dentist, Verne Lane, a recent graduate of McGill University, who stated that he would be willing to do the work for two months at a salary of $150.00 per month. As this appeared an excellent opportunity to have the work done at an exceedingly moderate remuneration, we decided to go on with it, but, as it was necessary to obtain a certificate for his employment from the Civil Service Commission, and it would be absurd to advertise, we requested them to appoint him without reference to the Civil Service Act as to competition, and the inclosed memorandum to Council is to provide for this.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nJuly 23, 1923.\nCertified Extract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, held on the 10th August, 1923, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 17th August 1923.\n\n******\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nThe Board had under consideration the following memorandum from the Civil Service Commission, submitted by the Honourable the Minister of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"As provided in Sub-Section 5 of Section 23 of the Civil Service Act of 1913 as amended, the Civil Service Commission, on the recommendation of the Department of Indian Affairs, submits the following report for approval -\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs recommends that the services of Mr. Verne Lane, a graduate of McGill University be secured for two months for dental work in connection with examining and fixing the teeth of children at the Round Lake, Cowesses, Muscowequans, File Hills and Gordon's Boarding Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan, at a salary of $150 per month\".\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for the favourable consideration of council.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nCertified Extract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, held on the 10th August, 1923, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 17th August 1923.\n\n******\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nThe Board had under consideration the following memorandum from the Civil Service Commission, submitted by the Honourable the Minister of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"As provided in Sub-Section 5 of Section 23 of the Civil Service Act of 1913 as amended, the Civil Service Commission, on the recommendation of the Department of Indian Affairs, submits the following report for approval -\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs recommends that the services of Mr. Vernon Lane, a graduate of McGill University be secured for two months for dental work in connection with examining and fixing the teeth of children at the Round Lake, Cowesses, Muscowequans, File Hills and Gordon's Boarding Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan, at a salary of $150 per month\".\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for the favourable consideration of Council.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nAugust 23, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Foran,-\n\nI beg to inclose herewith copy of an Order in Council of August 17, 1923, P.C. 21/1628, which provides for the employment by this Department of Dr. Verne Lane, a dentist, for a period of two months, at $150.00 per month, to examine and fix the teeth of the children in several of the Indian schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nWill you kindly have the necessary certificate issued in favour of Dr. Lane, as requested in my letter of June 29, last?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm.

They look forward to a doctor or someone to look into the matter. May I offer a suggestion? Should not all Indian Day schools be supplied yearly with a small quantity of the most necessary medicine, that a teacher could use in just such cases. An Indian school teacher I feel need protection herself. These skin diseases are most noticeable and are contagious. Avoiding mouth breathing etc. can also be noticeable.\n\nThis is merely a suggestion. It would save doctors' expenses which are often of little value due to the few occasions on which they could call.\n\nI would like to know if the Dept. wishes such to be mentioned in my report to the Dept.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M. Bennett\nOttawa, October 2, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the advisability of supplying a small quantity of medicines to Indian day schools. In reply I have to inform you that the Department is not prepared to place a stock of drugs, etc., in each day school; but, whenever you are satisfied a particular teacher would use such supplies to advantage, you may ask her to requisition to the Indian agent for what would be useful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., M.A.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe question of where the line should be drawn in the removal of tonsils and adenoids is one regarding which you will find there is a very considerable difference of opinion even amongst nose and throat specialists.\n\nRegarding the removal of adenoids, if these are obstructing the breathing, there is no question and no difference of opinion as to the advisability of their removal. Indeed, where adenoids actually exist I think it is conceded that removal is the proper procedure.\n\nThe tonsil question, however, is somewhat different. Large infiltrated tonsils with crypts of pus or other material should certainly be removed; and, as a rule, in the case of most large tonsils, the proper procedure is removal. Of course, also some comparatively small tonsils are very vicious foci of infection; but, as in many other specialties, I think I can in all fairness say that the procedure of tonsil removal has been carried in some instances to a very great extreme. The conservative advice of some one of experience should, I think, be obtained in all cases in which there is not the positive evidence of the necessity of removal actually visible in the condition of the tonsil itself.\n\nShould you wish it, the Department would be pleased to give you any further assistance possible in this matter.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF DEPUTY SUPT. GENERAL\nto Dr. D. A. Clark, Asst. Deputy Minister of Health,\ndated October 20, 1924.\n\nIn view of the many recommendations that we\nare receiving from different sources for the removal\nof tonsils, I feel that I would like to have the\ncounsel of your Department. I know that there is a\ndifference of opinion among medical men in regard to\nthis operation.\n\nWould it be possible in this particular\ninstance to have one of your officers examine these\nchildren and submit a report. . . . .\nOttawa, November 24, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to surgical operations in the case of pupils at Indian residential schools. In reply I have to inform you that the Department considers it advisable to undertake an operation, without securing the consent of the parent, when it has been determined by the medical officer that such operation is really necessary for the health of the pupil. I believe this is the general practice at other Indian residential schools in western Canada. You will understand, however, that the authority of the Department for incurring the expense must first be secured, except in cases of emergency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, November 27, 1924.\n\nDear Dr. Clark:\n\nI wish to secure further advice with reference to operations for enlarged tonsils in the case of pupils of Indian residential schools. Our medical officers receive a stated amount per annum or a fixed fee per visit for their general services at these institutions. In addition, a reasonable fee is allowed for necessary operations. In the past, some of the medical officers removed tonsils or adenoids without added remuneration; but from time to time, this Department has been asked to fix a fee for this work. We have always made the most economical arrangements. In some cases eight or ten pupils have had tonsils or adenoids, or both, removed at one time. What is a reasonable payment per operation in the case of our regular medical officers?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. D. A. Clark,\nAsts. Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Health,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\n\nNovember 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of November 27th, referring to operations on nose and throat conditions in children of your Indian residential schools and further asking the opinion of this Department as to a reasonable medical fee to be paid for removal of tonsils and adenoids.\n\nIf you can refer to a letter to the Acting Deputy Superintendent General of your Department under date of May 16th, 1922, being a report of Dr. Heagerty of this Department in reference to his visit to the Saugeen Indian Reserve, you will see there a schedule of fees which Dr. Heagerty arranged with a Specialist in Owen Sound for this class of work. Dr. Burt agreed to do these operations for $10.00 per case in instances where there were five or more cases to be attended to and that the anaesthetist's fee would be $2.50 per case.

H. Murdoch (Dentist)\nTo The Junior Red Cross Advisory Committee\n\nGentlemen:\n\nINWOOD, September 2 - 12, 1924.\n\nThis was the first Junior Red Cross Dental Clinic put on in Inwood since July of last year.\n\nAs the schools were not all open it was hard to get notices to all the children. The only school open was the Inwood school itself and this forced me to use some other room. We picked on an old store that was empty and had it cleaned. At this time of year a fire was not needed so we had very comfortable quarters to put on the clinic.\n\nThis cleaning out of old rooms and buildings, etc., all takes time but these villages are so small in most cases that the hotels have not enough rooms to allow me to use one for an operating room.\n\nMy visit this time was purely operative. I did not go visiting schools and therefore was able to get much more work done. The rural schools did not send their children in as well as I had hoped. The main reason, I believe, being that they had not received work. Then I find that people take so long to decide to send the children for dental treatment. In the first part of my visit work is comparatively slack, in the latter part, I am always nearly overwhelmed with work.\n\nThe condition of the teeth in the mouths of those children who received treatment last year is indeed very good, and with the exception of one little filling they needed practically nothing. However, there seemed to be so many more who on account of the large numbers at my last clinic were unable to receive attention and who of course were on a waiting list this time. Consequently, I was kept busy not only from nine to six but often till 10 p.m. and Sundays as well. Before closing this report, I wish to mention again that this clinic was possibly mentioned in my last year's report on Inwood. During inspection of the Inwood schools a year ago I found one case, a girl of about fifteen years of age with several teeth needing filling and the usual lack of healthy teeth with only small cavities but large enough to cause the tooth to ache. As I thought the nerve would either be dead or just saving and knowing that I had not the time at my disposal to treat such a tooth I advised extraction. Needless to say the parents would not listen. Now had they been in a position to pay for their work I would at once have advised them to take their child to Winnipeg but they could not afford this. Therefore it is often this way\u2014when Daddy has a sore tooth he has it attended to, but when some of the children have one it does not hurt Daddy except in the pocketbook. This was the situation in this case.\n\nThe result was that nothing was done. The child got through the winter fairly well with just the odd spell of toothache, but this last July it started to ache severely and her face began to swell. The result was that her father drove her twenty miles to the nearest physician and had it lanced externally on her neck. When I saw her the wound had not been healed for six weeks and was discharging pus all the time.\n\nThis is one of the best examples of neglect that I have seen. This girl had to be brought to the General Hospital as a Junior patient and will have a scar she will carry as long as she lives. Just at present I have a letter from her asking how soon she can have some false teeth\u2014at the age of sixteen years!\n\nThis shows how much pain is being saved these children who take advantage of Red Cross service. I often wonder if they realize what the Red Cross is doing for them.\nHARCISSE, September 14 - 20, 1924.\n\nWe arrived in Harcissee Monday night, September 14th, where I found the question of accommodation much more acute than at Inwood. There was only one boarding house\u2014a building about nineteen feet by eighteen feet which they were using as a general store, lodging house and also a residence for a family of six children. Rather congested, you will say, but when in the country and especially in my districts we have to make the best of what we can get.\n\nFor an office I got the use of a cottage. As the furniture has to be moved to another one anyway, I naturally did not expect to have to pay very much for it, especially as I had to help clean the place up for the settlement. But note the case, the owner was a Scotchman and wanted his dollar a day rent just the same. This point had the poorest hotel accommodation so far and I was charged higher rates than in the best hotels that I go to. Now I believe in paying my way but not in being overcharged so needless to say I cut this clinic just as short as I could. I worked almost night and day while I was there, but did not stay any longer than I had to.\n\nThe districts being served from Harcissee are Willowview where the clinic was held last year, Harcissee, and one other school district. Now do doubt those districts would have liked me to stay longer and I would have done so but for the poor accommodation. However, I think we got most of the work well finished except my landlords' children, and as he was the wealthiest man in the district, I thought he could afford to send his children to Winnipeg.\n\nThere was one little girl seven years old from Willowview to whom we did a very good turn three years ago when she had all her baby teeth extracted at the Winnipeg General Hospital. Her permanent teeth were starting to go almost as soon as they were through, but thanks to the Junior Red Cross she had them saved.\n\nOur visit at Harcissee although short was a very busy one and both Mrs. Macleod and myself were working till late every evening. With so many permanent extractions, I think the fee should be raised to 75\u00a2 not only because of the work, but also because of the fact that people will rather have their children's teeth extracted for 25\u00a2 rather than filled at 1.00.\n\nLAD DU BONNET, October 10, 1924.\n\nThis was our first Junior Red Cross dental clinic ever put on at Lad du Bonnet. Accommodation was good so there was no complaint in that direction.\n\nFirst I might say a few words about Lad du Bonnet and the class of settlers around there. Lad du Bonnet is situated on the Winnipeg River and the settlers are scattered mostly up and down the river. Accordingly when they have a winter route roads for wagons are not so much needed. It seemed to me that all who could, used the lake as a means of transportation. They only good road is the one towards Winnipeg. I had intended to inspect a number of the outlying schools but as in most cases you have a mile or two to walk after leaving the boat my time did not permit me to do it. Furthermore during my visit there was a great deal of rain. However, I was able to meet the teachers of the schools and was able to give them some idea of what we are trying to do.\n\nThere are so many nationalities and the settlement is so badly scattered that it is a most difficult matter to get the people to join for the Junior Red Cross. If they are afraid unless we are very careful they will only support it in name for just they think they can get out of it. The majority of the people are slow to take up anything.\nHARCOURT, September 14 - 20, 1924.\n\nWe arrived in Narcisse Monday night, September 14th, where I found the question of accommodation much more acute than at Inwood. There was only one boarding house\u2014a building about fourteen feet by eighteen feet which they were using as a general store, boarding house and also a residence for a family of small children. Rather congested, you will say, but when in the country and especially in my district we have to make the best of what we can get.\n\nFor an office I got the use of a cottage. As the furniture had to be moved to another end anyway, I naturally did not expect to have to pay very much for it, especially as I had to help clean the place up for the renter. But note the case, the owner was a Scotshman and wanted his dollar a day rent just the same. This point had the poorest hotel accommodation so far and I was charged higher rates than in the best hotels that I go to. Now I believe in paying my way but not in being overcharged so needless to say I cut this clinic just as short as I could. I worked almost night and day while I was there, but did not stay any longer than I had to.\n\nThe districts being served from Narcisse are Willowview where the clinic was held last year, Harcourt, and one other school district. No doubt those districts would have liked me to stay longer and I would have done so but for the poor accommodation. However, I think we got most of the work well finished except my landlord's children, and as he was the wealthiest man in the district, I thought he could afford to send his children to Winnipeg.\n\nThere was one little girl seven years old from Willowview to whom we did a very good turn three years ago when she had all her baby teeth extracted at the Winnipeg General Hospital. Her permanent teeth were starting to go almost as soon as they came through, but thanks to the Junior Red Cross she has had them saved.\n\nOur visit at Narcisse although short was a very busy one and both Mrs. Lindroth and myself were working till late every evening. With no new permanent extractions, I think the fee should be raised to 75\u00a2 not only because of the work but also because of the fact that people will rather have their children's teeth extracted for 25\u00a2 rather than filled at $1.00.\n\nLAC DU BONNET, October 27 - October 30, 1924.\n\nThis was our first Junior Red Cross dental clinic ever put on at Lac du Bonnet. Accommodation was good so there was no complaint in that direction.\n\nFirst I might say a few words about Lac du Bonnet and the class of settlers around there. Lac du Bonnet is situated on the Winnipeg River and the settlers are scattered mostly up and down the river. Accordingly when they have a winter route roads for wagons are not so much needed. It seemed to me that all who could, used the lake as a means of transportation. They only good road is the one towards Winnipeg. I had intended to inspect a number of the outlying schools but as in most cases you have a mile or two to walk after leaving the boat my time did not permit me to do it. Furthermore during my visit there was a great deal of rain. However, I was able to meet the teachers of the schools and was able to give them some idea of what we are trying to do.\n\nThere are so many nationalities and the settlement is so badly scattered that it is a most difficult matter to get the people to work for the Junior Red Cross. I am afraid unless we are very careful they will only support the clinics for what they think they can get out of it. The majority of the people are slow to think anything\nnow and few have any education. As a result one is kept busy explaining Red Cross and unless we are very careful they are inclined to think that they can get free medical and dental service when they pay a small fee of twenty-five cents a year membership. I tried my best to get this point thoroughly understood.\n\nAs there had never been a dentist into this district before I was very busy, mainly with extractions, as they had simply let their children's teeth go. Only in one case did I see any previous dental work done.\n\nTwo thirds of the children could not chew their food because of sore teeth. Others had been suffering from toothache for years.\n\nAgain I think some publicity should be given to the names of those getting free work done because we are finding difficulty in collecting even the small Red Cross fee. There are always some families who should pay for this work and although I do not regret attending to their children at our clinics but think they should pay at least a fair fee for the work done.\n\nIf it had not been for Mr. Murdoch going directly to some of the homes and asking for payment of their small fees the people would not have paid. One man had to be asked to pay for his children's work which at regular dental rates would have cost thirty-five dollars. At Red Cross rates it was about five dollars. He owns a store, Lunch, Studebaker, Bus, Grinder car etc. How I do not think this is right. There should be some way of making this class of patient pay. Of course there are not many of them, but the ones there are should pay more than Red Cross rates.\n\nThe majority of people around Lac du Bonnet can pay the Red Cross fee for their children but all want to get treatment without paying. There seems to be only one solution and that is make them pay in advance, because they are not paying even cost of material.\n\nWe gave the Lac du Bonnet people an excellent clinic, working evenings and Sundays for them. Over a hundred children were attended to who surely needed attention and few of the parents could afford city fare or regular food. But there are twice as many children left to be attended to yet. Thanks to Mr. Murdoch we collected 75% of our debts.\n\nHILLIE, October 13 - 21, 1924.\n\nHillie is a little siding about 140 miles north of Winnipeg. As it is nearly two years ago since I put a clinic on for them I thought they were entitled to another one. As accommodation was questionable I let Mr. Murdoch go on to the end of the line about twenty miles further while I got off with my equipment. The hour was about 8 p.m. and everything was under a pitch. After getting my equipment in one end of the box car siding under lock and key I began to look for some place where I could get a little supper as I had had nothing since an early dinner before the train started. But in this respect I was disappointed. As for sleeping accommodation two travellers had the only bed to be found so there was nothing for it but to take a light a fire in the stove which was situated in the box car siding and keep warm until morning. By that time the 6 a.m. train would be through and I could get the travellers bed. Also as soon as the fellows were up my chances would be good for a little breakfast as I was like a wolf in winter. However after being in the army and in a good cool warm places than St. Mary I thought myself lucky.\n\nBy morning I secured the travellers bed until the people got up. Then after a little breakfast I found an old horse and rig for school inspection.\nAround Hilbre are four schools, Longridge, Birch Bay, Wooddalo and Hilbre. There are as many children in the Hilbre school as in all the others put together.\n\nFrom a dental standpoint I have never seen children in a worse condition than were some of the children in these districts. They had hardly ever been without toothache for years.\n\nFor holding the clinic I found an old cottage that was vacant about half a mile away from the siding with a stove in it. We set up our equipment and started in on extractions and relief of toothache. The people treated us very well and were well pleased with the service they were getting. All went well for about four days when I got a tooth of my own aching under a bridge, so there was nothing for it but stand it as long as I could and then cut through the bridge enough to get relief. As there was no train into town for two days there I was. The next train I ran into the city and had it out. On my return I was into work until all hours. The children were from all four schools and all the schools paid their fees except Birch Bay. They seem to have the idea that anything the Red Cross does should be free. This seems to be the attitude in the border stations. However, I think they know differently by now. They have a lot of fairly nice farms and I do not think that they should have everything for nothing.\n\nJust to give you another, one evening about 9 p.m., I had a boy come in who walked twenty miles to have a tooth out (yes this in Manitoba). I found the Junior Red Cross had provided dental treatment for some children from this district two years ago by bringing them to Winnipeg for eye examination as well. If it was not for the Red Cross these children would be suffering as only those know who have had a real aching tooth and live in a place where no relief is obtainable.\n\nI did not get them all finished so I promised them a clinic next summer. Again I thank the Red Cross for this opportunity of service.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Signed) \"R. H. Murdoch\"\nJanuary 12th, 1925.\n\nDr. D. G. Scott,\nGeneral Superintendent,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Junior Red Cross since 1922, has been giving a dental service to the children living in the country between Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg. A fully qualified dentist, Dr. R. H. Murdoch, trained also as a teacher, has since that time inspected the children's teeth in the schools, addressed them on the importance of good teeth and finally treated the defects by means of clinics established at convenient centres. I append one of his reports to show the nature of his work and the value of this dental service.\n\nThe outstanding feature of the service has been the obvious improvement in the state of the children's health as well as in that of their teeth. Schools which in 1922 had over 80% of the children with defective teeth and with general health below par, showed in 1924 this percentage reduced to 20, with a corresponding improvement in the health of the pupils. The Doctor's visits have a further effect of stimulating an interest in the practice of good health habits through the formation of Junior Red Cross Branches wherever possible.\n\nIt has occurred to our Junior Red Cross Committee that our dentist, Dr. R. H. Murdoch, might be able to render service to some of your department's schools in this interlake area. Just as there are dental defects in the provincial schools, so there may be some waiting for correction in your schools. The desire to reach the Indian Schools has often been expressed by Dr. Murdoch on his return from the Fairford and Hodgson districts where your schools are situated.\nD.C.S.-S.\n\nIf you will give your permission, our Committee will be very pleased to send Dr. Murdoch into one of your schools to give a demonstration of our dental service. Our usual method is to charge each child a small fee as you will see from the attached pink sheet. In the case of your school we would suggest that your Department should pay the travelling and material expenses in addition to providing Dr. Murdoch with board, lodging and a room in which to carry on the clinic. One month should be enough to complete the examination and treatment.\n\nDr. Murdoch has been on our staff for nearly three years and has proved himself a conscientious, careful and industrious official. He is, moreover, a man of good principle and honorable in every respect. He is thirty-two years of age and married. Thus, in offering Dr. Murdoch's services we have every confidence that you will find his work and personality entirely satisfactory.\n\nAwaiting a reply at your earliest convenience, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. H. M. Speechly,\nSuperintendent, Junior Red Cross,\nManitoba Division.\n\nMS/ML\nJanuary 26, 1925.\n\nDear Mrs. Speechly:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the activity of your dentist, Dr. R. H. Murdoch and in which you offer his services for the Indian school children between Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg. I should be pleased if Dr. Murdoch would hold a clinic for the children of the Peguis and Fisher River Schools, northeast of Hodgson, Man. In the Fairford area we have no local representative who could cooperate with your dentist and I am not prepared to authorize a clinic there. It is understood that the Department will be responsible for the travelling and material expenses and for the board and lodging of Dr. Murdoch while engaged on the clinic. I note that you estimate one month's time for the examination and treatment.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent M. McGuish, The Halfway P. O., Man., informing him of our plans and asking him to complete the arrangements with Dr. Murdoch, who should correspond with him before proceeding to the district. When the work is completed, Dr. Murdoch should submit his account in duplicate, showing his expenses, and should support it with receipts for the payment of board, transportation (except railway fare which is at a standard rate), etc.\n\nI have to thank you for this opportunity and I am hopeful that the general health of the Indian children treated will be much improved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. H. M. Speechly,\nSup't., Junior Red Cross,\nManitoba Division,\n187 Kennedy St., Winnipeg, MAN.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., February 10, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI received a telegram today from Reverend Mr. Bley of Elkhorn Residential School, in which he informs me that George Manningway, a pupil of his school, died this morning.\n\nIn a conversation with Mr. Bley over the phone, he told me that three of this family were at the school, and they were all tubercular cases. He claims they were sent to him through the recommendation of Inspector Bunn.\n\nWe will have to do something to stop this indiscriminate admission of children without first passing a medical examination. Speaking to Mr. Bley, I told him that this would be done in the future. I think we should instruct all principals and Indian Agents, again, that no children are to be admitted to a school without first having passed a medical test. I quite often hear from the Indians, that they do not want to send their children to school as it is a place where they are sent to die. While this is not true, at the same time if we have a number of deaths, the schools will get a bad name, and certainly Elkhorn is not starting out well.\n\nWill you send a circular to the Agents and Principals or shall I do so?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 209-11B of the 10th instant. I am glad that you have brought to my attention the advisability of a more careful medical examination of applicants for admission to Indian residential schools. I have discussed this with Mr. Ferrier and he will direct a circular letter in this connection to agents and inspectors. It is our own officers who pick up orphans, delinquents and others, that are causing the difficulty, as occasionally no application forms are forwarded. There will be also a more careful checking of the medical officers' remarks in the case of all applicants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department wishes to emphasize the vital importance of having all applicants for admission to Indian residential schools carefully examined by a medical officer. When a pupil's health becomes a matter of concern soon after admission, the consequent parental alarm and distrust militates against successful recruiting. The difficulties inherent in this situation can be somewhat overcome by strict compliance with the Department's regulations concerning the physical fitness of recruits.\n\nEach applicant should be thoroughly examined and pronounced fit by the medical officer before admission to a residential school. The doctor's certificate is given prominence in the Department when applications are being considered. Please see that all interested in recruiting children for this class of schools conform to the Department's requirements in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nTo Indian Commissioners,\nInspectors and Agents.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your circular letter of February 25th, Inst., No. 1-1-13,\n\nI have forwarded copies of this letter to the doctors affected by it, and to the Principals of the Residential Schools in this Agency, calling their particular attention to it.\n\nIt is impossible to follow your instructions at the outlying Missions in this Agency.\n\nThe school term opens in September. During the summer, prospective pupils wander with their parents, who are hunting, or who are for other purposes, in the bush, often far away, off their Reserves. They do not all return, at the same time, when school opens, but drift in, one after another.\n\nDr. E. L. McIntyre attends six Residential Schools: St. John's and St. Martin's at Wabasca; St. Bruneau's, near Slave Lake; St. Stephen's at Grouard; St. Peter's, five miles outside of Grouard; St. Andrew's, Whitefish Lake. He resides and practices at High Prairie, some 200 miles from Wabasca, and some 100 miles from Whitefish Lake. There is no other doctor in this extent of territory.\n\nIt is manifestly impossible for the doctor to be at all these widely separated schools at the opening of the school term, and if special trips have to be made to examine one or more children before they could be admitted to the schools, the expense will be heavy - from $150.00 to $200.00 per trip. This also applies to the school at Sturgeon Lake, as Dr. Raeby resides at Grande Prairie, some 80 miles from the school.\n\nI think that those in charge at the Missions are capable of judging whether children seeking admission to Residential Schools are in ordinary good health, and that they would refuse to admit such as might endanger the well-being of those\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nthose in the schools. So far, no epidemics have broken out in these schools, that have, in the least way, deterred the Indians from sending their children to school. In fact, applications for admission to the various schools in this Agency are almost without exception, up to, or in excess of, the number which the per capita grant is allowed by the Department.\n\nIf the suggested manner of admitting the children to school at the outlaying Missions could be authorized by the Department, the children could be examined by the medical officer on his regular, or other, visit to the Reserves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent\nHINTS ON THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE.\n\nThe following is intended merely as an outline of the study beginning from Standard II; and the teacher is advised to make constant reference to the text-book provided by the Department.\n\n1. Practice deep breathing exercises daily. In connection with these exercises be sure that the children breathe through the nose, and endeavour in every way to have them cultivate the habit.\n\n2. Let chest expansion and other physical exercises be practised regularly to the same end as the teaching of hygiene.\n\n3. Study the respiratory system; the functions and care of the nose, throat and lungs.\n\n4. Pure air; what it is, its relation to health, and how it becomes contaminated.\n\n5. The ventilation of dwellings, its importance and the means by which it is secured. Special need for fresh air in bed rooms.\n\n6. Disease germs and how diseases are spread.\n\n7. The effect of sunlight on germs.\n\n8. The fly and mosquito, how they grow and multiply; how they carry disease.\n\n9. Cleanliness in houses and surroundings to prevent the multiplying of flies.\n\n10. Communicable diseases (contagious and infectious.) How to prevent their spreading, the object of quarantine; how it should be observed.\n\n11. Special study of tuberculosis, the spread of the disease and methods of combating it.\n\n12. Diseases of the eye; danger of communication by towels and handkerchiefs.\n\n13. Each pupil be provided with a separate handkerchief and slate cloth.\n\n14. Study the digestive system; the mouth, stomach and intestines and the functions of each.\n\n15. Care of the teeth; causes of decay, how to prevent decay, ill effects upon the teeth of the use of too much sugar.\n\n16. Uses of the teeth; emphasise the importance of thorough chewing of food.\n\n17. Importance of wholesome and well cooked foods; regularity of meals.\n\n18. Importance of pure water and the free use of it except at meal-time.\n\n19. Effects of coffee, alcohol and tobacco on digestion.\n\n20. Study the circulatory system; its organs and their functions and their relation to the health of the body.\n\n21. Study the nerves and the muscles; the importance of exercise and rest; the effects of stimulants and narcotics on the nerves and muscles.\n\n22. Study the skin, its functions, glands and so forth; the importance of regular baths and cleanliness.\n\n23. Care of head; importance of cleanliness. The practice of wearing handkerchiefs on the head in the school-room and indoors generally should be firmly discountenanced.\n\n24. Importance of clean and comfortable clothing.\n\n25. Importance of keeping the feet dry; ill effects of wet feet, colds, croup, sore throat, rheumatism, etc.\nOttawa, March 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the doctor's examination of applicants for admission to Indian residential schools. I note the extra difficulty and expense attendant upon an examination by a medical officer prior to a child's admission to the residential schools in your agency, and it will be satisfactory to the Department if the procedure in the past is followed. The object of my circular of the 23rd ultimo was not to impede recruiting, but to insure the physical fitness of the children enrolled at this type of institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa, April 4, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to refer to the last paragraph of your 403-11B of the 30th ultimo, relative to departmental responsibility in connection with the number of surgical operations performed at Indian residential schools. I have to point out that the Department and the school management are acting as guardians for the children and our consent is necessary. Further, as I have already informed you, the Department of Health has stated that the practice of tonsil removal has been carried in some instances to a very great extreme. These are the reasons why operations cannot be left entirely to the discretion of the medical officer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM DEPUTY SUPT. GENERAL'S LETTER to COMMISSIONER GRAHAM, dated March 17, 1925.\n\n- Original on 106-0-13.\n\nI wish to point out that the Department, as well as the Doctor, is responsible for the number of operations that were performed. No medical officer would perform a large number of operations on the authority of the last paragraph of the letter to Dr. Johnston of April 23rd, last, informing him of his appointment. The paragraph in question was with reference to remuneration and it was not intended that he should have authority to perform operations on his own initiative. The authority for the recent operations was received when you were visiting the school, and, as I pointed out in my letter to you of the 18th ultimo, you would have done well to have enquired as to the extent of these operations, before telling the medical officer to go ahead and sending one of the travelling nurses to assist.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM, His No. 402-11B, dated March 30, 1925, addressed to Secretary. - Original on 110-0-13.\n\nIn your letter of the 17th instant, #106-0-13, dealing with a similar matter in connection with the Elkhorn School, I note that you state the Department as well as the Doctor is responsible for the number of operations to be performed. Will you explain to me what you mean by this? My view is that it is a matter that is entirely at the discretion of the Doctor. If the Doctor informs the Principal that a specific number of cases need to be operated upon, I presume that this specific number will be attended to, and the Principal would have nothing to say in the matter.\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the TIE-DINAGA CENTRAL SCHOOL for the year ended March 31, 1925, ONTARIO.\n\nA new scheme for securing cleanliness and health has been used here for the past year, and is very successful. One point is given daily for the following:\n\n1.- Clean handkerchief.\n2.- Clean teeth.\n3.- Clean hands, face and nails.\n4.- Neat shoes.\n5.- Neatly brushed hair.\n\nFrequently the whole school obtains perfect. Nail files and combs were given by me at Christmas time and tooth brushes are earned by a perfect record for a month.\n\nMrs. Celia File,\nTeacher.\nMarch 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 23rd file No 1-1-13, in reference to the medical examination of prospective pupils to the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have written to both of our Medical Officers urging them to be strict in their examination of all applicants presented to them, also to the Bishop of Yukon and the various missionaries asking to exercise great care in selecting children and advising them to take into consideration the antecedents of the children recruited for the school.\n\nI fully realize the difficulty in obtaining recruits to fill vacancies when the health of resident pupils breaks down and more so if they happen to die which unfortunately did happen at Carcross last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n25-1\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nOttawa, April 9th, 1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to letter to you of the 24th March and your reply of the 3rd instant regarding the fees approved by your Department for removal of tonsils, I beg to say it is regretted that letter of the 24th March failed to make clear to you that reference was made therein to a group of five or more patients each requiring operation.\n\nThe reason for having brought the matter to your attention is due to the fact that from time to time it becomes necessary for this Department to have operations of the nature mentioned performed at Indian schools, and the question has arisen as to the rate of remuneration which is fair to allow. Enclosed you will find copy of a letter of the 27th November last which was written in the matter to the Department of Health. The reply received from that Department was to the effect that $10.00 per case where there are five or more cases to be attended to would be reasonable remuneration, with a fee of $2.50 per case for the anaesthetist. It was further stated that the rates mentioned would be about in accordance with payments allowed under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Seemingly your view of the matter is different, but possibly when you consider it in the light of the information now supplied you may have a further recommendation to make. An expression of your opinion will be much appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) J.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Director,\nMedical Services,\nDept. of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nSOLDIER CIVIL RE-ESTABLISHMENT.\n\nOttawa,\nApril 17, 1925.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 9th.\n\nI do not agree with the information forwarded to you by the Department of Health. This Department would pay the regulation fee for tonsillectomy, regardless of the number done at any one time. The fee is $3.00 for the Anaesthetist is not in accordance with the Workmen's Compensation Fees. The Workmen's Compensation Fees in Ontario provide $5.00 for each anaesthetic for minor operations and $10.00 for majors. None of the Workmen's Compensation Boards in Canada pays less than $5.00 for a general anaesthetic of any sort.\n\nThe fact that five operations were performed in one day has no bearing, whatsoever, on the amount to be charged, in my estimation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.C. Arnold,\nW.C. Arnold, M.D.,\nDirector Medical Services,\n\nWCA/C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 27th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th instant #1-1-13, in connection with surgical operations for tonsils, adenoids and glands on pupils attending our Industrial Schools. I am quite well aware that the Department and School Principals are acting as guardians of children, and that the consent of the Department is necessary before operations take place. Surely I have not been labouring with the Indians for forty years and have to be told this at this late date.\n\nThis correspondence grew out of what took place at Elkhorn in connection with operating on children. What I maintain, and I think I am absolutely right, is that if the doctors say to us that a certain child will have to be operated upon, we are bound to accept his advice and give the consent. We have been doing this as long as I can remember.\n\nIn connection with the operations that are to be performed at Edmonton, you were told that there were three cases. I am now told by the Principal that there are one or two cases to be added to this number. I am quite satisfied that when the doctor is out there he will operate on these cases, as he properly should, and it is not for me or the Principal to say whether this should be done or not. I think you will agree with me in this matter.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would hate to say to a Doctor that he must not operate on a case, when he tells me it should be done, and done in a hurry.\n\nI am continually fighting Doctors with a view of keeping their charges down, and I think so far as operations both major and minor which are performed in Regina are concerned that we have cut the charges down to a minimum.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nThe expenses incurred when taking a pupil of a residential school to hospital and his hospital care, if not of long duration, are met from Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education where funds can be found for the purpose. Funeral expenses are met from Relief Vote, if a pupil of an Indian residential school dies elsewhere than at the school, and provided the parents or guardians are unable to pay the costs of burial. When a pupil dies at a residential school, it is considered by this Department that the school authorities should be responsible for the expenses. Occasionally, this Department has paid the cost of transporting the body from the school to the home of the parents, when the parents have refused to permit burial at the school.\n\n(Sgd.) J. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nMay 11, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from the Honourable Mr. King, I have to inform you that Dr. Baker and his son, Dentists, of Vancouver, have done dental work at six Indian residential schools (Lytton, Fraser Lake, Cariboo, Ahousaht, Alberni and Christie). The work extended over two years and for the last of these schools we were able to arrange for the very reasonable rate of $1.00 per filling and 25\u00a2 for each extraction. No expenses were allowed. There was considerable correspondence in connection with the accounts that were presented for these six schools and it was found that only the necessary work had been done. The accounts were large and the conclusion the Department and Commissioner Ditchburn reached was that it was the condition of the pupils' teeth that was responsible.\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn recommended that these dentists do the necessary work at four other schools - Sechelt, Kuper Island, Alert Bay and Mission. At that time no further funds were available and the work was not authorized. Three other schools have not been mentioned as yet, but I am convinced considerable dental work is needed there also (Kamloops, Kootenay and Squamish).\n\nThere is no question concerning the advisability of having dentists proceed to the four schools recommended by Mr. Ditchburn. It is quite probable that the other three schools should also be visited. The whole question is one of funds. There is an item in the Estimates for Medical and Dental Attention at Indian Schools. A larger one will have to be voted in future if we wish to make dental work at these institutions a regular practice.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you report that satisfactory work has been done by Dr. R. H. Murdoch, the dentist who was sent in by this Department in cooperation with the Manitoba Junior Red Cross. At a later date it may be possible to have him complete the clinic for the pupils of the Fisher River Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

R. Baker, of Vancouver, has been engaged by us to give dental attention to the children at Indian residential schools, as follows:\n\n1923 - Lytton, Fraser Lake and Cariboo.\n1924 - Christie, Alberni and Ahousaht.\n1925 - St. Mary's and Sechelt.\n\nThere is only one Indian residential school in British Columbia where practically no dental attention has been received in late years - that at Kuper Island. It is possible that there is considerable work to be done at the Kamloops, Kootenay and Squamish institutions, but there has been no urgent request. As far as Alert Bay is concerned, a local dentist is attending to the most urgent cases.\n\nThere is no doubt of the advisability of having the Kuper Island School pupils examined by a dentist. It is quite possible that the other three schools mentioned should also be visited. It is a question of funds.\n\nI suggest that the Hon. Mr. Stewart inform Mr. Doneghey that Dr. Baker will be engaged if we need dental services at Indian residential schools in the Province. This dentist's work for this Department has apparently been efficient.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nI cannot help thinking that there is some laxity in the medical examination of pupils for our schools. In most cases pupils are admitted and after a time a medical examination is made, and I am of the opinion that the doctors are prone to allow cases to remain in school that should not be there, thinking that they will improve under the better living conditions afforded them in the schools. We have altogether too many cases going to the Sanitorium from our schools. No less than 24 children have been taken out of the schools and sent to the Saskatchewan Sanatorium at Fort Qu'Appelle within the last three years. If we could insist that these children be not taken into residence until they are thoroughly examined and questioned as much as the one we are now asked be filled in and passed by our medical officer here we might put a check on this and curtail the expenditure. It would also eliminate the danger of exposing healthy children in the schools by taking in those who are inclined to be tubercular.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Paragraph 24 of Section 91 of the British North America Act provides that the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians.\" Paragraph \"A\" of Section 98 of the Indian Act provides that the Chiefs of a band in Council may make regulations for the care of the public health subject to confirmation by the Governor in Council, and Paragraph \"B\" of Section 92 of the Indian Act provides that the Superintendent General may make regulations for the prevention or mitigation of disease, etc. Provision has therefore been made by Dominion legislation for coping with diseases among Indians on their reserves, and when regulations are made in pursuance of this legislation I do not think the provincial law could be enforced on Indian reserves.\n\nDepartmental Solicitor.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 9th, 1926\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo replying to my letter to you of the 8th March with reference to the admission of pupils to our residential schools.\n\nI may say that I was aware of the contents of your circular of February 23rd, 1925 when I wrote to you. The point I want to make is that it is the practice to take children into the various schools, and sometimes it is weeks after the admission before they have a medical examination and in cases where they are found to be not exactly what they should be physically there is a tendency to keep them in the school and they are kept there. I know this, and have known it for the last 25 years. Your circular is not all that is necessary in order to stop this; the medical men should be specially instructed. My idea was that a child should be taken into residence at all until the Department had examined the certificate of health. This could be done quite easily. The Inspectors and Agents are aware that it is the desire of the Department that children shall be physically sound before being admitted to the schools, but this does not stop the Principals of the schools from going to the reserves, recruiting children and bringing them back long distances to the schools without a medical examination.\n\nI should be glad if the Department would take some action to see that no pupil shall enter our schools without a proper examination, the result of which an examination to be approved by the Department or this office before admission is granted. The cost of medical attention for tubercular children is growing all the time, and to take a child that is threatened with tuberculosis into an Indian school is not going to improve the condition of that child, to say nothing of the danger to which the other children in the school are exposed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 5, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11B of the 9th ultimo, with reference to the medical examination of applicants to Indian residential schools. I shall prepare a circular to principals in this connection and, in due course, will forward copies to you for your file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nThe Department wishes to emphasize the vital importance of having all applicants for admission to Indian residential schools carefully examined by a medical officer. When a child's health becomes a matter of concern soon after admission, the consequent parental alarm and distress militates against successful recruiting. The difficulties inherent in this situation can be somewhat overcome by strict compliance with the Department's regulations concerning the physical fitness of recruits.\n\nEach applicant should be thoroughly examined and pronounced fit by the medical officer before admission to a residential school. The doctor's certificate is given prominence in the Department when applications are being considered. Please see that all interested in recruiting children for this class of schools conform to the Department's requirements in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

May 13, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should like to know from you whether any provision is being made this year to carry on the dental work among the pupils of the residential schools, as I have received, on several occasions, letters from different principals pointing out the desirability of further visits by a dentist.\n\nUp to the present the children of the Kuper Island, Alert Bay and Coqualeetza Schools, have not been attended to and as Dr. Baker has not re-visited any of the schools at which he had previously done dental work, it necessarily follows that some further attention will be required on the pupils.\n\nDr. Baker, as you know, has done practically all the dental work at the schools so far at rates of \u00a31.00 each for amalgam fillings and 25\u00a2 each for extractions. I have, however, received an offer from Dr. C. H. Pinoe, a dentist at Port Alberni, offering to do the work on the pupils of the schools in his district at the same rates. Dr. Pinoe's district would cover the Alberni, Ahousaht and Clayoquot Schools.\n\nWhile I have received communications from other dentists throughout the province desirous of doing the school dental work, none of them have quoted rates anything nearly as low as those of Dr. Baker and Dr. Pinoe.\n\nAn early reply from you on this subject will be appreciated.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW.

I have no doubt that the reason is the practice of supplying neighbouring Indian communities from time to time. A letter has been addressed to the Rev.

I should be grateful if you would consider the advisability of supplying this salt at your institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMt. Elgin Institute,\nMunsey, Ont.\nBrook Village, Inverness Co., N.S.\nMay 24, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on conditions as I find them among the Indians whom I visited in Nova Scotia.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS.\n\nThat the children be provided with one hot meal in school each day. Such meal should consist of hot soup or broth with biscuit, milk, cheese, sugar and cocoa. The actual preparation of this in the school and similar meals would serve a very useful educational lesson.\n\nThat for purposes of education in health matters practically all activity be concentrated on the school children and that which can be done with the individual mother as the occasions arise.\n\nThat serious consideration be given to the practice of allowing grants for the care of orphan children but rather that arrangements be made for maintaining such children in the Municipal Homes of the Province.\n\nCatherine MacDonald.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on conditions as I find them among the Indians whom I visited in Nova Scotia.\n\nSCHOOL CHILDREN.\n\nA large number of the school children appear to be undernourished. It is not unusual to have a school teacher report that it is a common thing for the children to show signs of faintness or weakness in school. When I have taken up this question with the parents the usual answer is for the mother to say that they have not the means to buy such food as milk, butter or eggs for their children.\n\nPractically all the children have decayed teeth, many having enlarged glands; a considerable number suffer from adenoids and enlarged tonsils as well as defective eyesight. A great deal could be done for these children by providing them with a hot lunch of good nourishing food in school. I can conceive of nothing that they would appreciate more or would do the more good.\n\nI have endeavored on all visits to give them, at least, one lesson on health and am getting the teachers enthused along the same line. I feel that the only hope of education in health matters lies among the school children. Very few mothers take kindly to the idea of instruction and so far there has been no indication that they would attend classes organized for such purposes although here and there one does meet with a mother who is anxious to improve and some improvement has been effected, although the bulk of the women seem to think it is hopeless to try to improve in any way under present conditions, their general complaint being that they cannot get the things that are really needed.\n\nSome schools have been supplied with a tank or container for drinking water and the common drinking cup is gradually disappearing.\n\nOwing to the fact that these reserves are scattered over practically the whole length of Nova Scotia and there being no living accommodation within easy reach without hiring daily transportation and also the lack of much evidence on the part of the adults that they will profit by much instruction, I feel that more practical results will be obtained eventually by now concentrating on the school children. Actual demonstration in the schools will be much more advantageous and production of more results than similar attempts in the homes. In this connection it is suggested that arrangements be made whereby some funds would be placed at the disposal of the school teachers to carry on in this fashion with my assistance and supervision.\n\nOrphan Children.\n\nIt is seen that it is the practice of selecting or appointing a guardian or foster parents for orphan children and then allowing such guardian or foster parents a small sum of money for the maintenance of each child. The result of this practice is that the whole family attempt to live off of that allowance and do nothing further to provide for themselves, the result being that the poor orphan profits but little from the Department's money. This can be overcome by maintaining such\norphans in the local municipal homes where they would be fairly well looked after and sent to school.\n\nCatherine MacDonald.\n\nover for recommendation\nOttawa, June 21, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your report, dated the 24th ultimo, which is relative to health conditions of the children attending the Indian day schools in Nova Scotia. At the beginning of the coming academic year, I will initiate correspondence with the respective Indian agents, making them to report on the possibility as well as the advisability of providing a hot lunch in the case of the nine schools where no provision is made in this connection.\n\nI have noted your remarks concerning maintenance grants to foster parents.\n\nYou state that \"actual demonstration in the schools will be much more advantageous and productive of more results than similar attempts in the homes. In this connection it is suggested that arrangements be made whereby some funds would be placed at the disposal of the school teachers to carry on in this fashion with my assistance and supervision.\" Please make a definite recommendation concerning what materials should be placed in the hands of our teachers. The Department is disposed to give this suggestion favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Catherine MacDonald,\nBrook Village,\nInverness Co.,\nN. S.\nBrook Village, Simcoe Co., N.S.\nAugust 14, 1926\n\nMr. J. D. Maclean\nAsst. Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter No. 1-1-13, dated June 21st, 1926, was received by me a couple of days ago.\n\nYou ask that a definite recommendation be made concerning what materials should be placed in the hands of the teachers.\n\nFor hot lunches, utensils, as provided in the Indian Day School at Shasonia would be sufficient for the present. Namely: individual cups, little for boiling water, a large saucepan, hot and pan dish towels, a small table or shelf on which to place dish pan when washing dishes, a chest for dishes and for storing food supplies and cooking utensils.\n\nChildren would be taught the preparation and serving of lunches, also washing dishes, and the proper care of utensils used for these purposes.\n\nSalmon River with a small fund for the purpose of covering the cost of materials for sewing, mending and stitching, teachers could buy suitable material for individual cases.\n\nThe value of hot lunches, Public Health Nurse, Sydney, said, that where hot lunches have been used in rural schools, teachers report improvement in the general condition of the pupils, mentally as well as physically.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nCatherine Macdonald, R.N.\nOttawa, September 14th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th ultimo, relative to the providing of a hot lunch to the pupils of the Indian schools in the Province of Nova Scotia, I beg to inform you that it has been decided to authorize the serving of a hot lunch at the following schools:\n\nEskasoni, Millbrook,\nSalmon River, Indian Cove,\nSydney,\n\nWe have corresponded with the respective agents and requested them to arrange with the teachers for the preparing and serving of this lunch during the fall and winter months. The agents have been authorized to purchase biscuits, cheese, cocoa, sugar, and condensed milk, sufficient for the requirements and the utensils necessary for the preparation and serving of the lunch. As our funds are extremely limited we will not be able to authorize the serving of this lunch at all of the schools. The ones selected have the largest attendance. As male teachers are engaged at Middle River and Whyccoomagh, it is thought that they would not be able to prepare and serve a lunch. At each of the schools mentioned where the lunch will be served, the Agent has been requested to have the teacher utilize the services of the older girls in the preparation and serving of same.\n\nWhen we are assured of the success of the serving of the lunch at the schools mentioned above, further consideration might be given next year to the authorizing of a lunch for the pupils at all the schools in Nova Scotia.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Catherine MacDonald, R.N.,\nBrook Village,\nInverness Co., N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs Provincial Superintendent of Education amongst Indians, I have been writing the teachers in order to find out what advancement is being made along educational lines, and find from the replies that in many instances pitiful conditions prevail.\n\nThere seems to be among the older pupils in the various schools a growing desire for education, and in most instances the teachers (so far as heard from) notice much interest in the advancement of their Indian pupils, but many of them report bright pupils having to stay out of school for lack of medical treatment, sometimes defective eyesight, sometimes diseased tonsils, and in a few cases the need of an operation for appendicitis, and...\n\"Nothing is too hard for the Lord\"\n\nOntario Woman's Christian Temperance Union\n\nand very often tuberculosis trouble.\n\nI am therefore taking the liberty of calling your attention to these conditions, and would be glad to know if where parents are not able to secure medical aid, the Department would supply the means if cases were reported to them through teachers and clarified by the agency?\n\nRe: Tuberculosis cases, the children dismissed from schools because of this trouble have no future. Such dismissal does not stop the spread of the disease, as they mingle just the same while able to be about with the inhabitants of their locality.\n\nWould it not be possible to establish an industrial home for such pupils, where they could be given a chance? Many of them with care and proper nourishment outgrow the disease, and all could receive some instruction part of the day and take up some carpentry or...\nCraft work as their inclination might lead them, as well as gardening and light farm work, and thus be at least partly self-supporting, and cease to be a menace to their home reserves.\n\nThe Public Health nurses,\n\nI notice by your Department report that you have established a staff of nurses in Saskatchewan with headquarters at Regina.\n\nCould this not be done also for Ontario? New Ontario seems especially in need of such help. In gathering my report it occurred to me that every town would be a centre from which very effective work could be done. Besides being a help in times of epidemic or reserve, the example and personal touch with...\nIndian girls and mothers would be of untold value to them. Mothers among Indians are well aware that they need an example to bring up to and especially when they are old enough to leave school.\n\nWe are pleased to find that there are now several Indian girls in course of hospital training and we plan to follow up the gold medal we presented Miss Sampson, our first graduate, by presenting one to the Indian girl taking the highest number of marks each year at graduation.\n\nThanking you for past courtesies in reference to Indians and knowing you will give these subjects your attention and consideration.\n\nI remain yours Truly,\n\nB. C. Ashcroft\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nDear Mrs. Ashcroft:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the physical condition of pupils at Indian schools. I am pleased to assure you that medical treatment will be given to the children of our wards whenever possible, if reported to our local representatives. Your suggestion that a residential institution for tubercular children be established has been noted. Concerning the advisability of a travelling nurse with headquarters at Parry Sound or other suitable centre, I wish to state that the Department has given this question serious consideration and if we can secure the necessary funds, it would be possible to make an appointment. This activity has already been given a trial in Ontario.\n\nI wish to thank you for your interest in the work generally and especially your action in keeping in touch with the Indian girls who are in training at hospitals.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nOctober 8, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nWhilst on my tours of inspection this year, I have been taking up with the medical men, the question of a more thorough and adequate check upon the children in the various schools.\n\nUnder the present regulations, the children are only medically examined upon entering the school, and unless there is an epidemic threatened, or any of them are sick, the doctor does not, except in a very general way, thoroughly examine these children again.\n\nIt is the opinion of the medical men, in which I heartily concur, that the children should be thoroughly examined at least once a year, preferably immediately after the summer holidays. This is only feasible now what is already done by the Health Inspectors at the various Provincial schools, and as the doctors point out, it gives them a chance of getting in touch with any children who may be disposed towards T.B., or any other serious ailments. It would also, considerably help Agents and myself in explaining to the various Indians, in answer to their complaints that the children are not properly fed and looked after.\n\nI should suggest a form something after the style of the form now in use by the Medical men in examining white schools. This form would be of great assistance to the said medical men, in seeing check on the children's health, and would also largely aid the Principals who have to look after the children, and would give most important information to the Agents and myself as to the healthful progress of the children at the schools. Finally, too, it would assist everybody in keeping check upon the prevalence of T.B. trouble amongst the Indian children. You can readily understand that very often when the children are first examined, the doctor can find no trace of any serious disease, and if he does not examine them thoroughly at least once a year, he has no opportunity very often until too late, that the child has developed disease.\n\nYours, truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nGSP/S.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nNovember 17, 1926.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th ultimo, with a suggestion concerning organizing the medical inspection of children who are attending Indian residential schools. I wish to thank you for this helpful letter, which is receiving our consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B. C.\nNovember 27, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nIn addition to the medical work for the Indian in his home, there is an effort to safeguard the health of the youth of our wards who are attending school. 8242 Indian children are enrolled in the 254 day schools in operation. The regular doctors, traveling nurses and field matrons have special opportunity to examine school children and remedial measures can be supervised by the teachers. The Appropriation for Indian Education provides approximately $12,000 annually for the purpose of a hot lunch at half classes of school. Nourishing soups, milk, cocoa and biscuits are the foods supplied most commonly. Hygiene and the proper preparation of food is stressed by the instructors in day schools.\n\nMore comprehensive is the effort on behalf of the 6327 Indian children enrolled in the 74 residential schools in Canada. Medical officers are appointed for these institutions and occasionally dental clinics are held. In all our modern buildings, there are special quarters for the care and isolation of the sick, and, at a large number of Indian residential schools, there may be found sleeping verandahs for the children of tuberculosis tendency. The Department purchases from wholesalers approximately $150 worth of drugs annually for an institution with 100 pupils. The approximate annual expenditure from Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education for medical work generally at residential schools is as follows:\n\nDrugs and Medicines .... $ 9,000.\nDental work ............ 4,500.\nMedical services ....... 13,500.\n\nTotal: $27,000.\n\nRussell T. Hennan\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing the corrected September quarter return of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School, also letter from the Reverend Principal. Please inform him that in the case of his school it is not necessary to have new pupils medically examined by a doctor before they are admitted. It is expected, of course, that each new pupil should be carefully examined on entrance by the Reverend Sister who looks after the nursing duties and that the pupil should later be examined by the medical officer on the occasion of his first visit to the school.\n\nAs pointed out in our letter of October 20th, the September quarter return should show the exact dates between which the annual holidays are taken. This information is required in order that the return can be properly checked. I enclose a duplicate copy of this letter which you should forward to the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Department wishes to direct your attention to the following circular letters:\n\nNov. 9, 1922 - Examination of applicants for admission to residential schools.\n\nFeb. 23, 1925 - Physical fitness of pupils entering residential schools.\n\nThe instructions in these circulars should be known to you and to others interested in recruiting and, if extra copies are required, please inform the Department.\n\nI am particularly desirous, at the present time, of impressing on you that pupils whose eligibility is doubtful\u2014either for religious or other reasons\u2014must not be placed in a residential school until all the facts are known to the Department and a decision has been given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Principals of Residential Schools.\nDecember 7, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Larose:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo, I am pleased to inform you that you have been appointed medical officer for the Guy Indian Residential School, at Sturgeon Landing. Once every three months, you should make a thorough examination of all children in residence, with a view to determining what action, if any, is necessary for their physical welfare. Further, you should respond promptly to all calls made by the Rev. Principal, or his representative, and should give whatever professional attention is needed to safeguard the health of the pupils at the school. You should give the Principal advice and make reports to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy concerning whatever sanitary arrangements are advisable.\n\nYou will be allowed fair and reasonable expenses and $10 per day for your services in connection with the residential school. If you find it necessary to perform an emergency operation, upon receipt of a satisfactory explanation the Department will allow a reasonable fee.\n\nPlease inform me if you accept the appointment and indicate the date of your first inspection of the pupils. As there has been some sickness at the school, I wish to urge that your first visit be as soon as possible.\n\nIf pupils of the Guy Indian Residential School are sent in to the hospital at The Pas, they will be under the care of Dr. Crok.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nArthur Larose, Esq., M.D.,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM INSPECTOR GEO. S. FRAGNELL,\nP. O. BOX 752, KAMLOOPS, B. C., dated December 7, 1926,\naddressed to Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nReports of this kind, rendered at the end of each term, taken in conjunction with an annual medical inspection as suggested, and which I wrote Dr. Scott about, but have not heard, would give the Agents sufficient information upon each child, both educational and physical to be able to answer questions, and instill trust and interest amongst the Indians. In connection with the physical welfare of the children, I might say that this is of as much importance to the agents as is the question of education. We are constantly being accused of under-feeding and overworking the children, and although we know that this is not so, we have nothing but the doctor's original inspection reports at the enrolment of the child to go on. If it were annual, we could show the child's progress in weight, etc., or the reason why he or she was not up to standard. It is also a good check upon the institution if the medical man sees all children once a year, and thoroughly examines them, recording all particulars.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMany from M.O.'s would demand added examination - the added medical value is slight - no action at present.\nMILK VALUABLE TO GROWING BOY\n\nImportant Investigation Carried Out In England\n\nINCREASE WEIGHT, HEIGHT\n\nCow's Product Is a Most Complete Food\n\nBy London Pure Milk Company.\n\nThe addition of one pint of milk a day to the diet of boys whose appetite of growing boys converted an average gain of weight of 3.5 pounds per year instead of 2.6 pounds and produced an average annual increase in height of 1.4 inches instead of 1 inch.\n\nThis betterment in nutrition, by natural processes, was not due to the relatively small increase in the fuel value of the dietary, nor to the extra food energy supplied, but to the specific qualities of milk as a food.\n\nEXPERIMENTS.\n\nThe experiments were undertaken under the auspices of the Medical Research Council of Great Britain as a part of an extensive series of studies of the influence of diet upon the growth of the child. The experiments included the observation of 599 to 600 boys living in ordinary London homes.\n\nAn analysis was first made of the amount of food eaten by these boys who were receiving under the standard diet and the average rate of growth. The diets were then modified by the addition of milk and butter in specified amounts. However, the other foods remained standard and did not vary. During four years records were kept of the food actually consumed at the table by weighing each sample amount of food after each of the three meals and deducting the waste.\n\nIt was found that these boys were taking from 1,875 to 2,134 calories per day\u2014a range of 259,000 calories which 12 per cent were protein, 38 per cent fat, and 48 per cent carbohydrate.\n\nVALUE OF COW'S MILK.\n\nThe diets were modified for groups of boys to determine whether the group by the addition of milk to the basic diet of casein, sugar, or butter, or vegetables, margarine, or cheese, and watercress.\n\nIt was found that almost invariably there was no growth during summer, and usually more gain in weight at that season.\n\nThe groups whose cow's milk was given as an addition to the diet gained far more in both weight and height than those without the milk.\n\nThis may be taken as another striking demonstration of the value of milk as a complete food and of the necessity that it form the basic substance in the diet of all growing children.\nFebruary 5th 1927\n\nD. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a clipping regarding the value of milk in the feeding of children, in view of the fact that preparations are being made to serve cocoa, Egg-O-See, Ovaltine or some such stuff to the children at school at noon. Milk is infinitely more valuable as a food for growing persons, particularly undernourished children, than any other known substance, so why serve something else to the children.\n\nIf the idea back of this treat is to encourage the children to attend school, it is unnecessary; if it is to piece out an inadequate diet at home, milk is by far the best of the lot besides being the easiest to obtain and to serve.\n\nIf the idea is that there is some peculiar virtue in a warm drink, it may be explained that there is no difference between the same drink when taken hot or taken cold save that digestion is delayed in the latter case until it has been warmed in the stomach to body temperature; Scalding hot drinks are thought, by some authorities to be one cause of gastric ulcers and cancers.\n\nThe clipping has gone the rounds of the medical journals. Yours very truly,\n\nW.H. Woods.\nOttawa, February 11, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the value of milk as a food.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Woods, Esq., M.D.,\nMount Brydges,\nOnt.\nMarch 17, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Donaghy's letter to the Honourable Mr. Stewart, I wish to report that practically no dental work was undertaken at Indian residential schools in British Columbia last year. Dr. A. R. Baker, who is mentioned in the attached letter, did good work for us at several of these institutions two and three years ago. There is no reason why he cannot be employed if it is found necessary to have dental work done this year. A Dr. Pinco, of Albion, was given some work at Ahousaht, Christie and Alberni a few days ago. If it is the Superintendent General's wish that Dr. Baker be employed this year, I can ascertain what schools most require dental services.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nRe Dental Services Residential Schools\nBritish Columbia.\n\nThe following dental services have been performed at each of the residential schools to date:\n\nAhousaht:\n- Sept. 1924 - $235.50 - Dr. A.M.O.Baker, Vancouver.\n  Dr. C. M. Pineo, Port Alberni, has been authorized to perform necessary dental work by letter of March 7/27.\n\nAlberni:\n- Sept. 1924 - $599.00 - Dr. A.M.O.Baker, Vancouver.\n  Dr. C. M.

It is possible that there is considerable work to be done at these schools, also at Kootenay, Squamish, Kamloops, Kitamaat and Port Simpson.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 19, 1927.\n\nMr. Ferris,\n\nKindly let me know the extent of the dental work which has been done in British Columbia during the last couple of years, stating the schools and the amounts paid, also let me know what might be undertaken this year.\n\nD.

No more expensive material was to be used and only permanent teeth, filled. 25 cents was allowed for each extraction. No cleaning or other dental work was to be undertaken and the dentist was to pay all his expenses. It has been clearly pointed out in the case of each school that the dentist shall do only the absolutely necessary work.\n\n[signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 4, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 809-11B of the 26th ultimo, with reference to dental services at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. You may offer the work to Dr. Day, on the following conditions: amalgam fillings for permanent teeth only - $1.50, and extractions - 35\u00a2. No cleaning or other dental work should be undertaken, unless there is special authority. No fee can be allowed for dental inspection and only the most necessary work is to be done. The dentist, of course, will have to pay all his expenses. This is in harmony with our general practice when a dentist is asked to put in order the teeth of pupils at Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMr. Russell T. Perrier, Superintendent,\nIndian Education,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. A. D. N. Daunt of the Department of Indian Affairs, New Westminster, B.C., is much interested in having our volume, \"Home Physician and Guide to Health,\" placed in every Indian school. When our agent in that section called on Mr. Daunt, he immediately became interested in the work and felt that it would be of great value in the schools.\n\nThe book, \"Home Physician and Guide to Health,\" is having a wide circulation in all Canada and has become so popular that it has been translated into several foreign languages. It has been prepared by a large group of physicians who have specialized in their line. We believe it is the only book of its kind that is being printed and circulated in Canada today.\n\nWe thought you might be interested in looking over this volume so we are taking the liberty of mailing you a copy for your inspection. Should you be interested in the book and wish to go into the matter of price and quantities, we shall gladly supply you with this information or go to Ottawa and talk the matter over personally.\n\nThanking you in advance for any consideration you may see fit to give this matter, and hoping to hear from you in regard to the same, we are\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nCANADIAN WATCHMAN PRESS,\n\nManager.\n\nHHR-k\nOttawa, May 10th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo and copy of the \"Home Physician\". I have examined this publication and I consider it might be used to advantage by some, specially qualified, of our workers. Whenever a requisition for the book is received, it will be given favourable consideration. The copy you directed to me is being returned under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. H. Rans, Esq.,\nManager,\nCanadian Watchman Press,\nOshawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., May 23rd, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant 119-1-13 regarding the employment of a young dentist to visit all residential schools in the three provinces.\n\nI may say that I have an offer from Dr. McDougall, a young dentist of this City to do the work at the rate of $300.00 a month, the Department to supply materials and to pay travelling expenses. It seems to me that this would be a good arrangement, but unfortunately it cannot be put into effect until after the schools reopen in the Fall, as by the time we got the necessary authority through now it would be drawing near the time of summer vacation. However, I should be glad to have the Department's views on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11 B of the 23rd instant, concerning the appointment of a dentist to visit Indian residential schools in the Prairie Provinces. I have discussed this matter with the Deputy Superintendent General and it has been decided that such an appointment cannot be made at the present time. Whenever dental work is urgently required at an Indian residential school, the local dentist should be approached with a view to determining what arrangement can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nBrook Village, Inverness Co., N.S.,\nJune 2nd, 1927.\n\nI herewith submit report for the month of June 1927.\n\nIn examining the school children throughout the province I find that the majority of them have very defective teeth. Some also have enlarged tonsils and defective vision.\n\nIf the children could have decayed teeth extracted and prophylactic treatment given each year it would insure them better health, later on in life.\n\nCatherine MacDonald.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 4, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nDr. A.R.Baker, 407 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B.C., may be engaged to do dental\nwork at the Ceqalesetza Institute, and at the\nSquamish School in North Vancouver.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOctober 5, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Baker:\n\nWith reference to earlier correspondence, I should be grateful if you would arrange to perform the dental services required at the present time by the pupils of the Coqualeetza and Squamish Indian Residential Schools. The fees allowed by this Department are at the rate of 25 cents for each extraction and $1.00 for each amalgam filling. More expensive fillings are not authorized. In the case of temporary teeth only extractions can be allowed. The work should be performed at the school. All materials, equipment and transportation expenses should be supplied by yourself.\n\nIf you accept this proposal, please inform me and communicate with the principals of the schools and ascertain when it will be convenient for you to undertake the work. The principals in question and their addresses are as follows: Rev. G. H. Bailey, Principal, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.; Rev. Sister Mary Amy, Principal, Squamish Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, B.C. When I receive your answering communication, I shall inform the principals and local Indian agents and request them to assist you in every possible way.\n\nWhen the work has been finished at a school, please prepare, in duplicate, a list giving the name of pupil receiving dental attention, and the number of fillings and extractions performed for each. The list for Coqualeetza School should be certified by the principal, who will forward it to the Department for payment, while the list for the Squamish School should be certified by the principal and handed to the local Indian agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

W. Richman, of Cardston, Alta., with a view to making satisfactory arrangements for the performing of whatever dental work is really necessary at each of these schools.\n\nIn similar circumstances, the Department has allowed a fee of $1.00 per amalgam filling and 85\u00a2 per extraction when it has been possible, as in the case of the pupils of these schools, to take them in groups to the dentist's office for attention. In the case of first teeth, extractions only can be allowed. The dentist is to provide all material. If Dr. Richman will undertake the work at the above rates, you should arrange with the Principal of each school to have the pupils requiring attention sent to his office when convenient to have the work done. The work absolutely necessary from time to time may be undertaken according to this arrangement.\n\nThe Doctor should prepare a list, giving the name of each pupil receiving attention and the number of fillings and extractions performed in each case. These lists should give the names for each school separately. They should be certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department attached to the dentist's account for payment for his services. The accounts should also be certified by you. Lists of the pupils receiving attention, as well as accounts showing the expenditure should be forwarded for each school separately.\n\nYou might inform the Department if the above arrangement is satisfactory to Dr. Richman, and, if he accepts, please state the date on which he will commence the work. You should inform the principals of the respective schools and have them arrange to send the pupils for treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenna,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ.

Cups and Paper Towels\n\nI recommend that individual cups and paper towels be supplied to all the schools. At Pictou, where there are 20 or 25 pupils, six cups have been supplied. In Sydney, where the cups originally supplied had been lost in moving to the new school during the holidays, six cups were supplied for 30 pupils. My April report contained a recommendation in this connection, and possibly further cups have been supplied.\n\nI would strongly emphasize the need for paper towels, as the use of a roller towel is about the surest way to spread skin disease.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTravelling Nurse, Nova Scotia\nOttawa, July 20th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss MacDonald, travelling Nurse for the Province of Nova Scotia, recommends that individual cups and individual towels be supplied to the pupils of the Sydney Indian Bay School. In this connection, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of thirty small drinking cups before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYou might consult the teacher when the school reopens regarding the individual towels and, if she can arrange to have the children attend to the laundering and, also, see that there would be no loss of the towels, you may purchase two for each pupil. While one towel is being used, the other could be laundered. The Department will leave the question of providing the towels in the hands of the teacher and yourself and, if you consider it advisable, you may arrange to purchase the towels as mentioned above.\n\nYou should forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSent to:\nRev.

Many of the studies forced upon our lagging attention were far removed from the glowing, living world outside the school room.\n\nBut the world is moving on. Children no longer hate to go to school. Teachers are co-operating with parents in a marvelous way in training eager youngsters to establish habits which will give them strong, healthy bodies and fine minds.\n\nLessons on the care of eyes, teeth and skin are educating many a parent along with their children; for much learned at school percolates through to the grown-up at home when presented to the child in a vital, interesting manner.\n\nThere is, however, one branch of hygiene which seems to have been side-tracked\u2014the care of the hair. Need of this instruction is obvious when one notices the large number of children who come to school with dead, lusterless hair; who have dandruff and even worse contagions, which they spread to those about them.\n\nAll of this may so easily be remedied if children are taught at school the latest, scientific methods of looking after the hair. An ounce of systematic care is worth pounds of cure, for a perfectly clean scalp, like a clean body, does not quickly pick up germ or parasitic infections.\n\nAmong the old superstitions which are being relegated to the limbo of old wives' tales is the time-honored idea that frequent shampooing injures the hair. Quite the opposite view is held by modern dermatologists and hair experts, while every up-to-date mother can testify to the vast improvement in the looks of her children since the weekly shampoo was inaugurated in the family.\n\nInstruction on how to care for the hair will be eagerly received by the older girls and boys, who are already alive to the importance of being well-groomed when they enter the business world. They hardly need to have their attention called to the fact that Jill easily secured a good position at a fine salary when she graduated from High School because her teeth, nails and last, but not least, her hair looked as if she took pride in her appearance whereas her class-mate Jack, with untidy hair and general don't-care, untidy look, found great difficulty in landing a job at all.\n\nWhen it comes to the younger child, it may be necessary to awaken a pride in appearance. Gone are the days when the grown-up feared to make tiny Mary vain by talking too much about her looks. The hall-mark of self-respect is pride in outward appearance and such pride is surely a fundamental in character building.\n\nEven the youngest child will respond to a suggestion if his imagination seizes upon the idea and he sees the reason why.\nHence it may be well to begin the lesson with an explanation of the way in which hair grows. The chart on the opposite page shows the anatomy of a single hair. It has been simplified so that it can easily be copied on the board and each part pointed out.\n\n**Something About the Anatomy of a Hair**\n\nThe hair is really a part of the skin, as are also the nails. Each single hair (1) is implanted in a hair sac or follicle (2) which is set obliquely 1/12th to 1/16th of an inch into the skin forming the scalp (3). This follicle is surrounded by an outer sheath (4). The papilla (5) from which the hair draws its nourishment is situated at the base of the follicle. It is fed in its turn by the fat cells (6). The bulb (7) at the base of the follicle fits like a cap round the papilla. Oil Glands (8) supply lubricant which keeps the hair soft and glossy. Other glands supply coloring matter. At one side of each hair are tiny muscles which contract in extreme fright and actually cause the hair to stand on end. In cross section, straight hair is rounded while curly hair is elliptic in form.\n\nEach hair is 240th part of an inch in diameter. Women's hair is usually coarser than men's. Hair grows about \u00bd-inch each month. The average head contains 120,000 hairs.\n\nWhen a hair is pulled out forcibly, some of the pulpy substance adheres to it, but this is not the root, for the hair germ or root remains behind and will eventually grow another hair.\nHow to Care for the Hair\n\nADVISE children to brush and comb their hair night and morning, using a moderately stiff brush and a comb with smooth, coarse teeth. A cheap, roughly finished comb will catch strands of hair and break it, or scratch the skin covering the scalp.\n\nThis systematic brushing and combing the hair:\n1. Keeps the hair in order and gives it a well-groomed appearance.\n2. Removes the dust and germs which may have settled on the hair during the day.\n3. Stimulates the blood circulation, which urges the glands to do their work in providing the proper supply of oil.\n\nWhen and How to Shampoo the Hair\n\nIt is just as important to wash the hair once a week as to take a daily bath, especially when living in a dirty, dusty city. A special day for shampooing should be ear-marked in every family.\n\nKeeping the scalp perfectly clean does not in any way destroy the natural flow of oil; on the contrary it promotes its functioning freely.\n\nWarm, soft water must always be used when shampooing the hair. In localities where the water is hard, rain water should be saved or distilled water secured for this purpose.\n\nThe choice of the shampoo is most important of all. A good shampoo must contain:\n1. Cocoanut oil to give lustre.\n2. Pine tar to stimulate healthy growth.\n3. No alcohol to make the hair brittle, as do most liquid shampoos.\n4. No excessive free alkali to bleach and injure the hair, as do most ordinary soaps not especially made for shampooing.\n\nManner of Procedure\n1. Wet the hair thoroughly with warm water.\n2. Apply the shampoo and rub to a thick lather over the entire head to the ends of the hair. Keep rubbing until the lather has become stiff.\n3. Rinse thoroughly with warm water, using a spray if possible or pour water over the hair with a pitcher.\n4. Repeat the lathering operation.\n5. Finish with a cooler rinse to close the pores.\n\nAfter the shampoo, school children should be safeguarded from any infection by having a special fine comb run through the hair while still wet.\n\nDrying the Hair\nGently mop the hair with a warm, thick bath towel. The drying process may be hastened by fanning or using gentle heat. Intense heat should never be used.\nIf the proper type of shampoo has been used, the hair will dry out soft and glossy. If, however, the hair is unnaturally dry a few drops of almond oil or warm olive oil may be rubbed into the scalp after the shampoo. In any case, this is an ideal time to give the scalp a good massage, which will stimulate the glands and promote a luxuriant growth of hair.\n\nHow to Massage the Scalp\n\nThe tissues of the scalp should be fairly loose on the bony structure\u2014the skull. Unhealthy hair is often caused by a tight scalp, which can be easily loosened by systematic massage.\n\nPlace the fingers on the scalp and move them in a circular motion. Use a firm but not heavy pressure. Work back gradually from the top or sides of the head to the neck until the whole scalp has been massaged. After a few massages you will notice that the tight scalp has become more flexible.\n\nFighting Hairute Ills on Their Own Ground\n\nTHE weekly shampoo is not only the best preventive but the only remedy for germ diseases of the hair and other ills. It must be borne in mind, though, that falling hair may be caused by a poorly nourished system or diseased physical condition. Milk and eggs, plenty of fresh vegetables and water, long hours spent out in the sunshine and proper exercise will work wonders.\n\nOily Hair This may be the result of an over-rich diet such as too much fried foods, pastries, candy, etc. That \"tired feeling\" may also be one of the danger signals sent along with oily hair to call attention to a poor physical condition. As a local remedy frequent shampooing several times a week will help the appearance of the hair for the time being, but will not do away with the cause of the trouble.\n\nDandruff This is an infectious disease, which one person can give to another. The very best preventive known is perfect cleanliness\u2014the weekly shampoo. The next\u2014great care not to use other people's brushes, combs or hats. The first symptoms are tiny, white, scaly bits of skin on the coat or dress collar. If these are discovered early the trouble can usually be cured by washing the hair with a suitable antiseptic shampoo three times a week and using a very fine comb while the hair is still wet. Obstinate cases need the care of a hair specialist.\n\nFalling Hair After a severe illness, the hair frequently loosens and falls out, owing to the lack of nourishment. A general run-down physical condition will also cause the hair to fall. Toning up the system, massage and frequent shampooing with special hair soap will do much to correct this trouble and cause the new hair to grow in rapidly. Many people who have lost practically all of their hair through illness, have been able to grow a heavy, luxuriant crop when they have persistently followed out these instructions.\n\nPediculosis (Head Lice) This is a most unpleasant, but all too common, trouble when children are massed together in large groups as in school or when they travel on trolleys and other public conveyances. To avoid picking up\none of these parasites, children should be warned not to put their heads together or pile their hats when playing out of doors. Of course, no child should be allowed to use other people's combs and brushes. Children should understand that while it is no disgrace to have caught one of these creatures, it is a crime to allow it to remain in the head even for a few hours. The infection usually shows itself by irritation of the scalp. With such a symptom, a child should be sent home immediately with a printed copy of instructions for treatment. These must be followed out before he is allowed to return. The publishers of this booklet will be glad to furnish leaflets used for this purpose by hundreds of schools throughout the United States (copy enclosed).\n\n**Interest Exciters for the Small Pupil**\n\nPlaying on the competitive instinct and stimulating pride by public approbation can both be used to advantage in this connection.\n\nChildren, like sheep, have a great deal of the herd instinct and naturally follow one another. When Jack finds that Jill has her hair washed every week and gets much commendation for her improved appearance, he naturally wishes to enter the game, too.\n\nA chart drawn like the one on page 12 and hung in a conspicuous place in the school-room will be a constant reminder and stimulant to hair cleanliness. When a child has been marked for having his hair shampooed for four successive weeks, a gold star opposite his name will set him apart among the upright and make him more enthusiastic to keep up the good work; a certain number of gold stars might have a reward. After all, a firmly established habit, whether it be good or bad, is not so easily broken, so why not form as many good ones as possible, while your material is plastic enough to be easily moulded?\n\nFor the very littlest there are stories in which beautiful hair holds the center of interest, such as:\n\n- Rapunzel\u2014Grimm's Fairy Tales.\n- Snow White\u2014Grimm's Fairy Tales.\n- Pretty Goldilocks\u2014Lang's Blue Fairy Tales.\n- Golden Haired Children\u2014Kuno's Turkish Fairy Tales.\n\nIf these are told in a dramatic manner they will add variety and interest to the hair lesson.\n\n**All Sorts and Conditions of Ways of Dressing Children's Hair**\n\nChildren are the most conventional members of the human race, hence it is sheer cruelty ever to make a child look too different from his mates.\n\nNevertheless, there is so much variety offered nowadays in styles of hair dressing that it takes only intelligence and taste to select one that will bring out the best points in a child's face.\n\nFashion and good sense unite in decreeing that the bobbed head is the most practical for the small girl, as well as for the\nboy. Certain types, however, look most picturesque if they have a luxuriant growth of hair flowing about their shoulders.\n\nNeedless to say, a child with a long thin face should wear her hair fluffed out on each side. A chubby, round face can stand hers bobbed and combed straight and flat about her ears, lying close to her head. The average small girl looks well with her hair parted on one side and caught with a barrette.\n\nThose who have abnormally high foreheads will find that the bang suits them. This is usually cut straight across, though it is possible to have a bang cut with a point in front when the straight line seems too severe. In girls with a low forehead, it is quite possible that she will look better with her hair drawn back from her face and worn very like her older brother. Like her brother's, too, if the style in which the hair is cut at the back, for the present vogue seems to demand that the hair be cut to show as much of the contour of the head as possible, hence the boyish shingle, or at least a partially shingled effect.\n\nIf, however, the head is not well shaped, it is well to step out of line and have it bobbed as it was a few years back\u2014Dutch fashion.\n\nIf a child's hair is naturally curly all so well and so good for curly hair is usually easier to dress attractively than straight hair but a child with naturally straight hair should never have it curled with curling irons, which render it dull and brittle.\n\nThe End\nNOTE\u2014This booklet has been compiled with the assistance of dermatologists and hair experts.

AUDEN, M.D., M.A.Cantab., F.R.C.P.Lond., D.P.H.Camb.\n\nSchool Medical Officer, City of Birmingham.\n\nA word of apology is perhaps necessary for the introduction as a subject for discussion of so trite a question as lousiness of the head. Yet, as a matter of fact, it is possible that lousiness is more prevalent evil in our more public money and more time of the school nursing service than any other form of minor ailment. The records of the health officers of local inspection in every borough in the kingdom reveal the continued high incidence of head infestation, and bear witness to the constant need for the control of large sections of the community regard it. The problem is, no doubt, as old as humanity itself; indeed, it has been suggested that the head louse is the oldest inhabitant who has been driven into the tightnesses and fastnesses of the head by the invading hosts of the body louse, when man lost his hirsute covering and took to the skins of animals to keep himself warm within.\n\nA little sidelight on the common infestation is given by a poem of effectual date in the sixteenth century, of which Holmes has represented as enquiring of two fishermen the extent of their catch: \"Those we caught we threw away, those we didn't catch we've thrown at us,\" is their easy answer. Doubtless this was a hoary chestnut, even at that date.\n\nProfessor Nuttall gives a heading to his article on the subject (\"Parasitology,\" Vol. 10) the following apt quotation from Barbut (1752), pp. 328):\n\n\"Man, the chief lord of all animals, hath notwithstanding been made the food and ordinary abode of these vermin, who riot in his blood and sometimes colonise his body with such force and detestable offspring. What can a mean and disgusting insect as this can raise legions sufficient to render thee loathsome, and even to destroy thee? O man! where is thy vanity?\"\n\nThe war has taught us much concerning the life, history and habits of this pest, and however we may use the term \"head louse,\" it by no means the easy matter it was at one time supposed to be. This is true of both head and body louse. It is with the former that I propose to deal today.\n\nWith the absence of any proper conveniences such as hot water, basins and towels, the overcrowded state and the monumental conditions of the slums, it is not altogether surprising that many a mother gives up in despair the attempt to keep her children's heads free from infestation. Indeed, the constant reinfestation and the habituation of the lice have led many parents to believe that these are the autochthonous progeny of the skin itself. \"Why she breeds them herself, if she does she ought to have removed,\" is a common retort to the investigator. However, it is really quite uncommon nowadays that a child which has not had some form of antilouse treatment. This has been one of the difficulties in the investigation which I have attempted to make, which are detailed below. It will be seen that in view of these difficulties, the discovery of an effective agent for the disinfection of the head would be a great social service to the community.\n\nFor such an agent to be of general value certain desiderata must be fulfilled. It should be (1) specific, (2) non-toxic, (3) non-irritating, (4) lethal or repelling to the louse, (5) have penetrating power sufficient to destroy the embryo, (6) soften and thus facilitate the removal of the nit, and lastly it must be cheap, readily accessible and easily applied, without any complicated ritual of procedure.\n\nProfessor Nuttall, in the paper above quoted, gives a very long list of insecticides which have been used for various purposes. Only a comparatively small number of these, however, conform to the above conditions, while many cannot be ruled out for use on one occasion another. Again, many of the materials described can be used for clothing only, and require more prolonged application than is possible for the head.\n\nAfter trials of various substances, I have been experimenting with a soap sold under the name of \"Navy Soap.\" Despite its name it possesses certain advantages. It was guided to the selection of this soap by the fact that its chemical and physical composition were different from those of the usual soaps purchased over the counter. It was found to possess certain advantages. It was guided to the selection of this soap by the fact that its chemical and physical composition were different from those of the usual soaps purchased over the counter. It was found to possess certain advantages. Made primarily by the action of caustic soda upon the starch, proteins, &c., contained therein, the cleansing action is different from that of the ordinary fat soap, and the colloidal products produced in its manufacture are of a different character. In the first place it does not precipitate at the same time as in combination with the calcium of the water, and there is a much less precipitation of the fatty acids in consequence. The result is that there is more fatty acid remaining in the solution, with a consequent good lather. Certain soda-starch compounds (probably $\\text{[Ca}_2\\text{H}_4\\text{O}_6\\text{Na}_4\\text{O})$ are formed, which are known to be excellent emulsifiers, produce soaps of amino-acids and ammonia. Further, it contains a heavy percentage of birch tar, which appears from experience to be a most effective remedy for skin affections. The tar is presumably emulsified in the colloidal condition. It is possible also that as the birch tar contains cresols and other phenolic bodies, phenolates are produced. I am inclined to regard coal-tar derivatives as undesirable, owing to the irritation of the skin, and the well-recognised irritation of the skin caused by coal soot. Professor Nuttall wrote:\n\n\"(PP. 559): 'Further tests should evidently be made.'\n\n\"The chemistry of soaps and the colloidal conditions which are formed by their use are exceedingly complex, and not altogether understood. The cleansing properties are due in part mainly to the 'true' emulsion which the substance causes by an alteration of the surface tension and the formation of an emulsion which has an affinity for dirt, grease, &c. Many authors insist that a wetting agent and there is no 'molecular intimacy' as it is called. To be effective in destroying the louse and embryo it would seem necessary that there should be this 'true' cleansing action, and this action is accelerated by the thorough lathering of the head, which is an essential part of the process.\n\n\"The problem which confronts us is that of the nit rather than that of the louse. The nit can be dislodged by the repeated use of substances accompanied by mechanical means, such as a fine tooth comb, especially if it is emersed in a good lather. The louse, however, so persistent that even a prolonged exposure to most substances, with the exception of the mineral oils, will kill them. Moreover, the louse has a habit of...\"\nshamming dead, and frequently those which appear to have been killed can be found to be quite active a couple of days afterwards. Death ensuing out, therefore, is an essential part of any treatment.\n\nThe destruction of the embryo in the nit is then the chief object to be aimed at. The disinfestation of the nit, however, is a secondary consideration from a disinfection point of view. To the mother, however, the removal of the lice is often of supreme importance, as even when the hair has been treated there may still be an infestation. It is not generally recognised that the louse lays her eggs close to the scalp, and that the distance between the head and the hair to which it is attached is a measure of the age of the nit. I believe that many a parent has been prosecuted and even fined for non-compliance, because they had not scalded the hair in which the louse has long hatched out.\n\nIn order to test any disinfecting material, experiments must be carried out under certain predetermined conditions with definite control experiments. These may be summarised as follows:\n\n1. Hairs must be taken from children who have recently been infected, and on whose heads there are living lice.\n\n2. The hairs supporting nits must be taken immediately before and immediately after treatment with the disinfectant chosen, and incubated under identical conditions, at a temperature of 90\u00b0 F., the optimum temperature for the development of the louse.\n\n3. Nits must contain embryos in both cases. For this purpose it is necessary to examine a number of hairs from each child.\n\n4. In any given sample of hairs one finds far more nits than living shells.\n\n5. After incubation the nits taken before treatment should either hatch out or show evidence that the embryo has continued to develop, while the nits, after treatment, should show no evidence of continued development. Sometimes active pharyngeal movements in the contained embryo can be seen, thus affording definite evidence of life.\n\n6. It will be seen that it is by no means easy to carry out experiments which conform to these stringent conditions. It is, moreover, not easy to cause the lice to hatch out under artificial conditions, and a good deal of experience is necessary to detect changes in the embryo indicative of death.\n\nAnother difficulty which exists is that there is no means of knowing what percentage of nits in an untreated case hatch out. In examining the nits upon hairs of hatched-out specimens, although the majority had hatched out, there was a number which did not contain fully developed embryos, which had presumably died during incubation under similar conditions, and a certain proportion of the nits do not produce living lice.\n\nIn my experiments the hairs were placed in test tubes in an electric thermostat incubator regulated to a temperature of 90\u00b0 F., and the lice placed in small glass receptacles with a piece of cotton-wool. In some cases a small plug of damp cotton-wool was placed at the bottom of the tube to prevent desiccation. This, however, appeared to be unnecessary, and increased the difficulty in looking for hatched-out lice.\n\nThe results of the twelve experiments may be summarised as follows:\n\n(a) Adult lice.\u2014After well lathering the head for about ten minutes the majority of the lice remain motionless and could be picked off the head and rubbed off on to the towel with fair ease. When placed upon filter paper and in a glass cell they appeared to be active. However, after two hours' incubation they became inactive and moved freely, in all cases making their way into the lower compartment. The notable exception here was in the case of three experiments with live lice, all were found dead on the following day, after about sixteen to twenty hours' incubation at 90\u00b0 F. This is remarkable, for the ordinary adult is extraordinarily resistant to change, and if the application is not prolonged, I have found them to revive after a drop of chloroform has been placed upon them. This is very different in the case of the lice, to which chloroform causes instantaneous death. They also survived drops of a mixture of absolute alcohol and olive oil, of such strength as to cause immediate burning sensation to the tongue or lip. It would appear, therefore, that the treatment, although not immediately fatal, does have a lethal effect upon the adult louse, and that two or three applications would be sufficient to kill a head from life by these means. A difficulty which is often found in these cases is the presence of impetiginous crusts, against which the soap is powerless.\n\nAfter treating an exceptionally lousy head, the attendant complained of the large number of live lice on the towel with which the head had been rubbed. It is, therefore, worth while proceeding to take steps to kill the lice which have been detached, by boiling the towels which have been used or by pouring boiling water upon them.\n\n(b) The nit.\u2014I prepared a considerable number of slides of nits taken at 90\u00b0 F., taken immediately before and after treatment. In some embryos survive a single treatment was proved by the hatching out of embryos, but the evidence from the microscope goes to prove that no further hatched out, as judged by the unhatched shells, from the untreated hairs. In by far the majority of slides made from treated hairs, the shell was found adherent to the bottom of the test-tube in which they had been incubated was littered with freshly hatched lice. The appearance of the unhatched shell after treatment was not always distinctive. I was at first disposed to believe that an actual degeneration of the embryo had taken place. Similar experiences, however, I have sometimes found in slides from untreated nits. There certainly seemed to be a shrinkage in the embryo in treated cases, leaving a space between the shell and the body, probably due to shrivelling of the mouth. In going through a large number of slides, without ascertaining from the label whether they had been treated before or after treatment, I found that my judgment from the physical appearances of the embryo was very generally correct. The changes in the two cases are therefore, I think, distinctly marked and peculiar.\n\nIt would appear from the above experiments that the soap in question fulfils to a considerable extent the conditions laid down. It appears to have a lethal effect on the embryo in the nit in a large number of cases, but that more than one application would be necessary to destroy viable adult lice. It immobilises the louse, but does not immediately kill it. As all lice after treatment died within twenty-four hours, it is probable that if the method were repeated several times in succession I may add that bed-bugs immersed for one minute in an ordinary solution of the soap died immediately. It is, however, a method which is not applicable and has a danger attendant upon its use, such as that inherent in use of paraffin, for instance. Paraffin, however, has had a creeping tendency that, though efficacious, it is not altogether a satisfactory de-louser. Sassafras is expensive and requires prolonged contact. I have tried Xylool varnish, which is certainly lethal to the louse as to the bed-bug, but it is inflammable and cannot be placed in the hands of the ignorant. I do not think that the method is graceful, cheap, and efficacious in any real value so far as the head is concerned. I made some experiments by adding a small quantity of ortho-chlorobenzol, which possesses a powerful disinfecting power. This substance has been tried by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Bulletin 888, 1\u201315, 1920) and has been found to be effective. When applied it is an invaluable for chicken lice and dog fleas. It is also one of the ingredients of the preparation now being used to destroy the bed-bug by grinding the root of West Indian Hall. Unfortunately, however, it delathered the soap solution in some obscure way, possibly by producing carbonic acid in the surface tension. It appears, moreover, to have an untoward action on the skin of the hands somewhat similar to that produced by carbolic acid.\nJanuary 31st, 1930\n\nThe Minster\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department of the Interior, U.S. Indian Service, Washington, D.C., have considerable trouble with the heads of the children in the Indian schools and after exhaustive experiments Miss Nina Groves, Supervisor of Home Economics, has found that the Derbac Health Shampoo and Special Comb are the most effective cure and prevention of pediculosis.\n\nBoth shampoo and comb are, therefore, supplied regularly to the Indian Schools and Reservations throughout the States and it occurs to us that you might be interested in trying them out.

A. Acland, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, 1829.\nNorway House, Man., May 20, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would suggest that the Indian children of the various residential and day schools be examined at least yearly. The pupils of the Residential schools are examined on admission only at the present time. Many of them remain for years and some of them get broken down in health in the schools. A yearly check up on them would enable one to weed out those likely to break down. This same examination could also be applied to the pupils in the day schools. The pupils of the public schools of British Columbia are provided with cards on which the Medical Officer records the results of his examinations and which are used annually until they leave school. I feel that if this system of examinations were instituted the results would be less sickness in the various schools.\n\nW. N. Turpel, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 11th, 1930.\n\nMr. Ferr\n\nKindly inform me who has performed the dental work at Norway House, his place of residence and how he has been paid. Also give me the names of any Vancouver dentists who have been doing dental work, and the method of payment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa\nSeptember 11, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT\n\nWith reference to your memorandum, I have to inform you that Dr. J. A. Bleakley, 506 Boyd Building, Winnipeg, performed dental services for the pupils at the Norway House Indian Residential School in 1929. All he did was filling, at 50\u00a2 per filling. Extractions at Norway House are shared for by the medical officer. I understand Dr. Bleakley was holidaying at Norway House for a few days and did this work on the side. In 1925 and 1926, a Dr. D. A. Anderson, dentist at 507 Boyd Building, Winnipeg, visited Norway House and he performed the work that was necessary at the Indian School. His services cost the Department nothing, other than accommodation for himself, wife and son at our hospital, free of charge. He spent one week in the hospital in 1925 and two weeks in 1926.\n\nThe undermentioned Vancouver dentists have been engaged at Indian Residential Schools:\n\nDr. F. E. King, 301 Birks Building,\nDr. A. R. Baker, 407 Hastings St. West.\n\nThe terms of engagement in each case were 25\u00a2 per extraction and $1.00 per amalgam filling; other work not authorized; in the case of temporary teeth, extractions only allowed. The work was performed at the individual school and all material, material, equipment and transportation supplied by the dentists.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 16, 1930.\n\nTo Teachers of Indian Day Schools:\n\nThis will introduce Miss Beatrice Cousins, R. N., Travelling Nurse on the staff of the Department of Indian Affairs. I know that you will welcome her to your school and give her every facility for inspecting the children. Of course, you will also follow any instructions that would have to do with the health of the children.\n\nThe Department will be grateful for any courtesies that you can show Miss Cousins when she is on duty.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear [Student],\n\nThe school year is on its way, and one of the \"head\" problems is one you will face early in the term.

In the event of emergency purchase of drugs, you may deal with either A. W. Smiley, 116 Market St., or H. M. Lee, 103 Dalhousie St. Of course, your regular supply of medicines, etc., should be the subject of requisitions to the Department.\n\nI also wish to make a new arrangement for dental services for pupils of the Mohawk Institute. At your convenience, will you please interview Dr. F. W. Landymore, 70 Eagle Ave., and explain the nature of the services required. When there are a number of children who should visit the dentist, the Department expects special rates. In the case of other schools, we allow $1.50 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 for each extraction when considerable work is necessary. Of course, in emergencies, when you take but one pupil to the dentist, we are prepared to pay $1.50 for fillings and 50\u00a2 for extractions. Dental services other than extractions and fillings are not authorized, except in special cases, which should be brought to the Department's attention. In the case of temporary teeth, extractions only are allowed. After you have seen Dr. Landymore, you might report to the Department, indicating if he is willing to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W.

The Officer in charge of the Stores states that the greatest care is taken in assembling, checking and packing these goods, and that all containers are properly sealed or strapped.\n\nIn reporting any such shortages in future kindly observe the following:\n\n1. State the number of packages or boxes received and whether that number agrees with the freight bill.\n\n2. State whether such packages were received and signed for in good condition. If not describe any breakages.\n\n3. State whether all such packages were carefully unpacked and the contents checked against the delivery slip enclosed with the shipment.\n\nPersons receiving goods by freight should never sign the freight bill without first carefully inspecting the shipment and counting the number of packages to see that the whole shipment has been received. Any packages found to be broken or leaking should be so marked on the freight bill, and report made at once to the Department. In unpacking supplies particular care should be taken to sift the packing material, as small articles may easily be overlooked. No cases or packing material should be discarded until the whole shipment has been checked with the delivery slip.\n\nThis is an important matter, and your co-operation is earnestly requested.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\nOttawa, November 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that in future when dental attention is required by the pupils at the Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora Indian Residential Schools the work should be offered to Dr. J. A. Dean, Dentist, Kenora.\n\nThe Department's practice is to allow only necessary extractions and inexpensive fillings. In the case of temporary teeth, only extractions can be permitted. The fees, where there are several children requiring attention, are $1 per amalgam filling and 25 cents per extraction. When local anesthesia is necessary when extracting, $1 is allowed for the first tooth in each case of such patient and 25 cents for each additional tooth. Please see Dr. Dean at your convenience and, if he accepts the Department's proposal, you may arrange to have him perform the dental work recommended by the medical officer of the schools as being really necessary for the health of the pupils at each of the two above named schools.\n\nAccounts should be in duplicate and should show the name of each pupil and the number of fillings and extractions. The accounts should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nAfter consulting Dr. Dean, you should advise the Department as to whether he accepts the above offer.\n\nYou will, no doubt, have a copy of the list giving the names of the pupils requiring dental examination and treatment at each of the above schools, as prepared by Miss Olive Ings, Travelling Nurse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that when the services of an optician are required in future for the pupils at the Kenora and Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential Schools, Dr. O. C. Snyder, of Fort William, may be engaged, and you may arrange with him to perform the work recommended by the medical officer of each school as being really necessary for the health of the pupils. It is not intended that an expensive type of glasses be furnished. It is considered that spectacles of an inexpensive type of frame, with flat lenses, would be satisfactory. You should take this matter up with Dr. Snyder at your convenience and inform the Department as to whether he will carry out the work or not. We understand that he also has an office in Kenora.\n\nHis account should be in duplicate and should show the name of each pupil examined and the cost of examination and glasses supplied. These accounts should cover the cost of the work at each school separately and should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYou will, no doubt, have a copy of the list prepared by Miss Olive Ings, Travelling Nurse, giving the names of the pupils at each school whom she recommends have their eyes examined and the necessary glasses supplied.

They will not be stamped unless you desire them stamped: \"Made in Canada\".\n\nThis is a first class brush and will give excellent satisfaction. We do not put these brushes up in cartons, but simply in small, individual envelopes. We have supplied considerable quantities of tooth brushes to the Department of Justice for use in the prisons, the purchasing agent being Mr. Dillon.\n\nWe are also sending you a couple of tooth brushes for your own use which we would like to have you try. We are assuming that you like a hard bristled brush, but if you find these stiffer than you desire, we would be glad to exchange them.\n\nI have not forgotten our conversation with reference to a container or some sort for the brushes in the schools and within a few days, I will submit to you an article\nThe following table shows the dental work that has been done in the residential schools in British Columbia:\n\n| School          | Year | Dental Work |\n|-----------------|------|-------------|\n| St. George's    | 1923 | Baker       |\n| Cariboo         |      | Baker       |\n| Fraser Lake     |      | Baker       |\n| Ahousaht        |      | Baker       |\n| Alberni         |      | Baker       |\n| Christie        |      | Baker       |\n| St. Mary's      |      | Baker       |\n| Sechelt         |      | Baker       |\n| Kuper Island    |      | Baker       |\n| Alert Bay       |      | Baker       |\n| Ocqualeetza     |      | Baker       |\n| Squamish        |      | Baker       |\n| Kootenay        |      | Baker       |\n| Kanaloop        |      | Baker       |\n| Kitamaat        |      | Baker       |\n| Pt.

S. G. I. A.\nApril 11, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 18th instant, concerning the need at Indian residential schools of the services of a dentist located at Vancouver, B.C., I have to inform you that the undermentioned schools are in the southwestern part of the province and, in each case, a Vancouver dentist would be more or less suitable. I find that, in the past dentists from Vancouver, among others, have been engaged for these schools. I am showing, in parenthesis, after each school, the federal district in which it is located, and I am indicating whether or not the services of a dentist will be required in the near future.\n\nSt. George's, at Lytton. (Cariboo) Already assigned by Minister's office.\n\nSt. Mary's, at Mission (Fraser Valley) do\n\nCoqualeetza, at Sardis (do) do\n\nAhousaht, at Ahousaht (Comox-Alberni) Dentist not required this year.\n\nAlberni, at Alberni (do) do\n\nChristie, at Kakwits (do) do\n\nAlert Bay, at Alert Bay (Vancouver Nor.) do\n\nSechelt, at Sechelt (do) Dentist may be required.\n\nSquamish, at North Vancouver (do) Dentist now required.\n\nKuper Island, at Chemainus (Nanaimo) Dentist may be required.\n\nThe only immediate need is in the case of the Squamish Indian Residential School, at North Vancouver, in the Federal District of Vancouver North. Later in the year it is possible that the Department will receive requests from the Sechelt and Kuper Island Indian Residential Schools, and if we do not establish our own dental clinic in British Columbia, these requests should be satisfied, as it is now some years since a dentist visited the two schools mentioned.\n\nRussell T. Herries\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMay 16, 1931.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRoom 501, Booth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our conversation when the writer was in your office I am sending you by mail, under separate cover, sample each of two-row and three-row medium tooth brushes and will undertake to furnish the two-row brush at $19.80 per gross and the three-row brush at $21.60 per gross, plus tax, delivered to Ottawa in quantities sufficient for freight shipment.\n\nAs stated to you, the two-row brush is the one which we invariably supply for the use of school children and apparently it has been giving satisfaction, as we have furnished them for several years to the same people.\n\nYou will notice that these brushes are stamped \"Hutax\" and in explanation of this, I may say that the Hutax people are going into the colored handles and we have a number of these in stock, so while they last, we will furnish them at the same price as unstamped brushes. There is no stamping figured in the cost at the prices which we have made you.\n\nWe trust that we may be favored with your order and can give same immediate attention. Thanking you in anticipation, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.H.S.: BH\nA.M.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. L. Harvey\nOttawa, May 18, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, addressed to Mr. Ferrier of this Department, quoting your price for the supplying of tooth brushes in gross lots, and submitting samples of your two-row and three-row medium brushes. Your quotation for the supplying of the two-row brush at $19.50 per gross, plus tax, F.O.B. Ottawa, is accepted. I have, therefore, to request that you will ship by freight, addressed as follows:\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRoom 503 - Booth Building,\nSparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nfifteen (15) gross of your two-row medium tooth brushes.\n\nPlease forward your account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the brushes and, when these goods are received as per sample, payment of the account will be made.\n\nIt is noted that the brushes you will furnish are stamped \"Nutax\" insofar as your stock of these brushes will last. If you have not sufficient of these stamped brushes on hand, you may supply the balance in unstamped brushes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nH. H.

In addition I may say that it is an \"established practice to submit such accounts to the Treasury Board for approval\" after being taxed by the Health Department.\n\nA precedent in your department would be the case of R.

In some instances, departments have had these accounts taxed by the Department of Health, and in others this has not been done.\n\nThe Treasury Board are of opinion that it is advisable to have all such accounts taxed. They direct accordingly, that all accounts for medical and hospital expenses be submitted to the Department of Health to be taxed by officials of that department before payment is authorized.\n\n(Signed) Watson Sellar\n\nActing Secretary.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJanuary 12, 1932.\n\nDr. Smith,\n\nThe Minister would like you to furnish him with a list of the Indian Schools in Manitoba and Eastern Saskatchewan, together with a statement showing the number of children in each school, and whether dental work is required at any of them.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nSchool, address,\n\nNote method of pay schools.\nJanuary 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Has been performed by Dr. R. W. Clements, of Semans. (your memo of May 2, 1931.)\n\nEnclosed, will be found memoranda regarding dentists for the Brandon and St. Philips Indian Residential Schools. At four other schools - Fort Alexander, Sandy Bay, Elkhorn and Muscowequan - although there has been no request for dental attention, it is probable considerable good would result if a dentist visited the school. As funds for this purpose are extremely limited, I cannot recommend any work at these four schools unless conditions arise which impose expenditure. It might be stated that, at all Indian residential schools, the medical officer or the school nurse performs simple extractions.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nStevens-Hepner Company, Limited\n\nManufacturers of\nBRUSHES, MIRRORS,\nBROOMS AND WHISKS,\nHIGH CLASS FRENCH IVORY\nAND EBONY GOODS\n\nTrade Keystone Mark\n\nCarl Adolph Stevens\nA.B.C.

In every province of the Dominion, reserves have been set aside for the benefit of the Indians, the Department of Indian Affairs maintains a health service whereby not only bodily ills are attended to but the Indians are trained in personal hygiene and otherwise grounded in the fundamentals of preventive medicine.\n\nThe health service of the Department of Indian Affairs is carried out for the most part by local physicians and hospitals. About 325 such physicians are employed on part-time salaries or on the new system to attend bands of Indians living in their neighbourhoods. The number of local hospitals utilized in this manner is about 200.\n\nThe permanent full-time health service of the Department is carried out by 16 Medical Superintendents, 10 Field Nurses and 7 Hospitals, located as follows:\n\nDoctors (Full-time Physicians)\n- Quebec: Bersimis, Seven Islands, and Caughnawaga.\n- Ontario: Six Nations Reserve (2).\n- Manitoba: Nipigon.\n- Saskatchewan: File Hills and Qu'Appelle Agencies combined, and at the Battleford Agency.\n- Alberta: Blackfoot Reserve, Sarcee Reserve, and at Chipewyan.\n- Northwest Territories: Resolution, and Simpson.\n\nField Nurses\nOne field nurse is assigned to each of the following provinces:\u2014Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan.\n\nTravelling Nurses\nPrairie Provinces (2); British Columbia (1); Northwest Territories (1).\n\nDepartmental Hospitals\n- Ontario: Lady Willington Hospital, Six Nations Reserve, Brantford, 20 beds.\n- Manitoba: Norway House Hospital, 20 beds.\n- Saskatchewan: File Hills Hospital, 25 beds; Qu'Appelle Hospital, 30 beds; Blood Hospital, 40 beds; Sarcee Hospital, 20 beds; Regina General, 8 beds.\n\nThe nursing staff of these hospitals numbers 21 graduate nurses. The Indians' fear of and prejudice against medical treatment have been almost wholly overcome and the hospital facilities are used at all times.\n\nIn addition to providing the services outlined above, the Department co-operates with Church missionary organizations, in the operation of hospitals and with the Provincial Governments, and the Victorian Order of Nurses in the maintenance of district nurses in many places.\nStevens-Hepner Company, Limited\nManufacturers of Brushes, Brooms and Whisks.\nPort Elgin, Ontario\n\nSold to The Department of Indian Affairs,\nRoom 503, Booth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMarch 11th, 1932.\n\nTerms - Net 30 days\nOrder No.: March 1/32\nSalesman:\nVia Freight Prepaid\n\n| Gross 2 Row Medium Tooth Brushes | 18.75 | 261.25 |\n|---------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Sales Tax 4\u00a2                    |       | 11.25  |\n| 1 Case 110#                     |       | 292.50 |\n\nCertified correct, furnished charges fair and just.\n\n[Signature]\nH.

Further copies on request.\n\nThe department's estimates for the fiscal year 1932-33 have been greatly reduced, and it will be necessary to take measures to curtail expenditure for medical and hospital attendance during that year. Until further directed kindly be guided by the following instructions, which have been prepared with care, and which will repay careful study.\n\n1. Epidemic Diseases\n\nSpecial attention must be paid to reporting of outbreaks, quarantine of infected families, disinfection and all other measures specified in the regulations for the prevention of epidemics. Attention is directed to Circular 93-I of June 12, 1928, which, briefly summarized, states that the Indian agent is responsible to the department for these matters, acting under the advice of the departmental doctor. The regulations to be used are those of the province in which the reserve is situated.\n\nVaccination against smallpox is to be carried on as directed in Circular 93-IB, which gives complete directions in this connection. Special importance is attached to the prompt and complete vaccination of any band of Indians among whom or near whom smallpox appears.\n\nLarge scale immunization against diphtheria or scarlet fever by the use of toxoid or equivalent preparations is not to be undertaken without authority from the department, except in places where the majority of Indian children are already immunized. The use of antitoxin for the protection of actual contacts is, however, strongly recommended, subject to the advice of the doctor in charge.\n\n2. Tuberculosis\n\nIt will not be possible at present to authorize admission of patients suffering from tuberculosis to sanatorium or hospital unless such patients require hospital care for relief of actual suffering; that is to say, tuberculosis in itself is not to be considered as a cause for admission to hospital or sanatorium. Special consideration may be given to patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, where prompt treatment may prevent the formation of deformities if immediate action is taken.\n\nAs a general rule, chronic cases of tuberculous adenitis (serofulsa) are to be cared for at home.\n\nThe cost of special food for tuberculous Indians at home is borne from the medical appropriation. In recommending such cases the Indian agent must satisfy himself not only that they are required, but that the patient will himself get the benefit of them.\n3. Trachoma\nThis affects only certain parts of the country. The directions contained in the Circular of Instructions on Trachoma, dated October 1, 1931, must be carefully followed.\n\n4. Venereal Disease\nStanding instructions on the treatment of syphilis will continue in force. The fees allowed will be as follows; and are not subject to the 10 per cent reduction provided for in section 8:\n\n- Administration of neosalvarsan or equivalent ........ $5.00\n  Note.\u2014This drug will be supplied by the department on demand. Local purchase is not authorized. If doctors purchase locally, the department will neither reimburse them nor pay the account.\n\n- Administration of mercury bismuth, etc. ............. 3.00\n  Note.\u2014This fee must include the supply of the drug.\n\n- Taking of blood for Wassermann or similar test ...... 2.00\n\nIt should very rarely be necessary to keep a patient in hospital for ordinary treatment for syphilis.\n\nProvincial clinics should be made use of whenever available.\n\n5. Dental\nDental attention must be limited to measures for the relief of suffering. No repair work or supply of artificial teeth is authorized at present.\n\n6. Correction of Defects\u2014Day School Pupils\nDuring the present school term it will be impossible to authorize operations for correction of pupils' bad dental work for pupils of day schools. An inspection of the pupils should be made as soon as the schools reopen in September, and recommendations submitted. If funds are then available, the department will endeavour to proceed with some of this work.\n\n7. Hospital Treatment\nIt will be necessary to reduce hospital expenses by at least 20 per cent. The standing instructions on admissions to hospitals (50-1) are adequate and suitable, but the department considers that Indian patients in any places are admitted to hospital for trivial complaints, and kept in hospital longer than would be the case if they were either paying their own accounts or were indigent members of a white community. In the last analysis, the doctor's orders must be obeyed, but the agent should exercise careful supervision both of admissions and duration of stay in hospital.\n\nThe daily rate for the attendance of patients in the public ward of any hospital shall not exceed $2.50 per day, including such charges as those for the operating-room, X-ray, ordinary medicines, dressings, etc. The rate for a new-born child shall not exceed $1 per day. Only in the most exceptional circumstances should agents authorize the admission of a patient to hospital in connection with a sick child, and the rate charged for such a patient shall not exceed $1 per day.\n\nThe rates now paid to the following hospitals will remain in effect:\n- Sacred Heart Hospital, Caughnawaga, Que.; Dynevor Hospital, Selkirk, Man.; the hospitals at Fort Smith, Fort Simpson, and Aklavik in the Northwest Territories; the hospitals in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency; the hospital at Fort Albany.\nrates paid to the Lady Minto Hospitals at Cochrane and Chapleau shall be $2.25 per day.\n\nThe rates paid to hospitals located in the Williams Lake, Stuart Lake, Babine, Skeena, and Great Charlotte Agencies shall be $3.75 per day for acutely sick patients and $1.50 per day for those classed as chronic. The classification of each patient must be decided monthly by the Indian agent and the doctor.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances there is no object in agents telegraphing to the department for authority to admit patients to hospital. Circular 90-1 gives directions for action under such circumstances, and orders that instructions should be obtained when it is proposed to send a patient out of his district to a hospital in a distant city, and in cases where the agent is at all in doubt. Henceforth the department will require a doctor's certificate for every patient admitted to hospital. The form for this certificate is laid down in Circular 90-1. It should be furnished by the doctor, signed by him, the date of admission noted, and forwarded immediately to the department, with the date of admission noted on the face, and a brief statement as to the agent's knowledge of the circumstances.\n\nSpecial nurses may only be engaged under the most exceptional circumstances. The maximum rate allowed is $5 per hour, and the department will not pay any amount of accounts for special nurses' services unless the nurse has been engaged by permission of the Indian agent, on the written recommendation of the doctor, who must certify to the absolute necessity of the service.\n\n8. Doctors' Fees\n\nPhysicians on salary, like other civil servants, will be subject to a reduction in salary of 10 per cent. Doctors on the call, or account system may make up their accounts as usual, and reduce the total by 10 per cent. In many cases, however, a doctor will find attending Indians so burdensome that he cannot attend to his own practice. In such cases, the doctor may request the Indian agent to allow him an extra fee for his services. This can be controlled in a great degree by the doctors themselves, and the department is under the necessity of asking for their constant co-operation in this connection.\n\nIn places where the Indian agent, farming instructor, field matron, or other officer is accustomed to receive calls for doctor's services, this system is to be continued.\n\nThe department, in some cases, may find it necessary to impose a limit on expenditure for the services of individual doctors.\n\nPayments will only be made on the written recommendation of the Reserve doctor. The regulations for admission of patients to hospital are applicable in this connection, but the Indian agent should request the authority of the department unless the case is urgent.\n\nIn many places doctors on salary have been accustomed to present accounts for treatment of Indians who do not belong to the bands which they are engaged to attend, and for surgical operations, and special treatments of various kinds. All such arrangements, whether now authorized or not, must be discontinued, subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) Doctors who have facilities for performing major operations may address the department, through the Indian agent, and request special consideration in this respect.\n\n(b) Doctors will be allowed extra fees for vaccination against smallpox, inoculation against typhoid fever, diphtheria, etc., and, if agreed upon in advance, for treatment of syphilis. The department wishes to encourage treatment of this kind.\n\n(c) If any doctor considers himself to be under an undue burden by reason of calls on his services for visiting or transient Indians, he may address the department, through the Indian agent, and request special consideration.\nReports and accounts of doctors must be rendered promptly at the end of each month. Neglect in this matter may, in extreme circumstances, expose the doctor to the risk of not receiving payment.\n\n9. Drugs\n\nThere has been a commendable reduction in the quantity of drugs used during the past fiscal year, and in many places the situation in this respect is quite satisfactory. In others, however, the department considers that great reductions might be accomplished without injury to anyone. The instructions on the first page of Drug List No. 3 are clear and specific, and must be followed in detail. To these is added the following:\n\n(a) Alcoholic liquors will not be supplied under any circumstances whatever, nor will they be paid for if purchased locally.\n\n(b) Requisitions must be reviewed, revised if necessary, and certified by the doctor in charge of the Reserve or Residential School. If they do not bear evidence of this close scrutiny, they will be revised at Ottawa by an officer who has no opportunity of knowing local conditions, and who will be guided largely by the per capita expenditure for this purpose.\n\n(c) The use of cod liver oil is to be encouraged as hitherto instructed.\n\n(d) The indiscriminate issue and use of castor oil, kidney pills, potassium chlorate tablets and many other items in the drug list is to be avoided. No drugs are to be given to Indians to take away unless it is certain that they will be taken, and that they will be needed.\n\n(e) The privilege of local purchase of drugs is being abused in some places, in regard to kind and amount of drugs ordered, and also in regard to prices charged. Where such abuses are observed, the department will be compelled to abolish local purchase and furnish drugs from a central Government store at Ottawa.\n\n10. General\n\nNothing in these instructions is to be taken as indicating that preventable suffering is to be allowed for want of funds. The appropriation for medical attendance, while greatly decreased, is sufficient to provide for actual necessities. If all officers will co-operate in preventing waste in doctors' calls, hospital attendance and drugs, no Indian need want for really necessary attendance.\n\nWhile these instructions are applicable in a general way to all reserves and depots, special provisions will now be taken after they apply to medical superintendents and departmental hospitals. Further directions will be issued to these officers and institutions by the Director of Medical Services.\n\nThese instructions will take effect on April 1, 1932.\n\nA. F.

H. Paget, who has retired from the Service, quoting a price for supplying tooth brushes.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we still have a considerable stock of tooth brushes on hand which were supplied by your firm last year and, while thanking you for the quotation, the Department does not require any tooth brushes at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nStevens-Hepner Company, Limited,\nPort Elgin,\nOnt.\nNovember 27th, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. MCGILL\n\nWe have received the report of the survey of the Residential Schools in Saskatchewan, carried out by the Anti-Tuberculosis League of that Province.\n\nBriefly stated that report is as follows:\n\n1091 pupils were examined in 10 Residential Schools and one day school.\n\nOf these, twenty-two children have open pulmonary tuberculosis, and are considered active spreaders of the disease. Of these 22, twelve are candidates for sanatorium, owing to the advanced nature of their disease. Ten might be provided for in a school specially set aside for this purpose.\n\nA further thirty-three children have small or incipient tuberculous defects in their lungs. These may be classed as \"early\" cases and as potential or occasional spreaders.\n\nAnother group of eighty-five have old chronic tuberculosis. Of these sixty-four are not considered dangerous, but should be kept under observation in the schools where they now are. The remaining twenty-one are potential spreaders, and require segregation in a special school.\nA final group of 17 are considered healed cases but should have occasional examination.\n\nThere are therefore:\n\nTwelve cases for sanatorium.\nSixty-four for special school.\nEight-one for observation in their present situation, who will require more or less special treatment and food.\n\nOf the 12 cases for sanatorium it may be expected that the parents of some, when they know the facts, will require their return home. If this accounts for, say 5, the remaining 7 will call for an expenditure of about $6,000.00 during the next year for their maintenance in sanatorium.\n\nThe sixty-four for special school accommodation present a more difficult problem. You will recall that on Dr. Ferguson's last visit here, he suggested that one Roman Catholic and one Protestant school be set apart in the Province for accommodation of pupils with milder tubercular defects who do not require sanatorium care, and who might be managed in a school provided with some special equipment and staff.\n\nIt would be necessary, therefore, to select two schools, one of each religious denomination, and to provide in the one accommodation for 17 boys and 28 girls, and in the other for 8 boys and 11 girls.\n\nI do not suppose that any additional space would be required. There are probably two schools which have the necessary dormitory and other accommodation available. It would, however, be necessary to clear out of them a corresponding number of well pupils, by transfer to other schools, or other means.\nSome additional equipment and staff would certainly be required for the two special schools, and they should be located in a place where fairly expert Tuberculosis supervision is available not too far off, and a good medical adviser close at hand.\n\nThe two schools in the area of Qu'Appelle Health Unit - Lebret and File Hills, immediately suggest themselves for this purpose. The rebuilding of Lebret furnishes an opportunity for any slight structural changes necessary to the purpose. File Hills is under excellent management and both have the best medical service and the best position for expert supervision of any schools in the Province. They are also centrally located.\n\nI should suppose that the cost of this program would be somewhat as follows:\n\nMaintenance of say 7 children in sanatorium... $6,000.\nA nurse-teacher for each special school...... $2,400.\nExtra food for 64 children at 10 cents per day each = $6,400................. $2,356.\nIncidentals - equipment, etc....say........... $1,264.\n\nExpenses of annual survey of schools estimated by the Anti-Tuberculosis League at $2,000.\n\n$14,000.\n\nSome years ago I formulated a plan for the discovery and segregation of Indian consumptives. While this plan proposed by Dr. Ferguson does not go as far as I should like to go, in that it does not touch the mass of infection remaining on the Reserves, nor provide for any supervision after school age, I give it my unqualified approval as the purpose for which it is designed. It provides a means whereby the Residential school may be made tuberculosis free, and whereby the children selected from them may be given a good chance of recovery.\nI do not need to say that Dr. Ferguson is regarded as a leader in his field, nor that the Department is under continued pressure to bring its tuberculosis program into line with that of the Provinces. In the Province of Saskatchewan, last year, the Indian death rate from tuberculosis was 20 times that of the white population from the same cause. One quarter of the tuberculosis deaths in the Province occurred among Indians, who number 2% of the population.\n\nThe appropriation for medical services will not bear the additional expense of this program, and there is no provision for it in next year's estimates. All tuberculosis work is at a standstill for lack of funds, and there are eight other Provinces to be considered. I cannot think that a moderate appropriation for tuberculosis and trachoma work among Indians would add very substantially to the financial burden of this country.\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\n\nMP.\nFebruary 7th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Murison,\n\nIn my letter to you of January 19th I tried to set out the situation as regards the survey of the Residential Schools in Saskatchewan by the clinic of the Anti-Tuberculosis League. You will recall that no very specific directions were given as to the disposal of the pupils who have active tuberculosis and should be removed from the schools at once. The reason for this was that it was desired to have a further report as to the standing of the appropriation for medical services. The financial statement at the end of January is reasonably satisfactory and I am now pleased to be able to direct you to secure the removal of these pupils at as early a date as can be arranged.\n\nWhile several of the Indian Agents have reported the names of the pupils in their schools who should be removed, the Department has not a complete list of the names and the schools to which they belong. Doctor Ferguson undoubtedly has this information and it is advised that you communicate with him and Doctor Simes. Find out where these pupils are and issue instructions for their removal. You may quote authority of the Department in this connection.\n\nUnless the parents of these consumptive children make a decided demand for their return home they should be transferred to the nearer or more convenient sanatorium, whether at Fort Qu'Appelle or Prince Albert. The pupils will be discharged from school and their maintenance in sanatorium will become an obligation of the Vote for\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nmedical attendance. As from the date of these pupils' removal from the schools they will be discharged as Grant earning pupils.\n\nI should appreciate your report on the completion of this duty.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarold W.

Please be advised, therefore, that the use of iodine or any of its preparations taken internally is neither authorized nor sanctioned unless specifically prescribed in writing by a qualified physician for the individual patient to whom it is to be given.\n\nNo lay person is authorized or permitted, under the terms of this instruction, to administer iodine to any Indian by mouth unless, as provided above, the medical officer has given an order in writing to the effect that iodine is to be so used and has specified in his order the exact dose to be given.\n\nAll persons who receive this instruction are requested to acknowledge its receipt to the Department at Ottawa. Indian Agents will please distribute it to every person in their agencies who have any Indians under their charge.\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nE. L. Stone, M. B.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\nJanuary 26th, 1935.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL:\n\nAt a discussion between Mr. Sutherland and myself, at which Mr. Donnelly, of the Department of Finance, was present, it was agreed to recommend to your consideration that:\n\n1. As from April 1st, 1935, I take over the medical and health supervision of pupils of Indian Residential Schools, with funds voted for the fiscal year 1935-36 in the appropriation for Indian Education, these funds to be transferred to the Medical appropriation. Mr. Donnelly says that there is no apparent difficulty as to the transfer of funds, with your approval. The money provided appears to be sufficient for the purpose.\n\n2. In making up the estimates for 1936-37, these funds be provided in the Medical Appropriation.\n\nNo increase or decrease in departmental cost is involved. A fair amount of clerical work will be saved, and frequent doubt removed as to which appropriation should bear an individual expense.\n\nE. L.

At the present time the system of follow-up in connection with these cases is very haphazard ones and even in cases of pulmonary tuberculosis frequently no steps are taken to insure that even an attempt at isolation on the Reserve will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L. McQuarrie, M.D.\nAssistant Superintendent of Medical Services for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\nMay 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn Doctor McQuarrie's letter 400-7-0 of April 14 he asks that the Department direct that when a pupil of a Residential School is discharged on the account of ill health the school Principal be instructed to inform the Indian Agent so that appropriate measures may be taken for his care at home. This is particularly important when the child is discharged on account of Tuberculosis or other communicable condition. It might be supposed that a Principal of a Residential School would do this as a matter of course but possibly he often would overlook it. In any case it is well within your authority to issue such an instruction in British Columbia and it would be a little convenience to the Department if you would do so. When next a general instruction is being prepared for Indian Residential Schools this will be included.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nMajor D. M.

Discussions of public health problems should be encouraged, and certain definite periods should be set aside weekly for health study, when simple health talks would be given.

Moore, M.D.,\nAss't. Sup't. of Medical Services.\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. STONE:\n\nA delegation representing the Anglican, Roman Catholic, United and Presbyterian Churches interviewed the Minister on November 21, last, with respect to the restoration of the 5% deduction in payment of per capita grants to residential schools. The Minister of Justice and the Minister of Labour were associated with the Minister in this interview.\n\nI may state that immediately following the presentation of their case on the restoration of per capita grants, a memorandum was submitted to the Minister by the delegation, in which the Churches deal with educational policy and the health and general welfare of the Indian population. The following excerpt, for your information, is taken from this memorandum:\n\n\"SOME URGENT NEEDS. Of the more urgent needs for pupils in either the Day or Residential class of School, one of the most pressing is that of regular visits from dental clinics. The following extract from the report of a dentist after visiting certain schools furnishes strong evidence of this need:\n\n\"Upon first examination of scholars in these schools deplorable oral conditions were found, temporary and permanent teeth with crowns broken down and gone, abscessed roots, gingivitis, great deposits of tartar and teeth that had never been brushed. One thing was noticeable and that was that the children coming from beyond the civilized area seemed to have less carious teeth than did their cousins who were living on the borderland or in civilized areas. One would infer from this that the cruder diet of those removed from stores and civilization had a bearing on the teeth.\n\n\"Children in these schools range in age from five to sixteen or seventeen (the Government sets an age limit which I think, is sixteen) boys seem to predominate in numbers. There is a great prevelency of tuberculosis amongst the Indians and in all likelihood this was a distinct factor in tooth decay. Many of the worst cases were amongst the juniors; oral hygiene was unknown to all; temporary teeth that had not exfoliated were left to misguide or impact incoming permanents; mastication in many cases was an improbability as much pain would ensue upon the least pressure. Altogether it would be almost impossible to visualize conditions more neglected and deplorable.\n\n\"Bearing instructions from the authorities at Ottawa that no temporary teeth were to be filled, no filling materials to be used but cement and amalgam and that no prophylaxis would be paid for, I commenced work. My first visit lasted for one day, and what a day it was!\n\nI found -\nI found no scholar who escaped the forceps and after ten hours of almost continuous work over three hundred teeth had found a resting place in our improvised canteen. Three weeks later I again visited this school and spent the best part of three days filling the teeth and giving the needed prophylactic work (for which I received no remuneration). I felt that it would be impossible to instill into the minds of the youngsters the need for brushing their teeth if they were not started on the right road, so therefore, gave them a cleaning up. Instructions were given to the staff to assist in the follow-up work by insisting on toothbrush drill and from subsequent visits one would judge that this was done.....\n\n\"The Principals and staffs of the schools visited were loud in their praise of effects gained. Absence from classes on account of pulpititis, etc., had decreased from several cases daily to nil. The children were able to eat and enjoy their meals and were, in many instances, putting on weight. They were more attentive in the classroom and better results were being attained generally.\"\n\nThe Minister, in replying to these representations in a letter dated December 12, 1938, states in part:\n\n\"The suggestion you make that greater provision should be made for dental work at our schools is one that will be brought immediately to the attention of the Superintendent of Medical Services.\"\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that I should welcome an opportunity to discuss this matter with you and with Mr. Phelan any time at your convenience.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKAMLOOPS BC 19 JAN 1939\n\nDR E L STONE\n\nDIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nCASE OF UNDULANT FEVER DEVELOPED AT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL KAMLOOPS STOP\nDIAGNOSIS DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED BY AGGLUTINATION TESTS STOP DISEASE\nPROBABLY CONTRACTED THROUGH MILK SUPPLY FROM INFECTED HERD DOCTOR\nMCQUARRIE ALREADY MADE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING IMPROVEMENTS TO SAFE-\nGUARD SCHOOL MILK SUPPLY STOP ABOVE CASE INDICATES URGENT NEED OF\nTHESE MEANWHILE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN AT THE SCHOOL\nP & S TENANT.\n\nThis is a Collect message and will be charged to your account unless we are notified at once to the contrary.\nJanuary 20, 1939\n\nMemorandum: MR.

Pant Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n507 Calgary Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\nCalgary, August 28th, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received this date from Col. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, regarding the re-opening of Indian Schools. This letter is self-explanatory.\n\nI beg to ask for instructions from you, by radiogram please, as to what action, if any, you wish me to take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\n/B\nAIRMAL.\n\nAugust 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of August 28 with respect to communication from Indian Agent Lewis in connection with the epidemic of polio.\n\nAccording to my advice it is by no means established that polio is contracted from horses as suggested. It is not desired or considered necessary that horses should be destroyed. It will be in order for you, however, to carry out whatever measures are usually taken in similar circumstances under the directions of the authorities of the Province of Alberta, which presumably would be the isolation of any horses suspected of being affected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nC.P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report that due to an epidemic of Poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) and Encephalomyelitis (sleeping sickness) now prevalent in the Province of Alberta all public schools are to remain closed until September 15th, 1941.\n\nI have discussed the situation with Dr. A.C. McGugan, Provincial director of communicable diseases who informed me that our Indian Schools would come under this order. I then discussed it with Dr. J. H. Conroy, M.D., and he stated that it was his wish that the Edmonton and Youville schools remain closed until the public schools opened.\n\nActing upon the advice of both Doctor Conroy and Doctor McGugan I have informed the Principals of the Edmonton and Youville Residential Schools that the schools would not open until September 15th, 1941.\n\nTwo weeks ago Doctor Conroy asked me to issue instructions to the Indians not to allow their children under the age of 17 years to go to the City of Edmonton, these instructions were issued to the Indians.\n\nWhile discussing the situation with the Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School he stated that his school would have approximately $750.00 overhead expenses from August 29th when the school was to have opened and September 15th, and asked if the Department would assist in paying part of this expense; I informed Mr. Woodsworth that I could not answer that question but that I would mention it in my report to you.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

F. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received the following telegram from Mr. R.A.

Davison, Deputy Minister of Public Health for the Province, and he stated that they have informed all of the schools in the Province that in their opinion there is no need to keep the schools closed. Therefore both Residential and Day Schools may be kept open but visiting and mingling with the school children must be banned. I would particularly bring to your attention that part of Mr. Hoey's telegram which reads: \"Agents and Principals should be guided by instructions local Medical Health Officer\".\n\nIn view of the above be on the alert for any further developments. You will be advised from this office should any further orders be given by the Provincial Board of Health.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

These instructions appear to have been necessitated through the prevalence in many parts of Canada of the two serious diseases known as \"sleeping sickness\" and \"infantile paralysis\".\n\nAs all our School staffs had been brought up to full strength in readiness for opening the Schools on the 1st inst., and as many, probably most, of the pupils had returned from their holidays before the order was received, I sincerely trust that the per capita grant may be paid in full as from that date, whether the classroom work is being carried on or not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/KH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant it is not the Department's intention to penalize Indian residential schools due to the fact that some of them may not conduct classroom work in view of the epidemic. You may so inform the Principals of your schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hossy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

The services of our officers would be rendered free of charge and everything possible would be done to maintain the herd free from tuberculosis.\n\nIf you would advise me of the name of the party to whom I should write with regard to the school at Sault Ste Marie, I shall be glad to communicate with him, and upon receiving a signed agreement form from him will ask our officer to commence the test at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Geo.

The Department considers that such action is unnecessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A of the 18th instant, with reference to the replacement of a milch cow at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I have to inform you that it is the Department's practice to replace milch cows that are destroyed by order of the Veterinary General, and you may purchase for this school, when timely, one suitable animal. I note that the Principal is desirous of securing a dual purpose Shorthorn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 2, 1926.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIt is the Department's practice to replace milch cows at Indian residential schools when they are destroyed by order of the Veterinary General. Such destroyed animals are sometimes sold for beef. The question to be decided is whether the proceeds from the sale should be applied on the replacement of the animals or should be deposited to Casual Revenue.\n\nI consider that the school management has some general equity in the stock at these institutions and that the proceeds could quite properly be considered school moneys. I therefore recommend that they be held to be applied on replacement costs and not forwarded to Ottawa for deposit. This would relieve the Appropriation for Indian Education somewhat.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my No. 140754-3 of April 12th, last, concerning milk herds at Indian residential schools in British Columbia. Of the sixteen institutions, only two do not keep their own milk herds, viz., Port Simpson and Kitimat. All the others as shown on the enclosed list have their own milk herds, and in each case, with the exception of Alert Bay, practically from the commencement of the school. At Alert Bay, they have had their own herd for twelve years. The enclosure is in duplicate so that you can send one copy to Dr. H. W. Hill, Professor of Bacteriology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., with any comments you wish to make. I regret that the dates when tuberculin testing of these herds became operative are not always determined. I may add that the only schools that have any complete record of the animals that reacted are Coqualeetsa, Alberni and Kamloops.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention something that has been forcefully brought to my mind in the last few months in going around the different Agencies, and that is the question of where Indian Schools are situated on Reserves, to what extent should they be allowed to carry on farming operations. The same applies to the number of cattle and horses they should raise.\n\nI do not wish to convey to the Department the impression that I wish to make this an issue at the present time; The schools have received a 10% reduction in their grant, and for my part I do not wish to retard their efforts to make some extra money out of their farming operations, but I think we should give this matter some consideration. The farming, of course, can be limited to the area that has been set aside for the use of the school, but the number of cattle or horses owned by the schools may become an issue. The places I have in mind are the Pelicans and the Bloods. Both schools are greatly increasing their cattle herds, and the time may come when the Department may have to set a limit on the size of the herd each school should raise on the reserve.\n\nNow, as I have mentioned before, I do not want this to become an issue at the present time, but I am merely bringing it to the attention of the Department so that if anything comes up, the Department will fully understand the situation. My reports will show the number of cattle each school owns, and after getting the 10% reduction in grant, there is no doubt that they need the revenue from the cattle they are raising at the present time, to help finance their institutions.\n\nI trust the Department will see my point of view in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nLEBRET SASK INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nAugust 25th 1937\n\nRev. Father Plourde O.M.I\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear and Reverend Father,\n\nI have to bring to your knowledge that our crops were a complete failure and that we have to consider that it is a crying necessity to look in other Provinces for a little fodder for the wintering of our cattle.\n\nWe have spent much money this year to buy the best seed of millet, but even this last one did not yield anything. We are facing a very grave problem for the coming winter and I wonder if any help could not be secured for having at least the freight paid by Ottawa on the hay I am compelled to buy from Manitoba.\n\nWe need to keep some milking cows for the health of our children and it is the reason why I made the sacrifice of buying hay in the next Province because our alfalfa, our natural hay, our sweet clover, our oats and barley did not give us anything. Owing to this fact I bought from Manitoba a hundred tons of hay but I cannot reasonably foresee another expenditure for the transportation of it.\nYou will certainly understand our needs and strive to make\nunderstand from the Department the necessary cooperation we can\nreasonably expect from them in such a necessity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. M de Bretagne O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nPS Our Provincial authorities will not help us for the\nfree transportation because we do not pay any taxes\non our land.\nWINNIPEG, Ottawa, December 9th, 1937.\n\nH. A. H. O. E. Y., Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has several schools in the dried out areas of the Western Provinces. All of them have farms attached with herds either of dairy or beef cattle if not both.\n\nThese herds under ordinary conditions are a great help to the schools both as producers of milk and beef and as a means of training the children that are attending school in the art of farming and cattle raising. This year, however, due to the drought, these herds are a great burden to each school as all fodder and grain for their upkeep have to be bought at prices which are almost prohibitive. The schools under our jurisdiction have either killed or sold the beef cattle which they had last fall and have only kept such dairy cattle as were essential for the producing of milk for the school children. But even with this drastic reduction in the number of cattle kept, the cost of hay and grain is still greater than the schools can meet out of the grant.\n\nWe find it, therefore, necessary to apply to the Department for special consideration of each school in the dried out area which is so handicapped. We would suggest that the Department supply to these schools the same amount of hay and grain that the Governments of the Western Provinces are supplying to the farmers situated in the same areas. By adopting this method of relief, we believe that no criticism of the Department could be made as it would be doing for the Indians just what the Provincial Governments are doing for the white population living in the same areas and under the same circumstances.\n\nWe submit our case in all confidence and hope that the Department will give it favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. School Files. (RG 10), Volume 6016, File 1-1-1a, part 1)\nOttawa, December 13, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from the Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., General Superintendent of the Oblate (Catholic) Indian Missions. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt is impossible for me to submit the request contained in Father Plourde's letter to the Minister for his consideration until I have obtained more definite information in respect to conditions prevailing at a number of residential schools administered by the Department in cooperation with the Roman Catholic Church in the province of Saskatchewan. I am inclined to think that the schools that Father Plourde has in mind - although he does not say so - are Cowessess, Muscowequan, Qu'Appelle, St. Philips and Thunderchild.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to obtain from the Agents a report on the condition of the live stock at these institutions. It is desirable that we should know the extent to which they have had to provide for additional fodder and feed and the extent to which they have been compelled to slaughter stock as the result of fodder shortage. Anything you can do to supply me with this information would be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant, in connection with fodder conditions at the St. Phillip's Residential School of this Agency, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. Number of cattle kept - 19\n2. Number used for milk supply - 12 at present time, which is about the average for the year.\n3. Condition of the cattle - Not very good, owing to poor feed.\n4. Amount of hay and fodder necessary to carry them through - about 75 tons.\n5. Amount of hay and feed raised by the school this year - 13 tons of hay.\n6. Amount of hay and feed purchased or will be necessary to purchase this year - About 22 tons of hay purchased, and 15 tons hay still to be purchased. These figures are given me by the Reverend Principal of the school and I think he should have considerably more than this. The milk cows are not in fit condition for milk. They are being fed mostly on wheat straw, with some hay, but not sufficient to milk more than half what their capacity would be under good feed.\n7. To purchase the feed necessary to carry the cattle through, owing to drought conditions, has cost approximately $300.00, but, as stated above, the cattle are not being fed as they should be fed.\n8. The only cattle disposed of owing to shortage of feed, were 2 cows and 5 calves, butchered for use in the school.\n\nI think the arrangement at this school, by which the farm land is rented on shares with a neighboring white farmer, and not worked by the school, is not the best possible arrangement, and the feed situation would have been better this year if the school had had the whole crop. I have spoken to the Reverend Principal regarding this, and the question of his taking over the whole of the farming operations, but he does not feel inclined to do so. He says the number of elders at the school would not be able to do the whole of the farm work, and that he would have to hire a considerable amount of extra assistance to do it, also that he has not the stable room to carry enough horses to...\ndo the farm work and his finances at the school are so low that he could not afford to take chances on the expenses of the whole of the farm for fear of the possibility of crop failures.\n\nThe Reverend Principal also informs me that the other school principals with whom he has been in contact, inform him that the operation of the school farms causes a loss in most cases, unless there is a particularly good crop. If this is the case it does not speak very well of farming, as a whole, in Saskatchewan or the management of the schools, because the schools should be able to employ their labour when necessary to employ any, and they all have some older Indian boys to perform some of it.\n\nIt is so long since I have seen a paying crop at an Indian school that I do not feel in a position to argue this point, as I saw seven successive non-productive crops at the two residential schools at the Crocus Lake Agency, before coming here, and I have not seen one since, but it seems to me that the school farms in the northern part of the Province must pay good returns, and they should here, under average conditions. The renting arrangement at the St. Philip's school has been the custom for many years, and I would not like to be responsible for insisting upon the change, because there is always the possibility of a failure and I think any drastic change should be the choice of the principal and the responsibility for success or failure, also his.\n\nThese observations, while not directly connected with the information you have asked, are somewhat related to the matter in question, and I would like you to consider them, for what they are worth, and I would like to have your opinion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.M. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Jos Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nFurther with reference to our conversation of even date respecting the Cowessess Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that these people have not had to purchase any more feed this year than other years as quite a number of their herd were disposed of during the high price of cattle in the early fall. I understood at that time that this was being done not with a view to reducing their herd, or to save shortage of feed but rather that they hoped to be afforded an opportunity sometime during the fall or winter season to replacing the majority of these with pure bred stock from people who raise these in the main, at a very favorable price but which at this date has not as yet been done.\n\nI might add in this connection that I was fortunate enough to dispose of the saleable Siksikay cattle on this market which returned the Indians even a better price than that paid by the Department for destitute ration beef.\n\nI am not aware of the nature of their application but judged from the information given me by the Rev. principal that some application had been made regarding the disposal of these cattle and thought the information above given may be of service to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.R.

The extra cost of flour this year by having to purchase the flour was at least $500.00. Also the vegetables were more or less a failure and the principal purchased a lot of vegetables. Extra cost is hard to figure but I am certain it would be more than $2,000.00 you see it will keep going on until the vegetable crop is ready in 1935, and the animals will have to be fed till the hay grows next summer. In addition to the cattle we must remember there are about 12 big horses and some young stock here to feed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThos Robertson D.D.S\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nP.S.

MCGILL,\n\nIn a letter to the Department dated December 9, 1937, Reverend Father J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., General Superintendent of Oblate Catholic Indian Missions, submits, for our consideration, a request received by him, for special financial assistance, from a group of schools situated in the drought stricken area of the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn response to instructions, Inspector Robertson, in co-operation with Indian agents, has made an investigation of conditions existing at six residential schools operated under the auspices of the Oblate Order in Saskatchewan. Dr. Robertson estimates that the loss sustained at these schools, as the result of drought, shortage of hay, oats, vegetables, etc., at $9,080. All surplus stock at these institutions was disposed of early in the fall of last year. Father Plourde in his letter states:\n\n\"We would suggest that the Department supply to these schools the same amount of hay and grain that the governments of the western provinces are supplying to the farmers situated in the same areas.\"\n\nThere are in the province of Saskatchewan nine residential schools operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church. I have not obtained from Inspector Robertson a report on conditions at the other schools. It is my opinion that all the residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan, with the exception of one or two in the northern section of the province, are urgently in need of financial\nfinancial assistance.\n\nReverend T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., has not yet submitted a special request on behalf of the three schools operated by the Anglican Church in Saskatchewan. But, in a letter sent forward by him to the Department dated December 21, 1937, he deals in a general way with the difficulties experienced by the Anglican Church in securing the funds necessary to operate their residential schools.\n\nDr. Westgate states:\n\n\"Our Society's overdraft at the bank, on account of our Indian residential schools, is $52,324.35. This year, 1937, it is now estimated that our expenditures will exceed all receipts by $18,000. This increase is very largely due to the increase in the cost of flour, other cereals and commodities generally.\"\n\nDr. Cochrane, representing the United Church, interviewed me at my office early in November. Dr. Cochrane informed me that the Home Mission Board of the United Church were experiencing the utmost difficulty in finding the money necessary to support their residential schools. At that time I made arrangements whereby fifty per cent of the per capita grants due to the United Church for the current quarter was paid in advance. In fact, we have found it necessary in recent years to make such advances to all the churches.\n\nI was not aware, until recently, that the churches were experiencing so much difficulty in financing their residential schools. Our failure to restore the five per cent deduction in per capita grants, together with the substantial increase that has taken place during the last year in the price of supplies, has, no doubt, contributed to this condition.\n\nIt is my opinion that conditions in the province of Saskatchewan\nof Saskatchewan are very serious and that immediate steps should be taken to assist the churches in maintaining their schools there in a reasonable state of efficiency. Dr. Robertson, in reference to the condition of the cattle at the St. Philips Residential School, states:\n\n\"It is noted from the agent's report that these cattle are in poor condition. It is his opinion that they are not getting enough feed, owing to drought conditions, the schools being unable to purchase the grain necessary for feed.\"\n\nIn view of these conditions, may I recommend the immediate payment to the church authorities responsible for the administration of residential schools in Saskatchewan of a grant equal to $5.00 per pupil. The total authorized pupilage in the residential schools in the province is 1,675. The special grant I suggest would amount to $8,375. This sum may appear to be somewhat inadequate, but it represents the maximum grant we can make out of the current year's appropriation. If a grant equal to this amount is authorized, the utmost care will have to be exercised in the authorization of expenditures for repairs and supplies at Indian day and residential schools during the 2\u00bd months remaining in the present fiscal year.\n\nThe necessity for the restoration of the five per cent deduction made in the per capita grants is a matter that should be given very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 13th 1928.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Minister -\n\nI send herewith memorandum submitted by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training in regard to the need for special assistance to the Church organizations operating residential schools in the drought area in the province of Saskatchewan. I concur in Mr. Hoey's views and recommendation.\n\nIt is not only the operation of residential schools, however, which has been adversely affected by the drought conditions. The effect of several dry seasons, culminating this year in the most severe of any occurring in the series, has been to make administration extremely difficult and costly in Saskatchewan.

You will note that this grant is being paid at the rate of $5.00 a head on an authorized enrolment of 1615 pupils.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the suggestion contained in Mr. Jackson's memorandum of January 14th, that this additional grant should be restricted to the schools in Saskatchewan which have been directly affected by drought conditions in the province. It is exceedingly difficult, however, to select a school which, in our judgment, is not in urgent need of special financial assistance. For example, in the Battleford agency, northwestern section of the province - where the Thunderchild Residential School is located, relief costs during the period April 1 to December 31 have increased almost 100% over the expenditures for the same period of last year. Relief figures for the Carlton agency show a similar increase. The Principals of the two or three residential schools which have not suffered directly as the result of drought conditions have experienced the utmost difficulty in securing the necessary supply of meat, vegetables, milk, etc., and have only succeeded in securing these at prices substantially higher than the prevailing prices of last year. I am convinced, therefore, that it would be more equitable and certainly more in accord with the actual needs of these schools if the grant was made as now suggested, on a pupilage basis.\n\nT.R.L. [Signature]\nFor Director.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 31st January 1938.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 24th January, 1938, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, submitting:\n\nThat there are fourteen Indian residential schools in the Province of Saskatchewan;\n\nThat of these, nine are operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, three under the auspices of the Church of England in Canada, and two under the auspices of the United Church of Canada;\n\nThat the total authorized pupilage at the above mentioned fourteen residential schools is 1,615;\n\nThat reports received from the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan and the local Indian agents indicate that farming operations at these schools have been adversely affected by drought conditions during the summer of 1937;\n\nThat, as a result, the schools in question have been obliged to incur extraordinary expenses in order to purchase feed, meat supplies, vegetables, etc., that ordinarily would be raised on the farms attached to the residential schools;\n\nThat the management of these schools have appealed to the Department of Mines and Resources for a special grant in order to assist them to meet these expenditures; and\n\nThat an amount of Five Dollars ($5.00) a head on the authorized pupilage of 1,615, or a total of Eight Thousand and Seventy-Five Dollars ($8,075.00) is available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure of the said sum of Eight Thousand and Seventy-Five Dollars ($8,075.00) as a special grant, at the rate of Five Dollars ($5.00) a head on the authorized pupilage, to the residential schools in the Province of Saskatchewan - the same to be chargeable to Vote Number 109 - Indian Affairs Branch - Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 4, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 9, in connection with the extra expense caused to Indian Residential Schools in Saskatchewan owing to weather conditions during the past summer, it has been arranged to make a payment at the rate of $5.00 per capita on the authorized pupilage to each Indian Residential School in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn accordance with the above decision the following payments are being made to Indian Residential Schools conducted under Roman Catholic auspices:\n\n| NAME OF SCHOOL | AUTHORIZED PUPILAGE | AMOUNT PAID |\n|----------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Beauval        | 100                 | $500.00     |\n| Cowessess      | 85                  | $425.00     |\n| Duck Lake      | 160                 | $800.00     |\n| Guy            | 125                 | $625.00     |\n| Muscowequan    | 105                 | $525.00     |\n| Onion Lake     | 120                 | $600.00     |\n| Qu'Appelle     | 235                 | $1175.00    |\n| St. Philips    | 70                  | $350.00     |\n| Thunderchild   | 120                 | $600.00     |\n\nThe payments for the Beauval and Guy Schools have been forwarded to Rt.

There are about 90 increase this spring. This appears to be a very worthwhile enterprise, although a new mink-house is required to house about another 150 mink.

Mr. Edmunds was not there when I called there.\n\nMr. Neary, it is not possible to get a complete dairy in one apparatus for less than the price that we are asking you, and it is not possible to get a pasteurizer for a commercial dairy for less than $1500.00.\n\nAs you know, homogenized milk preserves at least 12 hours longer than pasteurized milk. For milk reconstitution, it is necessary to have an homogenizer to get the complete dissolution of the powder and good tasty milk.\n\nHoping that your department will place an order as soon as possible,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. A. Blackburn, Repres.\nTechnical Agriculturist.\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\nCENTRAL EXPERIMENTAL FARM\nOTTAWA.\n\nJanuary 28, 1949.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you doubtless are aware the National Dairy Cattle Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. E.S. Archibald, functions under the National Advisory Committee on Agricultural Services in an advisory capacity in the interests of the dairy cattle industry. It has five subcommittees as follows: Sterility Problems, Bang's Disease and Mastitis, Artificial Insemination, Nutrition, and Stable Management, each of which is active at the present time.\n\nIn addition to the normal work of this Committee, and its sub-committees, Dr. Archibald has suggested that the Committee might perform a very useful service and fill a great need in acting, if possible, as a two way \"clearing house\" of information relating to various phases of dairy cattle production, and a coordinating link among the various institutional herds in Canada. The idea behind this suggestion is that it is felt that among these institutional herds, as for example, Dominion Experimental Farms, agricultural colleges and schools, penitentiaries and jails, hospitals and mental institutions, Indian Affairs' institutions, Veterans' Affairs projects, etc., etc., there is lying fallow a wealth of data and experience relating to problems and practices which could be of inestimable value to all concerned if collected, analyzed, and used. A consolidation of information of a practical nature, which naturally would be collected on a voluntary basis and used in a confidential manner, would be of value to the Committee in making recommendations of a national character, to the institutional superintendents in the efficient operation of their farms and herds, and to the Canadian dairy cattle industry at large.\n\nMany examples might be given of the value of such a proposal for all concerned. One which was cited at a recent meeting was the case of three institutional farms and herds adjacent to one another and under different governmental administrations in Canada carrying out many quite different practices in farm management and herd operation, each of which might have benefited by the experience and good management factors of the others if known and applied. Such matters under consideration might be those of finding out the nature, extent, locality and best methods of overcoming breeding troubles, mastitis, acetomelia, etc.; experiences in the efficient growing, putting up, and feeding of legume silage and how such a feed fits into various cropping practices; efficiency and utilization of labour for milk production; problems and experience in relation to costs of different types of barns, layout, equipment, etc.; location, use and suitability of surplus feeds, breeding stock, etc.; and many others.\nIt is proposed first of all to compile as complete a list as possible of Canadian institutional dairy herds and when this is made to attempt to obtain the voluntary co-operation of the managers or superintendents in direct charge, and send them a practical questionnaire dealing with such information as outlined above. An attempt would be made to analyze such information on a collective basis and utilize it to the very best advantage. The continuance of such a scheme would naturally depend on the reception and progress made of such an undertaking.\n\nWe should be very glad of your candid opinion of the above proposal and any suggestions you may care to offer as to its practicability and feasibility. In order to compile a list we would appreciate your giving the names of any dairy herds, either purebred or grade, that may be under your jurisdiction, the addresses and names of the men in direct charge of them, together with your permission to communicate with them. I may add that no commitment in any way other than outlined in this letter is involved.\n\nI would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.B. MacKenzie\nSecretary, National Dairy Cattle Committee.\nFebruary 4, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. DOUCET,\n\nCould you please contact Mr. MacKenzie the writer of the attached letter and discuss with him any details which we should include in a circular letter to be sent to our residential school principals concerning the list which he requires of Canadian dairy herds.\n\nWe will not want to overlap the questionnaire which they propose to send out but as you are aware, we do not have up to date information on the state of certain of our herds.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nFebruary 12, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTo supplement my telephonic conversation re Dairy Herds at Indian Residential Schools, I must say that as the school herds belong to the various denominations the Department has no accurate record of them.\n\nI wish to add that the Department would be pleased to relay any questionnaire sent to us from your office.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA.J.

Intosh or Sioux Lookout School or at Sioux Lookout or St. Boniface Hospitals, where pupils of these schools are generally sent, or should a death occur when they are away on leave on their Reserve some distance from the schools, it would be impossible to hold an enquiry, owing to the distance and difficulty of reaching these places.\n\nYesterday we received a notification of the death of a pupil of the Sioux Lookout school at Sioux Lookout Hospital. This child died on the 17th inst., but we have only just received the report. It will therefore be impossible to hold an enquiry soon after the death, it would also have been very inconvenient for the Principal of the school to go to Sioux Lookout or for ourselves to go from here, owing to the difficulty of travel.\n\nHowever we have asked the Principal to make the necessary enquiry with the Doctor and another party representing ourselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the Memorandum of Enquiry in the case of the death of a pupil at an Indian residential school.\n\nThe Department realizes that, in some cases, you cannot carry out all the instructions mentioned on the memorandum but you should observe these instructions as closely as possible.\n\nIn the case of a pupil dying at a residential school, the form should be completed and the Department considers that you should be in a position to carry out all the instructions previously given as, if you are unable to attend the enquiry, you can appoint someone to represent you.\n\nIn the event of a pupil dying at a hospital, the part to be signed by the Principal should be completed, as well as by the medical officer of the school if he was in attendance and, in addition, as mentioned in paragraph 3 of circular letter of April 17th, a report should be submitted from the physician or surgeon who is in attendance at the hospital.\n\nWhen a pupil of a residential school dies on a reserve some time after such pupil has left the residential school, it is not necessary to hold an enquiry as, in such cases, the pupil has, no doubt, been visited by the reserve doctor and he is fully aware of all circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Box 54\nCardston, Alberta\nMay 4/35\n\nMr. John Pugh,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nI noted in the last circular that was sent out by the Department that there must be a board of enquiry whenever there is a death at either of the residential schools. I feel that such a procedure will have good results; in that any neglect will be sought out; and the responsibility placed where it belongs.\n\nIn case, however, where a parent refuses to have treatment for his sick child there is no provision where such treatment can be carried out and the child admitted to the hospital if necessary. The criminal code I believe can punish a father for \"criminal neglect\" in such cases.\n\nI have a case in point now, in which the father refuses further treatment for contracted knee. If this is neglected the child will grow up a hopeless cripple. His man's name is Wings. I would like to what ruling the department would make on a case of a child where treatment was refused when a child's...\nJ.R. Murray, M.D.C.M.\nP.O.

Mulloy, Medical Officer, in regard to the recent ruling in regard to enquiry into deaths of pupils at Residential Schools, and subject matter that relates to hospitalization of Indians in accordance with addition of added regulations to the Medical Regulations.\n\nThe points as mentioned in Dr. Mulloy's letter have been discussed, and I, therefore, wish to collaborate with Dr. Mulloy in obtaining the Department's viewpoint and instructions in the matters to which he refers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 30th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour communication enclosing letter from Doctor J. K. Mulloy of Cardston, Alta. was received. The points brought out in Doctor Mulloy's letter are, of course, very important ones, but when it is remembered that the Department of Indian Affairs only undertakes to supply medical and surgical treatment for its Indian wards but does not insist that these services should be accepted, the consideration of the matter is, perhaps, simplified. As Doctor Mulloy states, the criminal code can be evoked when a parent or other person acting in that capacity palpably neglects to give an infant or child under his care reasonable care and attention.\n\nIt seems to me that in the case of the man wings a judicious display of tact and persuasion might be effective. If you find that by this means nothing can be accomplished, you might again bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nJ. E.

D. McLean, Esq.\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly let me know if white people (French Canadians) have a right to inhabit houses on the Indian Reserve?\n\nCould you confer on me rights to look about the Indian Reserve of Esquimaux. There are several little changes happening which I think should be prevented. There were some of our Indians who had started using intoxicating drinks. I stopped them short.\n\nWould there be any possibility of having a separate school on our Reserve for Indian children only? The reason for my asking this is that in winter time the distance the children have to walk in the snow and in the cold is too considerable. It must be fully one mile. There would be about fifteen children of both sexes who could attend school. This number may increase soon. There is no building now that would answer the purpose.\n\nI have asked the Mayor of the place, Mr. A. M. Mercier, to be my interpreter with you and I moreover wish to mention that I applied to you directly instead of going through our agent, as you are the representative of our forefathers who gave us the little property.\nJ.S.

McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nMr Edouard Moreau,\nIndian Reserve,\nLes Escoumins,\nQue.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that when on my visit to Escomain the Indians have asked me to pray the Department for a School for themselves on their Reserve. They have 15 children of school age who in the winter through cold and snow can not attend the school for the white in the village of Escomain which is 1/2 mile from the Indian village. They say that they furnish the school house themselves that if the Dept would grant forty or fifty dollars a year they could hire a school mistress for that amount providing the Dept would supply the school materials.\n\nIn my opinion I believe it would be a good thing for the Indians of Escomain to have a School on the Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be - Sir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nAdolphe Gagnon\nIndian Agent\nOTTAWA, 18th July, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, stating that the Escomains Indians have applied to you for the establishment of a school on their reserve, and in reply I beg to inform you that a similar application was received from Edward Moreau, an Indian, of that place, who was informed that the Department regretted that it could not establish a school there as the Census does not show that it would be justified in doing so, even if funds were available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nAdolphe Gagnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have just received a letter from Edward Monaw, headman of the Indians of Escomunans, stating that out of some 15 children of school age, he will be able to walk daily from the Reserve to the village of Escomunans to attend school, where they would be received as pupils by paying a monthly fee of 25\u00a2 each. Edward Monaw asks if the Department would be willing to pay this fee; he concludes his letter by saying that he is sorry to see the children of the band brought up in ignorance, that a little schooling would help them later in life.\n\nI have the honour to be \u2014 Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nAdolphe Lagron\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant informing the Department that you have received a letter from Edward Mercier, headman of the Escomains Indians in which he states that out of the 15 children of school age, 7 would be able to walk daily from the reserve to the school in the village of Escomains and asks whether the Department would be willing to pay a tuition fee of 20 cents a month for each child. In reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to pay this fee, such payment to be made on receipt of a quarterly return showing the attendance of the pupils, certified to by you. This return should be accompanied by a voucher from you showing in whose favor the payment is to be made for the children in attendance at this white school.\n\nBlank forms of requisition and quarterly return are forwarded you today.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

This culvert should be covered to avoid accidents to children.\n\nEnclosed herewith is an authorization from Mr. Agent Gagnon appointing me Chief of the Indians of Escoumins, but I prefer that this should come directly from your Department. I have abolished liquor on the reserve, I do not like it, I never take liquor, am 72 years of age, and I hope that I will never take it.\n\nIf I had some distinction from the other Indians I would be believed and feared more, also Mr. Gagnon is paid by your Department and I receive nothing for doing his work on the Escoumins Reserve.\n\nDuring the summer I went to Bersimis. I found disorder through liquor, on the part of the Indians and the French whites on the Reserve. I was ashamed of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nEdouard Moreau,\nIndian.\n\nI thank you for your kindness in what you have done for us, for the Indians of the Escoumins Reserve.\n\nIn having the goodness to return me the authorization of Mr. Agent Gagnon you will oblige me.\n\nP.

Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of the visit of Mr. Ramsden\non June 26, last, we were heard on the subject of a mixed\nschool on the Indian reserve. I transmit a memo. On this\n3rd day of July, in accordance with Mr. Ramsden's order we\nassembled the persons concerned, ten heads of Indian\nfamilies and three heads of whites families. They received\nunanimously, and without any objection, the annexed resolu-\ntion, which we have the honour to transmit.\n\nWe told Mr. Ramsden that it would be necessary\non the part of the Indians that you grant the sum of $100\na year. Without that, we should not be able to carry\non the work well. The keeping up of a school costs dear.\nAt present there are only three white families who will be\nobliged to meet the expense annually of an equal sum. They\nare willing to make sacrifices for a good school. What\ncompels them to do this is the too great distance from\nthe central school, and the young people cannot go there\nduring the severe season. You see that this is not exagger-\nated on the part of the Indians, who are the greater\nnumber.\n\nMoreover, I am convinced that this school will\nbe of great use to the Indians in uniting them, the young\npeople, with the white people by education. They will\nlearn to respect each other. These are my views.\n\nI tell you sincerely that all these poor people\nappeared perfectly happy after having passed their resolu-\ntion; it was a veritable joy on all sides, and their happiness\nwill be still greater when you shall have given them a favourable reply, which I hope for very soon.\n\nReceive, Sir, the expression of the great respect that I have for you.\n\nEd.

They would agree to furnish a school house, a vacant house which they possess in common and which would be sufficient, I believe for that purpose. Although they have not a sufficient number of children to sustain the school, they have thirteen which are of age to go to school and to which some education should be given.\n\nI believe that an allowance of $200.00 yearly would be sufficient XXXXX to pay the salary of this teacher and I think that this sum would be a just expenditure from the public account.\n\nA prompt answer would permit me to see about the engagement of this teacher in good time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJos.

Cameron\nAgent des Sauvages\nPar l'E.\nEscoumins, May 15, 1911.\n\nMr. A. Gagnon,\nAgent,\nIndian Reserve, Bersimis.\n\nSir,\n\nYou are aware that for some time I have been working for a school for the natives of Escoumins. To-day we are finding the means of building for ourselves a mixed school, without asking the Indian Department for money. All are unanimous about having a school at the Point; three families, French Canadian, will make the sacrifice of building the school,\u2014Joseph Tremblay Jean Boise, David Boucher, sons of Charles and Alfred Tremblay, sons of Francois of Little Lake and brother-in-law of Charles Boucher, provided that we shall be assured that the Indian Department will give us a monthly grant in favour of the children of the Indian families. We are certain of success with this school. At their request we shall try to get a good teacher, and with the grace of God all will go well.\n\nI hope soon to have a favourable reply and then I shall keep you advised of the situation.\n\nThe reason for the present request is that the children are too far away from the village school. They have a great deal of trouble, some disagreement with the municipality, which is pleased at our efforts. The whole thing is approved here.\n\nWith much respect on the part of\n\nEd. Boily\nParish Priest\n\nFor the chief of the Escoumins Indian reserve\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inclose a letter from the Rev. Ed. Boily, priest at Bacoumaine, who wishes to build a school-house on the Indian reserve.\n\nI beg you to reply to me direct or to tell me what reply I ought to give.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. Gagnon,\nI.A.\nby J.G.\nOttawa, June 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nFor some time the Department has been paying to the Escomains school a fee for the Indian children who had the privilege of attending. Rev. Ed. Boilly, the Priest at Escomain, wrote on the 15th ultimo to Mr. A. Gagnon, the Agent, stating that they are building at the Point a school for whites and Indians without asking the Department for any money. They ask, however, that the usual monthly grant be continued. The Department is quite prepared to continue this grant, but before authorizing the erection of a school, which the Agent states is on the Reserve, it desires further information with respect to location, number of children who will attend, ownership of site, etc.\n\nShould you go to Escomain in the near future I would ask you to look carefully into this matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Ramsden, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a communication from Rev. Ed. Royly, the Priest at Escoumain, in reference to the building of a school on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Gagnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBerimis, Que.\nC.G.S. \"ROUVILLE\" 27th June, 1911.\n\nJ. N. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 15th, 1911, file No. 273510-5, re school at Baccumains.\n\nI beg to report that I had an interview with Father Boily and Chief Paul Ross. The location of the school was not definitely settled, Father Boily desiring to call a joint meeting of the whites and Indians to determine the location. The Chief insisted on the school being on the reserve, and if built on the reserve, it was agreed that the location would be on the rising knoll just inside of the eastern line fence and about 225 yards from the river, and on band property.\n\nThere are about sixteen children of eligible school age of Indian parentage, and Father Boily asked for as liberal grant as possible stating that a grant was now given of .40 per scholar per month by the department which amounted to between $70. and $80. per annum. An annual grant paid quarterly would be preferable of say $100. per year. It is the Fathers intention to build the school by the labour of both the white and Indian population and by subscription, this would, of course, mean a joint ownership and be under the control of the Father and Indian Agent.\nAfter discussing the matter of ownership with the Father it was agreed that the school could not be closed or removed without the consent of the Indian Department and that an annual rental for the ground of $1.00 per year be paid. This agreement should be made in writing and signed by the Father, when, or before the department gives the grant.\n\nFather Boily is going to write the department the result of his next meeting as to location of school and until he is heard from again no further action is necessary. I may say the Chief seemed unalterably opposed to the school unless built on Band property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nAt a meeting of the Indians of the Escoumains reserve and of their immediate white neighbours, it was resolved:\n\n1. To build a school-house on the land of the Indian reserve in common, the white people supplying the necessary material. And the said white people and Indians shall do the work of construction in common. The white people will not trespass on the land of the said reserve.\n\n2. Each of these races will pay its share for the maintenance of a teacher. The white people will provide her board and lodging and what remains of her salary, which will be about $150, perhaps more. We wish to have a good teacher.\n\n3. Each of the two parties shall furnish their share of firewood for the said school in the severe season.\n\n4. The parish priest of Escoumains shall have the supreme control of this school; he shall settle the difficulties. This school shall be neither Indian nor white, but mixed, in order to prevent disputes in future.\n\nDone in general meeting this 3rd day of July, 1911, and signed in the presence of us, the undersigned parish priest of Escoumains, and in the presence of each other, these presents having first been read over.\n\nPaul Ross, chief\n(and 12 others\u2014Indian and French\u2014for names see original)\n\nEd.

The location of the school was not definitely settled, Father Boily desiring to call a joint meeting of the Whites and Indians to determine the location.

Ramsden\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 4, 1911.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Department wishes to permit certain white families living near the Escoumain Indian Reserve to co-operate with the Indians and erect a day school building on the Reserve. The memorandum accompanying Father Boily's letter of July 3rd states their wishes. I think it would be well to have a properly worded agreement prepared and signed by the Reverend Father and also the trustees of the section, if it is organized, embodying the terms. These are:\n\n1. We consent to their erecting the building on the reserve, but this permission is to give them no title to the land nor is it to constitute the usual right of occupancy on a reserve.\n\n2. The building is to be erected without any expense to the Department.\n\n3. The Department will give an annual grant of $100.00, payable quarterly upon receipt of returns showing the attendance, so long as the attendance of Indian children will warrant it.\n\n4. The Department will assume obligation for half of the\n2.\n\nthe cost of the necessary fuel.\n\n5. The school is to be managed jointly by the Parish Priest or trustees, if there is any organized section, and the Indian Agent representing the Department.\n\n6. The total cost of maintenance other than above mentioned to be assumed by the whites.\n\n7. The Department will provide books, stationery, etc., for the use of the Indian children.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nNo. 65.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nBERSMIS P. O. - JULY18, 1912.\n\nSIR,\n\nAt the time of my visit to Escoumaine, the Indians of that reserve, begged me to ask the Department to grant them a teacher to educate their children. They would agree to furnish a school house, a vacant house which they possess in common and which would be sufficient, I believe for that purpose. Although they have not sufficient number of children to sustain the school, they have thirteen which are of age to go to school and to which some education should be given.\n\nJOS. F. X.

Bankhead, Secr\u00e9tariat\nSecr\u00e9taire du Comit\u00e9 des Affaires des Sauvages\nOttawa\nJan 30, 1886\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the large number of children of school age at Gainsborough, it has been decided to open a \"girls' school\" on the reserve in order that the children of both sexes may each have a school to attend and thus afford better facilities for education and also avoid difficulties that are likely to arise in connection with a mixed school such as that at present in operation on the reserve.\n\nParliament at its last session voted a salary of $300.00 for the teacher of the girls' school, and this amount will be available from the time the school is in operation.\n\nThe stone buildings formerly occupied by...\nEmploying the Grand Trunk Railway on the Ross will no doubt afford ample accommodation for school purposes both for boys and for girls. I have therefore requested that you will consult with Mr. Macdonald and with the Chiefs in this matter with a view to such of the buildings as may be considered advisable being appropriated for the use of a public school.

Father. In the mean time I explained...\nexplained to them the advantages their daughters would derive from a good school especially if the teachers were men and I am now able to inform you that they have decided on having none if they can get them and to select a place near the church - If no suitable house can be purchased near the church, they will then build one - We are now at work.\n\nThese are the reasons which prevented me answering your letter before and having nothing satisfactory to say on the matter.\n\nI have\n\nA.

Some years ago, the Government promised each such of $500, to be applied annually for educational purposes among the Indians. This plan was promised, but for some reason or other these people have not yet to this present day received any of the money placed at their disposition. Now, however, the question of how to get this money has become a burning question amongst the otherwise quietly-disposed Indians. It appears that a considerable portion of the fact, the better part of the community, had decided to form the Catholic St. Joseph's mission religious community at Lachine, and send three of their number to attend the mission school there. At the same time, possess themselves of the Government grant. This suggestion has been met with resistance from a few Indians who seem to be decidedly against the interference of the Catholic education. The anti's have succeeded in raising a terrible tempest in the neighborhood, and are pressing for the closure of the village and safety of the sums if they should come into the place.\nMonseigneur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous informer que les parents de plusieurs familles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 venir faire l'\u00e9cole aux jeunes filles de Baughmanage, demandent de faire des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 la maison actuelle par le biais pour y tenir une \u00e9cole de filles sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Baughmanage avant d'y faire la classe.\n\nCes r\u00e9parations consistent \u00e0 r\u00e9nover la vieille maison de mani\u00e8re qu'il y soit une affaire pour la classe, une entr\u00e9e pour la r\u00e9ception des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, un porche, une salle \u00e0 vivre et deux chambres \u00e0 coucher, et ajouter une petite cuisine de 10 pieds sur 20 pieds avec un toit pour abriter les \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\n\nLe Rev.

These repairs will consist in putting up the school house, that is to say, to have one room for class one for recreation, one for storage, two rooms and two bed-rooms and an addition of a small kitchen 10 x 12 ft. with porch for the entrance.\n\nAnd Mr. Burton has had a plan made by an architect, but this plan would not correspond with the need.\nNote of the building and its condition for it is very hard to get con-\ntractors unless they pay double the price.\n\nI suggest to have the repairs made by the day by carpenters of\nConnaughta. The Curator is a competent Carpenter and could perform\nthe work. The accounts could be transmitted to Ottawa for approval.\n\nIn this manner the repairs in question would only cost half as much as\nwould be otherwise. The carpenters of this place are good workmen but\nthey would be afraid to contract for the work themselves and at present they have\nno work.\n\nShane\n\nW. B. Rossau.\nA.

No. 9069 relative to the repairing of the school house for the pupils at Caughnawaga, which is in charge of Mr. Parmelee. However, I shall be happy to inform you that there will be very little difference in the cost of coal or wood when the school - Coal will cost $6.50 per ton taken at Chateaugay basin and carriage from there to Caughnawaga $1.25 in all $7.75. Three tons would be sufficient and a coal store will cost from $15 to $20 according to quality. Wood at Caughnawaga sells from $5 to $8 per cord, at least 15 cords will be required and a store will cost from $12 to $15 according to quality.\n\nWith regard to the lumber and other work in case a contract...\nContinuing from their request by the former teacher Mr. Hetherington, who was responsible for the work done to repair some woodwork, as much as necessary.\n\nThey can of course be utilized in the main frame but new ones are required as there are not enough for all the pupils.\n\nThese repairs were recommended by the Councilors at their meeting on the 20 April last (Resolution No. 3) and subsequently approved by the Board.\n\nThe approximate cost of these repairs will come to about $200.00 - $100.00 for the repairing and strengthening with oak for underneath - of which the most expensive item being and covered with sheet metal or tin plates $5.00 will be required and for the window $6.00 must be the same $25.00.\n\nThis is exclusive of the painting of the house and of the fencing of the yard for the protection and the repainting of the closets which are also badly necessary.\nI believe the idea of the Committee to have these repairs made by the day to be a bad one, for it will be a saving and the means of securing better work.

N.C.\n\nSir,\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of Cheque No. 44 dated Nov. 15th last for the sum of $12.50 in favor of Miss Josephine Parent, as her salary as teacher for the quarter ended Nov. 30th last, and in consequence thereof I have to state that Miss Parent is aware to know how it is that she is allowed only $12.50 for that quarter, for she was ready to begin Class on Nov. 1st, and the time lost was lost in awaiting for instructions from the Dept. and she began to teach as soon as the notice came, so that effect more or less would be made up for the lost time\u2014Calculating to have an amount of $30.00 per annum, but as the period of the school year consists of 10 months only.\nfor month receive only $237.50 according to that pay.\n\nMuch\u2014\n\nShe has to teach more than 50 pupils which necessitates some assistance, but her sister helps her\u2014It is not her intention to ask any remuneration for that service, but she expects being paid the full amount of her expenses next when the fourth quarter has expired in June next, which will end the school year.\n\nWhat Miss Parrott asserts is certainly true, and her sister helps her in the school\u2014She is most zealous in the performance of her duties and very anxious for the progress of her pupils, but I am unable to answer to give her a satisfactory answer.\n\nYours etc,\n\nH. B.

I beg to state that Mr. Brossard thinks that Miss Parent should have been paid her full salary for that date as it was not her fault that she did not open the school at the beginning of the month. The facts are that on the 12th July last Mr. Brossard sent forward an application from Miss Parent for the position but on the 16th August he was requested to send in her certificates & testimonials for examination by the Dept. On the 25th of the same month the certificate was sent in. On the 4th September he was instructed to make the appointment Miss Parent's salary to be at the rate of $300.00 per annum on the 26th of the same month (Sept.)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 18\n\nHe reported that she had entered upon her duties on the 17th of that month from which date $10 has been paid.\n\nIt was necessary that the Dept should first examine the certificate and satisfy itself as to the qualifications she possessed before making the appointment. I cannot see that Miss Parent can fairly claim any salary for the time that lapsed between the date of her application on the 12th July and the date of her entering upon her duties on the 17th Sept. It will be observed that although Mr. Rossman was instructed on the 4th Sept. to make the appointment yet she did not open the school until the 17th. She must go to show that she was not ready before that date.\n\nJohn Mcfarlane\nA.

It was necessary that the Dept. should first examine the Certificate and satisfy itself as to her qualifications before\nbefore making the appointment, and the Dept cannot concede that she can fairly claim any salary for the time that lapsed between the date of her application (the 12th July) and that on which she entered upon her duties by the 17th Sept., and further it is observed that although you were instructed on the 4th Sept. to make the appointment, yet Miss Parent did not open the school until the 17th Sept. which would go to show that she was not ready before that date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell\nMonsieur\n\nRef\u00e9rant \u00e0 mon dernier lettr, du 25 octobre dernier, No 69067, en rapport avec les r\u00e9parations de l'\u00e9cole des filles \u00e0 Kangmanage.\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse, j'ai l'honneur de vous informer qu'il y a besoin de bois et de planches pour environ 30 livres, que la cl\u00f4ture n\u00e9cessaire pour entourer le terrain et faire une cour estime, ainsi environ 220 pieds de longueur, parce qu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 un mur en pierre qui court le cl\u00f4ture pour une partie du terrain.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre\n\nMonsieur\n\nVotre obligeant\n\nA.

Now that the liberty is given to you direct to enclose you to have the goodness to see to my case\u2014may perhaps be too late, being you too much, but while I tell you that all I have received since last year is $237.50 only which I have been obliged to pay over to my assistants, I feel convinced that you will do me the favor I crave\u2014It was impossible for me\nIt seems almost too many people at the school reports with them and I had only the balance of that money to support myself and family.

I beg to report that this same request was made by Miss Parent on the 5th last month, and upon the matter being referred to Mr. Brossard for report, he stated that he did not consider it necessary to increase the salary of the Assist. teacher as Miss Parent could always have an eye on the Assist. class. This school is now undergoing repairs and among other things a division in the School Room for the separate class taught by the Assist. teacher.

I am writing to express my concern about this matter.\n\nAs you may be aware, the land in question is currently occupied by several families who have lived there for generations. They have built their homes and established their lives on this land. It would be extremely difficult for them to relocate, especially given the current economic conditions.\n\nI urge you to reconsider your plans and explore alternative options. Perhaps we could find a way to accommodate both your needs and those of the existing residents.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nat Red River Village, which is just a distance from here, it is not very handy for me to come there.\n\nI will have my holiday at the end of the month and I urge you to accept it without delay. I would like to see you again and I am sure you will agree.\n\nI have my two diplomas in English and French and I think you can read both the ones as well as I have. English is easier for me than French, but this fact should not deter you from accepting them. I am confident that the language is quite familiar to you and I am sure you will be able to teach it to me.\n\nAnd I shall always be happy to help you with any difficulties you may have. I hope you will make up your mind to accept my offer for next year.\n\nBe assured that I will do the best I can to give you the satisfaction you deserve when I offer you an opportunity.\n\nSo you understand? I'll take care of my studies, the rest is up to you. English is easy for me, but French is more difficult. If I ask the place it is not here. I cannot find anyone here who can help me.

He and his wife owned a house and lot where the girls school is now located. He and his wife sold it at the request of the Chiefs to the Dept. General for school purposes. The western boundary described in the conveyance as school described in the present council house property is the present council house property. He can show where his western property was. His lot was fenced on the limits west, east, south, and north side. The stone wall of the fort was his southern limit, also fenced on the north side. His house was in the north east angle of his lot. The east wall of the house formed the eastern limit and forming the house forming the northern side of the house. There was no door in the northern limit, there was no land on the east of his house as he had no land on the west side. The door on the north entered his street and the one on the south entered his garden. The stone wall is now just as it was at that time. He can show on the ground when his eastern limit was. East of his house was an open space inside. The public accommodations were walked. The public accommodations were walked at that place. There was a platform around the flagpole there. He thinks the flagpole was about 50 feet east of the eastern wall of his house. So far as he knows the flagpole\nAnd so to say where it was then,\nhe passed his property almost\nevery day ever since he sold it, he\ndoes not think his property went as\nfar as the fence recently placed there,\ngoing to the ground in Phillips pointed\nout the east end of the stone wall at the\nsouth of the lot and the eastern boundary\nof his lot, this line at right angles\nfrom the stone wall would strike the present\nschool building at a point about 4 feet\nfrom the east end, Mr. Phillips and his\nwife resided in the house sold, not quite\na year, this wife owned it for about 20 years,\na party by the name of Mitchell Jacob,\na party by the name of Mitchell Jacob,\nMr. Phillips first the brand, built the house\nand word these immediately preceding him,\nthe house was 21 x 28 feet running east and\nwest.\n\nSigned in the presence\nof J.J.

The house conveyed was used for a school building from that time until the present house (school) was built. He purchased and removed the old house to his property diagonally across the way. He has lived there for years so.\nThe school house is near in view of the old house. The old house where he removed house was near about 4 feet the eastern end of which was about feet west of the eastern end of the present school house. The old house was a stone foundation cellar wall all around the house, but was below when the excavated new. The penultimate house had no room for the present house and was made for the first building. The new was made for the last by its location of the eastern wall of the old house running through the fence on the point was removed from the southern east corner of the house from the south east corner of the house several years after the dug over this stone wall. Several rooms after the general purchased place of building along the east without being removed any side directly running towards us that time until the cement block was put into his yard. He was the last lot for years when this accuracy of the wall took place, he wall was laid.\nwhere the foot path had been, that was the only thing that they were guided by in laying the walk. There has never been a fence on the east of the present school building until this year. The flagpole has always been where it now stands. There is a hole in the rock for two purposes. The announcements after prayers are made from a platform by the flagpole. The northern around the flagpole was built the west about 25 years ago. He claims the land between the school house and the proper side of the wall is public property. The proper side of the wall is public place belongs to me. I believe and comes to a point or line to my vehicle and comes to a point or line about 15 to 18 feet north of the old stone wall.

Remembered the building\npurchased from Phillips; the eastern\nfence ran almost close to the foundation\nof the house to the end of the fortification\nwall. Never saw or knew of any other\nfence between two buildings and the\nsidewalk. Claims that the land\nbetween the building and the sidewalk\nbelonged to the band and was used\nfor announcements and for the assembly\nfor anniversaries and for the\ncelebration of trips, concerts, etc., by\npeople while at service and at funeral\nservices. Have attended funeral services\nthere. Have attended church services\nin the church across the way. Never heard\nany announcements from this place.\n\nWitness:\nA. Williams\n\nThomas H. Morris\nJohn Simpson\n\nRemember the school house which was moved away to make room for the present brick building. Had the contract to paint the old building and repair it in 1901 or 1902. There was the remains of an old fence running north and south about 4 or 5 feet east of the old school building. In a straight line from the corner of the old fortification wall from that time on the fence went into decay. I remember the distance between the wall and the fence on account of placing my ladder there. I pass by frequently and am familiar with its location and condition. To the best of my recollection the fence on the north side of the building was about 14 or 15 feet north, never heard of any one claiming the land between the building and the side walk, it was always considered to be public property. All proclamations, notices from the depot, etc., are always given from a platform around the flagpole. Subsequently a band stand was erected on this piece of land.\n\nJohn Simpson\n\nA.B. Williams\nTheresa Calicole wife of Mitchell Calicole,\nthe daughter of August Jacob, Sevorne.\nHer father bought the property and she\nacquired it as her share; this property\nlies south of the school property but\nchased from Jacques Phillips. Her brother\nMitchell Jacobo was the predecessor\nin title of Jacques Phillips as to the\nschool property. Her brother's property\ncame as far east as the end of the\nfortification wall. There has been no fence\nmarking the boundary between\nher land and the land to the north, east\nof the end of the stone fence, in her time.\nThere has never been any building to her\nrecollection on any portion of the land\nnorth of the hotel building. There was a large\nredish stone along the line where the\nsidewalk now is and within the corner of\nthe fence just erected which she supposed\nand claimed was the north easterly\ncorner of her property. She was born\non the property she now holds and always\nunderstood that that stone was her corner.\nShe cannot account for the projection\nof her property north of the fortification\nwall. There appears to be the foundation\nor the remains of one, if some building\nwhich has long since disappeared.\nThere was a fence running north from\nthe end of the fortification along the eastern\nlimit of the land of Jacques Phillips, but\nno fence running east and west along\nher north boundary\u2014only the old four\nposts.\nMichel Montour recalled he lived 44 years just across the road from Mrs. Delisle. He was a councillor in Agent Brossard's time when the fence was built along the east limit of the schoolhouse property about 25 years ago. The question of Mrs. Delisle's northern boundary came up at that time. Mr. Montour represented the Council and Mr. Brossard and Mrs. Delisle with Agent Brossard and Mrs. Delisle when the line was commonly indicated. It was understood supposed to be. It was understood at the time that no fence was to be placed there but that it was to be left open as a common with the property of the north.\nOttawa, 4th October, 1918.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn pursuance of your instructions I visited the Caughnawaga Village to look into the complaint made by the Caughnawaga Council that the fence recently erected around the Girls' School enclosed land which should not have been enclosed. The investigation took place at the Council House and was attended by nearly one hundred members of the band.\n\nI had before me the conveyance of the lot from James Phillips to the Superintendent General for the purpose of a school. In this conveyance the lot is described as bounded \"in front by the Main Street, on the east by another street, on the south by the lot belonging to the heirs of Isaac Jacobs and on the west by the present school property.\" It is with respect to the eastern boundary in particular \"another street\", that the complaint is raised. It is difficult to say just what was regarded as the western limits of this street at this place. The street is not very wide elsewhere. The eastern end of Mr. Phillips's house was about four feet west of the eastern end of the present school building and he claims that he regarded that as the eastern end of his lot. When he owned it, there was a fence from the southeast corner of his house running south to the fortification wall. This fence and the western end of his house formed his eastern boundary. After this lot was\npurchased for a school there was a fence erected at the eastern end running north and south about four feet east of the old building just on the line of the present school building. There never was to the knowledge of the oldest members present any fence farther east than this. It does not appear to me that the road would come as far west as this fence, but as this lot is at the four corners and was not fenced, the public apparently was accustomed to take a short course around this corner. It was established that this corner had always been open for the public and was used as a gathering place for announcements, as it is just across the way from the front of the Church, and the Indians feel aggrieved at having it enclosed and being deprived of it. The fence recently erected on the east side of the school is over forty feet from the end of the building. The Council on behalf of the Indians and themselves desired to have it placed near the foot of the steps being a few feet from the building.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with the four members of the Council who were present they concurred that if the fence was placed at a point four feet west of the flag pole and parallel with the eastern wall of the school building which would be over twenty-two feet from the wall, and if the angle of the fence on the north side was made less sharp they would be satisfied.\n\nMr. Delisle, another member of the Council, was unable to be present. I went, however, to see him with respect to this adjustment and with respect to the claim of his mother to some land on the southeast corner within the recently erected fence. Mr. Delisle was rather obdurate and contended that the Indians would not be satisfied with the fence four feet west of the flag pole. Finally he agreed to the fence being placed six feet west of the\nflag pole which would leave over twenty feet between it and the school building. Mr. Delisle has considerable influence with the members of the band and I thought it advisable that he should be satisfied with whatever proposals were made.\n\nMrs. Delisle, a daughter of Angus Jacobs, whose lands are referred to in the conveyance from James Phillips as bounding Phillips' lot on the south, claims a rectangular piece of land between the east limit of the lot conveyed by Phillips, and the travelled part of the road described as being bounded on the west by a line running northerly from the north point of the east end of the fortification wall at right angles to the said wall a distance of twenty-six (26) feet; and on the north by a line running easterly through this point parallel with the fortification wall to the sidewalk on the westerly side of the travelled road. Mrs. Delisle has no conveyance of this property. It has never been enclosed.\n\nMithel Montour, an old Councillor, stated that some years ago there was a question raised as to Mrs. Delisle's northern boundary and that he representing the Council with the late Agent Brossard indicated where the line was commonly supposed to be. There does not appear to be any record of this to show whether this land was regularly set apart for her or not. There is no reference to it as being on the eastern boundary of the lot sold by Phillips. I cannot say that Mrs. Delisle has no claim neither can I say that her claim was satisfactorily established. Mr. Delisle on behalf of his mother agreed, in consideration of the sum of $25, to have his mother give a quit claim deed of any interest she may have to land within the hereinafter proposed boundary.\n\nThe following is a copy of the\nmemorandum signed by Mr. Delisle setting forth the boundaries and the consideration proposed:\n\n\"1. Front fence of school to be placed six feet west of the flag pole parallel with the eastern wall of school.\"\n\n\"2. North fence to be changed to run from the first post east of the eastern gate post to a point in the fence now existing where said fence is intersected by the proposed front fence.\n\n\"A line is to be drawn from the north corner of the east end of wall at right angles to the wall a distance of 20 feet northerly; a line is to be drawn from this point easterly to the sidewalk at right angles; a line is then to be drawn from the middle of the end of the wall to the point where the last mentioned line intersects the sidewalk.\"\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Delisle quit claim and surrender whatever rights she or he may have to lands within the last mentioned line on the south and the proposed line on the east 6 feet west of Flagpole to the Superintendent General for the sum of twenty-five dollars.\"\n\nI think that the fence on the east half and the south easterly corner might properly be removed and placed on the lines as above set forth in No.1 and No.2, respectively, without special detriment to the school grounds. I would recommend that this be done and that the sum of $25.00 be paid to Mr. and Mrs. Delisle in satisfaction of any claim that they may have to property within these lines.\n\nI am not in sympathy with the proposed change of the north fence as set forth in No.2 above. This change would destroy the symmetry of the boundaries and would narrow up the grounds at a place where there is at present little enough space between the school building and the fence. The roadway is the same width at the corner which it has been suggested should be changed as it is at the north westerly corner of the lot and I do not think that the present fence is any encroachment on the road allowance or that the public will suffer any inconvenience by the fence being where it now stands.\n\n[Signature]\n29th October, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the fence which was recently erected around the Girls' School at Caughnawaga, I beg to say that objection having been made by the Council that this fence enclosed land which in their opinion should be left open to the public, I instructed Mr. Williams of this Department to look into the question of the boundaries of this property and to ascertain where the fence might be placed so as to be satisfactory to the Council and at the same time to leave reasonable space on the easterly end of the school building. Mr. Williams has reported that if the fence is placed on the lines hereinafter set forth that it will be quite satisfactory to the Council and will leave something over twenty feet on the easterly end of the school. The following are the proposed lines for the location of the fence:\n\n1. Front fence of school to be placed six feet west of the flag pole parallel with the eastern wall of school.\n\n2. North fence to be changed to run from the first post east of the eastern gate post to a point in the fence now existing where said fence is intersected by the proposed front fence.\n\n3. A line is to be drawn from the north corner of the east end of wall at right angles to the wall a distance of 26 feet northerly; a line is to be drawn from this point easterly to the sidewalk at right angles; a line is then to be drawn from the middle of the end of the wall to the point where the last mentioned line intersects the sidewalk.\n\nJ. J. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nthe fence to be placed along the last mentioned line from\nthe fortification wall to where this line intersects the\nfence referred to in No.1, above.\n\nI have gone carefully into this matter and have\ndecided that the fence on the east side of the school yard\nshould be removed and placed on the line indicated in No.\n1 above and that the fence on the south easterly side in\nfront of the Delisle's be placed on the land indicated in\nNo.3 above.\n\nI am enclosing a cheque for $25.00 in favour of Mr\nand Mrs. Delisle in satisfaction of any claim they may have\nto land within the above lines, which you will hand to them\non the execution of the quit claim deed in duplicate enclosed\nherein.\n\nWith reference to the proposed change of the north\nfence as referred to in No.2 above, I beg to say that this\nchange would destroy the symmetry of the boundaries and would\nnarrow up the grounds at a place where there appears to be\nat present little enough space between the school building\nand the fence. The roadway at this corner is the same\nwidth as it is at the north westerly corner of the school\nlot. It does not appear that the present fence is any en-\ncroachment on the road, that the public will suffer any in-\nconvenience by the fence being where it now stands.\n\nI have to direct accordingly that this fence on the\nnorth of the school remain as it now is.\n\nIt is desired that you at once secure from the\nCouncil the name of some capable person to perform the work\nof changing the east and south easterly fence to the lines\ndesignated, which work should be commenced at once and that\nyou take charge of the matter to see that the fence\nis properly constructed on the correct lines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nOctober 28\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed petition signed by many Indians of Coughshagan in favor to maintain the fence around the Girls School where it is now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

CHENE,\nDEPARTMENT ENGINEER, dated Sept. 7, 1928,\nfollowing his inspection of Central School,\nCaughnawaga.\n\nOriginal on 5-1-15.\n\nThe fencing should be erected as early as possible to prevent the cattle from roaming around the building, as the artificial stone has been considerably damaged by the cattle during the night, and the ground is unfit for the children to use as playground. Provision should also be made for the cleaning of the school grounds which is filled with large boulders, and for the filling of the holes where stone has been quarried. This work can be done economically by day labour, under the supervision of Mr. Robert, Caretaker of the School.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, [date]\n\nMemo Mr. Ferguson,\n\nThe fencing around the school grounds at Barry's Bay is now complete. The total cost was approximately $1485.00. This was due to the nature of the excavation for the cedar posts which will have to be sunk in solid rock and buried deep in concrete to make a solid and permanent job.\n\nA fair amount of grading could be done for $600.00 if the land is returned to its original state today. The fencing could be carried out by contract more economically.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 11, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nMr. Chene has estimated the cost of fencing the grounds at the new Senior Day School, Caughnawaga, at $1485. The cedar posts would have to be placed in solid rock and then filled in with concrete. As you will remember, we secured several large lots for this school, so that we would eventually have a good playground, not only for the children, but for community purposes. Considerable grading will have to be done in the future, and I am taking note for next year's estimates. Mr. Chene's estimate includes an ornamental gate on the main highway.\n\nThe funds can be found in the Appropriation, for the fencing this year, and I have to recommend that you give your authority to have the work undertaken. Mr. Chene suggests that it be done by contract.\n\nSome additional grading should be done this year around the building, and I wish to recommend that $600 be allowed for this purpose - the work to be done by day labour, under the supervision of Mr. Robert, the efficient engineer-caretaker at the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell J. Perrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nSept. 14, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAnother scholastic year has started with a record most pleasing and encouraging. Could it be otherwise with the splendid school provided by the Department. That the Senior School can rival with any school, even in larger Montana, is what every visitor has said and which I am proud to repeat especially to the officials of the Department of Indian Affairs. Assuredly, the building and its very fine class equipments are worthy of praise. The school rooms are most attractive and inviting, 156 girls and 198 boys were registered the first day. All are in the best of spirits and the year promises to be one of assiduity and application.\n\nI deem it my duty to speak of the grounds around the Senior School which are used as a pasture; the corners of the school also in a dreadful condition, as the animals brush against it and loosen the bricks. The newly white steps in the front would need another cleaning. You can imagine the condition of the grounds, so consequently, the pupils cannot play outside. Do you not think a cheap wire fence around the grounds with a large gate for the front entrance would be advisable.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSIR,\n\nI beg to inform you that an amount of $600.00 is now available for the continuation of the grading of the ground surrounding the Central School at Laughingstone. I understand that Mr. Roberts, the Overseer of the school, already had charge of this kind of work before, and suggest that you request him to undertake this additional grading and levelling work, providing it will not interfere in any way with his duties as Overseer of the Government schools, for which the Department is willing to pay him for the time he actually spends on the work. The wages to be paid to the women are to be those allowed on similar work by the contractors for the building, and it should be understood with the foreman that all possible care is to be taken when grading, in order to protect life and property.\n\nI am advised that the Departmental Engineer has already explained to Mr. Roberts the nature of the work to be carried out, for which the expenditure is provided.\n\nWith reference to the erection of a fence around the school grounds, I beg to say that this matter is not under consideration, and I shall further advise you at a later date as to the Department's decision concerning this addition I wrote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n(No. 10), Volume 6017, File 305-9, part 2)\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 19, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to fencing the grounds at the Senior School, Caughnawaga. I may say that the Department is making arrangements for the erection of this fence this fall. A copy of my letter to Mr. Letourneau in connection with the grounds was directed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant and dealing particularly with its last paragraph, relative to the erecting of a fence around the Senior School playground. I have to suggest that consideration be given by the Department to the question of the expropriation of Village Lot No. 106 and part of Lot No. 105 on which an old barn is erected. An old stone-house is erected on Lot No. 100, and this, together with the above mentioned old barn is of an ugly effect as presently situated almost in front of our beautiful Senior School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Signature]\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n5-1-9 A\n\nOttawa, September 20, 1928.\n\n1: Mr. Ferris\n\n2: Mr. Chas.\n\nMr. Alphonse Barsalou, Laprairie, Que., Contractor, may be employed to erect the fence around the grounds of the new senior day school, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo get his price. Have you considered Steel poles for drilled hole?\nOct. 3, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has under consideration the erection of a suitable fence around the property of the Central Dog School at Loretteville. I understand that Mr. Alphonse Beaudet of Loretteville, etc., would be willing to supervise this work as working foreman. I would ask you, therefore, to communicate with him in order to find out under what conditions he would consent to take charge of the work. In the meantime I would like to be advised by you of the type of fencing which would best suit the location, also the quantity of each type of fence, the number of single and double gates, the number of steel angle posts and round cedar posts, together with any other information you might think necessary so that the order can be placed direct from this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Dupuis of Montreal on behalf of Mr. Lanctot, M.P., when here last week on other Departmental business that a representative of the Department be sent to Caughnawaga to consult with the Indian Agent and Mr. Barsalou on the location and erection of the above mentioned fencing also the choosing of the various materials required, etc. I beg to suggest that Mr. Chene, who is familiar with the local conditions at this school, be requested to attend to this matter as early as convenient.\n\nRussell A. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. Scott. With your permission I shall attend to the above mentioned matter Friday next, while in Caughnawaga in connection with other Departmental Works which are now completed, namely, the extension of the sewer outlet at the Caughnawaga Hospital, and the cleaning of the brick and artificial stone work at the new School, in order that final settlement can be made with the contractors.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOct. 24, 1926.\n\nLee Lotourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\n\nArrange with Boursalou meet Engineer\nFriday noon Central School Congmengon.\n\nJo. D. McLean,\n\nGeo. DIA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOct. 29, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAs per instructions I made arrangements last week when at Caughnawaga in company with Indian Agent Letourneau for the erection of a fence around the Senior School lot. Mr. Alphonse Barasolou of Laprairie has been requested to supervise this work which will be performed by day labour. I will proceed with this fencing during the course of this week. The rate of wages set by him is $10.00 per working day, including board and travelling expenses.\n\nThe fencing will consist of 6\" peeled cedar posts, with galvanized wire fencing 50\" high, made of 9 bar stays, 16\u00bd\" apart, with a top and bottom railing made of 2 x 4\" dressed studding. I would suggest for the front fencing, which is 50' long, that one double gate with two turnstiles built of ornamental steel be installed, similar to that erected around the church property with posts built of brick instead of stone.\n\nThe foreman has requested that a surveyor be sent to Caughnawaga as early as possible to give him the exact location of the proposed fence. I cannot attend to this owing to the disappearance of posts and old fences. I may say that Mr. White of this Department made a survey of this school lot at the time it was acquired.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, 29th October 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that a surveyor from the Department of Indian Affairs will be at Caughnawaga on Tuesday, November 6th. You are requested to meet him and he will endeavour to locate for you the several corners of the lot around the Senior school at Caughnawaga, which it is proposed to fence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.B.

Hodge\n\nHush-a-bye\nlyric by Frank & Sabina\nmusic by Robert Spencer\nOttawa, 7th November 1928\n\nSir,\n\nReport re Senior School lot at Caughnawaga\n\nOn the East side of the Senior School at Caughnawaga when the road is put on the outer side of Lot 91, the fence will be within 25 feet of the corner of the school. This is not desirable.\n\nMrs. Small-fence is the owner of Lot No. 91. When purchasing the other portion of the school lot last year, I endeavoured to get a part of this lot but could not obtain a reasonable price. On No. 6th I secured from Mrs. Small-fence an agreement to sell the portion of the lot which will be required for the school yard and road for the sum of $50.00, which I recommend the Department to purchase.\n\nThe land to be purchased may be described as follows:\n\nThe westerly portion of Lot 91 of the Village of Caughnawaga and described as:- Commencing at a point on the northerly limit of said lot 91 at a distance of sixty seven feet four inches from the North East corner of the said lot; thence westerly along the northern limit of Lot 91 a distance of sixty-two feet to the North West corner; thence southerly along the western limit of Lot 91 sixty-six feet and eight inches more or less, to the South West corner of the lot; thence easterly along the southern limit twenty-seven feet; thence northerly across Lot 91 seventy-nine feet and four inches to the place of commencement.\n\nI would recommend that a Quit Claim deed be prepared for the signature of Mrs. M. Small-fence and sent to Indian Agent Letourneau, accompanied by a cheque in favour of Mrs. Small-fence for the sum of $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 7th November 1928\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of yesterday, I beg to enclose two copies of sketch plan of the Senior School lot at Caughnawaga as it is to be fenced, with the measurements given on each course.

White,\nIng\u00e9nieur du D\u00e9partement qui vient de tracer les alignements pour la cl\u00f4ture qui doit \u00eatre construite autour du terrain de l'\u00e9cole Senior.\n\nEn attendant de recevoir du D\u00e9partement le plan avec la longueur de la cl\u00f4ture \u00e0 construire, je vous prie de bien vouloir m'autoriser \u00e0 faire l'achat des poteaux. Apr\u00e8s m'\u00eatre enquis des fournisseurs de poteaux de cl\u00f4tures, je constate qu'\u00e0 ce temps-ci de l'ann\u00e9e il est impossible d'avoir des poteaux de grosseurs uniformes en quantit\u00e9 suffisante, except\u00e9 cependant de M. Jacques Bourdon, \u00e0 Laprairie, qui peut fournir \u00e0 l'entrepreneur, M. A. Barsalou, 20 poteaux de 10 pieds de longueur pour les places basses sur le terrain en plus d'environ 180 autres poteaux de 7 pieds n\u00e9cessaires pour entourer compl\u00e8tement ce terrain. Ces poteaux ont de 5 \u00e0 6 pouces au petit bout, ce que je crois de grosseur suffisante. Le prix de ces poteaux sont de $1.50 pour les 20 de 10 pieds et les autres sont \u00e0 $1.00 le poteau.\n\nComme je viens de vous le dire, il semble impossible de s'en procurer ailleurs que chez M. Bourdon \u00e0 Laprairie. Comme la saison froide avance rapidement et que l'entrepreneur est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 placer en terre cet automne au moins les poteaux, sinon la pose de la broche qui pourrait se faire au printemps prochain, je vous prie de me r\u00e9pondre imm\u00e9diatement, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence par un t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme, si je suis autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire l'achat des 200 poteaux n\u00e9cessaires aux travaux.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\nSt. Constant, Oct 6th 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI have just met at Caughnawaga Mr. White, Surveyor from the Department who traced the fence line to be built around the property of the Senior school.\n\nBefore the plan is received from the Expert meet with the indication of the length of the fence to be built, I wish you would kindly authorize me to purchase the posts. After an inquiry with the fence post dealers, I found that I can only get them in sufficient quantity and uniform size, but from Mr. M. A. Batelain: 20 posts 10 ft. for the lowest part of the ground and about 1180 posts of 7 ft. to go around the ground. These posts are about 5 or 6 inches at the small end. The price of these posts is $1.50 for the 10 ft. ones and $1.00 for the others.\n\nAs stated above it seems impossible to get them except from Mr. Batelain. As the cold season is setting rapidly and the contractor is ready to put these posts in place for the least and apply the wire next spring, I wish you would send me a reply by wire authorizing me to purchase the 200 posts necessary for this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Lorenzo LeTourneau\n\nP.S. If you advise of color for this fence posts may be given us almost accepted thus an advantage in this case.\n\n(Signed) H. H. Smith\nOttawa, November 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith Quit Claim Deed, in duplicate, for the plot of land which is being acquired from Mrs. M. Smallfence for the use of the Central School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. I have to request that you will have this Deed signed by Mrs. Smallfence, in the presence of a subscribing witness. The witness should make an affidavit of his having witnessed the signature of Mrs. Smallfence. I am enclosing herewith cheque No. 4636 for $50 in favour of Mrs. Smallfence. When she has signed the enclosed deed, in duplicate, you should hand this cheque to her.

All his employees have been paid by himself.\n\nAs far as the posts are considered, it was a little hard to obtain the required number of posts from the same place and at the same time; he had to buy a certain number from here and there in the vicinity; that would explain why he did not produce the bill from each place; but he has bought 188 posts of eight feet, for $1.00 each and you will find all these posts either installed or ready to be, on the ground of the school.\nChambre des Communes\nCanada.\nMontreal, January 16th, 1929.\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Deputy Minister & Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\nYou will find also a bill for carters to carry the material and a bill from Mr. Lawrence McGee for sundries and also a bill from Mr. O. Brisson, blacksmith of Laprairie, the total amounting to the sum of $990.60.\n\nYou will easily find out that owing to the difficulties of the work to be done, that the whole thing has been done speedily and economically, and in the same way as would have done a good \"Pater Familias\".\n\nAs Mr. Barsalou is now sick in bed, and is anxious to receive his well earned money, I would like very much that you see that these bills be paid at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nROCH LANCLOT, P.C.\n\nPlease reply to:\nMr. Vincent Dupuis, advocate,\n152 Notre-Dame East,\nMontreal.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Jan. 23rd. 1927\n\n[Signature]\n\nI regret to be unable to recommend payment of these accounts for services rendered the Central School, etc. It was understood with Mr. Benson that all accounts for materials &c. were to be settled by him with the Superintendent of the school.

This is being done, as it is the usual procedure required by the Auditor General in connection with all accounts passed for payment.\n\nYou may rest assured that there will be no delay with regard to payment when the regulations referred to have been observed.

It was only this morning that I had the chance to have an interview with Mr. Barcelon about this matter. Although he was still sick Mr. Barcelon explained to me that the only receipts he had on hand were the paid cheques representing the salaries paid his employees during the execution of the work.\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding the accounts which I believe shows certify, as follows:\n\n| Voucher | Description       | Amount |\n|---------|-------------------|--------|\n| #1622   | O. Grison         | $44.25 |\n| #1623   | L. Megee          | $8.18  |\n| #1624   | Athanasius Barcelon | $55.77 |\n| #1625   | J. Lafont         | $21.25 |\n\nA total of $1029.40\n\nOf this number of 188 holes delivered on the grounds, 100 were for the larger task set in solid rock with dynamite. 18 of these posts are on the school grounds; they are actually missing. They were evidently taken by the Indians of the neighborhood.\n\nThere are still 10 holes ready to receive the posts.\n\nThe work executed by Mr. Barcelon in the course of last fall, was satisfactory taking into consideration the continuous rain that fell at that time.\n\nI beg to recommend that the above accounts be paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Lorenzo Letourneau\nApril 10, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the third instant, together with a number of accounts, with reference to the fencing of the Central School property on Ojibway Reserve, and in reply I regret to say that the vouchers cannot be given consideration as now submitted. The vouchers for wages, which are being returned, should be purged off the regular pay list forms, in duplicate. The case for materials supplied should already paid or not should be purged in duplicate on the regular voucher forms, mentioning in detail each article for which charge is being made. When these are returned the question of payment will be taken into consideration.\n\nWith regard to the amount of $35.20 sent in to cover damages to an automobile owned by Mr. F. Fontaine of Laprairie, caused by blasting of rock for the fence posts, I understand that instructions were given to the foreman in charge of the work to take every possible precaution to prevent damage of this kind. I should, therefore, be advised whether the Department is actually responsible for the payment of this claim.\n\nWith reference to the accounts amounting to $206.77 enclosed herewith in favour of Mr. Barssen, it is noted that a charge of $99.70 is being made for the transportation of his labourers from Laprairie to Ojibway, although it was clearly understood with Mr. Barssen that the wages of 50 cents per hour allowed to these workers was to include their transportation to and from Ojibway. You should, therefore, prepare new vouchers in duplicate omitting this item. It will also be necessary that I be furnished with accounts in duplicate duly recollected for the material purchased and paid for by Mr. Barssen, for which a charge of $24.2 is being made. This also applies to the accounts from Mr. J. Lafont.\n\nKindly attend to these matters as early as possible in order that the accounts may be settled as soon as possible.\n\nLe Jeune, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nASSISTANT DEPUTY AND SECRETARY.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...

He believes it would cost approximately $560 for the entire work including necessary equipment, dynamite, labor, etc.\n\n1600 ft of wire are required.\n\nWhen purchasing the turnstiles do you not think that six turnstiles for the Eastern and Kateri School of inferior quality could be used, three for Senior School to match the fence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. D. E. Cheng,\nDept. Engineer,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM: SCHOOLS BRANCH.\n\nMay 20, 1929.\n\nI beg to give you the following information concerning the work remaining to be done for the construction of a fence and the cleaning of the ground at the Central School at Gaughanawaga.\n\n8 cedar posts are required at a cost of ........................................... $30.00\nExcavation of 35 holes for posts, at a cost of ........................................... $110.00\n5000 feet of 2 x 4 Dr. railing for nailing of galv. wire fence at top and bottom, put in place ........................................... $350.00\n1600 feet of No 9 heavy galv. steel wire fence with uprights 22\u00bd\" apart at cost of ........................................... $80.00\n1800 feet of galv. barb wire to be placed at top of other fencing ........................................... $12.00\n1 double gate ........................................... $25.00\n5 turnstiles ........................................... $55.00\nOrnamental fencing for front entrance, including 1 double gate and two turnstiles ........................................... $250.00\n\nTotal ........................................... $902.00\n\nWith regard to the clearing of the school lot of large boulders and the levelling of holes, etc., I would recommend that $500.00 be appropriated for this work. This will leave the ground free of all obstructions.\n\nI would suggest that all of the above mentioned work be carried out by day labour under the supervision of the Sister Superior who is familiar with the manner in which the work should be performed.\n\nXX T. Gunt\n\nMAY 21 1929\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMay 21, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that you may purchase the balance of the cedar posts required for the completion of the fencing around the School grounds at the Senior School at Gagniawaga, etc., and arrange also for the installation of these posts and the ones remaining on the grounds. The work is to be carried out by day labour under your personal supervision, with the assistance of Mr. Robert as foreman, who I understand is familiar with the nature of the work which remains to be performed for the improvement of this school property.\n\nYou may obtain competitive prices from local dealers in Montreal for the furnishing of the following materials and place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price delivered on the ground. The necessary fencing made of No 9 heavy galvanized steel wire, 48\" high with uprights 22\" apart, having at least 6 horizontal bars at equal spacing.\n\n1600 feet of No 9 galv. barb wire to be placed on top of the above mentioned fencing together with the necessary staples and other fasteners required.\n\n1 single drive gate similar to those installed at other schools in Gagniawaga, this to be erected at the east side of the lot at the end of the road.\n\n5 turnstiles built of iron pipe strongly constructed to be erected on metal posts anchored in concrete base. The turnstiles and gate to be installed where agreed upon with the Superior of the School.\n\nThe ornamental fencing for the front entrance and the gates will be ordered direct by the Department and shipped to Gagniawaga at a later date, with the necessary instructions for their installation.\n\nWith regard to the clearing and levelling of the school grounds it is desired that you expend, for the present, an amount not exceeding $500.00 for this work, which should be performed in the manner above mentioned, in accordance with instructions already given to Mr. Robert, when the Departmental Engineer last visited the school building.\n\nAs it is important that this school grounds be enclosed as early as possible, I would ask you to have this\nwork completed as early as possible. An advance cheque amounting to $250.00 is being sent you under separate cover which should be used for the payment of wages only, and signed pay lists duly certified to by you and signed by each of the workmen should be sent in each week, with a brief report as to the progress of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLe Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nMay 28, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 21st instant, with regard to the completion of the fencing and other works on the school grounds at the Senior School, at Gagn\u00e9maigne, I beg to say that Mr. Burelou of Lepage should be engaged as foreman to supervise the above mentioned work instead of Mr. Robert, whose name was suggested as the Department was informed that the services of Mr. Burelou could not be secured on account of illness.\n\nIt is understood that you are to purchase the materials and prepare the pay lists, etc., in the usual manner for work performed by day labour.\n\nThe wages to be paid to Mr. Burelou should not exceed those allowed him last year.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this letter and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

A. Barsalou pour la construction de la cl\u00f4ture autour du terrain de l'Ecole Senior \u00e0 Caughnawaga, devraient ce me semble \u00eatre continus sans retard afin d'\u00eatre termin\u00e9s durant la pr\u00e9sente ann\u00e9e scolaire.\n\nM. Alph. Barsalou qui avait charg\u00e9 de ces travaux depuis le commencement est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 les poursuivre dans les d\u00e9lais requis par le D\u00e9partement; il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 les continuer lorsque vous voudrez bien l'y autoriser.\n\nDois-je comprendre que la broche n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette cl\u00f4ture devra \u00eatre command\u00e9e directement par le D\u00e9partement ou si vous voudrez bien m'autoriser \u00e0 faire cet achat. Dans ce cas, vous pourriez peut-\u00eatre m'indiquer le genre de mat\u00e9riel requis.\n\nJe crois devoir recommander que la partie frontale de ce terrain soit cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on plus ornemente et que deux barri\u00e8res de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour pi\u00e9tons \u00e0 part une troisi\u00e8me pour voitures y soit pourvue.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Indiens.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 4, 1923.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWhen the question of completing the fencing and levelling of the new Central School property at Caughnawaga was being considered I was under the impression that Mr. Barsalam, contractor of Laprairie, who had been recommended last year to undertake this work, would not be able to proceed with this work this season on account of illness. The Indian Agent, therefore, was authorized to have it completed by day labour under his supervision and that of the caretaker of the School.\n\nLast week, however, the representative of Mr. Roch Lecotot, called at this office and strongly urged that all previous instructions to the Indian Agent in connection with this proposed work be cancelled and that Mr. Barsalam be given an opportunity to carry out the remainder of the work under the same arrangements as last year with the exception of the furnishing of the materials, for which the Agent has asked competitive prices. Mr. Barsalam is to furnish his own staff of workmen and render his account weekly to Indian Agent Letourneau same as is being done for the general repairing of the other schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve by the Clovis Electric Co. of Montreal, general contractors, who were recommended by Mr. Lecotot and his representative. As I was entirely satisfied with the manner in which the work was carried out last year, I beg to recommend that it be again entrusted to Mr. Barsalam.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, June 6, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of May 28, 1929, concerning the completion of the fencing around the school ground of the Senior School at Caughnawaga, I beg to say that you may ask Mr. Barsalou of Laprairie to undertake the above mentioned work under the same arrangement as was done last year, and to see that the work is carried out in accordance with instructions given you by the Departmental Engineer when last visiting the above mentioned building in your company last week, with the understanding that you are to purchase materials required as already mentioned in my communication of the 28th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nQue.\nSt. Constant, P.Q.,\n28 mai 1929\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'accuser r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 21 courant relativement au projet de completion des travaux \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture entourant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9cole Senior \u00e0 Caughnawaga.\n\nLors de ma visite \u00e0 Caughnawaga, le 25 courant, j'ai entrevu M. Robert \u00e0 ce sujet et il n'a pas voulu me rendre une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9cisive ce jour-l\u00e0 quant \u00e0 son acceptation pour prendre charge de ces travaux. Cependant, il m'a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres travaux et que si vous vouliez bien lui accorder jusqu'\u00e0 vers le 10\u00e8me jour du mois de juin prochain pour commencer ce travail \u00e0 cette cl\u00f4ture, il serait alors dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 lui apporter l'attention n\u00e9cessaire; ce \u00e0 quoi je lui ai r\u00e9pondu que pourvu que le tout soit termin\u00e9 dans le cours du mois de juin, je crois que le D\u00e9partement serait satisfait.\n\nJe profite de cette occasion pour vous demander s'il ne serait pas pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'installer une barri\u00e8re genre tourniquet sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 Est du terrain, au lieu d'une barri\u00e8re simple comme celles qui sont actuellement install\u00e9es aux autres \u00e9coles; pour la raison que cette barri\u00e8re simple serait souvent laiss\u00e9e ouverte tandis que le genre tourniquet donnerait plus satisfaction.\n\nDois-je comprendre, lorsque vous mentionnez cinq (5) tourniquets, que de ce nombre seront aussi compris ceux qui seront install\u00e9s dans la partie frontale ou si le plan de cette partie frontale ornementale comprendra m\u00eame les barri\u00e8res genre tourniquet. Dans ce cas, une\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\nseule barri\u00e8re tourniquet au c\u00f4t\u00e9 Est serait suffisante,\nsinon, il en faudrait alors trois (3) et seraient plac\u00e9es\ncomme suit, deux dans la partie frontale et une au c\u00f4t\u00e9\nEst du terrain.\n\nJ'accuse aussi r\u00e9ception du Ch\u00e8que du D\u00e9partement\nau montant de $500.00 qui sera employ\u00e9 exclusivement pour\nle nivellement et l'embellissement du terrain entourant\nl'\u00e9cole Senior.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Indiens.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire-\nDepartment des Affaires des Sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., concerning the proposal of completing the work to the fence surrounding the property of the Senior School at Caughnawaga.\n\nDuring my visit at Caughnawaga, on the 25th Inst., I met Mr. Robert about this matter and he did not want to give me a final reply that day concerning his acceptance of taking charge of that work. However, he let me understand that he was very busy at other work and that he wanted to wait until the 10th of June next to start the fence; he would then be able to give it all the necessary attention; to this I replied that if the work could be terminated during the course of June, I thought the Department would be satisfied.\n\nI take this occasion to ask you if it would not be preferable to install a gate of the turnstile kind on the East side of the land instead of a single gate like those installed at present at the other schools; for that reason that the single gate would be left open when the turnstile would be more satisfactory.\n\nShould I understand, when you mention 5 turnstiles, that in this number will be also comprised those that will be installed by the front part? or if the plan of the erected front of this building includes at all any turnstile. In this case one (only) turnstile on the East side would\nbe sufficient, otherwise three of them would be sufficient required and should be placed as follows: two in the front and one on the East side of the ground.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the Departmental cheque for $50.00 which will be used exclusively for the levelling and embellishment of the ground surrounding the Indian school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, June 14th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum.

Chene.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nReplying to your favor of the 24th inst., referring to fence and gates at the Central School Grounds, Gaugimouage, P.Q.\n\nKindly allow us to draw your attention to the fact that the school authorities are desirous of procuring a fence of the same design and construction as the one which we have recently erected on the United Church of Canada's property, which as you are aware adjoins the school property.\n\nThe above is also in accordance with the instructions of the Indian Agent, Mr. Letourneau at St. Constant, P.Q.\n\nAlso, frontage mentioned on the school grounds along the main highway measures 66'0\" and not 55'0\" as per your letter. This includes the three gates referred to.\n\nEnclosed please find out showing the style of fence which we have recently erected.\n\nThanking you, and awaiting the pleasure of your further command, we remain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE JOHNSON WIRE WORKS LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.:\nENTIEREMENT CANADIENNE,\nUNE POUR CHAQUE USAGE\n\nL'entreprise qui deviennent les plus populaires de temps parce que le fil n'est pas assez durci, mais dans la Cl\u00f4ture Frost, le fil est tremp\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re que le degr\u00e9 de duret\u00e9 requis soit obtenu, et, en plus, il est parfaitement galvanis\u00e9 dans nos usines; ce qui assure un service maximum\u2014cependant, cette cl\u00f4ture ne vous co\u00fbte pas plus \u00e0 la tonne que le prix du fer ordinaire.\n\nLes machines modernes tissent la cl\u00f4ture de mani\u00e8re que tous les fils horizontaux soient d'une longueur et d'une tension uniformes, et l'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 de la longue utilisation, garde la cl\u00f4ture droite dans toutes les conditions atmosph\u00e9riques, et la fait resister aux chocs subits que lui donnent les chevaux et autres bestiaux.\n\nLe n\u0153ud-Juste est notre Marque de Fabricre brevet\u00e9e. Elle distingue la Cl\u00f4ture Frost depuis 18 ans. N'acceptez pas de substitut.\n\nChaque proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans la transformation des tiges d'acier, premi\u00e8rement en fil et ensuite en cl\u00f4ture, nous donne une nouvelle m\u00e9thode, de sorte que nous conservons la qualit\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re absolue. L'\u00e9norme production de nos usines nous permet ainsi de faire au plus bas prix et de vendre notre cl\u00f4ture avec une petite marge de profit par perte, calculant notre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice sur la grande quantit\u00e9 que nous vendons annuellement.\n\nLe service excellent que donnent nos agents, provient des raisons suivantes:\n\n1. Ils gardent un stock tr\u00e8s assur\u00e9. Vous pouvez donc examiner la cl\u00f4ture et juger de sa bonne condition. Il vous suffit simplement de faire une demande.\n\n2. Un de vos voisins est notre Vendeur dans votre localit\u00e9. Vous le connaissez bien sans doute. Il vous donnera de l'aide et vous fera des suggestions quand vous serez pr\u00eat \u00e0 acheter; il vous dira le genre de cl\u00f4ture qui conviendra le mieux \u00e0 l'usage que vous voulez en faire, et vous aidera \u00e0 la poser si n\u00e9cessaire.\n\n3. Nos Vendeurs peuvent garantir une satisfaction absolue, puisqu'ils sont soutenus par la plus grande Fabrique de Cl\u00f4ture au Canada. Nous manufacturons de la cl\u00f4ture depuis plus de 25 ans et nous avons \u00e9tabli une splendide r\u00e9putation. Ce renom, depuis si longtemps connu, est votre garantie d'une excellente satisfaction et d'un service parfait.\n\nCette \u00e9tiquette jaune est mise seulement sur la cl\u00f4ture Frost avant qu'elle ne quitte nos usines. Elle est inscrite sur le rouleau. C'est votre garantie d'une excellente qualit\u00e9.\n\nFROST STEEL AND WIRE COMPANY, LIMITED\nHAMILTON, CANADA\nNOTRE MARQUE DE FABRIQUE EST VOTRE GARANTIE\n\nCe lien ou n\u0153ud perfectionn\u00e9 est la Marque de Fabrique qui distingue favorablement d\u2019un Oc\u00e9an \u00e0 l\u2019autre, la cl\u00f4ture Frost enti\u00e8rement de fil No. 9. Il tient les fils de mani\u00e8re qu\u2019ils ne puissent glisser\u2014cependant le fil horizontal n\u2019a pas de petites coques (faux plis) et l\u2019\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 ou ressort du fil se conserve donc d\u2019un poteau \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\n\nLE RESSORT DE LA LONGUE ONDULATION EST UNE AUTRE CARACTERISTIQUE FROST\n\nLe ressort de l\u2019ondulation et la trempe du fil forment deux points principaux du corps de la cl\u00f4ture Frost. Cette solidit\u00e9, tient la Cl\u00f4ture bien tendue d\u2019ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e et lui permet de r\u00e9sister aux chocs subits que lui donnent les animaux.\n\nLa Cl\u00f4ture Frost est celle qui ressemble le plus aux anciennes cl\u00f4tures faites \u00e0 la main avec du fil ondul\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a pas une autre cl\u00f4ture qui a meilleur aspect sur les poteaux ou qui retient sa forme aussi bien. D\u00e8s le commencement, \u00e0 partir des tiges d\u2019acier jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la terminaison de notre cl\u00f4ture, nous avons un seul objet en vue dans sa fabrication : soit, une qualit\u00e9 premi\u00e8re, une valeur exceptionnelle et plusieurs ann\u00e9es de service.\n\nChaque rouleau est bien inspect\u00e9 durant sa fabrication, de sorte que chaque n\u0153ud est parfait et la longueur est exacte.\n\nCLOTURE FROST AVEC NOEUD ROND (Calibre No. 9 1/4)\n\nCette cl\u00f4ture est fabriqu\u00e9e pour fournir \u00e0 la demande pour une cl\u00f4ture lourde et durable, mais \u00e0 un prix plus bas que celle en fil No. 9. Elle est en fil d\u2019acier dur parfaitement galvanis\u00e9 dans nos usines.\n\nEtant un peu plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re que la No. 9 et tiss\u00e9e plus rapidement, nous pouvons la vendre \u00e0 meilleur march\u00e9 et donner au client, une aussi bonne valeur pour son argent que n\u2019importe quelle cl\u00f4ture d\u2019autre marque offerte \u00e0 un prix analogue. Chaque fil soutient une tension de 1500 livres.\n\nFABRIQUEE DANS LES STYLES SUIVANTS POUR TOUT USAGE\n\n| Fils horizontaux | Hauteur | Espaces |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| 5               | 40\"     | 10, 10, 10, 10 pouces |\n| 6               | 30\"     | 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 pouces |\n| 6               | 40\"     | 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 pouces |\n| 7               | 40\"     | 4\u00bd, 5\u00bd, 6, 6\u00bd, 8, 9\u00bd pouces |\n| 7               | 48\"     | 5, 6\u00bd, 7\u00bd, 9, 10, 10 pouces |\n| 8               | 41\"     | 4, 5\u00bd, 6, 6\u00bd, 8 pouces (\u00e0 moutons) |\n| 8               | 42\"     | 5\u00bd, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\u00bd pouces |\n| 8               | 47\"     | 5, 6, 6\u00bd, 7\u00bd, 7\u00bd, 8\u00bd pouces |\n| 9               | 36\"     | 3, 3, 3\u00bd, 4, 5, 5\u00bd, 6, 6 pouces (pour porcs) |\n| 9               | 48\"     | 5\u00bd, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\u00bd pouces (espaces \u00e9gaux) |\n| 9               | 47\"     | 3\u00bd, 4, 5, 5\u00bd, 6, 7, 7\u00bd, 8\u00bd pouces (espaces gradu\u00e9s) |\n| 9               | 48\"     | 3\u00bd, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7\u00bd, 8 pouces |\n| 10              | 48\"     | 3\u00bd, 3\u00bd, 4, 4\u00bd, 5, 6, 6\u00bd, 7, 8 pouces |\n\n(Noeud-juste)\n(Noeud-rond)\n(des deux types)\nJOLIES CLOTURES POUR PELOUSES\n\nLe style \"S\" qu'on voit sur la page pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, est le plus populaire. Les espaces du bas sont seulement de 1/8\", et les montants repli\u00e9s dans la partie inf\u00e9rieure, lui donnent un tr\u00e8s joli aspect. Hautes \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes hauteurs jusqu'\u00e0 6'.\n\nDEUX AUTRES BONS MODELES:\n\nStyle \"L\"\u2014espaces de 2/8\". Diff\u00e9rentes hauteurs jusqu'\u00e0 60\"\n\nStyle \"LP\"\u2014espaces de 1/8\". Diff\u00e9rentes hauteurs jusqu'\u00e0 60\"\n\nCes cl\u00f4tures am\u00e9liorent beaucoup le devant d'une r\u00e9sidence, etc., et sont bien sup\u00e9rieures aux cl\u00f4tures en planches pour les cours, car elles laissent p\u00e9n\u00e9trer le soleil et l'air et servent de jolis treillis pour les fleurs ou vignes. Les fils horizontaux sont form\u00e9s de deux fils du calibre No. 13, bien tordus en c\u00e2ble; les montants sont en fil No. 9, bien enlac\u00e9s dans le c\u00e2ble.\n\nElles sont tiss\u00e9es sur des m\u00e9tiers automatiques qui assurent l'uniformit\u00e9 du haut et une distance \u00e9gale entre les montants. Elles sont faciles \u00e0 tendre et restent droites sur les poteaux.\n\nBARRE SANS INTERRUPTION POUR SOMMET\n\nCette barre de sommet, employ\u00e9e avec des poteaux de ligne, forme \"U\" et des poteaux ronds de 2\" aux bouts et aux barri\u00e8res, donne plus d'\u00e9clat \u00e0 l'aspect de ces cl\u00f4tures pour pelouses. Avec des poteaux de bois, on doit mettre une planche au sommet.\n\nCLOTURE EN PIQUETS D'ACIER ANGULAIRE\n\nD'UNE APPARENCE MASSIVE ET RECHERCHEE.\n\nSont pour une institution publique, soit pour une r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e, cette cl\u00f4ture en acier angulaire, embo\u00eete un terrain quelconque tout en assurant une protection parfaite pour plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n\nOn l'emploie largement pour cimeti\u00e8res, \u00e9glises, cours d'\u00e9coles, terrains comm\u00e9moratifs, parcs, biblioth\u00e8ques, h\u00f4pitaux, usines, etc. On peut dire qu'il n'est presque pas possible de casser ces piquets angulaires. Toutes les hauteurs voulues jusqu'\u00e0 6 et 7 pieds peuvent \u00eatre obtenues.\n\nDes barri\u00e8res simples ou doubles se fabriquent pour l'appareiller.\n\nPeinture. Nous lui donnons une couche premi\u00e8re, mais une fois pos\u00e9, on conseille de bien peindre le tout avec une bonne peinture imperm\u00e9able.\n\nLes piquets sont de 3/4\" (ou 1 pouce) et passent \u00e0 travers un V entaill\u00e9 dans les barres horizontales. Ils sont rivet\u00e9s bien serr\u00e9ment \u00e0 chaque barre, et d'ordinaire, 3 pi\u00e8ces de diam\u00e8tre. Ces barres horizontales sont en acier angulaire de 2\". Pour les cl\u00f4tures de plus de 5 pieds de haut, les barres sont avec un mat\u00e9riel de 3 pouces. Cette cl\u00f4ture est mise en panneaux de 8 pieds de long, et chaque panneau comprend un poteau de 2\" de ligne.\n\nDEMANDEZ LA CIRCULAIRE SUR LA CLOTURE EN ACIER ANGULAIRE.\nBARRIERES SOLIDES POUR FERME\n\nLe cadre est en tuyau d'acier de 1/4\", galvanis\u00e9 et soud\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Nous fabriquons aussi une barri\u00e8re plus lourde avec cadre de 2\". Remplissage en fil No. 9 avec Noeud-Juste et fil de support pos\u00e9 diagonalement. Les barri\u00e8res ayant 12 pieds de long, ou plus, ont deux supports tubulaires.\n\nElles sont fournies avec gonds filet\u00e9s de toute la longueur et deux \u00e9crans avec rondelles pour permettre qu'on les ajuste \u00e0 volont\u00e9. Les loquets se ferment seuls.\n\nVous pouvez facilement voir que les Barri\u00e8res Frost sont faites pour le service journalier et dur qu'on en attend. Nous sommes les plus gros fabricants de barri\u00e8res au Canada et nous en manufacturons pour tout usage.\n\nL'illustration montre le poteau angulaire avec soutiens (Voir la description des poteaux). Comme ils se posent dans du b\u00e9ton ils sont solides tout en \u00e9tant jolis. Si des poteaux de bois sont employ\u00e9s, ils doivent \u00eatre d'au moins 8\" de grosseur et bien ancr\u00e9s avec de bons appuis \u00e0 la base, afin qu'ils ne se d\u00e9placent pas.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 tous leurs bons points, les Barri\u00e8res Frost ne coutent pas plus que les autres.\n\nARCH\u00c9 D'ENTREE\u2014BARRIERES ET CLOTURE STYLE \"S\" POUR PELOUSES\n\nPour une entr\u00e9e de voitures aux r\u00e9sidences, parcs, cimeti\u00e8res, etc., les barri\u00e8res doubles Frost conviennent surtout. Nous les fabriquons aussi simples, si d\u00e9sir\u00e9es.\n\nL'arche de fantaisie avec nom est plut\u00f4t attrayante pour cimeti\u00e8res, parcs ou terrains comm\u00e9moratifs. Une telle arche peut \u00eatre aussi faite en acier angulaire pour appareiller la cl\u00f4ture en piquets angulaires. Un grand nombre de ces arches se trouvent dans Ontario et Quebec. (Demandez la circulaire sur la cl\u00f4ture en piquets angulaires.)\n\nLes poteaux de l'arche sont en gros tuyau de 3\", assez hauts pour permettre \u00e0 tous genres de v\u00e9hicules, y compris les corbillards, de passer. Les barri\u00e8res doubles peuvent \u00eatre faites pour un espace de 10 ou 12 pieds. Le remplissage est toujours pour convenir au type de cl\u00f4ture qu'on pose. Ces arches co\u00fbtent moins que celles faites de fer brut.\nCES CLOTURES GARDENT LES PLUS PETITS\nPOULETS ET CE SONT SURTOUT CES\nVOLAILES QUI REQUIERENT PROTECTION\n\nCette cl\u00f4ture a les espaces du bas plus \u00e9troits que ceux\ndu fillet l\u00e9ger \u00e0 volailles, et dure beaucoup plus longtemps.\nElle ne requiert pas non plus de planche de soutien, ni haut\nni au bas. Faite en fil d'acier dur du calibre No. 15\u00bd, except\u00e9\nle fil du haut et du bas qui est du No. 12, elle renferme la force\net la protection \u00e0 un co\u00fbt minimum. Depuis les quelques\nann\u00e9es qu'elle est offerte sur le march\u00e9, plusieurs wagons\ncomplets se vendent annuellement.

Par\nun arrangement sp\u00e9cial que nous avons avec cette publication,\nnous pouvons fournir gratuitement, sur demande, ces plans\nimprim\u00e9s.

Nous fournissons, \u00e0 bas prix, un capuchon en fonte pour enfouir ces poteaux. Ils sont en acier \u00e0 haut carbone, et la forme \"U\" leur permet de bien adh\u00e9rer au sol. La longueur r\u00e9guli\u00e8re est de 7' 3\", mais on les fournit aussi de 8' 3\" ou 6' 3\".\n\nLes liens ou attaches (comme on le voit) co\u00fbtent tr\u00e8s peu et l'outil \u00e0 lier est gratuit.\n\nLe co\u00fbt de ces poteaux, une fois pos\u00e9s, est moindre que pour poteaux en bois, et les poteaux en acier ne brulent pas, sans compter qu'ils sont de bien meilleur go\u00fbt.\n\nLes poteaux-protecteurs pour les vergers, les jardins, les biens-immobiliers de campagne, ont un bras oblique pour supporter deux ou trois rangs de fil barbel\u00e9.\n\nPOTEAUX ANGULAIRES POUR COINS ET BOUTS\n\nCes poteaux avec leurs supports, sont les meilleurs qu'on puisse poser aux coins et bouts d'une cl\u00f4ture. Comme il doivent \u00eatre fixes dans du b\u00e9ton, ils ne peuvent se d\u00e9placer, par cons\u00e9quent, ils tiennent la cl\u00f4ture toujours droite et bien tendue. On les emploie largement sur les Routes Nationales et ils vont bien avec les poteaux de ligne, forme \"U\".\n\nLes poteaux pour bouts et pour barri\u00e8res ont naturellement un support d'un seul c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n\nAUTRES PRODUITS FROST\n\nDEMANDEZ LES CIRCULAIRES.\n\nCLOTURE FROST EN CHAINONS QUI COMPREND\n\nCl\u00f4ture de protection pour les usines,\nPartitions pour usines,\nPartitions d'\u00e9tables,\nCl\u00f4ture \u00e0 renards,\nArr\u00eats pour cours de lawn-tennis,\n\nFIL D'ACIER:\n\nAttaches et fil \u00e0 foin,\nFil barbel\u00e9, ondul\u00e9 et fil d'attache,\nCrampons galvanis\u00e9s ou reluisants (bright)\nFil recuit et huil\u00e9\nFil galvanis\u00e9\u2014dur ou mou\nFil reluisant et recuit.\nFil \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe\nNouveau Tendeur Frost, per\u00e7oirs de trous et autres outils \u00e0 cl\u00f4ture.\n\nACCESSOIRES POUR TERRAINS DE RECREATION\u2014APPAREILS COMPLETS\n\nVENDEUR LOCAL:\nTHE STEEL COMPANY OF CANADA, LIMITED\nMONTREAL GENERAL OFFICES\n\nMONTREAL, CANADA le 20 juin 1929.\n\nM.

En continuant la comparaison entre les deux du m\u00eame c\u00f4t\u00e9 les b\u00eates de race avec la cl\u00f4ture Invincible et de l'autre les troupeaux communs avec les cl\u00f4tures manufactur\u00e9es de billettes ou de tiges achet\u00e9es un peu partout, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, au hasard des bas prix.\n\nEn employant la cl\u00f4ture Invincible cette ann\u00e9e encore vous affirmeriez une sage coutume dans les achats de cl\u00f4ture, et votre geste confirmerait l'exp\u00e9rience de la majorit\u00e9 des cultivateurs canadiens, \u00e0 qui, depuis vingt ans la cl\u00f4ture Invincible donne satisfaction compl\u00e8te et durable.\n\nLE FIL\n\nLa cl\u00f4ture Invincible est fabriqu\u00e9e de notre propre fil d'acier Open Hearth, pur, dur et fort \u2014 le fil d'acier reconnu \u00eatre le mieux qualifi\u00e9 pour faire de la bonne cl\u00f4ture.\n\nLe minerai, le coke et la pierre \u00e0 chaux sont d'abord charg\u00e9s dans les hauts-fourneaux et l\u00e0 ils sont transform\u00e9s en fer en guesse, qui \u00e0 son tour dans les fournaisses Open Hearth est raffin\u00e9 en acier. Le fer en guesse en plus de contenir du fer contient aussi d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments, \u00e0 savoir le soufre et le phosphore, qui, si leur concentration est trop importante ou si certains affecte la qualit\u00e9 de l'acier et par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 Open Hearth leurs influences sont dos\u00e9es ou \u00e9limin\u00e9es au besoin. Le soufre et le phosphore tendent \u00e0 amoindrir la qualit\u00e9 de l'acier \u2014 le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 Open Hearth les nullifie tous deux et produit un acier plus fort, plus dur, plus pur, et d'autant mieux pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 de la rouille que son uniformit\u00e9 retient la galvanisation sur tous les points.\n\nQuand l'acier a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 point dans les fournaisses Open Hearth il est coul\u00e9 en lingots et ensuite subit les diff\u00e9rents proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de laminage, \u00e9tant successivement bloom, billette et tige. Enfin il est treill\u00e9 \u00e0 froid, galvanis\u00e9 et tiss\u00e9 en cl\u00f4ture. Pendant chacune de ces op\u00e9rations une inspection incessante et rigoureuse veille \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9.\n\nCHEZ VOTRE FOURNISSEUR LA CL\u00d4TURE INVINCIBLE\nLa galvanisation et la dur\u00e9e de la cl\u00f4ture\n\nPour faire une bonne cl\u00f4ture il faut commencer par employer de l'acier de bonne qualit\u00e9, mais ce mat\u00e9riel n'\u00e9tant pas enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de la rouille, il faut le prot\u00e9ger par une couche de zinc.\n\nAvec son fil d'acier galvanis\u00e9, The Steel Company of Canada, s'est acquis une r\u00e9putation sans rivale, r\u00e9putation qui s'appuie sur une exp\u00e9rience de plus d'un demi-si\u00e8cle dans les fils galvanis\u00e9s pour tous usages. Parmi les plus expos\u00e9s aux intemp\u00e9ries, elle compte par milliers les r\u00e9servoirs de ferme, de terrains de sport, de cabanes, etc., dont les probl\u00e8mes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solus. Les recherches, les efforts et les succ\u00e8s d'un personnel averti et consciencieux pendant cinquante ans nous valent une installation de grande efficacit\u00e9 qui est une garantie pour l'acheteur des cl\u00f4tures Invincible. Le fil de la cl\u00f4ture Invincible est de la grosseur la plus pratique pour le Canada et il est recouvert d'une \u00e9paisse couche du meilleur zinc qui lui assure la dur\u00e9e sous les plus exigeantes conditions atmosph\u00e9riques.\n\nLe Tissage\n\nLa cl\u00f4ture est surtout expos\u00e9e \u00e0 trois cat\u00e9gories d'\u00e9preuves : les multiples changements de temp\u00e9rature ; l'\u00e9tat rocailleux, montagneux ou in\u00e9gal du sol ; les chocs brusques et les tensions violentes ; toutes ces \u00e9preuves exigent de l'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 dans la construction de la cl\u00f4ture. Pour la cl\u00f4ture Invincible les fils larges sont enduits (voir vignette). Cette ondulation donne au fil l'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 voulue pour \"pr\u00eater\" au besoin et assez de ressort pour revenir d'aplomb quand la tension est pass\u00e9e.\n\nLe N\u0153ud\n\nLe n\u0153ud est une des parties vitales d'une bonne cl\u00f4ture, car en plus de bien tenir les fils en place, il doit se pr\u00eater \u00e0 une grande flexibilit\u00e9. Par sa formation serr\u00e9e, le n\u0153ud Invincible a une prise solide sur les fils. Il ne conserve aucune humidit\u00e9 qui produirait de la rouille et il est de m\u00eame jauge que les fils qu'il relie. C'est une force l\u00e0 o\u00f9 certaines cl\u00f4tures ont leur point faible.\n\nNotre M\u00e9thode de Vente\n\nLes cl\u00f4tures et barri\u00e8res Invincible parviennent au cultivateur par la voie la plus \u00e9conomique. Un seul manufacturier, un seul fret (en char ordinairement) et un petit profit \u00e0 votre distributeur local.\n\nLes cl\u00f4tures et barri\u00e8res Invincible sont vendues dans tout le Canada... et pr\u00e8s de chez vous.\n\nNotre Garantie\n\nNous garantissons en tous points le mat\u00e9riel de la cl\u00f4ture Invincible comme \u00e9tant du meilleur acier Open Hearth bien galvanis\u00e9 dont la dur\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue bien sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 tous les autres. Nous en garantissons aussi la fabrication sous tous rapports\u2014fils \u00e9gaux, supports droits, maillons forts et solides, etc. Que la cl\u00f4ture Invincible, comme son nom l'indique, ne peut \u00eatre surpass\u00e9e.\n\nLongueur des Rouleaux\n\nToute la cl\u00f4ture de ferme est en rouleaux de 20, 30 et 40 perches. La cl\u00f4ture \u00e0 volailles est en rouleaux de 10, 20 et 30 perches.\n\n| Perches | Pieds |\n|---------|-------|\n| 10      | 165   |\n| 20      | 330   |\n| 30      | 495   |\n| 40      | 660   |\n\nPour Vous Servir\n\n27 styles de cl\u00f4ture et 3 longueurs de rouleaux pour chacun ; c'est un assortiment de 81 grosses piles de cl\u00f4ture. Il nous arrive rarement de manquer des longueurs demand\u00e9es. Pourtant, \u00e7a s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu certains printemps. \u00c0 moins d'avis contraire, nous fournissons alors, dans le m\u00eame style, les longueurs en stock\u2014ce, afin de ne pas retarder les exp\u00e9ditions.\n\nCette cl\u00f4ture tiss\u00e9e a toutes les qualit\u00e9s indispensables d'une bonne cl\u00f4ture sans avoir les inconv\u00e9nients des anciennes cl\u00f4tures de perche ou \u00e0 jambette, de roches ou de souches.\n\nQuelques-uns de ses avantages reconnus sont :\n\n- Infranchissable et permanente\n- Pas de r\u00e9parations co\u00fbteuses\n- Ni mauvaises herbes ni insectes nuisibles\n\nEt surtout, le cultivateur qui a de bonnes cl\u00f4tures dort confiant la nuit, car il est s\u00fbr que ses animaux n'iront pas ravager sa r\u00e9colte ni celles de ses voisins. De toutes fa\u00e7ons, une bonne cl\u00f4ture augmente la valeur de la ferme.\nCl\u00f4ture Invincible \u2014 Style 540-0\n5 fils horizontaux, 40 pouces de hauteur, 22 pouces entre les supports.

Au cours de l'ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e, l'adoption de notre tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 a valu aux barri\u00e8res Invincible une autre am\u00e9lioration tr\u00e8s sensible.\n\nPour la fabrication des cadres des barri\u00e8res on n'emploie que du tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9, et ce, pour donner \u00e0 la galvanisation une duret\u00e9 encore plus grande. On appelle tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 parce qu'on a enlev\u00e9 les \u00e9caillles de la surface que de l'\u00e9rosion ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es. Les surfaces parfaitement lisses obtenues de la sorte permettent \u00e0 la galvanisation de s'appliquer uniform\u00e9ment sur toute la surface de la barri\u00e8re sans le risque de voir des \u00e9caillles se d\u00e9tacher, mettant le tuyau \u00e0 nu et l'exposant \u00e0 la rouille.\n\nDepuis longtemps, les barri\u00e8res Invincible sont renomm\u00e9es pour leur force sans \u00e9galiser, pour leur durabilit\u00e9 et leur \"galvanisation \u00e0 chaud\". Avec le grand avantage que leur ajoutent le tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 et la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 incontestable des coins carr\u00e9s, le choix de l'acheteur est tout indiqu\u00e9.\n\nEt si l'apparence compte pour quelque chose, pr\u00ealez d'\u00e9tudier la barri\u00e8re illustr\u00e9e ci-dessous :\n\n- tissage en fil d'acier galvanis\u00e9 et ondule No 9.\n- supports en tuyau soud\u00e9s au cadre faisant de la structure enti\u00e8re une forte charpente en acier.\n- les gonds et le loquet sont de telle sorte que la barri\u00e8re ouvre et ferme sans effort et que le poteau \u00e9tant charg\u00e9 \u00e9galement par le sommet et par la base n'est plus expos\u00e9 \u00e0 pencher.\n- gonds et loquet sont fournis avec chaque barri\u00e8re.\n\n| Largeur entre les poteaux | Hauteur |\n|---------------------------|---------|\n| 3 pieds                    | 42 pouces |\n| 4                        | 48 pouces |\n| 5                        | 48 pouces |\n| 6                        | 48 pouces |\n| 7                        | 48 pouces |\n| 8                        | 48 pouces |\n| 9                        | 48 pouces |\n| 10                       | 48 pouces |\n\nLa largeur donn\u00e9e est la distance exacte entre les poteaux.

Ainsi, seul, cet appui est donc une force additionnelle et ne permet pas \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re de fl\u00e9chir, ni de se tordre; d\u00e9fauts ordinaires des barri\u00e8res \u00e0 coins ronds.\n\nDes barri\u00e8res \u00e0 coins pentur\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies en grand nombre aux chemins de fer canadiens qui en sont les plus grands utilisateurs.

Ainsi dispos\u00e9s, les deux gonds sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s \u00e0 la plus grande distance possible. La tension sur le gond du haut est compens\u00e9e par la pression sur le gond du bas.

Les cours des \u00e9coles sont l'objet d'\u00e9tudes s\u00e9rieuses et partout l'on admet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de les entourer d'une cl\u00f4ture r\u00e9sistante.

La cl\u00f4ture Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene offre toute la protection voulue, m\u00eame aux voitures qui tenteraient de l'enfoncer. Sous le coup d'un grand choc le grillage c\u00e8de imperceptiblement \u00e0 chaque maille, mais ne rompt pas.

Pour les renards, la cl\u00f4ture Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene est tout \u00e0 fait indiqu\u00e9e; elle subit sans jamais c\u00e9der les assauts d'une ou de plusieurs b\u00eates et ses parois lisses ne peuvent endommager la fourrure. Alors que le treillis ordinaire se brise vite parce que sa galvanisation casse d\u00e8s que sont pli\u00e9s ses joints inflexibles \u00e0 triple torsion, le grillage Invincible articul\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre ni d\u00e9chir\u00e9 ni des chocs, ni du pliage. Pris en main de la mani\u00e8re qu'on forme m\u00eame et une galvanisation suffisante le grillage Invincible fait des cages et des enclos de tout repos pour le propri\u00e9taire et d'absolue s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les renards qui ne peuvent s'y blesser, ni y faire de trous pour marauder.\n\nLa charpente des cages et enclos Invincible pour les renards est faite de tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9. (Voir \u00e0 la page 14 quelle am\u00e9lioration repr\u00e9sente le tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9.) Le fait que la barre de sommet est d'un seul morceau donne \u00e0 la cage une rigidit\u00e9 beaucoup plus grande et pr\u00e9vient tout fl\u00e9chissement. Le tuyau n'ayant pas d'angle n'expose pas les animaux aux blessures. Les c\u00f4t\u00e9s et la couverture sont faits ensemble \u00e0 la barre de sommet.\n\nD\u00e9tails:\n\nMailles de 1\u00bd pouce, fil d'acier Open Hearth des jauge 14 ou 12.

Une cl\u00f4ture r\u00e9sistante, persistante et \u00e9conomique s'impose. La sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de ce grillage sur le treillis ordinaire est ind\u00e9niable, non seulement pour sa longue dur\u00e9e et son faible co\u00fbt d'entretien, mais parce que jamais il ne s'affaisse, ne mollit ni ne casse. Il a assez de r\u00e9sistance pour subir des chocs importants et des projections de boules ou de balles \u00e0 haute vitesse, sans risquer de s'effriter ou de d\u00e9chirer leurs v\u00eatements. Un tel entourage ajoute de la distinction \u00e0 votre club, et l\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous avons \u00e9rig\u00e9 des cl\u00f4tures semblables, les directeurs des clubs se f\u00e9licitent de l'enthousiasme de leurs membres et du d\u00e9sir d'un grand nombre de se joindre \u00e0 eux.\n\nD\u00e9tails:\n\nMailles de 1\u00bd pouce, fil d'acier \"Open Hearth\" de la jauge 12, galvanis\u00e9 avant ou apr\u00e8s le tissage.

La cl\u00f4ture Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene r\u00e9alise ces deux consid\u00e9rations. Elle se pr\u00eate \u00e0 toutes les ondulations du sol; elle est une protection constante qui impose le respect. Les barri\u00e8res surmont\u00e9es d'une arche convenable, avec l'inscription voulue, ajoutent de la dignit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enclos.

L'une des grandes difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 surmonter pour avoir un parterre attrayant, c'est d'emp\u00eacher les insouciants et les gens trop press\u00e9s de s'y faire des raccourcis. La cl\u00f4ture Invincible fait passer par les barri\u00e8res; cela favorise de beaucoup l'entretien de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et cela contente votre ambition de lui donner du chic.\n\nD\u00e9tails\n\nHauteur: 3, 3\u00bd, 4, 4\u00bd ou 5 pieds.\nMailles de 1\u00bd pouce, fil d'acier Open Hearth des jauges 11 ou 10.

Les enfants ne r\u00e9alisent pas le danger qu'il y a \u00e0 jouer dans un tel but et sont expos\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir des fausses balles. Il arrive ainsi une foule d'accidents faciles \u00e0 \u00e9viter. Les filets de balle-au-camp fabriqu\u00e9s et construits pour donner un tr\u00e8s long service, et une fois \u00e9rig\u00e9s ne co\u00fbtent pratiquement plus rien.\n\nD\u00e9tails\n\nMailles 1\u00bd pouce, jauge 12, fil d'acier Open Hearth galvanis\u00e9 avant ou apr\u00e8s le tissage. Charpente enti\u00e8re en tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 et galvanis\u00e9.\n\nGrillage pour les Rats Musqu\u00e9s\n\nRobert G. Hodgson, l'expert dans l'\u00e9levage d'animaux \u00e0 fourrure, \u00e9crit dans un article sur les rats musqu\u00e9s: \"Pour entreprendre cet \u00e9levage d'une mani\u00e8re s\u00e9rieuse, il faut tout d'abord un endroit o\u00f9 les animaux vivent comme \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat sauvage et o\u00f9 ils soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre leurs ennemis naturels: vision, renard, belette et loutre.\" Une cl\u00f4ture appro- pri\u00e9e est donc ce qui s'impose au d\u00e9but et c'est pratiquement la seule d\u00e9fense requise.\n\nD\u00e9tails\n\nLa cl\u00f4ture ordinaire pour les rats musqu\u00e9s consiste en un grillage de quatre pieds et d'une t\u00f4le galvanis\u00e9e d'un pied de hauteur. Un pied du grillage est enfoui dans le sol, trois pieds se posent au-dessus, consolid\u00e9s par la t\u00f4le. Les plaques de t\u00f4le perfor\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque bout, se raccordent au moyen de rivets. Le grillage est ensuite fix\u00e9 dans le bas par un crochet de grillage, qui consiste en un fil d'acier Open Hearth de la jauge 15\u00bd galvanis\u00e9 avant ou apr\u00e8s le tissage.\n\nLe grillage varie en hauteur, de 1\u00bd pied \u00e0 6 pieds. Les rouleaux ordinaires mesurent cent pieds de longueur. La t\u00f4le galvanis\u00e9e est de la jauge 28 et mesure 1 pied x 10 pieds.\n\nBarri\u00e8res Invincible\n\nLa partie la plus importante d'une cl\u00f4ture est la barri\u00e8re, car si elle est d'un dessin quelconque ou de construction n\u00e9glig\u00e9e ou d'un posage au petit bonheur, elle causera toutes sortes d'ennuis. C'est d'ailleurs une constatation que n'importe qui peut faire, car les barri\u00e8res sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 plus d'abus que toute autre partie de la cl\u00f4ture. En faisant le plan d'une barri\u00e8re, il faut viser \u00e0 la solidit\u00e9 et au fonctionnement facile, parce que, une fois install\u00e9e, elle doit \u00eatre quasiment indestructible.\n\nLes barri\u00e8res Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene sont faites de tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 et galvanis\u00e9 de 1\u00bd pouce D.E. (diam\u00e8tre ext\u00e9rieur). Les coins, en fonte mall\u00e9able, riv\u00e9s au cadre, servent d'appui pour les gonds. Le cadre des barri\u00e8res acquiert une plus grande rigidit\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 deux tuyaux d\u00e9cap\u00e9s et galvanis\u00e9s de 1\u00bd pouce D.E., croisant \u00e0 angle droit de ces tuyaux et formant le cadre, sont fait de pi\u00e8ces de fonte mall\u00e9able pr\u00e9par\u00e9es avec soin. Toutes les ferrures sont galva-nis\u00e9es \u00e0 chaud. Il y a des barri\u00e8res \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene dont les coins sont soud\u00e9s, mais nous ne recommandons pas beaucoup ce genre pour les largueurs de 6 pieds et plus.\n\nLes cadres des petites barri\u00e8res sont faits de tuyau d\u00e9cap\u00e9 et galvanis\u00e9 de 1\u00bd D.E. avec coins et tirants soud\u00e9s. Toutes les barri\u00e8res Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene sont finies de grillage Invincible galvanis\u00e9 avant ou apr\u00e8s le tissage et avec ou sans fil barbel\u00e9, selon la cl\u00f4ture. On entend, par largeur d'une barri\u00e8re l'espace entre les poteaux, car nous d\u00e9nissions quelques pouces pour les gonds et le loquet que, d'ailleurs, nous fournissons. L'on ajoute des d\u00e9corations appropri\u00e9es sur les barri\u00e8res de parterre.\n\nPage vingt-sept\n**Cl\u00f4ture Invincible**\n\n**Le posage**\n\nPour la permanence et la rigidit\u00e9 nous recommandons que tous les poteaux soient pos\u00e9s dans le b\u00e9ton. Nous sommes en mesure d'entreprendre le posage au complet ou de fournir \u00e0 prix nominal les services d'un contrema\u00eetre qualifi\u00e9.\n\nL'exp\u00e9rience nous a appris \u00e0 mettre tous les poteaux de ligne dans une base en b\u00e9ton mesurant environ 8 pouces de diam\u00e8tre dans le haut et s'\u00e9largissant graduellement jusqu'\u00e0 16 pouces au fond, \u00e0 $3\\frac{1}{2}$ pieds de profondeur; pour les poteaux des bords, des barri\u00e8res et des coins, faire une fondation d'environ 10 pouces de diam\u00e8tre dans le haut, 18 pouces dans le bas et $3\\frac{1}{2}$ pieds de profondeur. Nous sugg\u00e9rons aussi le m\u00e9lange suivant pour obtenir les meilleurs r\u00e9sultats: une partie de ciment; deux parties de gros sable \u00e0 b\u00e9ton; 4 parties de pierre concass\u00e9e de $\\frac{3}{4}$ de pouce.\n\n**Soumissions et Commandes**\n\nNous avons en magasin tous les genres et toutes les dimensions de grillage mentionn\u00e9s dans ce catalogue; le grillage lourd en rouleaux de 50 pieds de longueur et le grillage l\u00e9ger en rouleaux de 100 pieds. En vous informant des prix ou en ordonnant de la cl\u00f4ture Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene, s'il-vous-plait envoyer un trac\u00e9 du terrain avec les dimensions en indiquant aussi l'emplacement des barri\u00e8res et dans chaque cas mentionner si ce sont des barri\u00e8res de passage, d'entr\u00e9e de cour ou de traverse de chemin de fer. En indiquant la hauteur de la cl\u00f4ture requise, pri\u00e8re de mentionner si l'on d\u00e9sire la hauteur totale en grillage ou en grillage et fil barbel\u00e9.\n\n---\n\n**Mani\u00e8re de relier un rouleau \u00e0 un autre**\n\nLa cl\u00f4ture Invincible \u00e0 mailles de cha\u00eene est facilement raccord\u00e9e d'une longueur \u00e0 l'autre et sans que le joint paraisse. Il suffit d'ouvrir avec une pince les extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s du grillage, de tirer le fil en le d\u00e9visant. On approche les bouts du grillage tel qu'illustr\u00e9, et on remet le fil en place en le tordant. Une fois que le grillage est en place, on peut le fixer avec des pinces le m\u00eame fini qu'il avait auparavant. On peut couper le grillage n'importe o\u00f9 en entrela\u00e7ant un fil tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus.\n\n---\n\n**CHEZ VOTRE FOURNISSEUR LA CL\u00d4TURE INVINCIBLE**\n\n**LE TEMPS PROUVE SA LONGUE DUR\u00c9E**\nCl\u00f4ture Invincible\n\nOutils pour le Posage\n\nLe Tendeur Invincible\n\nNous voyons que ce tendeur est le plus avantageux actuellement sur le march\u00e9\u2014la simplicit\u00e9 de son m\u00e9canisme permet \u00e0 un seul homme de bien tendre toute cl\u00f4ture.

Quoique le prix soit moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de Frost Steel and Wire Company je crois que la cl\u00f4ture de cette derni\u00e8re Compagnie est plus r\u00e9sistante si nous consid\u00e9rons que le n\u0153ud n'est pas coulant comme celui de la cl\u00f4ture de The Steel Company.\n\nJe vous prie de consid\u00e9rer que le prix soumis par M.

Our automatic machines are each producing many miles of farm fencing per day. On the other hand Europeans first developed a wire fence for protection from human interference. Chain Link fencing, which has proved so successful as an unclimbable and unbreakable barrier to the human trespasser, came originally from Europe.\n\nThe SECURITY FENCE COMPANY, LIMITED, has developed special machinery for producing a superior Chain Link fabric. The greatest care is exercised in the wire mills with which this company is affiliated in producing exactly the right grade of open hearth steel wire, and in galvanizing same by the hot process, so as to insure the very best possible results. Nothing but the highest grade of hot galvanized material is used for the post structure on which SECURITY Chain Link Fabric is erected.\n\nA feature of our complete fencing is the absence of most of the fittings heretofore commonly used on fencing, thereby eliminating breakages and causes of looseness and of rust.\n\nSECURITY gates are welded in one solid piece from hot galvanized steel tubing and cannot become loose or saggy. Welded frame Chain Link gates are a particular development of the Security Fence Company.\n\nSECURITY Chain Link property protection fencing gives, as its name implies, the utmost in security for your property. It is non-climbable and cannot be cut with ordinary wire cutters. The fabric is barbed at the top, and angular arms carrying 4 pointed barbed wires make the completed fence still more impassable. Night or day, winter or summer, in storm, rain or darkness, Security unclimbable fencing keeps the undesirable, the vandal, and the Bob-lovik, on the outside. Even the petty thief, some-\nA factory yard that was formerly a shortcut and a resort of tramps and trouble. The owners have saved the cost of a watchman. This SECURITY FENCE has already paid for itself.\n\nSECURITY fencing eliminates many of the time consuming administrative details of industrial property, simplifying this inside supervision by ending outside interference, enabling the busy executive to give his undivided attention to the big and important matters. SECURITY fencing converts useless or vacant yard space into safe and valuable outdoor storage. It is an impregnable first line of defense against interference in the plant or warehouse, which brings the owner satisfaction and security.\n\nSECURITY fencing all is safe. It is better than insurance, it is the prevention of meddling, of theft and incendiarism.\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Fencing gives no foothold for climbers and with three sharply barbed wires securely fastened to receding arms, it not merely discourages trespassing but makes it practically impossible.\n\nSECURITY Gates are made in all lengths and heights either single or double, to swing or to slide. The gates are also of the unclimbable type to match the fence. All Security gates have frames that are welded in one piece. They cannot twist, bend, sag or get out of shape. The gates of an industrial plant get the hardest usage. Our welded one piece frame is designed to meet it.\n\nA part of the Cartierville Terminus Enclosure, recently built by SECURITY FENCE CO. for Montreal Tramways.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nSECURITY\n\nCHAIN LINK FENCING\n\nEND and CORNER POSTS are made from standard hot galvanized steel tubing 3\u00bd\" O. D. for the heavy, high fences, 2\u00bd\" O. D. for the middle weight or lower styles, and 2\u00bc\" O. D. for the lighter gauge fences.\n\nLINE POSTS are made from standard hot galvanized 2\u00bd\" O. D. steel tubing for the heavy high fences, 1\u00be\" O. D. for medium weight and 1\u00bd\" O. D. for light gauge fences.\n\nTOP RAILING is made from standard hot galvanized steel tubing 1\u00bd\" O. D. for the heavy fences, 1\u00bc\" O. D. for the medium weight and lighter fences.\n\nPOST TOPS are hot galvanized and fitted over the post to keep out water.\n\nEXTENSION ARMS and Barb Wires are hot galvanized and are carried by a heavy lug from MALLEABLE post tops. Three strands of 4 point barb wire are carried on these receding Extension Arms, making a formidable barrier. When, for appearance, on lawns or private property the arms are not desired, a single barb wire may be placed at the inside of the post tops.\n\nFABRIC\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Fabric is made from the best Open Hearth Steel Wire and hot galvanized by the most up to date method.\n\nThe wire for all SECURITY fencing is made from the ore to the finished product in the Sydney plants of the British Empire Steel Corporation with which this Company is affiliated.\n\nThe utmost care is taken in producing a wire exactly suited for Chain Link Fencing.\nSECURITY GATES are made solid, rigid, durable, absolutely non-sag by our one piece welded frame method. Any width of opening even up to 30 or 40 feet can be closed against all comers.\n\nDIAGRAM, PRICES, Etc.\n\nWhen asking for information, prices, etc., on SECURITY Chain Link or lawn fencing send a simple diagram or layout of proposed fencing giving the measurements of each stretch. Show the length of the gate openings and mention whether single or double, swing or sliding gates are required. Make an \"O\" where corner, end or gate posts are to be placed, also specify the gauge, the mesh and the height of the fabric desired and if receding arms with barb wires are to be used.\n\nGALVANIZING\n\nAll material is heavily galvanized by the hot dip process, the wire being coated by the latest \"long pan\" method which permanently amalgamates a heavy zinc coating with the surface of the steel.\n\nWe absolutely GUARANTEE that we use NO ELECTRO GALVANIZED (cold process) material.\n\nA Security Chain Link Panel partition recently installed for the National Mail Order House \u2014 Bleury Street, Montreal.\n\nSECURITY CHAIN LINK PARTITIONS\n\nSecurity C. L. partitions meet every requirement for the division of inside factory or storeroom space and protection of valuable stocks, tools or machines. They have none of the objectionable features of the old style crimped wire work.\n\nWe supply them either in panel form or in continuous fabric, and either erected for you, or the panels or fabric only. They are easily erected by ordinary carpenters.\n\nThe Standard panel is 4' x 8' and is made in 10 gauge, 1\u00bd\" mesh; with either swing or sliding doors to match.\n\nSend a diagram of your floor showing exact lengths of partitions, doors, etc.\nSECURITY\nLAWN AND PARK FENCING\n\nCEMETERY FENCES\n\nSecurity Chain Link Fence forms a particularly graceful and dignified enclosure for the cemetery. Its design, though artistic and noted for its simplicity and refinement; harmonizes perfectly with the character of its environment and adds to the attractiveness of the ground enclosed.\n\nThe effective and dependable protection afforded by Security Chain Link Fence is an incentive to make a cemetery more beautiful. It inspires better care of family lots and serves as an impressive reminder of the purposes to which the cemetery is dedicated.\n\nFOX FARMS\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Nos. 12 and 14 gauge fences are made in 1/2\" or 2\" mesh, in any width up to 12 feet and is the best fox fence that can be made. It is finished in any lengths.\n\nWINDOW AND SKYLIGHT GUARDS\n\nFor windows and skylights Chain Link Mesh is much the best fabric. It cannot be forced apart as in the case of the old steel crimped wire guard. The Chain Link forms an absolute lock.\n\nBASEBALL BACK STOPS\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Fabric is an ideal material in Baseball Back Stops, strong and non-sagging and when placed on steel frame work makes a rigid and durable construction.\nirresistible temptation to neighbours' children and pets. Many a neighborhood quarrel is due to the absence of a lawn fence.\n\nIn fact, it is often difficult to be patient with the neighbors when we find their children playing hide and seek in our costly shrubbery. Frolicking dogs do great damage to the flower beds. Yet there is no just cause of complaint for the owner of unfenced property. If we wish to enjoy to any degree, privacy in our gardens a fence is a necessity.\n\nA fine lawn fence gives a house a distinction which no other improvement can make.\n\nThis beautiful rural lawn fencing is both galvanized and painted (green). It is made in 36\", 42\" and 48\" widths, either of No. 9 or No. 10 gauge, by electrically welding the wires into one rigid web and therefore it keeps its shape beautifully.\n\nWe supply it in rolls of 100 or 150 feet (or cut to special length at 50\u00a2 extra) for attaching to wooden posts. We also supply complete steel posts, top rail, fittings and gates to match, if desired.\n\nParks, churches and schools may all improved in appearance and saved from ill usage by a fine trim and stylish Security Lawn Fence.\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Fence is particularly adapted to the requirements of schools; stands rough usage; shuts off the playground from the street; protects children from dangers of traffic; centralizes entrances and exits; protects buildings; equipment, lawns and shrubs against the depredations of rowdies and vandals.\n\nSECURITY Chain Link Fence makes a strong, durable, attractive enclosure for athletic fields.

En tenant compte d'une beaucoup plus forte r\u00e9sistance, il me semble que ce serait plut\u00f4t le \"Chain Link\" 2\" de maille qui serait apr\u00e8s tout la plus acceptable et que je me permets de recommander le plus fortement au D\u00e9partement.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire-\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes\nOTTAWA.\nMontreal, July 15th 1929\n\nMr. L. Levesque\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFollowing our conversation of yesterday we beg to quote a Security Style No. 8-48-D (full fence) with support every 22\", made of No. 10 wire, having a top wire No. 3, at the price of $0.45 per panel of 16' x 4'.\n\nThe Style \"C\" (lawn fence) double armament,\n48\" high, green painted -------------- $0.17 per lin. foot\nThe Style \"L\" 48\" high, spaced 2 1/2\" between supports --------------------- $0.14 per lin. foot\n\nOur prices above are 2% 10 days, net 30 days including freight.\n\nOur chain link fence called \"Chainlink\" 2\" mesh, 48\" high, wire gauge No. 9 barbed on top @ $0.36 the lin. foot, less 10% net 30 days, sales tax included.\n\nAsking you will find our business satisfactory and that we may be favored with your order which will receive our prompt attention.\n\nWe remain, Yours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecurity Fence Co., Ltd.\nGeo. W. Stevenson\nSales Manager\nTranslation\n\nSir,\n\nSt. Constant, July 15th, 1928\n\nFollowing my letter of the 2nd inst., concerning the wire to be used for the fence now being erected around the grounds of the Union school at Baughnawaga, I enclose herewith a letter from the Security Fence Co. Ltd. of Montreal dated the 13th inst., submitting a price list of their different kinds of wire fences.\n\nAs I had already remarked in my last letter to the Dept., I do not think I should recommend the use of the wire described in the second paragraph of your letter of the 21st of May last, for the reason I do not believe it strong enough.\n\nThe prices already given to the Dept. by the East Steel Co. for style \"L\" and \"LP\" being 16\u00a2 and 28\u00a2 and those submitted by the Security Fence & being 14\u00a2 and 17\u00a2, I believe I should recommend that the Security Fence be favored with the order. It is however of a different style which is to be taken into consideration and which I leave to your own choice.\n\nI am now informed that style \"Chain Link\" is generally employed around the grounds intended for school work. This \"Chain Link\" style is also sold by the Security Fence Co. at 26\u00a2 per lin. ft. The cost price would be about $575.00. Taking the strength of the material into consideration, I seem to me that the \"Chain Link\" 2\" mesh would be most acceptable and I wish to recommend it to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Lawrence LeTourneau\nAgent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJuly 23, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nPrices have been obtained by Indian Agent Letourneau for the furnishing of wire fence for the fencing of the school property at Caughnawaga, and it is recommended in his communication of the 15th instant that the order be placed with the Security Fence Co. of Montreal for a type of fence called chain link at a total cost of approximately $376.00. In view of the importance of this School, I beg to concur with the Agent's recommendation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nJuly 24, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, advising me of the prices submitted by the Security Fence Co. of Montreal for the furnishing of different types of fencing for the Central School at Okauchewan. As I understand that the chain link style is the one mostly used and adaptable for the fencing required at the above mentioned school, I beg to say that you may arrange with the Security Fence Co. to supply the required fencing at the price quoted in their catalogue. As the 15th instant is now very close, I should be requested to make shipment of the material with the least possible delay, and it is desired that you request Mr. Barcelon, who has charge of its erection, to make the necessary arrangements in order that this work may be rushed to completion by the first week in August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLennan\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLe Letourneau,\nIndian Agent,\nSte. Constant, Que.\nAugust 15, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your account, amounting to $850.00 for the furnishing of ornamental fence for the Central School lot at Goughswaga, and I would request that you send similar accounts in duplicate to Lorenzo Letourneau, Indian Agent at St. Constant, for his verification and certification. As soon as these accounts are forwarded to the Department by this officer payment will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSt. Denis Ornamental Fence Co.,\nSt. Denis St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, August 20, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to transmit herewith an account of $90.00 dated the 13th instant from St. Denis Ornamental. If the articles charged for therein were received at your Agency in good order, and if the cost thereof is properly chargeable to this Department, kindly attach the account to certified voucher forms in duplicate and return to the Department without delay in order that payment may be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[F.H.

This loose stone which is offered without any cost by Mr. Norton is presently used as stone fence.\n\nThe question is to whether the Department would be prepared to allow an approximate sum of $100.00 for the hauling of this stone into the lower places of the playground.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nMarch 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. James Jacobs owner of Village Holding No. 461 has in the past suffered damages caused by the pupils attending the Eastern School, which is located on Holding No. 460. The pupils who are playing football and baseball have to go and get their ball when it goes on Jacob's garden and I am personally aware that this Indian suffered considerable losses by the children's action.\n\nIt is believed that if a higher fence was erected between the school lot and that of Jacobs, it would remedy the situation. The line between the school lot and that of Jacobs is of 193. The present fence is of only four feet high and at present is almost non-existent having been erected over 25 years ago.\n\nI would ask you to take the matter of building a new fence into consideration; this before the month of May in order to protect the garden of this Indian when it is planted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant suggesting the erection of a fence at the Eastern School.\n\nWithout a very heavy expenditure I doubt that we would be able to construct a fence sufficiently high to prevent the damage outlined in your letter.\n\nHowever, you might let me know what would be the approximate cost of the fence that you consider would be suitable. At the same time you should let me know the height of the fence that you would recommend erecting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nMay 9, 1911.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have your letter of the 31st of March last, dealing with the erection of a fence between the yard of the Eastern School and Lot No.461 of this Village, the property of James Jacobs.\n\nIn reply I wish to transmit you herewith samples of wire which it is believed would be suitable to prevent the balls, footballs etc., to get on Jacobs' property. The fence would be of eight feet high consisting of two four feet strips of mesh wire. This would prevent the pupils to jump over the fence and go over the garden, where for several years, the crop has been spoiled.\n\nThe prices are as follows, for the material required:\nWire 0.15 per foot, 400 feet-$60.00, 20 posts of 12 feet long $0.40 each-$8.00, Scantling 2 x 4, $18.00, staples 0.70c.\nThe labor is estimated at about $15.00, for a total cost of about $100.00. Kindly let me know if the Department is prepared to authorize this expenditure. Prices for materials obtained from J.F.Crepin, Chateauguay Basin, que.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.

I also found from reliable authority that when he did teach, he gave many holidays, i.e., different times and returned them to me, as days he taught school, also speaks English very little to the children, and Indian most of the time also does not command enough to make the children attend; in addition to this, he is not a competent teacher, and I would advise on these several accounts that his John Deschamps School be closed until such time as some guarantee of better attendance, with some more.\nOTTAWA 13th March 1895\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo relating to the Red Rock Indian School, I beg to say that as the teacher, John Deschamp took upon himself to close the school without authority and in view of the unsatisfactory results obtained by him, the Department concurs in your recommendation that services should not be retained after the close of the current quarter, and you should see that he is only paid for the actual time the school was kept open during this quarter.\n\nYou might make enquiries with a view to obtaining the services of a properly qualified teacher to take charge of this school holding a Provincial or District Certificate to take charge of this school, and all applications are to be submitted to the Department accompanied by Certificate and testimonials and the Department will not in any way recognize or pay for the services of a teacher whose appointment has not first been confirmed by it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.P.

General\nof Indian Affairs\nAttawa\nI also took into consideration the fact of the teacher's father the chief, his uncles and brothers as well as himself having taken a great interest in improving the reserve and getting it redeemed by settling up, stopping families and getting a promise to continue doing better was another matter to be looked into, and have to ask the Department on these accounts to allow him to continue teaching at least long enough to prove to me his improvement and greater interest interest in his school and matters generally.\n\nI may mention also about mention about the Paps Plat School, that the teacher Miss Baxter will not teach any longer than this quarter, the reasons I will give in my next school report, and will do as requested in your letter, that no teacher will be accepted by me unless holding certificate and testimonials from the province or district of qualification.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

I have to dispose a little to keep friendly with these Indians especially the Chief as it affects the welfare of Red Rock Reserve to a certain extent, and they understand that the inspectors report of his incapability as a teacher was the cause of his removal, and I should like the Department to inform him plainly of this fact.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient Servt.,\nL. P. Dunlop\n\nDeputy Sect. General\nof Indian Affairs\nAttahwa\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing letters from the first and second chiefs of the Red Rock Band asking for the re-instatement of John Deschamps, late teacher of the Red Rock school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department does not feel that it would be justified in re-appointing Deschamps in view of the unsatisfactory manner in which he conducted his school as shown by the reports of the separate school Inspector, the Missionary for the district and yourself and Deschamps should not delay looking for other employment in the expectation of being placed in charge of this school. Arrangements will be made at an early date to procure a duly qualified teacher for this school, if it is found necessary to re-open it. The Red Rock Band are justly entitled to one school only and the school at Lake Helen is shown to be well attended the Department would like to know the number of children left at Red Rock.\n\nIt might be well for you to communicate with Rev. Father Specht in this matter. The Department trusts that the new building and the school material on hand are being properly looked after.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P. Donnelly\n\nIndian Agent\n\nFort Arthur, Ont. - Acting Secretary\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of the Red Rock Band in Council on 5th June last desired me to communicate to the Department certain of their wishes which were as follows:\n\n1. To have the school on what they consider their Reserve re-opened with Johnnie Deschamps as teacher.\n\nI doubt whether the existing educational arrangements can be bettered without opening a second school for the band and that I regard as being out of the question. The school at the Roman Catholic Mission on Lake Helen is, it is true, too far from the reserve for the children of Indians settled at the latter place to attend it; but it is of use to as many children of the band as a school upon the reserve would be, and if it were closed and the reserve school opened it would simply be to deprive one lot of Indians of educational advantages in order to bestow them on another lot who would possibly not appreciate them any more.\n\nThose who are agitating for a school on the reserve have me a list of the number of school age at that point. It comprises ten names. From that number an average would justify payment of a teacher could not be got. The fact is the old teacher, son of Chief Deschamps, the agitation is more in the interest of J. Deschamps than in the interest of education, and even were a school to be opened he could not be properly appointed to it, as he is quite unfit for the office.\n\nX X X X\n\nJ.A. Macrae\nI.I.A.\nExtract from letter dated Nepigon River 11th Oct 1897\n\nWill you honor me kindly inform me in reference to the reopening of the school. It is said that there are not sufficient number of children of school age \"to justify the expense of maintaining it.\" This statement is not true as it is a well known fact that there is a greater number of school children here than attending the surrounding Ind. Catholic Mission Schools.\n\nJohn Deschamps is said by the Department not to be possessed of the \"necessary qualifications for a teacher.\" Please tell me what are the qualifications for an Indian Catholic Mission School Teacher and who determines the standard of qualification.\nqualifications? This is inflicting a lasting injury on the children of this place to be deprived of their school. Why was a school house erected on the Reserve? unless it was to be kept open during the entire year.\n\n(Agd) Pierre Deschamps\n\nChief\nRed Rock Indian Band\nLake Superior\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, 19th November, 1897\n\nChief,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 11th ultimo relative to the Red Rock Indian school and in reply I beg to say that the Department does not see its way to re-open this school, and in this connection I have to refer you to Departmental letter of the 28th September last, No: 190919.\n\nI may add that teachers of Roman Catholic Indian Mission schools around Lake Superior, in addition to being the nominees of Rev. Father Specht, must be possessed of suitable qualifications in the way of ability and experience, and all such appointments are subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nChief Pierre Deschamps,\nRed Rock Band,\nNipigon,\nOnti-\nMuskogee River\n193112 25 Nov 1877\n\nNicky Dept. of\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received your letter dated 19 November No. 1538/2 in which it is stated that the Department does not see its way to re-open this school. I am very much grieved to hear that especially when I see that there are schools kept open that have a fewer number of school children than we do here. The number of children attending is enough to justify the re-opening of this school and the number will be greatly increased with the opening of spring when the Indians will have returned from their winter hunt by all means so we cannot have our school re-opened. As Chief of this Band I most respectfully insist on it. Why have we been put to the trouble\nCreating a school house, if it is allowed to remain unoccupied and not used for the purpose for which it was intended, should it please you to re-open our school. I may say that we are not prepared to accept as teachers the nominees of the Father Spedale. We would rather nominate our own teacher subject, of course, to the approval of the Dept. It seems to me quite evident that the Father Spedale and I may be some other are at the bottom of all this. The Rev. Gentleman has never been in sympathy with us in having a school of our own. He wishes to bring us to the Lake Union school, some five or six miles distant, which for our children would be an utter impossibility from its great distance, and the great danger of crossing the lake, especially in stormy weather, so we can readily perceive that our request is both reasonable and just.\n\nAs Chief of the Band, I claim the right to protect the interests of my people, to seek their welfare and endeavor to promote whatever means that may tend to improve them intellectually otherwise. As regards their spiritual affairs, the priest can whose province it is can attend to that, but I will take no part in the matter of education and the secular affairs being competent to attend to that matter and the Department with respectful deference to the Dept.\nSome also add that this is the proper place for the Indian Reserve. There is good land and abundance of wood also. It is far enough removed from the railroad to be free from molestation from the disrespectful white trash who come in contact with our people. Demoralizing and degrading them to the lowest level. The Lord Nelson Mission is a most disputable place owing to its proximity to the degraded whites. We wish to live in peace and decency to have our own school and educate ourselves so that we can success fully manage our own affairs on a par with our white brothers. Yes, dear sir, we must have our school re-opened. There is a pressing necessity for it and now is the season for it when we who remain at home have the most time to devote to the cultivation of the mind. I feel to be most respectful but I must say that I am firmly determined to agitate this question until our request is granted.\n\nPlease write me soon.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nPierre Deschamps,\nChief Red Rock Ind. Band\nOTTAWA, 7th December, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your report on the statements contained therein a letter from Chief Pierre Beschamps of the Red Rock Band making further application for the re-opening of the Red Rock school. The Chief has been informed that the Department does not see its way to re-open the school.\n\nKindly forward your report in this matter and return the letter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nJ. F. Donnelly, Esq.:\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.:\nMission, Fort William, 14th Dec 1877\n\nMr. J. P. Dannelly, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your note of today, I beg to state that I was on the Red Rock Reserve on the 1st inst., and found 2 families residing there, that of Mr. Macdonald, consisting of 6 souls in all. Near the Reserve I found 3 more families, viz.: Pericke Deschamps, Denis Deschamps, and Mr. Henry de Laroche, i.e. 16 more souls. In all, 26 souls, of whom 2 are of school age.\n\nThis is all there has been there since the middle of September last (with the addition of a little family of 3 souls, father, mother & infant).\n\nCarter\nand that will be there until the opening of navigation, towards May 28th next.\n\nAnd who is there (on the Reserve) in the summer season, over and above those already mentioned? Five more families, numbering together 29, say 30 souls, and containing 6 or 7 more children of school age, which raises the number of the latter to 7 in the summer season.\n\nThere are a few other families that nominally belong to the Reserve; but these, even in summer, do not reside on it, living as they do on Lake Nepigon.\n\nAt this date, there are 12 families living on Lake Nepigon Mission, with 10 children of school age. In the summer season, there are there some 2 families, with 4 additional children of school age, thus giving 18 families, with\n21 children of school age.\n\nHoping this will satisfy,\nremain, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\nJos. Specht, J.S.\n\nP.S. I may mention that this school was kept too long by Chief Deschamps's son. As you know, he was not only incompetent, but also immoral, had a child with the sister of one of his scholars and daughter of a poor widow! The party whom they have now in view as a teacher\u2014so I am told\u2014is a degraded man.\nKen white man, formerly a teacher.\n\nJ.S.\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant no. 153812, enclosing a letter from Chief Pierre Deschamps of the Red Rock Band making further application for the reopening of the Red Rock school, the Chief has been informed that the department does not see its way clear to reopen the school. He also states that the Chief expresses himself glad to hear that the Dept does not see its way clear to reopen the school, when he sees other schools open with a larger number of students than any school with as few a number as upon this Reserve. I find by reliable authority from the Reverend Missionary Father that S.S. whose letters to me on the subject herewith enclose, that there are but two families on the Reserve. The first mentioned I am told is a lazy Indian with a family from Martin Hall in the interior, in the spring the number increased will be uncertain, some times more and sometimes less etc., the others mentioned near the Reserve are about a mile off the River on opposite side of the Nepigon River, and he mentions of having been put to the trouble of building a school house now not used. May mention that he agitated as Secretary Dept of Indian Affairs Ottawa\nhe is now, until he induced Mr. McDonald late Mr. P. to get the department to furnish the school building i.e. $175.00 to lend it for his son to be the teacher, and is its full value, and am informed is stipulating to let the teacher referred to in Rev. Foster's letter for teacher, who is living with him at the present time.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. P. Dunnelly\n\nP.S.

It has been represented to the Department that there are not sufficient school children to justify the Department in keeping this school open which is not true. In the summer season there are a great many children here but the priest is working against us and is determined if he can prevent it, I allow no school. Can't we have a school here independent of the priest? What right has he to dictate to us on this matter. We are too far from the other school at Lake Kelowna. Still the priest insists on our sending our children there, which is an utter impossibility, the distance being too great. We have a first class school house erected principally at our own cost and it is to be hoped...\nThe Department will come to our aid\nand put us a secular school.

McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nJ.F. Hodder, Esq:\nActing Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont:\nSir,\n\nSome time ago we were informed that the Department could not see its way to reopen the school here on account of the small attendance. Now we are fairly wedded to reopen it on our own account and at our expense, that we are prepared to do for a short term at least, and we have already engaged the services of an experienced teacher whom we have for a long time known and who is thoroughly competent in every respect. Throughout respect to the Dept. we do not wish to take possession of the school-room without first obtaining their permission and consent, which we now ask, not that we, for a moment, consider we are under any obligation to do so, as we claim it is our own property built almost entirely at our\nAt the same time we wish to be allowed to use the school house, plates, &c., paid by the Dept. For the present the school shall not be used. The 15 children in school age, remaining around here, in a small field, and in a short time we expect many more. It is quite likely, in fact certain, that there will be 20 pupils in regular attendance during the summer months. We explain by that if we do not take this matter up ourselves and mind it at our own expense, we shall be deprived of a school altogether. We do not intend to send our children to the mission school, as it is an utterly impossible, the risk and danger on the lake is too great besides it is too far away.\n\nWe wish to start our school at once, and trust the Department will listen to our reasonable request.

Hodder, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOntario.\nSir,\n\nI am Sir, I the chief and one of the councillors representing the Red Rock Indian Band, resident on the Red Rock Reserve Lake Superior Algoma West do most respectfully ask you to give us a non-denominational school. For a long time our school was open as a Catholic Mission School and now we are now denied the privilege of having it continued as such. We most earnestly beg you to allow us to engage our own teacher and have our school conducted on non-denominational lines. Of course we expect your Hon. Dept to deny the necessary expenses. We have selected our teacher who was for about 12 years a mission school teacher amongst the Indians at this and Lake Huron region. His name is James MacKay. He is well known at least to Mr. White School Inspector and is well qualified to teach Indian schools. Hoping Hon. Sir you will be pleased to grant our reasonable request as soon as convenient.\n\nNipigon River\n25 July 1878\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (vol. 109, file 9-8-1, part 1)\nEnclosed is a list of the children of school age, and who are now running about wild when they should be at school.

In my opinion he is in several respects well qualified for such a post as to speak the language of children fluently and also has a fair English education with considerable experience in teaching. Before appointing him as teacher it might be well to get a statement from some of the missionary priests as to his conduct of late years, as reports have been spread that he becomes intoxicated at times and that his religious views are subject to rather frequent change.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

Father Specht (sending him a copy of Mr. White's letter) and ask him to be good enough to inform the Department, at his earliest convenience as to the character and conduct of Mr. Mackay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa...\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has just come to my knowledge that an application has been made to your Department by the Chief of Red Rock, to have Mr. James McKey appointed there again as teacher.\n\nNow dear sir, allow me to protest against the appointment of said Mr. James McKey to the Red Rock school, in fact to any school in my missions, as he is lacking a quality without which a man is unfit to be a teacher. Mr. McKey is not a gentleman. Besides he has an uncontrolable temper, and uses language of the most vulgar kind against persons whom he dislikes.\n\nIf needed, I can furnish proof of the above assertions.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) Jos. Splecht, S.J.,\nMissy,\nin charge of Red Rock Mission.\nFort William, Ont.,\nAugust 7th 1898.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to the recommendation of Mr. James McReynolds, as teacher of the Indian school at Red Rock, about which I wrote you two days ago, let me add this:\n\nI understand that Chief Pechampey, Mr. McReynolds wants an undenominational Indian School at Red Rock.\n\nNow, dear sir, the Indian Act provides that the school in any Indian Band is to be of the denomination of the majority of that Band. As to Red Rock Band is Catholic by an immense majority, its school can be but a Catholic one, with a Catholic teacher.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJos. Specht, M.P.\nMississauga.\nWithin two weeks most of the chil-\ndren that are around Red Bay's\nplace will melt away like snow\nin the spring. They will return to\ntheir winter quarters, and there will\nremain only an insignificant number.\nThe Department's work must not\nforget that several years ago when\nwinter came the press was made\nby Indians to have a school to teach the\nchildren. Red Bay's son\nI think who was taught at that\ntime got on the list; the children\nbelonging to Mr. McReynolds'\nschool down below.\n\nRemain, most truly yours,\nR. Baudin\n\nFoot William Aug 17 1864\n\nW. 153.212\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFather Speake is about, but I know\nenough of John McReynolds to give you\nthe answer you need.\n\nJohn McReynolds was drunk repeatedly\nsince he came up last October. His\nwife promised him to go back with\nyou if he reformed, especially\nif he quitted drinking for two years.\nJames said it was asking too much\nof him. The man is saying like\nthe moon. I know him to be a\nhimself a protestant and a Catholic.\nout a Lutheran, a Baptist, and a Catholic.\n\nThis change has occurred three times at least. Now it would be very hard to say what he did, as he lives with Catholics, he professes to be a Catholic, but a Methodist minister offers him a situation, he will be a Methodist. If you like, he was first a Lutheran, then a Baptist, then a Catholic. I think 17 years ago he became a Catholic. He had difficulties with Walter Scott; they in 1891 he became a Church of England man, so became again a Catholic, he abandoned the Catholic Church in 1893. What did he do meanwhile, until last fall? I know not. I never knew a man so unstable, varying every body and every thing, two weeks later apologizing for the indiscretion of his tongue. But he is a man every body admires. Mr. Hodder told me just before that if he wanted to promote him for the old honors might make publicly by taking the Hodder Way would furnish him the means to do so. Mr. Hodder out of kindness refused to do it.\n\nThis is the man whom Chief Dechamps went to give a teacher to his reserve. Last October it was settled at the Indian Department that the School should be opened for want of children, the reasons were given by Mr. Scott.\nOTTAWA, 30th August, 1865.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Departmental letter to you of the 11th instant relative to the proposal of Chief Deschamps that the Red Rock School should be reopened, I beg to say that the Department would like you to inform the Chief in this connection that before giving its consent to the use of the school house, it wishes it to be distinctly understood that as no salary for a teacher at this place has been voted for the current fiscal year, it will not be in a position to pay anything towards the salary of a teacher. It is good enough to inform him at the same time that owing to reports which have reached the Department as to the character of Mr James Mackay, it cannot consent to his appointment as teacher of a school at that place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. V. Hodder, Esq.,\nSecretary\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur,\nOnt.\nThessalon, Ont. 20th November, 1895\n\nMr. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Indian Department,\nOttawa,\n\nMy Dear McLean,\n\nThe Chief of the Red Rock Band of Indians at Nepigon has written me, asking me to write you with reference to opening the Indian School there next Spring. The Indians appear to be very anxious to have this school opened and it seems to me that it should be when they are so anxious for instruction and the building already there. Will you please let me know if this can be arranged so that the school can be opened early in the Spring when the Indians get back from their hunting trip.\n\nThey are also desirous of having about four miles of a road opened up from their reserve on the Nepigon River, along the Lake shore to Nepigon Station. I understand the Indians are raising some produce and have some horses now, and it would certainly be a big benefit to them if they could get in to Nepigon with their produce more handily than they do at present. I hope, if they have money to their credit, the Dept will have no objection to spending it in such laudable ways as this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. E. Dyment.\n\nFor A.\nOttawa, 7th December, 1896.\n\nDear Mr. Pyeatt:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, stating that the Chief of the Red Rock Band of Indians, at Terence, has written you with reference to opening the Indian school at that point next spring, and you ask whether arrangements can be made so that this can be done.\n\nIn reply I have to say that on the 17th of February 1896 Mr. Donnelly, the late Agent, reported that the teacher of this school, John Deschamps, son of Chief Deschamps, had closed the school without authority before Christmas 1895, and had gone to work at a pulp wood camp. Mr. Donnelly reported that Deschamps was very unsatisfactory; and as the attendance of the pupils was very poor in winter, he recommended that the school remain closed until there was some guarantee.\nguarantee of a better attendance, and the services of a more competent teacher could be obtained.\n\nDeschamps was, however, given another trial from the 1st of April 1896 for one quarter; but, as he again proved unsatisfactory, his services were dispersed with at the end of that term.\n\nChief Deschamps has repeatedly urged the Department to re-appoint his son, but as apparently the only reason why the Chief desired that the school should be re-opened was in order that his son should be employed, and as the Department did not think the attendance of the children justified it, no money for the salary of a teacher was voted for the present fiscal year. The salary was $250.\n\nWhen the Chief realized that the Department would not re-appoint his son he recommended Mr. James Mackay for the position. Although it was not considered advisable to re-open the school, enquiries were made as to Mr. Mackay's qualifications and character, with the result that he was found to be unsatisfactory.\n\nIf Chief Deschamps is honest in his desire that\nthe school at Red Rock be re-opened for the benefit of the children, and not in order that a friend of his may receive the appointment, or an assurance being received from him that he will not raise any objection to the nominee of the Rev. Father Specht (with whom an arrangement was made by the Department in 1896 that he should nominate teachers for Indian schools within his district) an amount to cover the salary of the teacher, which has been included in the next estimates, and no more will need to open the school after the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

My Indians will be all here about the 1st of June next. I am in full expectation to have a school soon. I have received letters from you stating that there will be no school this year but next year we must have it. Our children cannot be without a school. We must have them educated so they will be able to take care of themselves.\n\nRegarding about payment, I want you to pay all my Indians.\nbelonging to this Band, on the reserve or place else.\n\nAbout three years ago, Mr. De Lorme built a house on the reserve, intending to make a home, so he left from there moved from it, and he got away from the reserve. He asked me if he could get permission to take the logs out from the reserve, and ask my Indians they answer me immediately that they will never allow him to take the logs from the reserve logs belonging to the Indians.\n\nPlease Answer immediately.\n\nChief Mr. Pierre Deschamps\n\n[Signature]\n\nRed Rock Reserve\nPort Arthur 21st Decy 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith find communication received from Chief Deschamps of the Red Rock Band which he wished me to forward to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

If, however, Chief Deschamps can guarantee that a sufficient number of children will attend to justify the re-opening of the school and will promise that the Indians will accept the teacher whom the Department may think proper to appoint, instead of insisting on an appointee of their own, the Department will consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.F.

Rev.

In connection with an application made two years ago for the re-opening of this school Agent Hodder reported that he did not think there would be enough children at Red Rock to justify the Department in carrying on a school there. Father Dugas says that there are nine children now living there who could attend school and that the services of Miss Barker, who formerly taught the Pays Plat school, could be secured.\n\nNo provision is made in the estimates for a school at Red Rock and if the Department decided to carry on a school there, funds would have to be voted.\n\nI think it would be well to have a further report from Agent Hodder in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 6th April, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant forwarding a petition from the Chiefs of the Red Rock Band asking that the school on their Reserve be opened, I beg to say that before considering this question the Department would like a further report from you as to the number of children who would be likely to attend the school regularly, were it to be re-opened, as in your last letter on this subject, dated 18th Oct., 1900, you state that the Indians nearly all reside at Lake Helen Mission where the present school is located, and that on your visit to Red Rock at that time, you found only two grand-children of Chief Deschamps and the family of Kitchinini on or near the reserve, and that the latter would likely be away as he was a hunter, further stating that there were no residents on the reserve in the winter.\n\nI may add that this school, after being closed for a number of years, has been dropped from any estimates and in case it is too late to make provision for it now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.

Now we are sending an application through you that we want a school on our reserve. When Mr Joseph Laproche and the other chiefs sold this to the Government they promised them to give teachers and to have schools on their reserves. Good many things was put in the Treaty that we should have, but what we want especially is to have a school on our reserve our children should be educated. We have nine or children here now to go to school and Councillor Joseph Martin will be there shortly he has three children. Twelve (12) children altogether to go to school. Please report to the Department that we want to have our school reopen on the reserve.

I forwarded a copy of this list to the Rev. L.V.

A list of pupils likely to attend is enclosed by Chief Deschamps, as well as one prepared by the missionary, which reduces the estimates number of pupils from 15 to 8, which would represent the total enrollment. Judging by schools on outlying reserves we could not count on an average attendance of much over 4. Nearly all the children belong to Deschamps' family. The Martine mentioned in the Chief's list, are not likely to attend as the priest. The Chief's anxiety to have the school is accounted for by his wishing to have it placed in charge of his son, who formerly taught it, when it was proved to be a complete failure.

He claims that by this arrangement the two schools could be kept open for the six summer months each year. The Department would like to have your views in regard to this proposal but the returns from the Lake Helen school go to show that it would not be fair to close it during the winter as there is a fair average attendance while the difficulty of obtaining qualified teachers for only six months in the year would be insurmountable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.

Father was able to secure the services of a teacher. He did so then and wrote me saying so. I thought it strange that he was getting the teacher then as you had asked for one only till the end of October, and the time was then near over, but the teacher was then on her way to Nepigon and I had no chance to take the matter up with Father Dugas until I could see him, but I thought that you would be willing to let them have the teacher at least a short term to satisfy them, so I made requisition for them for a stove etc. Since receiving\nSir,\n\nyour letter I have taken the matter up with the Rev Father and he says that he did not notice that you had asked for only till Oct 31st, Until he had seen by the copy of the letter sent to him but he said that as the misunderstanding had occurred he would ask the Department to arrange it some way as he could not send the teacher back without giving her a chance to earn at least a little now that she had paid her fare to go there.\n\nHe thought that maybe you would consent to letting her teach at that school till the end of December and that then she might accept the Pic School that Moses Madwayosh is leaving at that time.\n\nAt any rate he says she is teaching now and he will let her continue till I hear from you and advise him.\n\nI would recommend that if possible the matter be arranged to his satisfaction as I find that he takes a great interest in the welfare of the Indians and that he is also a great help in teaching the Indians that the Department is working for their interests.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo regarding the re-opening of the Red Rock school; and in reply I beg to say that although such re-opening was not authorized, the Department will in view of your explanation pay the teacher in charge for the time the school was in operation, on receipt of a return covering that period, on the understanding that the school is to be closed on the 31st inst.\n\nYour suggestion to transfer the teacher to the Pic school in place of Moses Madwayosh, is approved of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nL.U.

We have sent letters to all the Indians belonging here on the Reserve to come down with their families; they are all willing to their children educated. We do not often ask help from Department, but we do ask now to have it, especially what we always ask is to have school on the Reserve. This is the right place to have school.

This will be allowed for that time as you may have been acting under a misapprehension of the instructions given you on the 16th May last in which you were told that a salary of $30.00 a month would be paid up to the end of October in case the school was opened. It was never the Department's intention to pay more than at the rate of $300.00 a year for any of the schools in this district, and if it is continued, it is to be on the understanding that the Pic River school is closed and that the teacher shall only receive the salary available for that school, - $300.00 a year.

John Deschamps who was at one time the teacher has applied for the position. I would suggest that the Rev Father Dugas be asked to give his recommendation as he knows these two and their qualifications better than I do.

The appointment of teachers for our Indian Schools is always made on the recommendation of the Missionary priest. So I would ask you to wait for the return of Fr.

I went last month to ascertain by myself the number of pupils we could count upon to attend school and I found that there were 10 children whose parents are anxious to have a teacher for their children and next spring three more children could attend the school.\n\nYour humble servant in Xat,\n\nRev. P. E. Lamarche, S.J.\n\nNepigon, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nwith reference to Rev. Father Lomarche's recommendation that the Red Rock school be re-opened, I beg to say that the Department would like to have an expression of opinion from you in this matter.\n\nIn April, of this year, you reported that you did not then consider it advisable to re-open the school till such time as a better attendance could be counted upon, and the Department would like to know whether the conditions have changed sufficiently to justify its reopening the school; and, if so, whether John Denchamps is the only available teacher.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPort Arthur, Jan. 18, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nRev.

Ag.,\nPort Arthur,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI called last Friday at your office, but you happened not to be there.\n\nIn reference to the Nepigon River School, I may say that the conditions are quite different from what they were when the school was reopened three years ago. There are four more families now established on the Reserve, at a short distance from the school. The number of children of school age were 7 or 6 and now it is 14 or 15.\n\nJohn Deschamps being now married may be expected to do better than he did the first time. There are always some families from the lake, camping the whole summer at the River, so that I strongly recommend to give that school another trial, and I, for my part, will do all I can to make it succeed. I hope to receive soon a favorable answer.\n\nYour humble servant in Xst,\n\nR.C. Samuels, Jf.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Feb 23/07\n\nNo. 153812/1\n\nI beg herewith to hand you Rev Father LeMarchen letter of Feb regarding the re-opening of Red Rock school in which he states the number of children is 14-16 and that in summer time this would be added to by a number of families from the Lake.\n\nHe strongly recommends the school to have another chance under John Deschamps as teacher and further that he will do all he can towards success.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 19, 1868.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., enclosing a communication from the Rev. P. F.

D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nN. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nThe Indians of Red Rock resident on the Nepigon River are desirous of having the school opened with John Deschamps as teacher.\n\nThere are now some 12 children who will be regular attendants, with the prospect that one or two more families will live there shortly.\n\nThe Lake Helen school is 6 to 7 miles from this point across the lake. This makes it almost impossible for these children to go there.\n\nThe Rev. Father Lemarche makes his head quarters at Lake Helen Mission and says he will keep a supervision over the Red Rock school; an opportunity should be given them; after a three months trial if not satisfactory it can be closed on his report.\n\nThe building should have new timbers in the foundation. Pierre Bonneers will supply the timber and do the work for $50.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nN.

Ag.\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to the Nepigon River School, all that I can say we cannot count on more than 5 to 6 children to attend that school at present. But if the Department is willing to keep the school for that number of pupils, it seems to me that John Deschamps could be tried for one quarter, and I promise to visit the school often enough to see if he can teach it properly. It is not so easy to find teachers for such schools.\n\nYours in X,\nRev. P. Lamothe\nNeil McDougall Ind. Ag., Port Arthur.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept 24th regarding the re-opening of Red Rock school, I herewith beg to hand you letter of 15th from Rev Father LeMarche who says if the Dept is willing to re-open the school for 5 or 6 children (he cannot count on more) under John Deschamps he would promise to visit the school often for a three months trial to see that he could teach properly.\n\nIf as the Rev Father says there would be only 5 or 6 children that they could count on it would be unwise to open the school at present.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 28th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing a letter from the Rev. Father Lemarche in further reference to his request to have the Red Rock School re-opened in charge of John Deschamps.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it is not advisable to re-open this school in view of the small number of children who could attend. You have already been informed that the Department has no intention of employing Mr. Deschamps as teacher of this school, and it would be useless to take him on trial. It might be well for Father Lemarche to try for the admission of some of the children on this Reserve to the Wikwemikong school, where vacancies are constantly occurring, and you might so inform him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nN. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nMr. Paget calls attention to the need of a school at Red Rock in the Fort William Agency.\n\nRed Rock is situated where the Nepigon River empties into Lake Helen. A few Indians reside there, but I am unable to state the number, as this reserve is included with the Lake Helen Reserve where a school is now in operation! A school-house was erected at Red Rock about twenty years ago and it might still be serviceable. I doubt if any white teacher would take the position and there have been constant efforts made by Chief Deschamps to have his son appointed to conduct the school. He was dismissed some eighteen years ago for the way in which he misconducted the school and he has been ever since then trying to get back. This school was dropped from the estimates many years ago and provision would have to be made for it, if it is decided to re-open it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, October 23, 1914.\nOttawa October 23rd, 1914,\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. F.H.

Father Belanger has also asked me to try to have this old school reopened. The chief claims fourteen children of school age live on the reserve. The old school house here is in very bad shape. Mr. Saget knows, and I should judge that it would take at least $2000 to put it in shape.\n\nI promised the Chief at Paqsa Plat that I would recommend a school for his reserve. They have more children than Red Rock, and I think they would appreciate a school building more than the Red Rock Indians.\n\nI suppose the building would cost about $4000, and if they had your approval they could get out the foundation piers this winter, and thus be ready to commence building in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nM.R.

Original on 153816/1.\n\nChief Joe Salt of the Red Rock Reserve is very anxious to have a school opened on his reserve. He offers to rent his house for school purposes for three dollars per month. The furniture from the Mobert School could be moved here. As the expenditure would be small I would recommend that a school be opened here for a year at least.\n\nThe Indians promise an attendance of fifteen or sixteen.\n\nThis question was raised at the council meeting and from I am of opinion it must be closed. The school is to be closed now to be applied elsewhere.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the application of the Chief of the Red Rock Band to have the school on his reserve re-opened, I beg to say that the Department will be willing to give this school a trial and will accept the Chief's offer of the use of his house for school purposes at the rate of $5.00 a month, provided a teacher can be obtained. You may have the furniture which was used in the Hobert school transferred to Red Rock.\n\nIf you have received any applications for the position of teacher of this school kindly forward them to the Department, with full information as to the age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., of the applicants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant re. Appointment of Miss Co. Harrison to the Red Rock School.\n\nI would recommend her appointment but urged upon the Dept't to notify her that the school should be kept cleaner than the Lake Helen School. The Indians at Lake Helen complained of the dirt at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 5, 1917.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Indian Day School which it is the intention to re-open at Red Rock.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss C. Harrison, who formerly taught the school at Lake Helen, as teacher of the Red Rock School and a salary will be paid her at the rate of $500.00 per annum, the same as she received while at Lake Helen school. Miss Harrison is being informed of her appointment and instructed that she should keep the school in a cleaner condition than she did while at Lake Helen.\n\nYou will be good enough to give Miss Harrison every assistance and endeavour to have the Indians send their children regularly. If, after a reasonable trial, the attendance does not warrant this school being kept open, it will have to be closed.\n\nShould the teacher require any school supplies she should forward a requisition through your office in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

The Department must request, in order to avoid any cause for complaint, that you will keep this school in a cleaner condition than you did while at Lake Helen school.\n\nShould you require any school supplies, you should make a requisition and forward it through the office of Mr. Agent Brown.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nMiss C.

I also understand that the school up the river is to be opened on the first of October. I would be glad to get it. It will be difficult to get a position at present in a public school, as they usually begin in January. I kept the Lake Helen school open during...\nThe month of July this summer, and\na full lawful vacation are included in\nthe school year. I suppose that will\nentitle me to my full quarter's salary,\nfor I have taught ten months at a\nsalary of five hundred dollars per year.\nI will send in the report for July\nas soon as I get a blank form\nfrom agent W.

Most of the Indians live at Red Rock, and it was decided to open a school there and Mr. Agent Brown was instructed to look out for a teacher. Mrs. Harrison might be transferred to this school but she is reported to be unpopular with the Indians. Mr. Inspector Finn says she is as good a teacher as could be secured for a school in this locality, and Father Belanger is favourable to her.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to employing the teacher who was formerly at the Lake Helen School, at the school about to be opened at Red Rock, I would suggest that Mr. Agent Brown be asked to report whether he recommends this teacher or not, as I understand that the Indians had a decided objection to her, as she had an adopted White boy who went to school and whose manners were anything but what they should be and he used profane language. Mrs. Harrison is quite an elderly person and although she may be well fitted to teach the Indian school, the Agent may have good reasons for not recommending her for the Red Rock School.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, August 27th., 1917.\nAugust 27th, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have had an application from Mrs. C.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWe Indians of the Red Rock Band held a meeting in regard to asking why it is that we do not have a school at our reserve instead of having a school at Lake Helen Mission. We have a number of children of school age and the following are the names that would attend:\n\nWilliam Salt, Benedict Salt, Benedict James,\nJerimah Abaskum, Matthew Abaskum Robert Deschamps\nAlbert Wadow, Michel Blakely Neil Manitobesee,\nAmelia James, Katherine Abaskum Lizzie Wadow,\nBeatrice Wadow, Margaret Manitobesee Maggie Deschamps,\nAngeline Deschamps Josephine Kitchiniany, Josephine Deschamps.\n\nWe Indians and residents of the Red Rock Reserve ask you to give us authority to build or remodel one large building for School House. As for a teacher we have one here that we would like to have to teach he already has taught the biggest part of the school year at Sand Point when that school opened up, and did not get any pay from the regular teacher also he has done a great deal towards the Hospital camp when we were building it.\n\nI have the following families at the Hospital camp:\nMrs. Walter Abaskum and family of seven children, Mrs. Thomas James and three children, Mr. and Mrs. Charley Lee, and two old blind people from Manitou. I am obliged to thank you the government for the support of the poor Indians I have left lots of my work aside in order to have the Hospital camp for these Indians in good condition.\n\nChief Joseph Salt\nOttawa, Oct. 17, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nA request has been received from Chief Joseph Salt, of the Red Rock Reserve, for the re-opening of a school on that reserve. He states that the Indians of the Red Rock Band held a meeting and wish to know why there is not a school on the reserve instead of at Lake Helen Mission. He gives the names of 12 children of school age who, he states, are residing on the Red Rock Reserve, and he requests authority to build or remodel a large building to be used as a school house.\n\nAs you are aware, we recently provided a rental for the use of the building which is used for school purposes at Lake Helen. The last return received from this school shows an enrolment of 16 pupils. This school is not on a reserve and the Indians living there should be residing on their own reserve at Red Rock.\n\nAs there would appear to be a sufficient number of children on the Red Rock Reserve to warrant a school being reopened, I have to request that you will state, as soon as possible, what it would cost to remodel and fit up for school purposes the building referred to by Chief Salt. You should also state whether, in your opinion, a school should be reopened for the benefit of the children of the Red Rock Reserve. It is considered that it would be only fair to the Indians of this reserve to provide them with a school as there are, no doubt, sufficient children at both Red Rock and Lake Helen Mission to have schools operated at both points.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views and full particulars as to the cost of fitting up the building referred to for school purposes at the Red Rock Reserve, as we are desirous of providing educational facilities for the Indian children of this reserve, in view of the fact that these Indians are complying with the wishes of the Department and residing on their own reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 17, 1922.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, addressed to Mr. Paget, of this Department, regarding the request of the Indians residing on the Red Rock Reserve for the establishment of a school, and stating the number of children of school age who would attend.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring this matter to Mr. W. R. Brown, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont., and requesting him to forward a report as to the cost of remodelling the building mentioned by you, which could be used for school purposes.\n\nProvided a suitable building for classroom accommodation can be fitted up without undue expense, the Department would be prepared to authorise the re-opening of a school on the Red Rock Reserve and paying the salary of a teacher. As soon as we have full particulars from our agent, we will be in a position to further consider your request and you will be advised as to the Department's decision regarding this matter.\n\nThe names of the families who are at the hospital camp have been noted, and I have to thank you for the interest which you have taken in the welfare of this camp, which is established for the support of poor Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Joseph Salt,\nRed Rock Reserve,\nNipigon, Ont.\nSir,\n\n9-8-1\n\nRe opening School at Red Rock Reserve.\n\nI would not care to recommend opening a school again there while the school at the Lady Helen Mission just a few miles distant is kept open with a very small attendance. Then again many of the Inspector's pupils mentioned by Chief Salt are tubercular and should not be allowed to attend school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.R. Brown,\nagent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 6, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the request made for the re-opening of a school on the Red Rock Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report on this matter, the Department is not prepared to authorize the opening of a school on this reserve. We are informing Chief Joseph Salt accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, Dec. 6, 1922.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 9th of October, last, regarding the request made by yourself and the Indians residing on the Red Rock Reserve for the opening of a school, I beg to say that after full enquiry has been made, the Department is not prepared to authorize the opening of a school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Joseph Bart,\nRed Rock Reserve,\nNipigon, Ont.\nMr. J. H. Potts\n\nNipigon Oct. 18/24\n\nSir:\n\nThis is to call your attention to the fact that there are 19 children here who should attend school. Children who are on the reserve. We had a meeting and we have come to conclusion that a school should be on the reserve. I am not asking to close Lake Helen School but the reserve should have first chance. Most of the Indians work here in winter. We are working on our road joining on the Government Road that leads to Nipigon. I would like very much to see the Indians gather here but as long as they get everything outside of reserve Indians will not settle here.\n\nSorry to write to you Mr. Burke answers no mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. E. Salt\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nA request has been received for the establishment of a school for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the Red Rock Reserve, it being stated that there are 19 children on the Reserve who could attend.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report stating whether the Indians reside permanently on the Red Rock Reserve, or whether they are only there for different periods of the year, also whether there is a building that could be used for school purposes, its condition and what furnishings in the way of desks, blackboards, etc., would be required. You should also state what accommodation there would be for a teacher in the way of a house or boarding facilities. Please state your views fully regarding the request for a school and give full information as asked for. An early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt Fort Arthur, Ont.\n\nNovember 11th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nre. File 9-8-1, of October 22nd, 1924.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo; in reply I wish to state, that I visited the Red Rock Indian Reserve on October 29th, 1924.\n\nThe School at the above mentioned Reserve is located about two miles from the Red Rock Reserve where the majority of the Band live, and have been living for the last 35 years. There are a few families living at the Reserve which is approximately five miles from the town of Nipigon, Ont.\n\nThere is no building at the Reserve that could be used for school purposes, and no accommodation for a teacher, as there is no road leading from the Reserve to Nipigon, and the majority of the Indians leave their reserve in the winter, to trap. I would strongly recommend leaving this matter as it stands. Upon investigating, I find there are only eight children of school age living on the Reserve.\n\nThe present school at Lake Helen where the majority of the Indians live, is only a mile and one half from Nipigon, Ont., which makes it very convenient for the Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

G. Dunn,\nTeacher\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn November last, we, the Anglican Indians of the Shesegwanning Reserve, received a communication, stating that your Department would recognize the school on this reserve conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, and would allow the old school building to be used for this school. It was at the time understood by us that in the near future steps would be taken to provide more adequate school accommodation. As, however, we have heard nothing further about the matter, we beg respectfully to submit for your consideration the following facts:\n\nThe building has previously been condemned, at a time when, I believe, the average attendance\nconsiderably less than it is in our school at the present time.\n\nThere are nineteen children on the register of the school, and the average attendance for the last year has been nearly eighteen.\n\nThe interior dimensions of the school-room are 23 ft x 14 ft x 7 ft, and the space is quite inadequate for the number of children attending.\n\nThere is no cloak room or other extra accommodation, with the exception of a small storm porch. There is no place for the storing of firewood, gardening tools, etc.\n\nCooking and other special instruction cannot be given at the school, but the children have to go outside to private dwellings for such purposes.\n\nThere is no provision of any kind for living quarters for the teacher.\n\nIn view of the above facts, we would ask you to give your consideration to the question of providing more suitable school premises, in order that the\ndifficulties and hindrances at present experienced in the working of the school may be removed.\n\nWe are, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJohniyaminiab\nDavid Edowishkoh\n\nPeter Nigomnewainah\nMatthew Edowishkoh\nGeorge Wabepyhtx\nPaul Cada\nRachel Cada\nLizzie Nigomnewainah\nJosette Nigomnewainah\nMike Cada\nRecords: 410674\n\nW Benson\n\nMr. Scott says this might be referred to.\n\nA. L. M.\nOttawa, August 20, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nA petition has been received from the Church of England members of the Sheshegwaning Band asking for the erection of a combined school-house and teacher's residence. They claim that the building in which their school is now held is too small for the average attendance and has no proper accommodation for cloak room, teaching of domestic science or the care of the material and there is no provision of any kind for teacher's rooms.\n\nBefore dealing with this application the Department would like you to report fully regarding the matters complained of and the necessity for more room. If it is decided that a new building should be put up it will be necessary to obtain a resolution of the band authorizing the required expenditure from their funds for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Church of England members of the Oseehiguaning Band sent in a petition sometime ago for the erection of a combined school-house and teacher's residence. Mr. Agent Baxter was asked to obtain a resolution from the band authorizing the required expenditure to be taken from their funds. Mr. Baxter has reported that as the majority of the voting members of the band are Roman Catholics they have declined to pass the required resolution.\n\nThere is no doubt that a new school building is needed, as the one in which the school is now held was condemned long ago and is totally unfit for the purpose, besides which there is no accommodation for a teacher on the reserve.\n\nSub-section 3 of Section 97 of the Indian Act provides that the Protestant or Catholic minority of any band may with the approval of and under regulations made by the Governor in Council have a separate school established on the reserve. The Department has sanctioned the operation of the Protestant School there and in order that\nit may be properly carried on a suitable building should be erected. Sub-section 2 of Section 59 of the Indian Act gives the Governor General in Council power to construct and repair school buildings and, as the Shehegwaning Band have a capital of $59,294.95 to their credit, they could well afford to put a new school-house there. If you are not prepared to make a recommendation to Council to take any portion of their capital for this purpose money should be provided in the estimates for putting up a combined school-house and teacher's residence. The Roman Catholic school on the reserve cost $5,600.15, but this building is large enough to accommodate all the pupils there. A smaller building would meet the requirements of the Protestant school and if the same class of building is put up it would cost in the neighbourhood of $4,000.00, as it is a very out-of-the-way place to get material and labour.\n\n[Signature]\nNo. 676\n\nFor Bay\n\nSeptember 10/1914\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Anglican Day School at the Sheshiguaning Reserve has asked for a flag for their school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH.

Bayly\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nMarch\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in which you request that a flag be sent for the Anglican School on the Sheshigwaning Reserve, and in reply, I beg to say that a flag will be forwarded from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, September 29, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant stating that you have seen Mr. McConnell, the well driller, and he says he would not move his outfit to Sheshegwaning unless he got three wells to drill.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not see the necessity for drilling three wells. You will be good enough to obtain from Mr. McConnell an estimate of the cost of moving his outfit and the price per foot for drilling two wells. It is thought that the settlers could get water from either of the two school wells.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nGore Bay, September 16th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Protestant school needs a well and there could be a well drilled in the farming settlement which would be of great benefit to a number of families.\n\nF.

In the mean time the matter will not be lost sight of, and the plans and specifications for a suitable building will be prepared, so that if funds are available the work will be executed next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF.

Sylvanus Phillip\nP.S.I.\nExtract from Report of Sylvanus Phillips, P.S.I., on the Sheshegwaning (prot) Indian School, December, 1914.\n\nOriginal on File 410624-6.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThis reserve requires a new school. The separate school near by the public school has a fine new building with residence attached. This is as it should be. The teachers should have separate quarters. A building, therefore, in keeping with the separate school should be furnished.\n\nThe Anglican part of the reserve are just completing a fine new church which will cost about $2,000.00. They will be able to pay $1,700.00 of this when the church is completed and dedicated. The Anglican people deserve great credit for the work they are doing on this reserve.\n\nSgd. Sylvanus Phillips,\n\nP.S.I.\nOttawa, January 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Sheeshgwaning Protestant School in which you state that this reserve requires a new school I beg to say that the Department is considering the question of erecting a new school at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSylvanus Phillips, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThis is only a suggestion and I trust your Department will consider it as such.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA. W. Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nI have the honor to inform you that some time ago your Department wrote me saying that you would consider the building of a Protestant school at Shekogwani.\n\nIn regard to lumber required for the building you could have all the scantling, joist, and 1\" rough pine lumber required for the building delivered on the school grounds at Shekogwani for $20.00 a thousand feet if it is delivered this winter and $25.00 a thousand feet if hauled on a wagon during the summer.\n\nAnd if the lumber has to be got at Fort Bay and taken to Shekogwani it would cost $20.00 a thousand at Fort Bay and about $4.00 to $6.00 a thousand feet for delivering it to Shekogwani.\n\nI was at a mill about four miles from Shekogwani and they asked me if I wanted to buy any lumber and I told them I did not but since I came here I thought that it would be a saving of from four to six dollars a thousand for your Department if you intended to build the school this year and if you had a sufficient lumber required for the building it could be delivered at Shekogwani this winter.\nOttawa, January 29, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in which you inform the Department that you can secure the supply of lumber required to erect a new school building for the Sheshegwaning Protestant School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department cannot consider the question of the erection of a new building for this school until after the estimates for the next fiscal year have been voted by parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dunn,\nTeacher.\nSheshgwaning Reserve,\nManitoulin Island,\nOntario.\n\n27th March, 1915.\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nTowards the end of last summer we petitioned you with reference to the erection of a new school building in connection with the Anglican Mission on this Reserve. We received a reply to the effect that it was then too late in the season to start building, but that the Department would have the matter under consideration, and would take steps to proceed with the work in the spring. We would now most respectfully bring the matter once again to your notice, as we feel that the question is too urgent a one to be overlooked.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, Mr. S. Phillips, when inspecting the school, has spoken of the need as one that should be supplied as soon as possible, and has, we believe, reported to that effect.\n\nWe, the Anglican Indians, have gone well forward with the building of our church, which, when complete, will cost about $2000, and we now desire to have a fitting and adequate school building, which we trust you will see your way to erect in the near future.\n\nWe are, Sirs,\n\nYours respectfully,\nMartin Sampson\nPaul Cada\nPeter Degonnawanah\nTom Whiteman\nMike Cada\nMichael Wahbiqeghik\nMrs. Josette Degonnawanah\nMrs. Louise Degonnawanah\nMrs. Rachel Cada\nMrs. Joseph Sampson\nMrs. Elizabeth Cada\nMrs. Maudlaney Wahbiqeghik\nMrs. Nancy Sampson\nOttawa, April 7, 1915.\n\nSirs,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the erection of a new building in connection with the Church of England school at Sheshgwaning I beg to say that this matter is under consideration and you will be definitely advised at an early date as to the action the Department will take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. Murray\nCounty...Middlesex County P. O. Address...Waterloo\nInspector...A. H. Miller Express Office...Waterloo\n\nREAD CAREFULLY.\n\nAlso\u2014in making arrangements for furnishing flower, vegetable and lawn grass seed to schools, the Schools' Division seeks to help teachers, and particularly rural school teachers, to secure suitable material results for promoting an interest in gardening and school ground improvement. In years past, as in the earlier years of the work, a charge is made for the seed. It may be purchased for gardens at either homes or schools.\n\nKind of Seed.\u2014The material supplied is of guaranteed high quality and, in amount, good value. Because it may be furnished through an organization connected with the Agricultural College, no question should be expected, however, it is good seed, but the improper planting, poor care, overwatering, and other factors injurious to children's gardening will more than offset the advantages of good seed. The flower seed is all of mixed varieties; the vegetable seed is of varieties specially selected.\n\nDistribution.\u2014Ex-pupils, teachers and parents joining in the practical work with the pupils may be permitted to secure seed in the school order, but it is naturally expected that the pupil's work will be put to educational uses by the teacher, and that the work will be put to the school's interest. Sunday Schools, Women's Institutes, Horticultural Societies, or any similar organizations may procure seed for civic enterprises they may undertake with children or adults for either education or civic Improvement. Unless under exceptional circumstances, children and adults, too, should be required to pay for their seeds; this will not only insure a proper interest in the gardening project, but will prevent neglect, and the development of a dependent spirit.\n\nSeed in Bulk.\u2014Where help is available and large supplies are required, it may be found advisable to purchase seed direct from the dealer. Seed catalogues may be secured from the following: D. M. Ferry Co., Windsor; Darch and Hunter, London; The Ontario Seed Co., Waterloo; John M. Bruce Co., Hamilton; J. M. Simmers, Toronto; Steele, Briggs Co., Toronto; Carter's Tested Seeds Co., Toronto; Graham Bros., Ottawa.\n\nGardening Note Books.\u2014In making the pupils' gardening work a vital part of the school curriculum and co-ordinating it with nature study, composition, art and other subjects, teachers should be encouraged to have the pupils keep their school records in a loose-leaf Garden Note Book. This should be of a size to permit the binding in of Government bulletins. Free copies of Circular 13A, Children's Gardening, will be supplied to the pupils if requested.\n\n(Over)\n**ORDER**\n\nAmount Enclosed: $1.50\n\nDate: 13 May 1915\n\n**NOTE.\u2014Remit by registered letter, postal note or money order.

The results of such work are twofold: in the first place the school work and the pupils' education are helped, and in the second place the status of the school is raised in the community and the interest in and support of education are increased.\n\nChildren's Clubs.\u2014The distribution is not restricted to school-ground improvement. Schools at which children may be organized into clubs, or at which a class or group of pupils may have planned together to carry on similar work at home, are permitted to participate under this scheme; pupils, teachers and parents joining in the practical work with the pupils' permission also. It is naturally expected that the pupils' experiences will be put to educational uses in the future.\n\nMaterials, Sour Out.\u2014The Schools' Division tries to procure the highest quality of supplies for the distribution at fair rates. It does not seek to supply cheap material. While it does not guarantee the material, it strives to protect schools against failures and loss. The selection made is of such hardy things as should do well under rather adverse conditions.\n\nVines.\u2014The vines are hardy except the Boston Ivy; it should not be bought for northern counties. The Clematis Punctata has masses of small white flowers, not large purple flowers. The Dutchman's Pipe has fine large leaves. The Rambler Roses are two of the best known varieties.\n\nGladiolus.\u2014The flowers of the Gladiolus make a splendid show. A few bed of them in front of a school would make a fine sight in August or the beginning of September. The bulbs are planted from April to July and lifted after the fall frosts, to be stored inside for the winter.\n\nDahlia.\u2014Dahlias produce their flowers in September and October. There are three types of flowers, viz., Garden, Decorative and Show. The tubers are planted in the ground when the weather becomes warm. Before hard frosts they are lifted, dried a little and stored inside for the winter.\n\n[Page 17]\nORDER\n\nAmount Enclosed $1.34\n\nDate 15th April 1915\n\nNote.\u2014Remit by registered letter, postal note or money order.

The shelf should be readily accessible. An agricultural bulletin board for displaying pictures, newspaper clippings, exercises, new weeds, etc., might be placed alongside the shelf. Some of the pupils might make these.\n\nAgriculture in the One-Teacher Schools.\u2014The agricultural teaching in a one-teacher rural school is not aimed primarily at giving young pupils a large fund of technical agricultural instruction. If a teacher succeeds in interesting her pupils in their agricultural environment, using this interest in the school work, makes them observant and inquiring, inspiring them to read and acquire knowledge for themselves; she has done much in adjusting the country school to meet the needs of country life.\n\nReading Should be Encouraged.\u2014While there is no text-book prescribed for the work in agriculture, it is important that pupils should be interested in reading for themselves upon agricultural topics, reproducing the best books, bulletins and periodicals, and trained to use them in connection with their class studies, debates, and experiments. The agricultural books should not be kept behind locked doors, but rather where pupils can get them without much trouble.\n\nThe aim is not to make Book Farmers but Reading Farmers. Not to teach agriculture from books only, but from nature also! Not one book but all good reading matter!\n\nThe teaching of agriculture is developing through Nature Study and Children's Gardening. The work should result in an inquiring mind and a desire to read!\nORDER\n\nAmount enclosed: $6.12\nDate: 15th April 1915\n\nNote.\u2014Remit by registered letter, postal note or money order. The order may be sent directly to the Students' Book Store, Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph. On orders of $5.00 or over, express or postal charges are met by the Book Store.

As we have often done in the past, we again protest with all our energy against the erection of another school with the Band's money.\n\nThree years ago, at the request of these same Anglican Indians, your Department has built, with our money, a large school near the farms of those Anglican Indians, and out of the central or overwhelming Catholic population. The year after, those same Anglican Indians have stolen away our Town Hall, with your last approval, and used it near their house, to use it as a school; and now our majority is about to be despised again by those few Indians who use our money to build school for their own children\u2014its five of them children have been taken to the fingewash Home, the others are too few to have a school of their own\u2014we know that there are some political influence in that affair.\n\nBut we ask for British fair play and the execution of the Indian Act.\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\nWilson Simpson Chief\nShi Shigawin\nMorrisville Rd.\nOttawa, May 12, 1915.\n\nChief:\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant protesting against the erection of another school on the Sheshegwaning Reserve with the band's money.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no intention of using any of the band's money for the erection of a second school on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The attendance at this school is very small and I think the present building will have to meet their needs, until conditions are such that we can find funds for a new building, combining a school-house and teacher's residence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

B. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOctober 12th, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter number 410624-5/, under date of September 18th, 1915.\n\nI have visited the Anglican school at Sheeshewaning and after going all over the building I have formed the opinion that it would only be a waste of money to repair the old building as it requires a new roof and a chimney the window casings are all loose and the rain beats in around them there is no ventilation whatever in the school nothing except a draught.\n\nThe school is 14 feet wide and 32 feet long and the ceiling is only 7 feet high there are sixteen pupils on the roll and the average attendance for the quarter was 13, so you can see that the building is much too small.\n\nI have figured that it will cost about $150.00 or $200.00 to repair this building to make fit for the winter.\n\nWe could have a nice cement school and teachers home built for about $1700.00 which will have to be built very soon and there is time to build it this fall yet and you would be saving the money that it would cost to repair the old school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nH. W. Baxter\nIndian Agent,\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nShehequawing Indian Reserve Anglican Section\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe, the undersigned Indians of the Shehequawing Reserve, Anglican section, do hereby petition the \"Department of Indian Affairs\" to reconsider their decision regarding the building of a new school-house in place of the old building now in use.\n\nThere is certainly some mistake as regards the number of pupils on roll in June last. It is stated in the letter from the Dept. dated Sept. 17th, that there were only eight pupils on the roll whereas there were eleven and there was a reason for the number being so small as that.\n\nThere are sixteen pupils on the roll at the present time and we are expecting at least six more very shortly.\n\nThe building in use just now is about 14' x 22' x 7' high (to ceiling). This does not give much air space for seventeen people. The building is also in a very bad condition. The roof leaks & the windows let in too much draught & too little light. The ceiling is so low that it makes the room very stuffy and oppressive. We are afraid our teacher will not stay unless something is done at once.\n\nThe Department promised last year that a new school-residence for the teacher should be erected this year and the undersigned look to the Dept. to keep that promise.\n\nThe number of children under the\nschool age, in the section, assures an increase in the number of pupils on roll.\n\nJohn Migunininch\nDavid Sampson\nMatthew Scumpson\nOricka Cada\nCelia Ogonnewenah\nPaul Cada\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNO.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nOctober 12th, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose a letter received from the Anglican Indians of the Sheshegwaning Band requesting that you reconsider your decision in regards to the building a new school for them on their Reserve.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nH. W. Baxter\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa,\nThe Dept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSheshegwaning\nOct. 14/15\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the condition of school-house on the Sheshegwaning Reserve (Anglican section) where I have been engaged to teach.\n\nThe building is in a very dilapidated condition totally unfit for the purpose.\n\nWhen I was engaged to come here, it was on the understanding that a suitable school residence was to be built this year. I am now living in the house of Chief Risamivina, who very unsatisfactorily moved out that I might have a house fit myself & family until the new building is erected. He is at great inconvenience and therefore I am placed in an uncomfortable position.\n\nWe have sixteen pupils on the roll and I have two little girls which have to stay at home as there is no accommodation for them. They are rather delicate & I would not care to have them crowded in that building. The roof leaks, the windows are failing to pieces and do not let in sufficient light, the place is draughty, ceiling just above one's head in fact, nothing is satisfactory.\n\nThe scholars here are bright intelligent, clever and quick to learn. One of them took first prize for penmanship at Silverwater Fair this year, competing against five schools including Silverwater.\n\nThe whole section of the Anglican Indians here are very progressive, anxious to learn, and are very desirable citizens.\nIt is absurd to teach \"Hygiene\" in a little dark, stuffy hole like that! In fact, it is a model building \"for killing children.\"\n\nI feel sure that the Department will attend to this matter at once, now I have brought it before them.\n\nI remain, Gentlemen,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEdwin Weller.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 1116\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nOctober 12th, 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose a letter received from Mr. E. Weeks teacher in the Sheshegwaning Anglican school complaining of the school on the Reserve and his statement is correct as to the condition of the building. This same building was reported unfit for to be used as a school in the year 1911 when the new Catholic school was built and there has never been any repairs done on the school since that time.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nH.

The 8 of our men present signed against the petition.\n\nThe protestant signed in favor of spending the money.\n\nMr. Baxter, the Indian agent did not let us know that he called the meeting to ask for this money as all of our men would have been present.\n\nWe do not wish to spend money for another school to be built on our reserve.\n\nThe building that the anglican...\nIndians have in large enough for the few children they have. If it needs repairing let them repair it.\n\nMr. Baxter, the Indian agent makes a great deal trouble and causes much quarrelling and misunderstanding every time he comes to ask for money to be spent for the good of only the Anglican Indians.\n\nPlease stop him from coming as he likes to ask for money for these Indians.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMrs. Wilson, Samson Chief\nShe She Quaening\nMorrisville Po\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 28, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 12th instant in further reference to the Sheshegwaning Anglican School and enclosing letters from the Anglican Indians of the band and the teacher in reference thereto.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds available for the erection of a new building at the present time and, in view of your report, it is not considered that the old building is worth repairing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the erection of a protestant school on the Sheshgwaning Indian Reserve, and protesting against band funds being used for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I think this is a\nOttawa, December 1, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Baxter, who forwarded to the Department your letter of the 4th of October last, in regard to the unsuitable condition of the building at present used for the Anglican School at Sheeshewaning, was informed that the Department had no funds available for the erection of a new building at the present time and that it was not considered that the building now in use was worth repairing. Kindly make any suggestions you deem feasible for improving the present conditions for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Weeks, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSheeshewaning (C.E.) School,\nMorrisville, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: yours of the 1st\n\nThe present building could be fixed up for this winter without much outlay.\n\nI would suggest that the end of building be knocked out & the building extended about 10 or 12 feet. This could be done for $100, including lumber, cartage & labour.\n\nI think this should be put in hand at once.\nI have nineteen on roll myself making 20 in all. You will surely see the importance of immediate action.\n\nI note you did not mention anything about increase of salary.\n\nRemain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdwin Weeks\nI have nineteen on roll myself making 20 in all. You will surely see the importance of immediate action.\n\nI note you did not mention anything about increase of salary.\n\nRemain, dear sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdwin Weeks.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that upon my last visit to the Sheshegwaning Indian Reserve the Indians of the Anglican school ask me to write your Department to find out if you would grant them the sum of $125.00 with which to repair the Anglican school on their Reserve. They claim that for the above amount that they can make sufficient repairs to the building so that it will do for the winter. They figured on raising the roof a foot and a half and building twelve feet to the end of the school as it is now. They have 19 children in the little building which has a seven foot ceiling and during school hours the teacher has to keep the four windows open from the top all the time in order to stay in the school at all. The work would all be done with common lumber and papered with roofing paper on the outside and felt paper on the inside so that when a new school was built for them the lumber could all be used in the new building and would not be wasted to any extent. The work could all be done in about six days and labour and material not to exceed $125.00.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n15-18\nMarch 2\nJune 11-8\nSept 16-13\nDec 17-14\n\nSherley Waring\nC.E.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nApplication has been made for improvements to the Sheshegwaning C. E. Indian School, Manitoba, to provide temporary accommodation for the pupils attending this school, pending a favourable time when funds will be available for the erection of a permanent building for their use.\n\nThere are at this time 19 pupils enrolled, with an average attendance of 14 during three-quarters of last year, which would probably be increased if accommodation were adequate.\n\nThe building occupied is that formerly used as an R. C. school, (moved from the old position to the present site near R. C. school) and is small and in poor condition, being 17 x 22 with 7 ft. ceiling, and provides air-space accommodation for 10 pupils only, while the floor area accommodates 22. The building is reported to be in very\nvery poor condition; yet, as this is the only building available, and the school apparently a necessity, and the outlay necessary to make temporary improvements, small, I would recommend for your consideration that an expenditure of $250.00 be authorized to provide this extension, and any additional expenditure incurred beyond this amount, to be provided by the Indians who are accommodated. The improvements suggested are, an extension to the present building of 12 x 17 with roof plate 10 feet above floor line, and the present building raised to that height, which will provide regulation accommodation for twenty-one children.\n\nThe materials could be purchased and deposited on the grounds and the frame work extension erected during this fiscal year; the balance about $75 to $100 would have to be provided from 1916-17 vote.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, January 22, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to improvements to the She-shawaning Church of England school, and in reply to inform you that you are requested to make and forward to the Department a plan of the present old building, showing exactly the positions of doors, windows, etc., with their sizes marked on the inclosed sketch. The size of the ground floor joists should also be marked with sill and its height above ground, and position of chimney in the building, and, if it is proposed to add to the front or rear of the school. A photograph of the school from front and side or in perspective would also be of benefit, if it can be obtained.\n\nThis information should be furnished at the earliest possible time so that a plan can be prepared and the work undertaken at once providing it is approved and can be completed for the amount available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay,\nOnt.\nOttawa, February 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nOn June 22nd last the Department wrote you in reference to certain improvements proposed to be made in connection with the Sheshegwaning C. E. School, requesting information which will enable it to prepare a plan and determine if the work is to be done. No answer has yet been received from you and as the matter is urgent, please be good enough to give this your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to reply to Department letter number 410,624-5 under date of January 22nd 1916.\n\nI am enclosing sketch received with above letter with the measurements as requested.\n\nThe Anglican members of the Band had built a piece on to the school themselves. I did not know anything about it until it was done; they built a piece onto the rear end of the building also raised the roof one foot. The work that they have done is only with rough lumber and tar paper on the outside with felt paper on the inside. They claimed that they would not let their children go to the school without there being more room so they bought some lumber and built a piece on to the school themselves. The lumber they used in the work can all be used again in making the proper repairs on the school. I am enclosing a sketch showing the size of the school also a sketch showing the size of the piece built on to the school by the Indians.\n\nThey kept account of the material that they used and their time and they figure the repairs that they put on the school to cost $103.00 for time and material they ask me if your Department would pay the amount. I told them I did not know as the work had never been authorized by your Department but that if you would pay for the work that I would get their bills and send your Department their account.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 4, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to addition to the Sheshegwaning Church of England Indian School and in reply to inform you that it was the intention of the Department to have made improvements to the school which would have provided the necessary accommodation and air space for the pupils in attendance pending the erection of a more permanent building. Owing to your delay in answering the Department's inquiries in reference to the building, the Indians have undertaken the work themselves, and while the extension erected by them does not provide the accommodation that the Department intended, now that it is done, the accounts will be paid providing they are sent in at once in the regular form certified by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

School, instructing you that these accounts should be sent in certified by you before the end of March.\n\nAlthough you have been twice notified of the urgency of the matter, the accounts have not yet come to hand.

Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI beg to call your attention to the unsatisfactory state of affairs re. the Anglican School here. The Indians being unable to get the Dept. to move in the matter last winter added a piece on to the end of present building. This was never intended to be a permanent job, but something had to be done at that time as the building could not accommodate the number of pupils.\n\nThe Dept. cannot possibly understand the condition of the building. It is absolutely past repair unfit for a school building. When it blows, the noise of flapping tar paper is so great I cannot hear pupils and be answer questions when it rains. Water pours in through the roof & I have to keep moving things from place to place to keep them dry.\n\nIt seems very strange that while we are double the number of pupils attending school than are attending the Roman C. school, they have a large up-to-date commodious school, while we have a small dilapidated old shed. We would like to know what the\nDept. has in mind re. this matter as certainly must be done this summer.\n\nI have to tramp half a mile or more across fields to get to the school, which is no joke in the winter, where the snow piles up in drifts about four feet deep. One has to break a new track every time as the wind fills it in a few minutes after. Many a time last winter I was quite delayed after breaking a track to the school.\n\nAgain, the late chief John Kigamwina, moved out of the house to make room for me & my family, thinking it would not be for long. He is crowded into a little house with two rooms. Himself, wife, wife's mother, the son & two girls - six persons in two small rooms. You can imagine how mean it makes me feel. It is impossible to stamp out consumption that way.\n\nI do not wish to give the Dept. any unnecessary trouble. My aim is to do all I can both for the Indians & to help the Dept. where possible.\n\nWe have fifteen on the roll & my own making seventeen & there will be more September.\nAs far as the teacher's dwelling is concerned, I would put up with almost anything so long as it was on the school grounds. A small four-roomed log house would suit me. It's cheap to build. It would cost very little.\n\nI would like to know, as I will have to make some other arrangements in a house in the near future.\n\nMr. D. Sampson has asked me to mention that he has never been paid for taking the census of the Indian families two years in succession, although he received word from the Dept. that he should be paid.\n\nAlso that there has been no money paid for alteration to building, nor for lumber, nor for cord wood or cleaner.\n\nHe asked me to request that these monies be forwarded without delay, trusting to be favoured with an early reply, stating that these matters will be attended to without delay.\n\nRemain, Gentlemen,\n\nYour obediently,\nExxon Weeks.\nTeacher\n**INFORMATION**\n\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| Dec 27 | 50 # nails @ 4\u00a2 per # | 2.00 |\n|      | 10 # spikes @ 5\u00a2 \" # | 50 |\n| 39   | 4 glass 12x 20 @ 15\u00a2 | 60 |\n|      | 4 \" 12x 24 @ 15\u00a2 | 60 |\n|      | 4 rolls felt paper @ 60\u00a2 | 2.40 |\n|      | 3 \" tar \" @ 75\u00a2 | 2.25 |\n|      | 6 boxes tacks @ 5\u00a2 | 30 |\n|      | 10# nails @ 5\u00a2 | 50 |\n\n**Total:** $5183.95\n\n---\n\n**Roy Smyth**\n\n1956 feet of lumber @ 12.00 per M\n\n$5184.33\n\n---\n\nAbove goods were used in repairing Anglican school at Sheshegwaning Reserve.\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nAgent.\nReturn of Labour on the Anglican School Shingwauk\n\nFor week ended January 8th 1914\n\nAll payments to be made in presence of person signing as witness.\n\n| NAMES          | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thur. | Fri. | Sat. | No. days worked | Price per day | Amount of Wages | RECEIVED PAYMENT |\n|----------------|------|-------|------|-------|------|------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| John Negomewinah | 1/2  | 3/2   | 1/2  | 1/2   | 1/2  | 1/2  | 5                | $0.50         | $2.50           |                  |\n| Tom Negomewinah  | 1/2  | 3/2   | 1/2  | 1/2   | 1/2  | 1/2  | 5                | $0.50         | $2.50           |                  |\n| Dave Sampson     | 1/2  | 3/2   | 1/2  | 1/2   | 1/2  | 1/2  | 5                | $0.50         | $2.50           |                  |\n| Matt Sampson     | 1/2  | 3/2   | 1/2  | 1/2   | 1/2  | 1/2  | 5                | $0.50         | $2.50           |                  |\n| Paul Cada        | 1/2  | 3/2   | 1/2  | 1/2   | 1/2  | 1/2  | 5                | $0.50         | $2.50           |                  |\n| J.

This addition is covered with tar paper and the rain gets through causing great inconvenience.\n\nIt would appear as if the Department should take some steps at an early date to provide a suitable building for the Protestant portion of the band. Such a building should have at least three rooms for the accommodation of the teacher. At present Mr. Weeks is living in a house of an Indian which has been loaned to him, the Indian living in a small shack in the meantime. The Indian is desirous of having his house to live in and the teacher must find another place but did not know where he could obtain one. If he is to keep the school open some provision must be made at once for a house for him.\nOttawa, July 28, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to enclose advertisement calling for Tenders for a combined School and Teacher's Residence for the Sheshegwaning Band, Manitoulin Island, Ont., and to request that you will be good enough to have it inserted in the following papers with as little delay as possible.\n\nThe Times (S W) Owen Sound, Ont.\nEnterprise Messenger (W) Collingwood,\nThe Recorder (W) Gore Bay,\nThe Mining News (W) Sudbury,\nThe Sault Star (D) Sault Ste.

I have therefore taken the liberty of changing the date of completion until the 31st December and getting the outside painting which I would like to do in the spring which I have fixed to finish by 1st June next.\n\nYou will no doubt be aware that here it will be too late to get inside painting when this school will be finished but that.\n\nI will have the inside work done and ready for use by 31st\n\nand the outside will be completed by the above date as per.

You should also measure carefully the form as laid out and make certain that the contractor is following out the plans which should not be deviated from in any particular without the written consent of the Department.\n\nThe contractor is desirous of having the foundation changed from stone to concrete and the Department has provisionally consented to the change on condition that the work be carried out according to a letter sent him on the 15th instant, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information.

Should additional inspections be necessary for special reasons, on notice to the Department these will be given consideration.\n\nCopies of certificate forms as well as plans and specifications are being sent you herewith under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen after being absent from the reserve for several weeks, I returned a few days ago, I found white men had started a new building on the reserve. I was wondering about it. I have been told that the Department was building a new school for this Band.\n\nThe Band knows nothing at all about it as they were not asked for a vote on the question nor was there a resolution passed.\n\nI would like to find out if there is any misunderstanding going on, on the part of the Anglican portion of the Band.\n\nWhat is causing Chief and councillors to be here? Let them know what you are going to do.\n\nThis is Indian reserve not a government land and who is going to belong to the building Indians or Department, and who is going to pay his money for the building?\n\nKindly let me know what the arrangement about the new building is.\n\nThanking you in advance for the information.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nWilson Sampson, Chief\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians here at this place are asking for some changes in their school. First, that the outside entrance to the basement goes down straight and a porch be built over it, which is very necessary. The basement is only down about four feet in the ground, at that depth the snow hardens. Second, they want the eastern part in side for no doubt it would freeze up in the winter time. There is a corner...\nin under kitchen where basement could be put. I moved one window six feet away from corner in order to leave space for eastern. They also want a pipe and pump fitted. Third. They want a bedroom over school room in attic. This can be also done but a little of the stair-way would show in school room up near the ceiling. Running partition out six or seven feet from each plate, spiked and strapped from joice to\nrafter would support the ceiling and put in some extra long joists. Put a window in the rear gable end of school. All the changes they asked for would cost about five hundred dollars. I told the Indians what it cost and they were all satisfied. I made no provisions for material for extra work and I would have to draw it about forty miles on wagons. If same work will all be up this week and I must know.\nat once whether those changes will be made or not as it would give me considerable trouble if I had to make the changes when the work is well on the way. Hoping to hear from you by return mail addressed to Silverwater.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWe the undersigned Indians, hereby warn you, Mr. Henry of Chippewa, to keep off the School grounds. We do not tolerate any improper conduct from you.\n\nWe also request you to be considerate of our children. We do not want any improper conduct from you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nWe the representatives of the Sioux Indians of the Red River Reserve do hereby request the following alterations to be made in their new school building:\n\n1. The going down into cellar should be straight instead of on the angle which would have a porch built over it to prevent snow being blown under the steps which would happen if built according to present plan.\n\n2. A well for soft water should be in the cellar with pump in kitchen for cooking.\n\n3. The bedrooms are not sufficient for teachers own family; three rooms at least being needed.\n\nAn extra bedroom could be made over the school room. The whole space over school building is being wasted and easily be made into an extra bedroom.\nWe request the Dept. to consider this matter & let Mr. Green, the contractor, know without delay as the alteration will cost much more when the work has progressed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdward [signature]\nMr. Silverwater\nOct 3rd 1916\n\nDuncan C Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived Plans and Specifications of the Shishigwaring School last night\u2014went to Shishigwaring this morning and inspected the work of building the school. The contractor is doing good work but he is building the foundation with cement concrete and the specifications says to be built with stone & bricks. I spoke to him about it and he said he had got it changed to cement concrete.\n\nI remain\nyour obedient servant,\nJohn Kemp Inspector\nOttawa, October 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 9th instant in reference to changes to the Sheshogwaning school asked for by members of the band, and in reply to inform you that the Department regrets that they cannot permit those changes in so far as the building of a room above the class-room. It will, however, dispense with the cupboard in the back room which will permit of that being used as a double room, the value of the partition and doors to be deducted from the contract.\n\nThe Department notes that you were only able to excavate 4 feet instead of the 6 feet shown in the basement portion of the building. The cistern will, therefore, have to be erected in the basement; separate wall will, however, be necessary, as the use of the wall of building as a cistern is not considered satisfactory and cannot be permitted.\n\nThe entrance to cellar as shown is satisfactory and will not be changed, but a porch may be authorized at a later date when estimates have been obtained.\n\nThe providing of a pump and sink will be given consideration at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge Strain, Esq.,\nContractor,\nSilverwater,\nOnt.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSilver Water\nOct 9th 1916\n\nTo Duncan C. Scott\nDeputy Dominion Inspector\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLeo Strain Contractor\nHas requested for me write you in regard the\nEast Side Stairs to Basement as the Plan does\nnot call for a Porch over the entrance\nwhich will fill with snow in the winter\nand if you wish one built it would have\nto be built before the siding is put on the\nSchool so the siding on the Porch would\nmatch with the siding on the School house\nas the Plan showing the Stairs going down the\nend of the School with turn at the bottom to go\nin the Door which I think would be much better\nif they went down straight for the Door for\nsiding in wood and a Porch six feet wide\neight feet long and seven feet high from the\nfoundation awaiting your reply.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\nJohn Kent Inspector\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 3rd with sample copy Certificate I was at Shishigwaming 5th and 6th Inspecting the work on school and the 6th and 7th. The work done is first class in every particular aspect to have it ready for the Finance within one days work as the distance from where I live to Shishigwaming School is eight miles through a bush road all the way which makes traveling very slow that is the reason why I take two day for each Inspection I stay at Shishigwaming over night hoping you will let me make two inspections each well as I cannot go away for to work at my table and inspect the construction at this time.\n\nI remain\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nJohn Kemp\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nDuncan E.

The cistern will be permitted inside of basement owing to the rock being too near to the surface of the ground to permit of safety outside.\n\nThe other matters referred to will be given consideration later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

In the event of this not being satisfactory, I have to request that you will telegraph me immediately upon receipt of this letter, when the Acting Indian Agent will be instructed to make the necessary inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would point out to you that there are but two bedrooms in the house adjoining school and these are very small. I have three children, one boy and two girls, all between 10 & 15 years of age. We therefore need at least three bedrooms. You suggest a partition in one of the bedrooms.\nThis is impossible. The rooms are already too small after allowing for staircase. I fail to see how you can divide the remaining space into two rooms. Every room in the house is uncomfortably small with the whole space above schoolroom going to waste. I fail to see any reason why there should not be at least one room over school-room where two rooms could be arranged quite easily. We positively must have three bedrooms ought to have four. In the residence at the other school here, the whole of the space above schoolroom is used; most of the dwelling being over the school. I am sure that if you will consider this matter you will agree with me that the accommodation is inadequate. The extra room over school-room is very necessary. As work is proceeding very rapidly I would feel grateful if you would consider this.\nwithout delay.\n\nobliged,\n\nYours sincerely,\nE.

Remain\n\nyour obedient servant,\nJohn Kemp\nInspector of Construction\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nYour telegram re Inspector Kemp of 25th inst only arrived this A.M. owing to storm breaking the wire and I went to Sheshegwaning and saw Mr Kemp and he said he would at once stop working for the contractor. The plans and specifications came to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nI beg to inform you that Mr Strain Contractor of Sheshegwaning School drew my attention to the entrance to the basement which on plan shows the steps parallel to therear of building and turns into basement. This will be rather awkward to get in wood as there seems no other provision for taking it in, and would I think more convenient if it went straight in also if furnace had to be taken out at any time it could hardly be done with the turn, also as so much drifting of snow in winter here it would be better if the cellar way was covered by porch.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your communication of the 12th inst., No. 410624/5.\n\nWe do not understand why you should object to the slight alterations to building required by us in our previous application.\n\nThe whole of we Protestant Indians are agreed that these alterations are absolutely necessary; we think that as the building will be paid for out of the Indian funds, that we Indians should have some voice in the matter. When we voted $500 to the war fund there was no kick.\nfrom the Dept., yet when we want a little alteration in the plans of school building the Dept. object.\n\nWe beg to say that unless we can have this extra room over school-room as requested there must be an extra room provided elsewhere, as the house is too small there are not sufficient rooms to accommodate the teacher's family.\n\nAs regards the other little alterations we ask for we still request that these be made, as each one is quite necessary.\n\nPlease oblige by giving us an immediate reply.\nas building is now well on the way alterations will cost more after the work has advanced.\n\nJohn Niyawina\nDavid Sampson\nPeter Niyawina\nMatthew Jackson\nOwen Sampson\nJoseph Sagaw\nEdward Sagaw\nOttawa, November 3, 1916.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the enlarging of Sheshegwaning school-teacher's residence, and in reply to say that the accommodation provided is for a single teacher who is usually engaged in these schools. At Sheshegwaning for the time being the teacher is a married man with a family; his successor will, in all probability, be single, as few married teacher's are available.\n\nThe Department wishes to conserve the Band's funds whenever possible and discourages unnecessary expense in building. It is, however, preparing plans for an extension with kitchen and bed-room which will be authorized, providing the work is done at the estimated cost. The plans and specifications will be completed and forwarded to the Acting Indian Agent within a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

Now if the department will send me two thousand dollars they would finish up building all but outside painting to be done next spring. They could then pay me the six hundred and fifty-two dollars of a balance. All my material has got to be paid for now and I have used my own money till my bank account is run out. Before to Mr. Kemp, the inspector, to get me one thousand dollars and I find that won't pay for\nmaternal. I want want to get everything straightened up smoothly so I am not going to have wages for myself. A nice and clean pump is very necessary right away. Bed entrance is in bad shape according to plan.

I made one last week and once this week. If Mr. Gregory acting Agent can do the inspecting for five dollars per week kindly give him the job of inspecting the construction of the school and residence at Shikshijawang as I cannot keep my family on five dollars per week.\n\nKindly let me hear from you as soon as possible and oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Kemp\nInspector of Construction\nOttawa, November 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department wrote you on November 7 last, in reference to addition to the Sheshegwaning school, wherein you were instructed to have the contractor at once proceed with the erection, providing his charges did not exceed the Department's estimate of $500.00. In the event of this work being proceeded with it will be necessary to give this closer attention and Inspector Kemp will therefore be authorized to give the work two inspections each week until the end of December, when the contract is to be completed with the exception of painting for which provision has been made to complete in the spring.\n\nI have also to request that you will forward me full information in reference to the inspections made by Mr. Kemp while working for the contractor, giving the date of his commencement and the leaving his employ, stating also if he were at work for the contractor on the days on which his inspections were made.

Much snow this last week\nas we have had very wet weather. Indians\nhave the furnace installed. I think he the furnace\nshould be fixed. The door and the window\nare in the house in the church. I told him\nabout it and he said not. Received plans for\naddition to residence yesterday went to Whitecap Bay\nwith them to buy the timber. Said he could not\nbuild it for five hundred dollars. The Indians\ncame to me and wanted me for to build it\nby the day and hire three for to do the work\nso they could get the money as they have no other\nwork for this winter. I told them to write you\nI built their Church two years ago as I have\nbeen carpentering for 35 years and building\nI think I know what it can be done for\nI can build it for five hundred or less and have the Indians help for wages by the day if not thrown in my way & build it kindly let me know and I will build it for you if you choose to let me do and inspection per week is not enough for me for a few men trying to hire from your town? Remember your obedient servant\n\nJohn Kerr\n\nInspector of Construction\nMorrisville,\nManitoulin.\nNov. 11/16.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI am requested by Mr. John Neganuma to acknowledge receipt of your communication No. 410624-5 referring to extension of teacher's residence & to thank the Dept. for meeting their requirements in a manner that is fully satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nThey consider the price you offer for the extension to be quite fair sufficient, & they do not wish the Dept. to go beyond the $500.\n\nThe reason they wish me to mention this is because they hear that although the contractor is willing to do the work for that sum, yet he intends to try to get an extra hundred dollars.\n\nIf he don't care to do the work for the $500 offered, the Indians know of a man who will.\n\nThis is written in confidence & the Indians do not wish the contractor to know anything of this letter, as he is constantly bothering them to apply to the Dept. for extras which are not...\nneeded.\n\nThe Dept can inform the contractor that\nthe price is final. Nothing further will be\nneeded, he will do the work for the price\noffered.\n\nPlease remember to treat this with strict\nconfidence.\n\nI remain, Gentlemen,\n\nYours obediently,\nE. Weeks\n(for John Hoganwirin)\nReplying to your letter of 14th inst I beg to report that Inspector John Kemp, I am informed by the contractor, has worked for him all the time not even stopping when he promised me he would. The contractor does not want him as he does not consider him a good enough workman but from what I could make out has been holding the \"big stick\", the impression I got was that the situation was becoming intolerant, work being done that would not suit the contractor and when men called down for it the Inspector saying he was boss and it was good enough for him, and in my opinion the sooner his services are dispensed with the better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, November 20, 1916\n\nJ.

Mc Gregor\nIndian Agent stating that the Department had written him that they would not pay my wages for October as some of the days I put in for I was working for his strain. I was not working for those none of those days I don't think it is fair that I should not get my wages because some other person says I was I think it should be investigated and see who is telling the truth.\nKindly let me hear from you and oblige\nJohn Keefe\nInspector of Construction\nGentlemen:\n\nRe new school building\n\nThe contractor, Mr. Geo. Strain, tells me he cannot build the addition to dwelling house by fall. He wants to put the matter off until next spring.\n\nI beg to say - It is absolutely necessary that the work be done at once & finished with the rest of the contract as I cannot possibly crowd my family into those two tiny bedrooms.\n\nIf he cannot do the work in the time set forth in your letter & at the price $500, there are men around here just anxious to get the chance.\n\nIt is the wish of myself & also of the Indians that all the work be completed by the end of the year. It could easily have been completed by Nov. 15th.\n\nI do hope Dept. will hustle the work along as I cannot keep the present school building warm, it is so draughty.\n\nI remain Gentlemen,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nIn answer to your recent reference to new additions to school house, Shesquawenying. On receipt of your letter I ordered material at once and started putting on the roof though as they had to be completed into another direction. The addition is a good idea but your price $5.00 is not enough. When I first figured on school I knew that I could buy my material in Owen Sound, which I did, Chartered John Harrison's boat and scow and had it all delivered at Shesquawenying. Now I have to...\nI went to the city and traveled 50 miles with wagons or sleighs which will make it cost me a great deal more. I can get nothing up there but gravel. However, I am going to go ahead with the addition and leave the matter with you. I should have six hundred dollars.\n\nSince I got your letter we have had a great change in the weather. It is very cold and foggy and hard. This may prevent me from getting in concrete foundation and you know cement work is not good if frozen before it sets. However, I will put all material on\nthe ground, if we get a\ngood spell I will go ahead\nand get foundations in and\ngo ahead with the building.\nIf not it will have to\nlay over until spring,\nexcepting I am sure by\nnow to go ahead with it in\nany case taking the responsi-\nbility of me in case of frost.\nThe teachers and Indians are\nsatisfied to let it lay over\nuntil spring if weather\nconditions are not favorable.\nI could have it done early\nin May. The school house\nnow on the way is\nnearly finished, all but\noutside painting, it having\none coat. Write me shortly\nif you can best date Geo. Stair.\nOttawa, November 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 11th instant in reference to the erection of addition to residence, Sheshegwaning Indian School, and in reply to inform you that arrangements have already been made with George Strain, the contractor, for the doing of the work at the estimated cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Make necessary arrangements for further inspection of building and advise Department of action taken in the matter.'\nD. C. Scott.\"\n\nIt would appear from your letter that we were unfortunate in the selection of an inspector. It is hoped, however, that the work and material used on the contract has been of a good and satisfactory quality, and before another certificate is issued, it will be well to report fully on the building including both workmanship and material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

With reference to the concrete work, providing the weather is unfavourable, concrete forms may be erected and temporary posts put in to support the building and removed when concrete is placed. The posts may be of concrete moulded in the basement and would not then require removing when the concrete wall is being built.\n\nThe work should be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Weeks, Esq.,\nTeacher, Morristown,\nManitoulin Island, Ont.\nRe your telegram of 20th inst I went yesterday to Sheshegwaning and found that Mr Kemp had quit work at 10 O'clock owing to slight illness and I sent him telephone message as per your instructions. I don't know of any available to take his place, in fact I know that there is not a suitable man in the neighborhood and a suitable man from Gore Bay is not to be had as they are all too busy men now scarce. As far as the main building is concerned the work is at the last round and could when completed as well as now, the finish of the foundation walls will have to be left until next spring as it is too cold for cement work.\n\nThey are commencing to put in foundation for new part today fit and I thought if weather for launch tomorrow I would go up but roads are so bad it is almost a three days trip by team and car impossible. If I can locate a man suitable for Inspector will report in the meantime will try and look after things.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith further reference to your letter of Novr 14th, I have a communication from Mr Kemp in which he says \"In regard to time for the month of Augusst Octr\" \"I did not work for Strain any of the dates I put in for \" \"inspecting the building and I will make affidavit to that\" \"effect and so will Strain\".\n\nI subsequently asked Strain and he said he did not have his time book with him but said that Kemp worked for him every day he was there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 29, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 22nd ultimo in reference to the Sheshegwaning Indian school contracts inspections, and in reply to say that the information therein has been noted, also that no further action will be taken in connection with Mr. Kemp's account pending further information from you, with particulars as to the time he was working for the contractor and for which charges are made as Inspector.\n\nEncl.\n\nIt is hoped that the weather will permit of the addition to the building being completed, except painting, before the setting in of Winter. Providing, however, that cement work cannot be done the contractor has been instructed to mould concrete posts in the basement to support the foundation which will permit of the balance of work being done, and the concrete work can then be done during favourable weather in the Spring.\n\nA copy of letter to the contractor is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I will build the addition I have the foundation built and all the material on the ground for to build it with if the weather will permit.

Should weather conditions, however, not permit of this work being satisfactorily done, it necessarily must be postponed until conditions are favourable and the Acting Indian Agent will be requested to determine this.\n\nThe information with respect to John Kemp's time has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean\n\nW. Russell McGregor, Esq., Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGore Bay,\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe new school building.\n\nI would strongly advise you to send a reliable & competent man from Ottawa to examine this building & to check off the work with specification. Specifications have been entirely ignored & the work that has been done is very poor & unsatisfactory.\n\nFor instance:\n- Ground floor is not laid diagonally as specified.\n- In house is soft wood instead of hard wood.\n- There is but one layer of tar paper under outside sheathing & also under shingles.\n- Specification calls for two layers outside & two layers of felt under shingles.\n- Shingles are painted on top only instead of dipped.\n- Eavetroughs are 4\" O.G. instead of 10' valley trough.\n- There is no ridge-board to main building.\n- Cellar walls are leaking badly & plaster in school-room is badly cracked.\n\nThese are some of the shortcomings, but there are many more.\nThe front steps are a disgrace to the building. The whole of the work that is covered is \"shoddy.\"\n\nThe first inspector worked hand-in-hand with the contractor, knew it needed a man used to inspecting buildings, some above who can be relied on for honesty to go over the work from cellar to ridge.\n\nThe Dept. would save both money & trouble in the future, by getting the work inspected now, before settling with contractors. I hate to get mixed up in this kind of thing, but I feel that I would be neglecting my duty, both to the Dept. & to the Indians, if I did not inform you about these conditions.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nE.

This does not, however, in any way imply that the contract is being accepted as satisfactory, as it is proposed to have the building thoroughly inspected from headquarters before proceeding with the work in the Spring. This is considered necessary to ensure that the materials and construction are in accordance with that required by the plans and specifications.\n\nProviding the interior of the building is in condition for occupation, you should arrange for the placing of the desks, etc., and furnishings of the old school in the new class-room, and permit the teacher to occupy the residence so that the school may be held in the new building after the beginning of the new year.\n\nYour report should be forwarded as soon as possible so that any necessary arrangements may be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that the building is being temporarily occupied for school purposes and for residence by the teacher, for which temporary occupation the keys will be accepted for you in trust by the Acting Indian Agent.\n\nIt is the intention of the Department to have the building inspected from headquarters before again commencing work in the spring. You will therefore not proceed with the further completion of the contract until the work has been inspected and written notice from the Department given to proceed with the work.

I say him in the office on 19th inst and he said he had left on the 15th and that they were holding school in the new building so I presume that the seats and furniture had been moved in and I have had no further word.\n\nI am glad to know that you are sending an Inspector to look over the building &c as it is not possible to get a suitable man here, and it will be more satisfactory all round, and while there are some things not quite according to plans there has been the very best of materials used and the building will be a credit to the builder and when finished will be quite a handsome structur\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe contractor has left a lot of work unfinished and what he has done is very unsatisfactory not according to contract.\n\nI wish to ask you, on behalf of the Protestant Indians, interested, to have his work valued & pay him according to value of work done & as regards the unfinished work, we Indians can do it ourselves, as well, & as cheap as anyone else. We don't want this man around here any more.\n\nThere are no closets for the children & these must be done at once.\n\nThere has been no levelling done around building but contractor has piled up banks of yellow clay & left a great number of large boulders all around the building.

McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGore Bay,\nOnt.\nA STATEMENT OF FACTS!\n\n1. Britain is financing this war, is short of labor and therefore charges us more for what we buy from her. Remember we buy a large percentage of our Supplies in Britain. Added to this increased cost we must pay to the Dominion Government a 5 per cent. War Tax on what we import from Britain, and 7\u00bd per cent. on Supplies from other countries.\n\n2. Supplies that were formerly purchased in Austria or Germany, where labor is cheap, must now be bought elsewhere, where a fair wage is paid, hence a large increase in our cost.\n\n3. It is impossible to hire skilled labor. Britain took away many of our best men to work in her Munition Factories. Nearly 300,000 of our men are under arms, and the number is to be increased to 500,000. A shortage of labor means increased cost of production.\n\n4. The increased prices WE MUST PAY, make it imperative that our customers pay us an advance on our Thirtieth Annual Catalogue listed prices. We averaged the increased costs and find that we are compelled to add 10 per cent. to selling prices given in our last Catalogue.\n\n5. To protect the Crown\u2014the School and the Home\u2014You must keep business moving. Canadian Business has to stand Canada's end of the War.\n\nThis is the situation as clearly as we can express it, and we ask your co-operation under the circumstances.\n\nBuy NOW!\nPrices are more likely to go Up than Down!\nMay 26, 1917.\n\nMr. J. Russell McGregor,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of May 25th may say that your remittance of $31.55 came in from Ottawa and was credited to the Indian Agent, Ottawa.\n\nHowever we have now adjusted this matter and given you credit for the amount which leaves a balance due us of $4.17. You state that this amount was deducted on account of Statement of Facts not being attached, and we enclose you herein the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.N. MOYER COMPANY LIMITED,\nper\n\nACCOUNTANT.\n\nB.\nMay 31st 1917.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith \"statement of facts\" in connection with account of Messrs E.W.N.Meyer Co.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nAgain referring to your letter of Jan 5th and also to mine of May 18th, I have a communication from the Contractor, Mr Strain who says that he has a brick house to put up on the North shore and wishes to know if Inspector is to be sent up at once and if not would like the visit postponed for three weeks, and would like to know as soon as possible,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, June 9, 1917.\n\nJ.

There are made but still in Cere Bay, and he will take up and put in, he having omitted to put in partitions and sand boxes in closets, and hinges on seat covers and I insisted that this be done and will guarantee that this will be done and thus not delay Mr. Smith in sending his check as he needs the money.

After the contract was let extra to the amount of $500.00 were authorized, and when the work was completed the total amount expended was $4152.00. As the Order in Council covered only the original amount ($3852.00) an other Order in council is required to cover the $500.00 additional taken from the Capital Funds. The amount at credit of this Band is $61,032.00.\n\nAccountant.\n\n19th September, 1916.\nOttawa, September 19, 1916.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nWith reference to Order in Council of 1st September, 1916, approving of an expenditure of $3652.00 on the construction of a combined school house and teacher's residence on the Sheeshowaning Indian reserve, the same to be charged to the capital at the credit of the Sheeshowaning band, the undersigned begs to report that the work could not be completed for the amount of the tender, and extras to the extent of $500.00 worth had to be purchased.\n\nAs the purchase of the extras referred to was necessary, the undersigned would recommend that under Section 89 of the Indian Act authority be given for charging the said cost of $500.00 to the capital at the credit of the Sheeshowaning band, which amounts to $61,032.00.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nThe recommendation to Council herewith is for an expenditure of $562.00 for extras over and above the amount of $3652.00 which was authorized by C.C. of 1st September, 1916, to be spent on the erection of a permanent school-house and teacher's residence on the Wechaga-wan- ing reserve on Manitoulin Island. $3652.00 was the amount of the lowest tender for the work.\n\nThe extras consist of such articles as a pump for the cistern, bookcases for the school room, lead piping, a flag pole, etc., etc.\n\nExpenditures on school-houses are made from capital under Section 89 of the Indian Act without a resolution of the band.\n\nIndian Affairs,\nSeptember 15, 1916.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, reporting that the work in connection with the construction of a combined school house and teachers' residence on the Sheshagwaning Indian reserve on Manitoulin Island, could not be completed for the amount of the tender, viz: $3,652 and that it was necessary to purchase extras to the extent of $500; that the initial expenditure of $3,652 was approved by Order in Council of the 1st September, 1916, and was chargeable to the capital at the credit of the Band of the said reserve.\n\nThe Superintendent General recommends that under Section 89 of the Indian Act, authority be given for charging the further expenditure of $500 to the capital at the credit of the Sheshagwaning Band, which amounts to $61,032.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSheshogwaning Band,\n\nREPORT NO. 96\n\nMINUTE NO.\n\nNo. of Account 247\n\nINDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo Messrs Jackson & Co.,\n\nDATE | Sheshogwaning Ang School | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1918 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 419624/4 dated October 10th 1918. | \nOctober 15th To 2 Deer Knobs | 60\n\nREBY Certify that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed urges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith account of Messrs Jackson & Co., for goods supplied Sheehawening Aug School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR PAYMENT\n\nAccountant\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the Sheashegwaning C.

We note that certain alterations will be required next spring, and this matter should be drawn to the attention of the Department in due time to have the work carried out next summer. When communicating with the Department in this connection, you should state what work is necessary and the approximate cost of the same.\n\nWe hope that the repairs which have recently been made to the furnace will meet the requirements for the coming winter.

School, I beg to advise that after a great deal of delay I have received estimate of cost of repairing same; the mantling weighs 425 lbs. and cost at the foundry in Toronto 14\u00bd cts pound, there would be the freight to Gore Bay and then to Sheshegwaning, a hole would have to be put through a cement wall to admit of cold air pipe on that side, as the absence of the cold air is what caused the damage. It would cost $125.00 to repair plus the cost of taking down the brick covering and rebuilding, which as I could get done with Indian labor would not cost much, some few brick might be necessary and cement for laying the walls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of repairing the furnace at the Shehewaning Anglican Indian Day School. It is noted that you state the cost of obtaining a new fire box and the labour in installing same would be approximately $125, plus the expense of taking down and rebuilding the brick covering around the furnace.\n\nPlease state if it is absolutely necessary that these repairs be made this fall or whether it would not be possible to carry on with the present furnace, without undergoing the expense mentioned by you. If the present furnace with a few minor repairs could be made serviceable for the coming winter, the Department would prefer not to undertake the expense of putting in a new fire box and labour required in taking down and rebuilding the brick covering. I should be pleased to hear from you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. H. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of 23rd instant re repairs to furnace at Sheshgwaning C.E. School, I beg to advise that the only way repairs could be made for the present would be to make opening in cement cellar wall (inside wall) and bolt plates inside and out, filling with cement which would make temporary repairs and should work besides the cold air which would come through the hole would prevent it getting so hot on that side and plates would not melt.\n\nThe blacksmith at Silver Water would do the job and for about $15.00 and I have instructed Mr. Weeks to have the work done in that way as furnace will soon be needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 29th ultimo, in further reference to the repairs required to the furnace at the Sheshagwaning C. of E. School, I have to say that you may arrange to have the temporary repairs, as mentioned by you, carried out. You may have the blacksmith at Silver Water do the work. We note that you estimate the cost to be approximately \u00a315. This matter should receive your early attention, in order that the furnace will be ready for use at an early date.

Crouchman, Silver Water, Ont.\n\nfor Repairs to C.E. School, Sheshawaning, Ont.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 12-8-5 dated Oct. 3rd 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 24, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWhen the Department decided to assist the Sheeshgwaning C. of E. Indian Day School in 1913, the grant was paid from Parliamentary Appropriation. All current expenses for this school were met from Vote, until the fiscal year 1917-18. From that year, certain miscellaneous accounts (never the teacher's salary) have been charged to Band Funds - the total amounts taken from this source being as follows:\n\n| Year    | Amount   |\n|---------|----------|\n| 1917-18 | $235.60  |\n| 1918-19 | 459.37   |\n| 1919-20 | 220.00   |\n| 1920-21 | 275.95   |\n| 1921-22 | 367.55   |\n| 1922-23 | 97.91    |\n| 1923-24 | 500.00 (estimated) |\n\nInterested members of the Band and others have been informed that the expenses of the C. of E. School were being met by Parliamentary Appropriation. I believe this assertion has been made because the salary and most of the current expenses were paid from Vote.\n\nI wish to recommend that all current expenses of the Sheeshgwaning C. of E. Indian Day School be paid from Appropriation.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that Mr. E. Weeks, Ans. School, Sheshawangani requests new leather valves for pump and 2 quarts of floor paint for kitchen & Dining room floors and will do the work and painting himself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, December 16th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase and have delivered to the teacher of the Sheshegwaning Indian Day School new leather valves for the pump and two quarts of floor paint for the kitchen and dining room floors. We note that the teacher will do the work in the repairing of the pump and the painting of the floors.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the above material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The small attendance enables the teacher to get the necessary time.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe Fifth Class is making satisfactory progress but I would recommend that fewer examinations subjects be taken that at present.

This is due to the return of a family having three children of school age so that the outlook for the school is brighter.

All primary pupils are very slow due to the fact that they can speak little or no English at first.\n\n[OVER]\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 142\nThe second class was examined in reading and spelling and did fairly.\n\nThe third class was examined in writing, grammar, reading, arithmetic, spelling, drawing.\n\nWhile this class shows improvement it is very doubtful whether either pupil will be prepared for the Entrance Examination next June.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT of Furniture\n\nCARE of MATERIAL\n\nCLEANLINESS of Pupils\n\ndo School-house\n\nOBEYANCE\n\nCONDUCT of Pupils in School\n\ndo out of School\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nPlease indicate what classroom equipment should be supplied\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk\n\nDesks\n\nBenches\n\nChairs\n\nCupboards\n\nBlackboards\n\nStoves\n\nStovepipes\n\nWashbasins\n\nBrooms\n\nAxes\n\nSoap\n\nTowels\n\nPails\n\nDrinking Cups\n\nLooking-glasses\n\nOther equipment\n\nglobe, books, and a very fair supply of materials for teaching.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nThere is no change in the condition of the buildings.

It seemed to us today that there was more freedom between teachers and pupils so that this experiment of having Indian teachers may work out very well.

Miss Parker was appointed to teach the school in 1882. I taught March June July 2 quarters of that year. Since that time the school has been closed and Mr. Van Abbott states in his last tabular statement that there are 76 children of school age on the Res of the Michipicoten & Big Bluffs Band.\n\nI think that an endeavor should be made to have the school re-opened. Mr. Abbott states in his annual report that there are 30 children of school age on this Res. I would recommend that he be asked to explain this difference between his tabular statement and what he states in his report.\n\nJohn McFarlane\nOctober 11th 59\n\nSir,\n\nIt appears from the last Fabulous statement that there are 76 children at school age in the Key of the Bishopric of Keewatin. The Dept. has considered that an effort should be made to have the school at Wuchepooten reopened. In your annual report you state that there are 30 children of school age in the Key. You will need to explain the difference between you.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 16450 dated 1st October 1889 asking me to explain the difference between 6 children of the age to attend school in Tabular Valleys and 30 children of an age to attend school living on the Reserve.

Van Abbott, Esq:\nIndian Lands Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.:\nPlease include $250.00 in Estimates to provide Salary of teacher at Michipicoten school.\n\n10-7-96.\nFort Williams, Oct. 25th October 1877\n\nJ. A. Smart, Esq.,\nDept. Superintendent, Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAllow me to bring to your notice, that the Indians living on Michipicoten Reserve stand in sore need of a teacher for their children, whom there are at present, 21 of school age. They are quite anxious to see their school at last opened once more, as for the last 12 years, their boys and girls have been deprived from the benefits of education, which your Department always so liberally grants to other Bands, and that too without any fault of theirs. They are an intelligent lot of people capable of appreciating the advantages of learning.\n\nA couple of years ago, their school-house, a neat log building one story high, plastered inside & clapboarded outside, was moved up to the head of its former place down the river, through the kindness of your Department, and the people felt confident that school would at last be opened again. I made application to Ottawa for the salary of a teacher, a little over a year ago, the then Deputy Superintendent replied that the Department would make an effort to obtain a grant for that purpose at the next session of Parliament. I suppose the move was not voted, as no salary was granted.\n\nI herewith renew my application, hoping to be more successful this time.\nI would like to have the school in working order by July next.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Red) Jos. Specht, M.F.\n\nMissionary.\nIndian agency\nSmith & Sons\n29th Oct 1897\n\nI have the honor to forward you\nherein the letter addressed by Mr. Mark Ege\ndept Superintendent of Indian Affairs Ottawa\nreceived by me from Rev. Mr. Joseph\nof Fort William. The letter being when\nI have read same, and see that the\nRev. Gentleman states that there\nare 21 children at present of school\nage there, more for the last two years\nI have found very few families residing\non the 175 acres of the Ontario Reserve.\nThe church and school house are both\nthere. The Rev. Gentleman has been acting\nfor a teacher for some years past.\nThere is no resident priest then the\nplace is only visited periodically\nby a layman Sunday School attends to\nthe duties at other times.\n\nI have the honor to be\nSir,\nYour most obedient\nH. W. Abbott\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary Dept.\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th October last, enclosing a letter from Rev. Father Specht, applying for a grant of $350 for the salary of a teacher at Michipicoten; and in reply I beg to say that an item of $350 for this purpose will be included in the Estimates for 1897-8, which it is hoped may be passed by Parliament.\n\nKindly inform Rev. Father Specht accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.
