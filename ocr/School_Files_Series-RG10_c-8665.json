It is fast and saves a lot of hard labor. Fairbanks-Morse has one of these pumps and can supply it immediately. The cost, I understand, is approximately $100.00.\n\nBrother informs me that the old pump is useless and one of the same type would cost at least $155.00. As stated above the pump is available now but may not be in a week's time. I would, therefore, recommend authority be granted for the purchase of the pump immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

It will be delivered to them by the Ford Motor Company of Winnipeg.\n\nThe water tank which is required for the above must hold 1,000 gallons and cannot be bought ready-made. It must be of the gasoline type tanks, oval in shape and the length of the truck chassis.\n\nThere are several firms in the city of Winnipeg which make a specialty of the manufacturing of such tanks. I am listing a few so that you may know where to apply for this service.\n\n1) Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Ltd., Logan Ave.\n2) Vulcan Iron Works Ltd., Sutherland and Maple.\n3) Westeel Products Limited, CNR Tracks & Desautels.\n4) Canadian Rogers Sheet, Metal & Roofing Ltd., 1109 Winnipeg Ave.\n\nWe are trying to have the truck held in Winnipeg by the Ford Motor Works so that it will be available to the Company which secures the contract for the building of the tank.\n\n...2(over)\nThe school principal is very anxious that this job be completed as quickly as possible so as to avoid the high cost of water transportation which the Department is now daily assuming.\n\nSo we hope that your purchasing Department will proceed as expeditiously as it can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

At the time the above noted letter was written the Department found, owing to lack of funds, that it was impossible to consider buying a new plant, however, the machine is nine months older and according to the Principal should be replaced.\n\nWill you please advise.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMay 28th, 1947.\n**RAILWAY COMPANY CARRIER**\n\n**THIS MEMORANDUM**\n\nIs an acknowledgment that a bill of lading has been issued and is not the Original Bill of Lading, nor a copy or duplicate, covering the property named herein, and is intended solely for filing or record.\n\nRECEIVED, subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of the receipt by the carrier of the property described in the Original Bill of Lading.\n\nat [Date]\n\nFrom CRANE LIMITED\n\nThe Rate of Freight from [From Location] To [To Location] is in Cents per 100 Lbs.\n\nConsigned to [Consignee]\n\nProvince or State of [Province/State]\n\nCounty of [County]\n\nRoute [Route Number]\n\nCar Initial [Car Initial]\n\nCar No. [Car Number]\n\n| Description of Articles | Quantity | Weight (lbs.) | Class | Check |\n|-------------------------|----------|---------------|-------|------|\n| Bags Iron Pipe Fittings | 2        |               |       |      |\n| Pipes                   |          |               |       |      |\n| Iron Valves             |          |               |       |      |\n| Wrought Iron-Steel Pipe |          |               |       |      |\n| Loose Fittings for Plain CI Pipe | | | | |\n| Cast Iron Oil Pipe | | | | |\n| Steam-Oil Separators | | | | |\n| and parts | | | | |\n| Traps | | | | |\n| Iron Belts | | | | |\n| Brass Pipe | | | | |\n| Brass Pipe Fittings | | | | |\n| Valves | | | | |\n| Iron Stands for above | | | | |\n| Loose Iron Radiators for H.W. or Stove | | | | |\n| Iron Sectional heating Bollers | | | | |\n| Parts for above | | | | |\n| Boxes Cement, Pipe fitting, in cans | | | | |\n| Asbestos Gaskets | | | | |\n| Packing | | | | |\n| Rubber | | | | |\n| Gaskets, Pkg.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWe have received your letters of May 28th and June 16th in connection with the request that you have received from the principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation for the Sandy Bay school there was included an amount of $2,000. for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment. We have already either authorized or paid the following:\n\n- New Tank $405.00\n- Piping $725.00\n- Labour painting $155.00\n- Barn $470.00\n\nIn addition to the above, we have decided to place an order for the blower in order to permit the school management to use coal instead of wood in the future.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the renewed request of the principal for a new engine and generator. To purchase these would involve a considerable amount and as a result the funds specifically provided for this school in the current year's appropriation will be greatly exceeded. It is our intention to secure the following:\n\n\"1 only \"Lister\" 3 Cylinder, 4 Cycle, Tank cooled diesel engine rated at 27 H.P. at 1000 RPM at 330 feet altitude. The Bore and stroke 4\u00bd\" x 5\u00bd\",\n\"Flywheel - 26\" x 4\u00bd\"\nFuel Tank - 20 gallons\nWater Tank - 450 gallons. Size 42\" x 84\"\n\n\"I only size C 14\" 8 groove pulley $1,745.00\n\n\"The above price includes the 8 groove pulley and the usual equipment, exhaust silencer, air silencer, fuel tank and piping, starting handle, set of tools, fuel funnel with strainer, water tank and connections. The cylinder liner is treated with the Lister process of chrome hardening.\n\n\"I only Generator.\"\n\nYou should consult the principal and ascertain if he considers the equipment mentioned would meet his requirements. It is the same type of machine as we recently supplied to the Beauval Residential School. An immediate reply would be appreciated as it will probably require some time to secure this equipment.\n\nIn view of the expenditures outlined in this letter and the further equipment that the Department is prepared to purchase, you should point out to the principal very definitely that we will not be in a position to consider any further requests for the Sandy Bay Residential School during the current fiscal year.\n\nWe do not intend to authorize at the present time the expenditure requested for the installation of additional wash basins and for eaves trough.\n\nBernard F.

The project is still incomplete. The Bureau of Mines is still collecting the data on hardness of water in various areas.\n\nWhere a school wants advice in the meantime, the principal should write to one of the big soap companies in the Toronto area. They are very co-operative.\n\nIf it is liquid toilet soap for hand dispensers the principal should ask for the soap produced to Government specification 2-GP-1 with directions for use.\n\nC.A.F.C.

It has not been the policy of the Department to supply soap to Indian residential schools.\n\nWhen the school management is buying the soap required they should point out to the soap manufacturer the difficulty you have as a result of hard water and I have no doubt that they will be able to recommend a type of soap that will give the best satisfaction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

For this purpose the following material is needed.\n\n- 12 sheets ten-test 4' x 10'\n- 100 lin. feet ten-test mold\n- 500 sq ft 4' x 10' v-joint\n- 50 pieces 2x4 x 10' spruce\n- 100 lin. ft. round mold\n- 100 lin. ft. 1/2x 2\" mold\n- 2 doors 2'x 8\" x 6'-8\"\n- 3 pieces 6\"x 10' door frame\n- 8 Pieces 4\" x 12' trimming\n- 2 door knobs\n- 2 sets door hinges\n- 10 lbs 1 1/2 galv. head nails\n- 10 lbs. 2\" finishing nails\n- 25 lbs 4\" com nails\n- 25 lbs 2 1/2 com nails\n\nYours truly,\n\nJean Lambert\nPrincipal\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSeptember 16, 1947.\n\nThe attached list of material was handed into the agency office on the 13th instant, by Father J. Lambert, Principal of Sendy Bay Residential School.\n\nThe material is required for making a partition in the grade 1 classroom. At present there are 115 children in attendance, and he advises that there will be 140 in attendance by the end of this week. He claims that he will have two Grade 1 pupils, \"A\" and \"B\" classes. The intention is to divide the classroom into two rooms for these classes, so there will be no interference. He claims to have teachers for each class. This class room is in addition to the usual junior and senior classrooms which will not be changed. The idea of the \"A\" and \"B\" classes is for backward pupils, or for children of ten to twelve years of age who are just starting school. They will be promoted to the usual junior room as soon as their progress warrants the change.\n\nThe list of material is complete, and will make a sound-proof wall. The work of erecting will be done by the school staff.\n\nJ.

Battleship inlaid linoleum, as per sample, is required for the chapel floor, which measures - 80 x 35 feet. Preferably not plain as it is too hard to keep clean.\n\n2. Two large rocking chairs for Supervisor's rooms.\n\nThe linoleum you will note is for the chapel floor. I do not know if this is a legitimate request or not, however, the chapel is part of the school building. The request for two comfortable rocking chairs does not entail much expense and I think the staff members deserve some consideration. The chairs might cost about $10.00 each and I recommend they be purchased.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nJanuary 6, 1948.\n\nMr. A.G.

The motor cannot run very long in such a condition. In a letter received from the department last fall, we were notified that the motor would be replaced by a new one. To date nothing further has been done nor heard on this matter. The present motor has been running since 1938 and has been carrying a heavy overload since 1929 when the two wings were added to the school.\n\nThe heating and water systems are both powered by automatic electric motors drawing heavily on the new set of batteries installed last winter. These are giving good service, but they will not stand their guaranteed time even with the good care we are giving them, the motor being in such a poor condition. The present condition of the motor may bring on every serious emergency any time, and we are without authority to solve such an emergency should a breakdown occur. The batteries even in their A-1 shape could not carry the load for more than twelve hours. Last year, in June, a breakdown occurred and we were a full week without power. Luckily at that time of the year the load is at its lightest. We could not possibly encounter a like emergency in winter and carry on with the school work.\n\nWe wish to notify you beforehand of the present state of affairs and ask for instructions now in case a breakdown should occur and which we feel is bound to come about in a very short time. We suggest it would be preferable to install a 27 h.p. automatic lighting plant which would start when the heavy load comes on and save the batteries from carrying the overload.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

At the present time they are using the following:\n\nOne 6 K.W. Lister diesel-driven generating unit - this was purchased at a cost of $1,450 in December, 1938.\n\nA new set of Globelite batteries, 450 A.H., 110 volt, was supplied in December, 1946.\n\nSince the original lighting plant was installed, the accommodation in the building has increased and also the number of pupils enrolled. As a consequence, we are advised that the following motors are in use:\n\n1 \u00bd H.P. for washing machine.\n1 \u00bd H.P. for water system in the stable.\n1 \u00bd H.P. for grinder in the workshop.\n1 2 H.P. for saw, compressor and drill.\n1 \u00bd H.P. for cream separator.\n1 \u00bd H.P. for heating system.\n1 \u00bd H.P. for water system.\n1 \u00bd amp. for DC to AC convertor.\n\nIn addition to the above, there are approximately three hundred electric lights with an average of approximately 60 watts each.\nIt has been suggested by the management of the school that an 8 K.W., 16 H.P. diesel would take care of the load and provide sufficient reserve power in case of necessity.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me have your opinion on the matter in order that we may arrange with the Purchasing Branch for the securing of the equipment required.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nDirector.\nSandy Bay Indian School.\nMarius P.O.

If you will kindly authorise it, we would be able to bring it to \"Dominion Motors\", Ford dealers in Winnipeg to have it checked, sometime in April. We mentioned this firm because they are the only really competent ones around here. Smaller dealers in nearby villages are not equipped to do this work thoroughly.\n\nThe winter season has been a very strenuous one for the truck and we feel that this check up would pay off in longer service.

The account covers the cost of twelve chair desks but you make the following notation on the account, \"Except one chair desk\".\n\nWe infer from this that you only received eleven desks and we are consequently paying the Company for that number.\n\nWe cannot understand why you did not report this matter to us sooner. When supplies are ordered by the Department and the goods arrive you should certify the account immediately and return it to the Department.\n\nPlease let us hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. F.J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res. School,\nMarius, Man.\nApril 19, 1948.\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nWe note that the statement \"except one chair desk\" refers to the fact that one desk was received in bad condition. You should have entered a claim against the transportation company and notified us immediately the desks were received. So much time has elapsed since the desks reached the school it is practically impossible for us to obtain any adjustment now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We feel that it would be more satisfactory to have an Officer from this Division inspect the existing electrical system and make recommendations than to ask Mr. Gow in Winnipeg to assign a member of his staff to make a technical survey and report his findings upon which this Division would make recommendations for lighting plant equipment.\n\nWe understand that the Indian Affairs Branch has a plan under consideration whereby an inspection company would conduct surveys and prepare reports and recommendations in connection with the structures and services at a number of schools including the above.\n\nIn the event that it is not reasonable to have a report and recommendation prepared by the inspection company within a suitable time and if it is considered urgent, Mr. Kosmar could be assigned to the electrical inspection of this school about the first week in June. The electrical inspection at the remaining schools referred to in our memorandum of March 2nd could be scheduled for the latter part of August.\n\nUpon advice of the Indian Affairs Branch in connection with the above, we will give the matter our prompt attention.\n\nR.A.

Anthropology, which gives Man a much better understanding of his physical characteristics.\n\nA famous study at present seems to be the Dr. E. H. Evans of Chicago University, who is trying to determine where Eskimos came from. His conclusion is that Eskimos are practically identical with Europeans, and therefore they are not descendants of European race populations, but immigrants from Siberia. They are probably the oldest people north and developed their peculiarities early.\n\nDr. Evans' theory is supported by the fact that many ancient relics have been reported as far south as Labrador Island.\n\n**NEW DRUG TO FIGHT T.B.**\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 A new synthetic drug for the treatment of tuberculosis has been developed.

It attacks the living portion of the bacillus cell. During the course of the experiment, the living cell of the bacillus, such as lactic acid and streptomycin, are relatively insoluble in fat.\n\n**ST. BONIFACE MEETING**\n\nST.

The council, consisting of several missionaries, many day-schools, and hundreds of mission posts under the care of the Oblate Missionaries across Canada, discussed the problems presented over the convention. A review of the work done by the Oblate Fathers and Welfare training Commission for the past twelve years was presented, and the council discussed the future plans for the advancement of education, cooperative, recreational centers on the reservations, and the formation of a Welfare Association for the Indians of the Manitou Oblate Province.\n\nRev.

I had often heard of Indian Schools from different people on various occasions. The impression received from these had been so developed in me as to desire to find out for myself just what was being done in Indian Schools. It was not without interest therefore that I took advantage of an offer extended to visit an Indian Technical School. I say Technical on account of the training received.\n\nSandy Bay Indian School is Father Beaulieu, pastor of the Reserve, and to Father Florentin, Saulteaux, Father Jean-Baptiste, Eab-and-Flow, Crane River and other reserve posts, was also sent Father Chagnon, who spent most of his life as principal of the school. Father Chagnon has, as a hobby, collected one of the most complete collections of birds' nests in Canada. These birds are housed in glass cases, as a permanent exhibit. Mr. O. Brayer and V. Laviole, devote their time to the upkeep of the school and the supervision of training to the pupils.\n\n(Concluded on Page 2)\nIndian Land Title in Canada\n\nIn view of the paramount importance given to the land estates of the Indians called 'Reserves', it seems opportune for your Parliamentarian Observers to publish a few historical facts on this subject.\n\nThe British Government has always recognized the Indian's title to land, which consisted of the whole area of the country, the districts occupied by them, and the Crown reserved to itself the exclusive right to treat with the Indians. In the case of Quebec, on the other hand, during the days of French Rule in Canada, the French claimed the new colony by right of discovery, and did not recognize any Indian title. As a matter of grace the French did not set apart reserves for the Indians, but applied the same exceptions to the reserve in Quebec and in the Maritimes.\n\nThe British assumed the French title to lands after the conquest, and the Indians were confirmed in the possession of the reserves which occurred by the Proclamation of 1763. However, in British Columbia the Provincial Government has not recognized any Indian title, and the Dominion Government has set apart reserves in which the Government retains an interest, called reverorsions, which will be held until such time as the Indians shall cease to require the land.\n\nIn Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the provinces have taken over the old policy of recognizing the Indian title has been followed. Large tracts of land have been ceded by the Indians to the Crown, and the proceeds are paid in goods or money, or for an annuity, or for both. In these Treaties the Indians reserved certain areas of land, which are now held by the Crown in the Crown, in trust for the Indians, and the ceded territory is administered by the province. At times Indians surrender their title for the purpose of clearing the land for themselves, and the proceeds are placed to the credit of the band.\n\nWe may add that during the period of military control in Canada (1763 to 1841), the Indians were treated more or less as independent sovereigns. However, the attitude of Canada was influenced to a marked degree by defeats on the one hand, to win the support of the Indians as friends of the Crown, and on the other, through fears of Indian attacks on his frontier settlements.\n\nThe following period, (1841-1867) is marked by a gradual change from a policy which was dictated by consideration of fear and defense, to one which directed efforts to educate, civilize and christianize the Indian. The British North America Act transferred the authority of the Indian Affairs Federal Government to the provinces. It was easy; in 1868 a Dominion Act which consolidated previous acts and summed up the best features of Indian legislation was passed by the federal government. There was no education and development of the former policy, elastic enough to accommodate the problems of the various Indian groups in the country.\n\nThe \"closed reserve\" policy has been enforced since the days of the Proclamation of 1763; the maintenance of the reserve intact has been, indeed, the basic principle of the Indian administration, and of incalculable benefit to the Indians.\n\nCatholic Welfare Associations\n\nAmong recent organisations for Indian welfare our readers are familiar with the Catholic Indian Institute of B.C., which is under the direction of Chief Bishop and other leading Indians who carry out social work on their home reserves.\n\nThe work of this Institute is distinctly that of a Catholic Social Action organisation, taking part in all the activities of human life. It is religious, intellectual, educational, charitable, economic and social, seeking to work towards the spread of religious influences in the home and community. In existence for four years, the Catholic Institute of B.C. has undertaken the training of the Indians for each mission, thereby laying a solid foundation for moral and spiritual welfare as well as for thorough social development according to the spirit of the Church.\n\nA much older and time-proven organisation, essentially a religiously religious in its purpose for the training of lay leaders among the Indians, is the parishes of St. Joseph's and St. Mary's, instituted for the Sioux in the Dakotas and Montana, over 40 years ago, by the late Apostle of the Sioux, Bishop Henry. Upon the Bishop's advice, Father Jerome Hunt, O.S.B., founded those Societies at St. Michael Mission, North Dakota, in 1886. At first under the direction of the priests, and later on their own account, the groups studied and discussed the truths of the Catholic religion and their application to practical life. They hold every Sunday afternoon, interspersed with hymns and prayers.\n\nThese Societies met with extraordinary success on the Sioux reservations, and the Indians responded to them in a way which would have been impossible for the missionaries to do alone. The Societies hold local congresses every two years, each time at a different mission, and general congresses, which delegates come from the various States.\n\nThe first congress was held at Standing Rock Reservation, N.D., in 1891, and several congresses have been held every year ever since.\n\nIt has been the privilege of your editor to witness, as guest missionary, several of these Congresses in the Dakotas and in Montana. Preparation for a congress and its management is the responsibility of the Local Committees. Committees are formed, delegates are elected from various missions and collections are made for their expenses.\n\nThe object of the congress is to bring together a large bower is erected for the meeting near the mission chapel. The sessions are conducted by the Indians; a different chairman is chosen for each session and the discussions are conducted with gravity and strict adherence to the rules.\n\nThe speakers, men and women, deliver addresses generally on some religious topic, such as the Christian Family. The meetings and religious services at which missionaries preach in the native tongue, last three days.\n\nAt the close of the congress a community banquet is served, in which all have contributed. Communion closes with a solemn procession, the men and women in full regalia, carrying their banners, sashes and other insignia according to their rank and office.\n\nThe absence of amusements of any kind, the strict order and discipline observed during the congress, the zeal shown by the leaders in seeking out the laikends, and the promptness to receive the Sacraments, are very striking indeed. At the close of the congress, the Indians return home with new ideals, and the subjects discussed at the attention of the congress will be discussed in the Sunday meetings again and again.\n\nThe foundation of an Indian Welfare Association with a religious as well as a social program of action has been laid down in the Oblate Missions of the Saskatchewan Province, and will include North Western Ontario and Saskatchewan. It is hoped that it will meet with the full cooperation of the eight thousand Catholic Indians in this mission territory, and that it will foster to a high degree the social, economic and cultural progress of the Indians.\n\nG. L.\n\nSANDY BAY\n\n(Concluded from Page 1)\n\nThe other departments in the school are on the east end of the building. St. Joseph's Church is on the north, P.Q., who are very devoted to the church. The kitchen, infirmary, sewing room and bakery are under the care, and they make the meals and do the work-keeping. Many beautiful pieces of fan- tasy work of woven material were shown to me.\n\nThe lay staff comprises Eddie Leduc, principal; E. Leduc, athletic coach; E. Leducotte and N. Trudeau, farm and dairy instructors; and M. Dufault, night-watchman.\n\nVisiting the four classrooms, with their desks and chairs, struck me by the neatness with which everything is arranged. The school curriculum is the same that at its provincial schools, save teaching in English.\n\nThe infirmary is well stocked with medicine, and it has two medical wards for the patients. The pupils enjoy weekly educational as well as recreational shows.\n\nHaving completed the visit of the buildings I went into the main buildings: the modern dairy stable; the chicken-coop, where 3,700 eggs are gathered monthly; the workshop, well equipped with tools for the training of the senior boys.\n\nThen I went to meet the Field-nurse, Miss Marie Cartier, R.N., who cooperates with Mr. Raymond Marie, also a R.N., in the health care of the school pupils and of the Indians. Since last year, the mortality rate has been greatly reduced at Sandy Bay, and the health of the Indians improved.\n\nMy last call was made at the mailing-post of Nap. Roy, near the school. The Marius Post-Office is located at this post. Mr. Marius is very co-operative with the school staff, and his services are appreciated by all.\n\nThe accompanying pictures, on pages 2 and 8, will tell a better story than I can explain by words. I am glad to state that what struck me most in my visit was that perfect cooperation between the Oblate Fathers and the Indian Affairs Branch, as well as between the Indian Affairs Service division and the Department of National Health, can be worked for the greater advantage of the Indian population, not only here at Sandy Bay, but in scores of other educational centres for the Indians across Canada.\n\nS. S.\nThe story is now: Daniel Little (Hanpa), grandson of the Sun-Dreamed, brought up in a Government Indian school, returns to Wood Mountain quite bewildered by his experiences. His grand-father wants him to marry the Doc-Maiden's daughter, a woman and end of a white man. At the death of his grandfather Daniel showed his true feelings by killing the white man who had tried to kill his horse, with his friend, Toto, and went to Poplar, Montana, to seek his fortune.\n\nDaniel and Toto work at the Ramsay ranch for a few days. Daniel is paid $2,000 by the owner, Mr. Ramsay, but he is not satisfied. Meanwhile he inherits $2,000 from his grandfather; and he decides to return to Wood Mountain and seek his fortune. He goes there in order to set himself up on a small farm, before going back to Poplar, Montana.\n\nAs the two friends arrive home, Pauline is heartbroken. Upon his arrival at Wood Mountain a casual remark causes Daniel to realize that Pauline is engaged to another man, Doc-Maiden, whom he has blindly ignored until now.\n\nThe annual Rodeo at Wood Mountain is an event which attracts visitors from distant points in South Dakota and Montana. The early frosts have been received, and the spirit of the old West is being awakened after a few days of rain. A huge tent is pitched in the valley of the Wood Mountain, where visitors are housed by tents; dining rooms are erected; and a vast dancing platform is set up under the stars. Visitors wander about, enjoying the rodeo-grounds, swings, show-tents, and amusement stands.\n\nRodeo and dude riders and cowgirls circulate in their gaudy apparel; old Indians in full regalia, engaged in watching a rodeo or eating a parade meal; morning and afternoon races of ponies, riders undismounted, bucking wagons, bull-riding, drag races, and a huge crowd. But the largest event which gains attention each year is the bronc-busting event, one of the most essential features of the rodeo.\n\nFrom the top of the surrounding hills, the view of the large encampment is thrilling indeed. In the valley, surrounded by populous hills, the sun's rays weave its way through the trees. The prairie presents the peculiar beauty of the valley like sentinels, adding their perennial beauty to the scene.\n\nThe Indian camp was set up on a little elevation to the west of the arena. There Dan and Toto had set their canvas tents, low and squatting among the towering trees. The Indians, ponies, hobbled, grazed close by. As the sun rose upon the opening of the rodeo, preparations were made at the arena, and by early afternoon, a huge crowd gathered to witness the opening of the rodeo.\n\nDaniel and Toto mounted their ponies, and took part in the colorful parade along the rodeo track, which marked the opening of the rodeo, while a Montana High School Band played martial tunes. As the riders were recognized by their friends, much hand-shaking and cheering was made as the riders waved their sombreros.\n\nDaniel was keeping his eyes eagerly on the solid row of cars which surrounded the race-track, when near the finish chute, he greeted loudly by the high-pitched voice of LeBeque. Daniel looked up, smiling, and shouted: \"Hi, partner, in beckoning! LeBeque was alone.\n\nThe parade over, Daniel, booked to ride in the very first race, proceeded to the corral chutes. The events succeeded one another in rapid succession: the slow riding, calf-roping, bronco-busting, wild-cow milking; by mid-afternoon a race was being scheduled for Daniel, when LeBeque rushed to the chute.\n\n\"Kola,\" answered Daniel, \"I have reasons of my own. I am seeking some one, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Say, partner,\" retorted Toto, \"I'm fed up with this business. You're No-Man's Horse. Come and see your friend LeBeque. He has invited me to come and see him\".\n\n\"A good idea,\" said Toto, \"and man, happen to find an occasion to meet the Doc-Maiden, without having to go out of your way yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied Marianne, quivering. Toto cast a questioning glance toward Daniel, who asked:\n\n\"Do you wish that I stay out of this?\" \u2014 \"No, if you promise to keep away about it, I do not mind.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Toto, refreshing himself once more from his flask, \"my name is Toto, and I am man now, I am pleased you call me your uncle. I will tell you something which will make you teach you a great lesson. When I was eighteen I went to Haskell Institute, and I came back there with honors. I went to work as a hog-keeper in a ranch, and I did well. I became engaged to a white woman, Dallas, whom I trusted completely. We bought a house and a car. We trusted another, had few friends, and our two children together were like heaven. We had a child, but we lost her after she was born. She was secluded, and I believed we could have lived on like that. One day, late, however, we had gone to a dance. Dallas was a perfect dancer\u2014when I noticed her, I thought I would seek her. A friend of mine told me she had gone out. I followed her, and I saw her in the shadows below the balcony, with my wife in the arms of a strange man. When I saw and knew, I rushed to my car and fled to Minnesota. There I cashed in my chances for half a dollar, turned over the balance and the deed on the house to Dallas, and left her. Dallas married and divorced a divorcee from Dallas, and left the world I had lived in, and which had destroyed my happiness. Now I have found peace and contentment, as a wanderer among the white people, here in Wood Mountain.\n\nMarianne was wiping her eyes. Toto continued: \"And this is, Marianne, what I want you to happen for me. It is really up to you now. Hanpa's trail is open to you. You must be there waiting for him\".\n\n\"They what about the white woman Dallas? Is it true, sobbed Marianne? \"She ran away from me last month?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Toto, \"but I can say new is that my kola is at the crossroads\". (To be continued)\n\nFORT PECK INDIAN CONGRESS\n\nPOPLAR, Montana\u2014The annual Council Congress for the Sioux and other tribes of Indians held under the sponsorship of St. Joseph's and St. Mary's Societies, near Poplar, Mont., June 22-25. Father G. Lavoiette, O.M.I., who lives at Fort Kip, near Poplar at Riverside and at Fort-Kip Congregates, will preach in Dakota at the annual meeting of the Poor of Poplar, Rev. Fr. J. M. Goff.\n\nOfficers of the 8th Annual Congress of Montana and North Dakota are: Honorable John, Chairman; James Red Fox, President; Mrs. Evelyn Red Thunder, Secretary; Mrs. Evelyn Red Thunder, Treasurer; John Leonard of Wood Mountain, one of the guest speakers at the Congress.\n\nDAKOTAS IN SPORTSMEN SHOW\n\nOne of the more entertaining features of this year's Manitoba Sportsmen's Show is the Canoe-Tilting Contest, featuring a pair of full-blooded Dakota Indians opposing a French-Canadian timberrman from the woods of Northern Ontario. This contest is even a more popular feature at some of the leading shows. It offers a spectacular display with thrills, spills and a goodly amount of humor.\n\nThe Dakota Indian pair, further featured in the program, demonstrated their repertoire of bird and wild animal calls.\n\nDakota Indians Ed Muckle and Tom Sanderson give a ducking to Ernie Simpson and Joe Perron, Northern Ontario guides, in the contest held at the Winnipeg Sportsmen Show, proving the redmen are still masters of the canoe. The contest was held May 11.\nA Visit To Sandy Bay\n\nTop left\u2014Brother Bruyere with a group of small boys: Raymond Martin, Bill Paul, Stanley McKay, John Paul, Leo Paul, Jos. McKay, Geo.

Both of these cold storage doors come complete with frames and cold storage door hardware.\n\nCOOLING UNITS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURE ROOM:\n\nWe will supply and install 12 only 7\" Frigidaire Eutectic Plates with minus 6\u00b0 Eutectic Solution. The Eutectic Solution fills completely the plates and has holdover capacity to enable equipment to operate and provide proper temperatures with a running time depending upon the outside weather conditions, varying from three to five hours each morning and from three to five hours each evening. In other words, the installation of this equipment is designed in such a fashion that the 110 Volt D.C. Current supply need not necessarily operate 24 hours per day.\n\nCOOLING UNITS FOR THE 36\u00b0 COOLER ROOM:\n\nWe will supply and install 7 only 9\" Frigidaire Eutectic Plates with plus 18\u00b0 Eutectic Solution. These plates are figured with the correct solution to balance out so that the running time of the refrigerating machinery will provide proper temperatures in the cooler room when the refrigeration compressor is operated the same length of time concurrently with the time it will require to be operated to cool down the low temperature room.\nCONDENSING UNITS:\n\nWe will supply and install one Model AF-6200 Frigidaire Freon Air Cooled Condensing Unit, equipped with 110 Volt D.C. Motor, 2 H.P.\n\nThis condensing unit has ample capacity to provide proper conditions of temperature even in the hottest weather.

An automatic control will be provided and included in the installation which will automatically shut off the 110 Volt D.C. Electric Motor when the temperature in each of the two rooms reaches the desired point. It will be necessary for those persons operating the equipment to start the condensing unit each morning and then again each evening. Experience after using the equipment, will indicate to the persons operating the equipment just at which time the condensing unit should be started.\n\nThis equipment will include in the installation a Frigidaire Accumulator Interchanger which will increase the efficiency of the total installation by approximately 5%.\n\nGUARANTEE:\n\nFrigidaire equipment carries with it a complete guarantee against defective parts and improper workmanship for a period of one year from the date the equipment is placed in operation. More important to you, however, as a user is the fact that genuine Frigidaire equipment continues to deliver satisfactory service year in and year out for many years after any guarantee has expired.\n\nPRICE:\n\nCost of the above complete installation, including all necessary insulating material, cold storage doors, and refrigeration equipment installed complete with all necessary installation labor, parts, Freon refrigerant, Frigidaire oil, and in fact everything necessary to make this a completely operating job, with the exception of the lumber and labor necessary to build the two coolers and install the insulating material, etc., is $2,620.00. This price would be subject to your discount of 10%.\n\nNot included in this price is the cost of electric wiring necessary to connect the electric motor, switches, etc. to the electrical services in the building.\nWe sincerely trust that the above will be of interest to you and that we may be favored with your valued order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J.

A lot of money has been spent on the school - I believe more at this school than in most cases - nothing has been done to provide cupboard space for the children's clothes. This makes it very inconvenient for the Sisters, and if possible, I would recommend that an amount of about two or three hundred dollars be allowed to have some cupboards built. These Sisters work very hard and are doing good work. I am quite certain these cupboards would be appreciated by them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

All water for the Residential School is hauled by truck from the lake 2\u00bd miles away, and as there is no plow of any kind at that point, considerable trouble and time lost takes place after every storm.\n\nThe road from the Residential School to highway #5 is six miles in length; this also fills up, and as this road is used by the school, and the reserve, also our Farm Instructor, days are lost until this road is opened up again by the Principal of the above school.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend this request for the above mentioned snow plow.\n\nAttached please find letter supplied by the Father Principal, of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for your consideration.\n\nW. Gowans.\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopy for:\nR.S. Davis, Esq.\nRegional Supervisor, Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nMr. W. Gowans,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGanphin, Manitoba.\n\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nReference your 149-5-276 of December 10 -\n\nWe have already over-expanded the amount included in our Estimates for equipment required at the above Residential School. I regret that there are not additional funds available and consequently we are unable to give favourable consideration to the Principal's request.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to R. S. DAVIS, Regional Supervisor\nDecember 30, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCOL. H. F. NEARY.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter dated the 17th instant, addressed to the Purchasing Agent of this Department, regarding certain accounts which are outstanding with the Winnipeg office of Crane Limited.\n\nI am writing the Winnipeg office of Crane Limited in connection with all of the accounts which were forwarded here, with the exception of two. The papers regarding these are attached hereto. You will see that I have noted in pencil that one of the accounts refers to the Fort Alexander School and the other to the Sandy Bay School. I have gone over your files regarding these two schools and have turned down some papers which have reference to the items mentioned. I have also been in touch with the office of the Purchasing Agent. He informs me that Purchase Order No. 19377 was issued on May 16th, 1947, in favour of Crane Limited. It referred to certain pipe, elbows, etc., required by the Sandy Bay School. He also informs me that this order was given to the Company F.O.B. Amaranth. The second Purchase Order No. 20930, or No. 30930, was issued on the 25th of June, 1948, for the Fort Alexander School. The order was F.O.B. Pine Falls.\n\nAlthough I have not been able to get full information, my opinion is that these orders were issued in favour of the Company and that part of the orders was sent almost immediately and, in accordance with the tender, the freight was paid by the Company. Later on they completed the order, but, in both cases, it was overlooked that the material was to go F.O.B. the nearest town in each case. I presume this is the reason why they are now making claim for freight on these two shipments.\n\nI am replying to the letter received, and informing the Company that they will hear further from you regarding the two accounts dealt with in this memorandum.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosures.\n| QUANTITY SHIPPED | PREVIOUS NO. | SHORTAGE NO. | LIST | GROSS | DISCOUNT | TOTAL |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| 52              |              |              | .72  | 37.44 | -61%     | 14.60 |\n\n**NO CLAIMS FOR SHORTAGE ALLOWED UNLESS MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF GOODS.**\n\n**NO CLAIMS WILL BE ALLOWED FOR LABOR OR DAMAGES.

Falconer\n\nRe: Typhoid Fever - Sandy Bay Reserve\n\nOn March 5th two children from this reserve were admitted to Portage Hospital with typhoid fever. One (Glen Flatfoot, age 8) was from the residential school and one (Frank Flatfoot, age 11) from his home. On March 12th two other boys from the school were also admitted to hospital but so far reports from the laboratory are negative.\n\nMiss MacCarthy, R.N., was brought down from Morway House Hospital and on March 16th started immunization of all on the reserve and at school. No new cases have developed.\n\nThis reserve has had nineteen cases of typhoid since 1937 as follows:\n\n| Year | Cases |\n|------|-------|\n| 1937 | 3     |\n| 1939 | 2     |\n| 1942 | 2     |\n| 1945 | 2     |\n| 1944 | 1     |\n| 1945 | 7     |\n| 1948 | 1     |\n\nAt least three of the above were at school on the reserve when they took sick. Most of the children at school go home at week-ends.\n\nInoculation with typhoid vaccine has been done at intervals in the past and may have prevented more widespread infection.\n\nIt is essential that pure water be provided. This is difficult .......\ndifficult in the Indians' homes but can be done at once in the school. I consider it absolutely essential that an automatic chlorinator be purchased and installed at the school at once. At present they were instructed to chlorinate by addition of chloride of lime to the tanks. During the winter this was not done.\n\nWallace and Tierman have a small automatic chlorinator of the type marked on the attached pamphlet. The cost is as follows:\n\n- Chlorinator - $375.00\n- 15 gal. crock - $12.00\n- 100 lbs. HTH - $1.00\n- Testing outfit - $22.00\n\nTotal - $440.00\n\nThe water for the Residential School is hauled by tank from the lake and dumped in tanks at the school.\n\nIndians at home use either snow or haul water from the lake. They have been instructed to boil water.\n\nWould you please consider this urgent.\n\nW. J. Wood, M.D.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. B.F.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWe beg to submit the attached letter as received from Father J. Lambert, Principal Indian Residential School, Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, Man, for your consideration.\n\nOn my last visit to that reserve these requests were gone into with the Principal, and I feel that the items required for the kitchen should have consideration.\n\nWe would appreciate the Department advising us what steps will be taken if any in granting these requests.\n\nCopy for,\nR.S. Davis, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor, Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWm. Gowans.\nSuperintendent.\nSandy Bay Indian School,\nMarius P.O., Man.\nApril 9, 1949\n\nMr. Wm Gowans, Superintendent,\nDauphin,\nMan.\n\nDear Mr. Gowans,\n\nWe wish to bring to the attention of the Department once again the different problems which still remain after several years. May we ask your cooperation in presenting them again to the Department for the new fiscal year.\n\nOur main problems are water, electric power and roads. Hauling water from the lake by truck and tank presents a major problem in winter when blizzards and snow block the road. To remedy this situation we suggest building the present road higher and request the necessary machinery to maintain it. As you probably know, the railroad has favored us with a siding directly west of the\nschool. A good road to this point and the main highway, for the use of the school, nurse station, and reserve, is requested.\n\nOur electric power needs are constantly increasing and the present overloaded old Diesel plant can not supply all the needed power.\n\nThis last winter we were very unfortunate in having to dispose of practically all our herd of cattle, because of Bang's disease. We ask for a special grant to help in securing another milk herd sufficient for the school needs.\n\nA new shop is needed for the vocational training of the pupils. The present shop is not fit for use nor remodelling.\n\nA special fence around the dug-out reservoir, a fence in front of school, eaves troughs for the school, fire escapes, water softener for the laundry, a new bake oven for the bakery, all items which are still to be furnished.\n\nA walk-in refrigerator is an essential necessity for an institution as the school.\n\nMiss McCready asked that the school kitchen and dining hall be modernised. A potato peeler, a food mixer and food chopper are items needed in the kitchen. An adding machine for the principal's office is also needed.\n\nWe also request a special grant for a hall for the social activities of the reserve as a whole and a follow-up\nprogram to continue and bring into adult life the formation and instruction received in school.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to secure the favourable consideration of the department for these problems and needed items.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Lambert, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nMay 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. Wm. Gowans,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant attaching a letter which you have received from the Reverend Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have noted the contents of Father Lambert's letter, and as you will realize, to meet all his requests would involve a very large sum of money. Funds are not available for a new water system or the road which he requests. It is not our general practice to purchase cattle for a residential school.\n\nWhile we had hoped to provide a manual training building at several residential schools, it is found impossible to secure funds for that particular purpose in the current year's appropriation.\n\nRegional Supervisor Davis advised us that he is arranging transfer of the pump, air compressor, storage tanks and gasoline engine which are surplus to requirements at the Fort Frances Residential School.\n\nIf you consider that the present diesel plant should be replaced, you may forward a requisition giving complete particulars and the catalogue number of the type of machine that you consider is needed.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 13)\nWe are also prepared to consider a requisition for a potato peeler and a food chopper. With regard to these items, the requisition should give the catalogue number of the type of machine that is necessary.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard E.

Lockwood, Muncey, Ont., that when the Mount Elgin Institute was torn down she saw our 90\" loom (worth about $125.00), which was stored in the Institute, thrown out on a pile of discarded lumber to be burned. She informed the man who had purchased the building that the loom belonged to the Handicraft Section, and was told to \"take it away if it was to be saved\". Mrs. Lockwood was good enough to have the loom brought to her home, which has now been purchased by the Department of Health and Welfare. As the Lockwoods expect to move within the next week or ten days, may I suggest that the Superintendent of Training should be requested to instruct the Indian Superintendent to have the loom crated and shipped to some school where a weaving project has been organised by Mr. Doucet. The Education Division has already taken over two smaller looms formerly used at the Mount Elgin Institute for the new school at Caughnawaga, where, prior to the fire, a 90\" loom was also used.\n\nKathleen Brodie\n\nIn Charge,\nHandicraft Section\nExtract from letter received from Regional Supervisor Davis dated December 14th, 1948 -\n\n\"I would further advise that construction will be started under the 1949 Programme on a line to Amaranth, to which our residential school and farm buildings on the Sandy Bay Reserve could be connected.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThe Indian Residential School of Sandy Bay is still hauling water by truck a distance of three miles to supply the school for all purposes except that of watering the cattle. For this service, you have supplied a truck and have contributed $100.00 towards the running expenses and the payment of wages to the driver.\n\nWinter conditions in Manitoba when at times the temperature goes down to 40, make the hauling of water for this school a difficult problem. Now that conditions are somewhat normal, we believe that money should be voted in the next estimates for installing a regular water system for this school, which will give a more abundant and sure supply of water.\n\nYour engineer some ten years ago made a survey of this water project which might be used now for the purpose of securing prices from interested contractors. You know that a considerable amount of money was spent on that school some ten years ago and that it is now one of your best institutions. With a proper and regular water supply the School would be completely equipped.\n\nHoping that you will look into this matter as soon as possible, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug 24 | To Boiler Inspection Sandy Bay Residential School as per attached. | $3.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nIn response to the request of the Department of Indian Affairs as contained in your letter of August 16th, Mr. J. T. Rose of this office and the writer visited Sandy Bay Indian School, spending August 23, 24 and 25th in making studies on the ground. A survey was made of what was considered the most practical route for a pipe line from Lake Manitoba to the school. This survey consisted of running a chained traverse by transit, running of precise levels to procure a ground profile, the taking of soundings off shore to ascertain intake conditions, the securing of borings along the traverse line, the location of buildings and the securing of elevations in the vicinity of the school buildings. An examination was made of the water supply that in addition to the installation of the school and data were collected relative to the water requirements of the Institution. A sample of water was taken from Lake Manitoba for analysis.\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM:\n\nThe existing water supply at the Institution is briefly as follows: The school building is approximately 100' x 40' and rainfall upon the roof is collected into an underground cistern 12 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep, with a capacity of about 7,000 gallons. This cistern is in close proximity to the kitchen and the water is delivered to the kitchen by means of a hand pump located in the kitchen. This water is used for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes. For sanitary purposes three tanks with a combined capacity of 2,200 gallons are located in the attic of the building and a gravity water furnished the school. The water supply to these tanks comes from two sources, but the quality of the water is much the same. A comparatively deep well, approximately 250 feet from the school, is operated by a wind mill and a feed pipe leads...\nto the water tanks, the energy necessary also being supplied by the windmill. A comparatively shallow well is located quite close to the workshop of the school and is connected to an underground cistern nearby; the dimensions of this cistern being about four feet square and sixteen feet deep. A pump driven by a small gasoline engine located in the workshop connects with this cistern and also to the storage tank in the attic and is operated during such periods as continued lack of sufficient wind to operate the windmill results in failure of water supply from the deeper well.\n\nThe Principal of the School stated that this shallow well appeared to be going dry. The water from both these wells is very hard and distinctly salty. It is unfit for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes in the school, but I understand that in addition to sanitary purposes it is also used in the steam heating system, high pressure boiler and domestic water heater.\n\nThe amount of water that can be collected into the soft water cistern from the roof, even in a year of average precipitation, is far from sufficient to meet the requirements of the very limited use to which this supply is put and consequently water has to be hauled from Lake Manitoba - two and one-third miles distant. The hauling is done by team and a 400-gallon metal tank mounted on a wagon is used. It appears that only an average of one tank per week is hauled from the lake.\n\nThe main school building is the only building equipped with a water supply system. Piping for both cold and hot water is installed and fire hose is in place on each floor. The hot water supply consists of a 300-gallon tank connected to the heating system boiler only, with the result that there is no hot water supply when the heating system is not in operation. There is no hot water supply boiler.\ninstalled and also no high pressure steam boiler, and this latter unit is rather essential in an Indian School. Piping in the school is in poor condition.\n\nWATER SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS:\n\nWe have been asked to report on the complete installation of an adequate water supply system for this school. Accordingly, for the purposes of this report we consider an adequate water supply system should include the following:\n\n(1) A dependable source of water supply.\n(2) A water supply safe for drinking, palatable, and not unreasonably hard.\n(3) Continuous hot and cold water in the main school building, necessitating the installation of a new hot water supply boiler.\n(4) A high pressure steam supply, necessitating the installation of a high pressure steam boiler.\n(5) A water supply for stock, necessitating pipe connection to barn and installation of water supply for cattle and horses, also a separate pipe connection to hog pen to provide water supply during non-freezing period of year.\n(6) A reasonable measure of fire protection.\n\nSOURCE OF WATER SUPPLY:\n\nTo fulfill requirements (1) and (2) above, it is considered necessary to use Lake Manitoba as the source of water supply. Wells in the district around Sandy Bay School produce a salty water if driven to depth and shallow wells are not at all dependable.\n\nA copy of the analysis of Lake Manitoba water accompanies this report. It shows the water to be hard and to contain a high amount of sodium chloride. However, it is considered that this water can be utilized without the use of filter, softener or chlorinator systems, even were it possible to install such systems. I would like to point out that this\nanalysis shows that trouble from incrusting solids must be anticipated in connection with the operation of the heating system, hot water supply boiler and high pressure steam boiler. Lack of water pressure at the school prevents the installation of a water softener.\n\nPROPOSED WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM:\n\nThe proposed water supply system can roughly be divided into the following main divisions: (1) Intake, (2) Main Pipe Line, (3) Pumping Plant, (4) Water Distribution System.\n\nPlate No. I accompanying this report, is a Plan and Profile of the survey line between the proposed location of the water supply intake and the school. This survey line does not follow the shortest distance between the proposed intake location and the school, it being necessary to diverge slightly to facilitate the running of the survey by avoiding heavy cutting through brush. Accordingly, borings shown on the profile are not all strictly on the proposed pipe line, but are sufficiently close to fairly accurately show the nature of soil to be excavated.\n\nPlate No. II is a Plan and Profile of the proposed location of the Pipe Line between the Proposed Intake and the school. The total length of line is slightly less than the survey line. It also shows a profile of the proposed pipe line.\n\nFor the purposes of the survey the elevation of Lake Manitoba was taken as 810.0 and it will be noted that there is a rise of fifteen feet between lake level and the ground level at the school, of which eight feet occurs in the last 1500 feet adjoining the school. The distance from the outer limit of the intake to the school is 9,970 feet, of which approximately 3,000 feet between chainage 49+00 and 79+00 traverse an area covered with poplar bush. Several of\nthe Indians have dwellings located in this wooded area.\n\n(1) Intake:\n\nThe governing features in connection with the intake are (a) Minimum lake elevation and (b) necessity for extension into reasonably clear water. The minimum elevation of Lake Manitoba over the past forty year period is approximately 809 as referred to our datum and the maximum slightly above 813.0. Soundings revealed that at a distance of 690 feet from waters edge, a depth of eight feet of water was obtainable. No equipment was available for us to determine the nature of whatever underlay the water and accordingly some uncertainty exists as to what difficulties will be encountered in underwater excavation. However, a boring taken some 320 feet back from the waters edge and down to elevation 805.2 showed sand and sandy loam.\n\nIt is proposed that the intake shall consist of a 4\" pipe line extending from a point 690 feet beyond waters edge to a concrete lined well located at chainage 27+50. Plate No. II shows the profile of this proposed intake. It is estimated that this 4\" intake line will carry by gravity a sufficient volume of water to the concrete well to enable 30 gallons of water per minute to be pumped from the well to the school. To ensure this flow it will be necessary to lay the intake pipe line at elevation 805.5 to the point where it joins waters edge. Outward from waters edge at elevation 805 the pipe line is to be supported on sunken rock filled cribbing with outer limit at approximate elevation of 804.0. Total length of 4\" intake line is approximately 3,550 feet. The concrete well at Station 27+50 will be sunk to elevation 805.0 and is to be 6' 0\" square. Over the well is to be built the pump house.\n(2) Main Pipe Line:\n\nThe main pipe line will consist of a 3\" pipe line leading from the above mentioned pump house to an underground reservoir in the immediate vicinity of the school. Plate No. II shows the profile of this proposed pipe line. To ensure protection from freezing it is considered necessary that this pipe line shall be eight feet underground between Station 27450 to 49400, 7 feet underground from Station 49400 to 79400 and 8 feet underground from 79400 to the underground reservoir. The total length of 3\" pipe line will be 6,450 feet, laid in the attic of the school building.\n\nThis pipe line will discharge into an underground reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 gallons which is the estimated water requirements of the Institution for three days.\n\n(3) Pumping System:\n\nThe most convenient layout would have the pump house at the school, the whole pipe line from school to lake being a suction line. However, it is considered that too much risk is involved with such a long suction line. The shore line of the lake affords a poor location for a pumping plant and during high water stages extensive flooding occurs to the rear of the shore line as can be noted from the profile on Plate No. I. It is proposed, therefore, to locate the pump house at Station 27450. The pump house would be built directly over the concrete well and it is hoped that a layout can be arranged so as to prevent formation of ice in the well, even though the pump house be used only every third day in winter. The location is very much exposed and it may prove difficult to protect the well from freezing, but it is considered that the difficulties can be overcome and heating be required only on\nIt is proposed to install one 2 H.P. engine driven Typhoon Pump to deliver thirty U.S. gallons per minute to the reservoir at the school. Pump and engine is to be mounted on the same frame.\n\nThe underground reservoir with capacity of 10,000 gallons will be located in close proximity to the extension of the present school building used as a workshop. It is proposed to utilize the 3 H.P. engine driven pump now set up in the workshop and used to pump water to the three storage tanks located in the attic of the school building. This pump will be connected to the proposed underground reservoir and the discharge line to the tanks in the attic will also be utilized as at present.\n\n(4) Water Distribution System:\n\nThe existing distribution system consists of the three storage tanks in the attic supplying by gravity, water for general purposes throughout the school. It is proposed to utilize the same principle, replacing such piping as is necessary and adding whatever piping is required for the additional services it is proposed to install. The vertical 2\" piping in the school is said to be in fair condition but horizontal lines are more or less eroded.\n\nIt is recommended that a hot water supply boiler and a high pressure steam boiler be installed. The hot water supply boiler would ensure a hot water supply during the period the heating system is not utilized and the steam boiler is rather a necessity in Indian Schools. These will involve additional connections to the water supply system.\n\nIt is also recommended a pipe connection be made from the cold water distribution line in the school building to the barn to provide a continuous water supply for stock throughout the entire year. The hog pen would be connected...\nby surface piping with the feed line within the barn in order to provide a water supply at the hog pen during the non-freezing period.\n\nESTIMATES OF COSTS:\n\nTime has not been taken to determine quantities of pipe connections, valves, fittings, etc., and necessarily some uncertainty must exist as to difficulties that might be encountered with excavation, particularly with underwater excavation. Underwater excavation for the intake would probably be simplified by the use of a dredge, but there is no dredge on Lake Manitoba and probably not even a scow suitable for supporting excavating machinery. A trenching machine could also be used to advantage in excavating for the pipe line, but transporting such machinery to and from the project might possibly offset the advantage over ordinary labor.\n\nEstimates are based upon the use of cast iron pipe with flexible joints for the intake and main water line. Such pipe is made in Winnipeg, is more serviceable and less costly than either black or galvanized pipe. It also is less costly to lay.\n\nParticulars as to the nature of excavation likely to be encountered and as determined from borings are briefly as follows:\n\nStation 0+00 to Station 27+50 - Light sandy loam and light damp clay. This whole distance is to be excavated to a depth 4.5 feet below lake level. Borings did not reveal that difficulty would be encountered because of this fact, but some uncertainty exists, especially if excavated by hand labor.\n\nStation 27+50 to Station 45+00 - Fairly hard clay containing some small stones.\nStation 45+00 to Station 73+00 - Light sandy loam overlaying damp light sand.\n\nStation 73+00 to Station 88+00 - Hard clay with small stones.\n\nStation 88+00 to Water Reservoir and in vicinity of school excavation is mostly through hard clay, almost in the nature of hardpan below the 3' level.\n\nEstimates of costs covering replacement of worn out piping in the school and the installation of additional piping are necessarily tentative.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT BOILER FEED WATERS.\n\nThe analysis upon the reverse side of this blank is given in grains per imperial gallon of 2774 (approximately) cubic inches. An imperial gallon contains 70,000 grains.\n\nTo convert the figures of an analysis given in parts per 1,000,000 to grains per imperial gallon, multiply by 0.07.\n\nTo change the figures of an analysis given in grains per imperial gallon to parts per 1,000,000, divide by 0.07.\n\nTo convert grains per 1/2 S. or wine gallon to grains per imperial gallon, add one-fifth.\n\nTo convert grains per imperial gallon to grains per U.S. or wine gallon, deduct one-sixth.\n\nTo determine pounds of scale forming or incrusting solids per 1,000 gallons of water, divide grains per gallon by 7.\n\nThe incrusting solids form boiler scale.\n\nA water containing more than 10 grains of incrusting solids is classed as a hard water.\n\nA water containing more than 35 grains of non-incrusting solids will give trouble with foaming or priming in a locomotive boiler; although these solids may reach as high as 45 or even 60 grains per imperial gallon without causing trouble in a stationary boiler.\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT CONSTITUENTS OF BOILER FEED WATERS.\n\nCalcium Carbonate\n\n(Commodity called Carbonate of Lime, Chalk or Marle. CaCO\u2083)\n\nCarbonate of lime is the commonest form in which lime occurs in water. It is present in chemically pure water, but when carbonic acid is present it is found in the form of bicarbonate of lime, which is quite soluble. Bicarbonate of lime when carried into the boiler is converted into carbonate of lime when carbonic acid is driven off with the steam and normal carbonate of lime is formed. This is the form in which lime is found when the temperature reaches 90 degrees F. Carbonate of lime also does not form boiler scale, but it is responsible for a good deal of the rust which is found in the boiler. Scale formed of lime may form part of a very hard scale, when other materials are present which cement all the parts of the boiler.\n\nCalcium Sulphate\n\n(Commodity called sulphate of Lime, Gypsum or Plaster Paris. CaSO\u2084)\n\nSulphate of lime is present in all conditions of natural water and is responsible for the hardest kind of boiler scale. Scale formed from sulphate of lime sometimes being as hard as porcelain. If lime is present in water in sufficient quantity there is fifty pounds precipitation being in the form of heavy crystals which settle down and adhere to the sides of the boiler, forming a scale of great hardness. Scale formed of calcium sulphate sticks to the sides of a boiler much more firmly than carbonate of lime.\n\nCalcium Chloride\n\nChloride of calcium is sometimes found in natural water, in which it is very soluble. It is cleaned among the corrosive minerals found in water. It does not of itself form scale, but when other sulphates are present they combine with it and precipitation sulphate is formed, which acts as described under that head.\n\nCalcium Nitrate\n\nCa(NO\u2083)\u2082\n\nCalcium nitrate rarely occurs in water, even though it be little in evidence, as the quantity is usually very small. If small does not form scale, but in the presence of sulphate of soda an exchange of acids takes place in the boiler and calcium nitrate is converted into sulphate of lime. Its action is corrosive.\n\nMagnesium Carbonate\n\n(sometimes called Magnesia. MgCO\u2083)\n\nMagnesium carbonate is found in water for the same reasons as calcium preparation. It is then known as magnesia. It behaves in exactly the same manner as carbonate of lime. Its bi-carbonate being soluble and its tri-carbonate being practically insoluble. The remarks above, pertaining to carbonate of lime, apply here. Magnesium carbonate is used for tagging for boilers and is an excellent non-conductor of heat, but when in the form of boiler scale is on the wrong side of the shield.\n\nMagnesium Chloride\n\nA very objectionable mineral when present in boiler water, it being very corrosive in its action, quickly pitting and gnawing boilers which use water containing it.\n\nMagnesium Sulphate\n\n(Commodity known as Epsom Salts. MgSO\u2084)\n\nSulphate of magnesium is a common constituent of natural water in which it is always quite soluble. It does not of itself form boiler scale, but is broken up by the lime salts when present in the water, boiler scale being formed.\n\nSodium Sulphate (Glaubers Salt) and Sodium Chloride (Common Salt)\n\nDo not form boiler scale, nor do they corrode iron, are not objectionable when present in large amounts, when they may cause foaming or priming in the boiler.\n\nSodium Carbonate\n\nDoes not form boiler scale nor corrode, but is objectionable when present in large quantities, as it causes foaming.\n\nIron\n\nIs generally present in water in the form of bi-carbonate, but iron is extremely liable to oxidise, being oxygen is converted into iron rust, this being the cause of many boilers to burst when they are exposed to the air for a short time. Carbonate of iron cannot boil away, but remains in the boiler, and such boilers sometimes contain sulphate of iron, which is extremely corrosive.\n\nCarbonic Acid\n\nCO\u2082\n\nIs found in all natural waters and in the same as the gas which we breathe in nodal and softer waters, and is responsible for the presence of many of the above minerals, and builds the mica solution in the water.\n\nSilica\n\nSiO\u2082\n\nCommon sand is nearly pure silica. Silica is contained in almost every water, but the greatest amount is in warm waters. It is frequently in combination with Alumina and is present in our case, is present in such small quantity that it has little to do with the formation of boiler scale.\n\nReactions\n\nWater may be alkaline, neutral, or acid; it is generally found to be alkaline. Some waters are acid, although this is quite rare, except waters drawn from coal mines or from the vicinity of coal beds. Water is often treated with hydrochloric acid and with sulphuric acid, which is produced by the oxidation of the pyrites or sulphate of iron, which is always found with coal.\n\nSuspended Matter\n\nThis is either organic or inorganic matter held in suspension in water and is very variable in quantity, depending upon the source of supply of the water and the season of the year and the season. Suspended matter forms boiler scale only by being cemented to the boiler by other materials.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lambert, O.M.I., Principal\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour letter of September 26, addressed to the Davis-Paradis Watchmens Clock Corporation, has been delivered to us as a number of years ago we purchased the remaining assets of this company.\n\nThe watchclock which you purchased from them in 1932 was originally made in Germany and as a consequence no repair parts are available for repairing this watchclock. It will therefore be impossible to repair your clock if new parts are needed. If you have not already sent this clock to us, we would suggest that if you feel that it should be repaired even though it is now 17 years old, that you send it to our distributors in Toronto, Hardinge Brothers of Canada Limited, 43 Scott Street, Toronto 1, and they may be in a position to repair the clock, providing no new parts are needed. If it is not possible to repair this clock they will be in a position to offer you a new watchclock for your use.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDETTE WATCHCLOCK CORPORATION\n\nManager Export Department\n\nWH: AEE\nJanuary 5th, 1950.\n\nMr. Wm.

Duplicate copies of this report with covering letter are attached herewith.\n\nThe report indicates the present cost of installing a water line from Lake Manitoba to this school along the lines of the general design in Mr. Gow's report of September 5th, 1934, will be approximately $40,000. Mr. Perrie states that the scheme outlined in Mr. Gow's report will provide what seems to be the only really satisfactory solution to the water problem at this school.\n\nWhile Mr. Perrie indicates that a change might be made in the location of the intake well with a slight saving in cost, this change will depend on conditions encountered on the Lake shore. A further investigation will be necessary before material can be ordered and before work can begin.\n\nAs water from Lake Manitoba is being used at present in the school this proposed installation of a pump and water line will not in any way improve the quality of the water available, but will save the cost of hauling water and perhaps enable a larger minimum supply to be in storage at the school with better regulation of the supply.\n\nEstimating the life of the installation at 25 years the annual cost to cover interest and sinking fund at a 3% rate and operating costs will be:\n\nYearly Interest on $40,000 @ 3% $ 1,200.00\nSinking Fund Yearly Deposit 1,097.20\nOperating Costs Yearly 52.80\n\nAnnual Cost $ 2,350.00\n\nThus, if the hauling of water at present costs more than $2,350.00 each year the installation of the proposed system would be economically advantageous. Of course, certain conveniences might result from the proposed system which cannot be expressed in money.\n\nThe attached report makes mention of the need for a high pressure laundry boiler. The estimated cost of this equipment is $1,750.00 in place, and should be considered as a separate item not included within the $40,000.00 estimated as the cost of the proposed new water system.\nThere appears to be a need for the installation of this water system, and if economically advantageous we recommend it be undertaken. Otherwise, it is expensive, and due to the fact that the pumphouse will be 1\u00bd to 2 miles away from the school in an exposed location, some maintenance troubles and expense might possibly develop later if carelessness is exhibited in operation.\n\nChief,\n\nAttns.\nAIRMAIL\n\n416 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nJanuary 3rd, 1950.\n\nRe: Water Supply - Sandy Bay\nIndian Residential School,\nManitoba.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions contained in your letter of October 14th an investigation has been made into the water supply at the above school and for your information I am attaching hereto copy of a report received from Engineer W. J. Kerr in this connection.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Gow's report of September 5th, 1934 has been studied and that the water supply scheme as outlined in that report is quite feasible and will provide what seems to be the only really satisfactory solution to the water problem at this school. The revised estimate covering the cost of the project as outlined in Mr. Gow's report can be considered to be a fairly close one although from information just obtained, it would appear that the item of $600.00 for High Pressure Boiler should be nearer $1,600.00. However any variations in the itemized estimate would be taken care of by the 10% provided for contingencies and unforeseen and it can be considered that, to construct the water supply system as recommended by Mr. Gow, the sum of $40,000.00 would have to be provided.\n\nIn the event that the Indian Affairs Branch proposes to proceed with the project in the coming year it would be well to provide funds as above, but I am of the opinion that it may be possible to effect some considerable saving in the cost of the project by locating the well and\npump house at the lake shore rather than at Station 27/50 as shown on the profiles attached to Mr. Gow's report.\n\nAt the time of the recent inspection it was not possible to sink test holes at the lake shore but from information at present available it appears that a supply of filtered water can be made available in a well located near the shore line and if the well so located fills with water by filtration through the sand it will eliminate the necessity of installing the intake pipe to the lake and effect a saving of approximately $5,000.00 in the cost of the work.\n\nAttached hereto are copies of the profiles that accompanied Mr. Gow's report of 1934 upon which I have indicated, in red, the recommended new location of the well and pump house.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervising Engineer\n\nEncs.\n\nMr. C.

J. Clark and myself proceeded to Amaranth on November 25th to inspect the above school.\n\nThe school is situated about 6\u00bd miles south east of Amaranth, Manitoba, and is about two miles from the western shore of Lake Manitoba.\n\nThe total personnel at this school is about 205 or 210, including the pupils, nuns and priests. This is the maximum complement for the school and several children had to be refused admission this fall due to the over-crowded condition. We were told by the Principal, Fr. Lambert, that he was endeavouring to have an old church changed into a day school to accommodate children from nearby and in this way ease the situation.\n\nThe school was in very good order and discipline was of a very high standard. The building's interior was very clean and well kept. Interior decorating had been done by the priests and lay brothers. All classrooms were extremely tidy. The boys' and girls' activities in the playrooms were being properly supervised and the playrooms themselves were in good condition.\n\nThe main problem at this school is to obtain some better system of delivering water. I will deal with this question first.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe had before us a copy of the \"Report on Water Supply System for Sandy Bay Indian School\" presented by D. B. Gow, Acting District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Supply & Reclamation Service, in August, 1934. We followed this report in detail and the project as laid out by Mr. Gow is quite feasible and any future work should follow the survey as laid down as to lines and levels.\n\nThe original water distribution has been changed since the report of 1934. The overhead tanks in the school attic have been dispensed with and pressure tanks with a total capacity of about 1,300 gallons are installed in the boiler room. The outside wells were abandoned and a 20,000 gallon concrete reservoir has been constructed approximately 50 feet from the end of the boiler room. This tank is kept filled with water by means of a tank truck which hauls the water from the lake. The truck capacity is 1,000 gallons and the water consumption in the school is about 3,000 gallons per day. It can be easily understood that, in extreme winter weather, it is a hardship to keep the water in the storage tank at a safe level.\n\nA dug-out has been constructed and a pressure system installed to supply water to the barn and pig pen.\n\nMr. Gow's report was made when the prices of materials and labour were approximately half the present price, and a revised estimate of cost is attached hereto.\n\nWe are presenting an alternative to Mr. Gow's scheme, which will not only save approximately $5,000.00 but will also deliver filtered water to the school.\n\nAccording to the last holes put down on the original survey, the material close to the shore line of Lake Manitoba is shingle sand and sandy loam. It is suggested that a cased well 10 x 10 be sunk near the shore line and a pump and motor installed at the same location, instead of at Sta. 27450. This would eliminate the necessity of underwater work in the lake and all of the 4\" C.I. pipe which was suggested in the original estimate.\n\nThe possibility of sinking a well in the vicinity of the school is practically ruled out because of excessive quantities of sodium chloride. The former wells have been out of use for some time and were used only for flushing sewage in the school. The water level in the wells has dropped to such an extent that there is not enough water to use for flushing sewage. Lake Manitoba is the only available water source and an analysis of this water, which appears in Mr. Gow's report, shows some sodium chloride.\n\nIt is proposed to use the present storage tank for storage and to connect the 3\" line from the lake directly to this tank. The Manitoba Power Commission is going to connect to this school very shortly and it is suggested...\nthat a transmission line be erected along the pipe line to the pumping station (approx. 9,200 feet) and electric energy, automatically controlled, be used for pumping the water.\n\nSome type of heater will be required in the pump house to counteract freezing conditions during the winter.\n\nAn approximate cost of this method is as follows:\n\n(a) Intake (Pumping Station)\n\nTimber crib well - Excav. & constr. $1,500.00\nMaterial for well and pump house 800.00\nMotor and pump 460.00\nTransmission Line (installing, connections and fittings) 2,300.00\nRoadway to well across swampy land 1,250.00\n\n(b) Pipe Line\n\n9300 lin. ft. 3\" C.I.P. @ 1.45 $13,465.00\nLaying pipe @ 20\u00a2 per lin. ft. 1,560.00\nExcavating and backfilling 8,750.00\nValves and fittings 300.00\nConnections to present reservoir including concrete cover 250.00\n\n(c) Distribution System\n\nHigh Pressure Boiler $650.00\nInstallation 150.00\nAdditional Fitting and Pipe 375.00\nAlterations to Laundry Room 200.00\n\nIntake $6,310.00\nPipe Line 24,645.00\nDistribution System 1,175.00\n\n$32,130.00 + 10% 3,213.00\n\n$35,363.00\n\nWe have included the cost of a high pressure boiler in our estimate. This could be installed in the boiler room beside the present furnace and boiler.\n\nOur report is not as complete as it might have been, but after one day's stay at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, we were forced to leave due to inclement weather and the possibility of being snowed in.\n\nTrusting that I have given you sufficient information for your requirements, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

The Manitoba Power Commission is going to connect to this school very shortly and it is suggested\nthat a transmission line be erected along the pipe line to the pumping station (approx. 9,200 feet) and electric energy, automatically controlled, be used for pumping the water.\n\nSome type of heater will be required in the pump house to counteract freezing conditions during the winter.\n\nAn approximate cost of this method is as follows:\n\n(a) Intake (Pumping Station)\n\nTimber crib well - Excav. & constr. $1,500.00\nMaterial for well and pump house 300.00\nMotor and pump 460.00\nTransmission Line (installing, connections and fittings) 2,300.00\nRoadway to well across swampy land 1,250.00\n\n$6,310.00\n\n(b) Pipe Line\n\n9300 lin. ft. 3\" G.I.P. @ 1.45 $13,485.00\nLaying pipe @ 20\u00a2 per lin. ft. 1,850.00\nExcavating and backfilling 8,750.00\nValves and fittings 300.00\nConnections to present reservoir including concrete cover 250.00\n\n$24,645.00\n\n(c) Distribution System\n\nHigh Pressure Boiler $650.00\nInstallation 150.00\nAdditional Fitting and Pipe 375.00\nAlterations to Laundry Room 200.00\n\n$1,375.00\n\nIntake $6,310.00\nPipe Line 24,645.00\nDistribution System 1,375.00\n\n$32,330.00\n\n+ 10% 3,233.00\n\n$35,563.00\n\nWe have included the cost of a high pressure boiler in our estimate. This could be installed in the boiler room beside the present furnace and boiler.\n\nOur report is not as complete as it might have been, but after one day's stay at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, we were forced to leave due to inclement weather and the possibility of being snowed in.\n\nTrusting that I have given you sufficient information for your requirements, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. J. Kerr,\nEngineering and Construction Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The estimate now provided by the engineers calls for an expenditure of $40,000.00 divided as follows:\n\n(a) Intake - Pumping Station $7,000.\n(b) Pipe Line 27,000.\n(c) Distribution System 3,000.\n\nTo this total we must provide, for a contingency, the sum of $3,000.\n\nIn addition to this, the pump house will be one and one-half to two miles away from the school in an exposed location. Great care will have to be taken with the system as otherwise maintenance troubles and consequent expenses will result.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P.

Dr. Wood took the matter up with me regarding the installation of the chlorinator at once as there had been cases of typhoid on the reserve and therefore was concerned that there might be an outbreak in the school.

Since no request for wiring revisions was made to this office, and we are unfamiliar with conditions at the school, an inspection trip will be necessary before Major MacKay can be furnished with our comment.\n\nWe have therefore instructed our electrical engineer Kosnar, now in the field, to stop over in Winnipeg on his return from Jasper, interview Supervisor Davis, and carry out an inspection at the school, on which to base a report and recommendation.\n\nMr. Kosnar should be back in Ottawa by April 5th.\n\nChief.\nMarch 31st, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S.

After examining the tenders submitted our officer contacted Colonel Neary in Ottawa by telephone regarding the extent of the work to be carried out and he requested that our investigation include lighting alterations as well as the work necessary to change-over from the present direct current supply provided by the diesel generating unit at the school to the alternating current supply of the Manitoba Power Commission.\n\n3. The Manitoba Power Commission prepared an electrical drawing showing new service and distribution equipment required and also electrical controls for new power-driven laundry and baking equipment which the school Principal had apparently requested or desired. It was on this plan and a report of their inspection, which included outbuildings, that the contractors based their quotations.\n\n4. In a discussion with the Principal it appeared that it was not definitely established that the equipment shown on the Commission's plan requiring electrical connections and controls would be provided. During a discussion with Colonel Neary and Mr. Phelan of the Indian Affairs Branch, it was established that no requests for the above mentioned equipment were on file in Ottawa, and concurrence was given to our suggestion that until such time as a decision was reached in this connection, provision would be made for this equipment only in the service capacity. In the interim the diesel engine, which at present is used to drive the D.C. generator and line shaft for the existing equipment will be retained to power the line shaft only.\n\n5. The lighting generally is not good at the school and improvements were recommended, particularly in areas where the seeing tasks require high levels of illumination. Colonel Neary concurred in making the necessary alterations and additions to the lighting, but requested that changes be limited to areas such as classrooms where good illumination is a requisite.\n6. It is necessary to carry out wiring in several of the Outbuildings to bring them up to Canadian Electrical Code Standards, and this together with changes necessary for the three (3) wire outside distribution system will be included in the work to be done.\n\n7. It was noted from the tenders submitted that all contractors did not base their bids on similar work and we are at present engaged in the preparation of plans and specifications which will form a common basis upon which the contractors can submit competitive tenders.\n\n8. Upon completion, blueprints of our drawings and copies of our specifications will be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch for transmission to Mr. Davis for calling of tenders.\n\n[Signature]\nChief.\nMay 27th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S.

Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education\n\nFurther reference to your Army message dated August 30, 1950 regarding the erection of a piggery and manual training building at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nFather Lambert called at my office in July and I wrote the Department under file No. 149/6-1-584 dated July 27, 1950, asking for information regarding the location etcetera of these buildings.\n\nApparently Mr. Doucett visited the school last time he was west. I understood from Father Lambert that some of the naffs etcetera had been shipped to them for this purpose. This is the only information I have regarding the erection of the two buildings above mentioned. As soon as I can get time I will visit Sandy Bay and take the matter up with you further on my return.\n\nR. J.

In this connection I would refer you to our signal of August 30th.\n\nWe have received direct from Father Lambert a requisition for the materials for the carpentry shop and also for the piggery. We are prepared to supply the material for either of these buildings, but not for both of them on the understanding that the labour will be supplied by the school staff without cost to the Department.\n\nPlease consult the Principal and advise which building he chooses to erect this year.\n\nBernard F.

To explain the matter more fully, I give the following statement:\n\n| Register Number | Quarter Return | September Quarter Return |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| 141             | Alex Deaffie   | Louis Walker             |\n| 142             | R. Levasseur   | Alex Deaffie             |\n| 143             | Stephen Beaulieu | Rupert Levasseur       |\n| 144             | R. J. Houle    | Stephen Beaulieu         |\n| 145             | - - - - - - - - | Rodrigue J. Houle        |\n| 0142            | A. L. Walker   | Mary Summer              |\n| 0143            | Mary Summer    | V. Levasseur             |\n| 0144            | V. Levasseur   | Genevieve Richard        |\n| 0145            | G. Richard     | A. Roulette              |\n| 0146            | A. Roulette    | A. Walker                |\n\nI would appreciate your taking up this matter with the Principal and have the return properly made out, keeping in mind that the Department desires the register numbers given pupils on the June quarter return retained, as the numbers appearing on that return correspond with the numbers entered on the application forms which are on the Department's file.\n\nI may add that no application or certificate of health has yet been received for R. J. Houle. There does not appear to have been any application submitted for Louis Walker. Possibly, this is a mistake. The Principal may mean Louise Walker and, if so, she should be shown on the section of the return on which the girls' names are entered.\n\nTo assist the Principal in his financing, a cheque for $2,000., being part payment of the September quarter grant, is forwarded under separate cover and any balance will be paid when the amended return is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOctober 31st 1931\n\nNo. 40.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to return herewith the quarterly returns of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School amended by the Rev. Principal, to conform to your letter No. 126-9-10, October 20th 1931. With further reference to the above noted letter, I beg to advise that the admittance of R.J. Houle was covered by Department letter No. 126-9-10 March 15th 1931, and the admittance of Louis Walker, who in previous correspondence has been shown as a girl, by letter 126-9-10 December 12th, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

White, Esq., Indian Agent of Portage la Prairie, to the effect that the night of Friday the 2nd instant a boy named William Thomas Beaulieu had gone to the Indian Residential School at Sandy Bay I. Reserve, and, against the wishes of Rev. Father O. Chagnon, Principal, taken his son Clifford Beaulieu, home from the school for the week-end, stating that the boy was lonesome and he would return him to school on Monday.\n\nIt was desired to have this boy returned to the school before Monday, as if allowed to remain away from the school it was felt that the parents of other children attending the school would want to have their children home, and thereby a great deal of trouble would be caused during the present teaching year.\n\nBriefly the reason for desiring action taken is as follows:\n\n\"In the past it has been the practice at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School to allow the children whose parents reside at the Reserve to go to their homes from Friday until Monday. This has proved to be a very unsatisfactory arrangement, in the past the children have returned to school the majority of them being dirty and verminous, also in numerous instances there has been children remaining away from school until Wednesday and Thursday of the following week.\n\nIt was therefore found necessary to discontinue the privilege, and before the summer holidays all parents were informed that all of the children in residence must remain at the school.\"\n\nIn view of the request of the Indian Agent, and with a view to possibly avoiding any further trouble from this source, it was arranged that Rev. Father O. Chagnon, Principal, of Sandy Bay Indian Residential School would transport the writer to Sandy Bay Indian Reserve in order that steps might be taken to have Clifford Beaulieu returned to the School before Monday, thus establishing that the children must remain at the School as ordered by the Principal.\n\nAt the early p.m. same date I left Gladstone accompanying Rev. Father O. Chagnon in his private car and proceeded to where William Thomas Beaulieu was camped by the house of William Thomas Beaulieu Sr. We located Clifford Beaulieu, but at this time the parent was not available, and we awaited his return.\n\nUpon his return I interviewed William Thomas Beaulieu, and upon it being pointed out to him that Clifford Beaulieu should not have left, or been taken away from the school without the permission of Father Chagnon, he intimated that he now knew that and had intended to return the boy at 4:00 p.m. this date. He was quite agreeable for the boy to return to the school with us.\n\nP.T.C.\nIn conclusion I might state that as far as I can ascertain there is no \"truant officer\" appointed at Sandy Bay Indian Reserve and this patrol was made chiefly to avoid Beaulieu establishing his presence here. It is doubtful if some steps had not been taken to assure that boy Clifford Beaulieu's return to school before Monday, then other parents would go to the school and take their children away against the wishes and without the consent of the Principal.\n\nThe fact that this boy returned to the School on Saturday will undoubtedly establish the rights of the Principal of the school, as guardian of the children in residence, against the parents who persist in so far as their remaining at the school is concerned.\n\nWhereas, as before stated, if this boy had been allowed to remain away from the school until the date that his parent stated he would bring him back, it would tend to lessen the authority of the Principal of the School.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nSub-Div.File 37/19.\n\n\"File Closed\"\n\nThe Officer Commanding \"D\" Division,\nR.C.M.Police,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nForwarded.\n\nJ.W.Kempston.\nInspector,\nCommanding Brandon Sub-Division.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.Police, Ottawa, Ont\n\nCASE CONCLUDED - HANDED TO DEPARTMENT,\n\nCOPY SENT TO INDIAN AGENT\n\nFORWARDED TO DEPARTMENT Of\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDate Sept. 15, 1932\n\nOur Ref. 38 D 126-F 15\n\nYour Ref.\n\nA.Patterson, Insp.\nFor D.C.I.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the R.C.M.P., in connection with action they recently took in returning Clifford Beaulieu to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears that the management of this school has been in the habit of allowing certain pupils to go home from Saturday to Monday but that they have discontinued this practice recently. The above-mentioned boy's father came to the school and took him home in spite of the objections of the Principal and the R.C.M.P. were, apparently, requested to have him returned, which they did.\n\nThe Department has never approved of pupils of Indian residential schools being allowed home over Sunday and we are pleased to note that this practice has been discontinued at the Sandy Bay School.\n\nYou should give the Principal every possible assistance in this matter by pointing out to the Indian parents concerned that it is in the best interests of their children to remain in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The Department considers that the school management should be able to exert sufficient moral suasion to prevent these boys from being chronic truants.

The child when once on the reserve is harboured by the Indians and if the child can tell a story of a whipping, it becomes quite a problem to get the pupil back to school.\n\nI firmly believe that if the two boys in question were transferred to another school as a disciplinary measure, and the two boys are chronic truants, I believe that it would tend to stop truancy from becoming epidemic in this school.\n\nI beg to request that the Department will reconsider their decision in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 16, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, regarding pupils Nos. 137 and 134 of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department approves of their transfer to the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On Saturday the 5th inst., a patrol was made\nto Sandy Bay Indian Reserve per police car #1245, and I pro-\nceeded to the Indian Residential School.\nUpon interviewing Father Chagnon he stated that three\npupils had been absent, two had been returned to the\nschool by their respective parents, and there was now only\none pupil absent, Ambrose SUTHERLAND, 15 years old.\nFrom enquiries made by Father Chagnon this pupil had been\nstaying part of the time with Mrs James Harris and one\nGoodmundson near Langruth.\nBut while at the school it was learned from Joe Beaulieu\nthat this youth was now back on the Reserve, and had been\nstaying part of the time at Norbert Beaulieu, Albert Beaulieu\nand Frank Deslauriers.\nAccompanied by Father Chagnon a patrol was made to these res-\npective places, and Ambrose SUTHERLAND was playing near the\nhome of Albert BEAULIEU, but upon seeing us approach he ran\noff into the bush, and while a search was made he was not lo-\ncated.\nFather Chagnon suggested that he be left as it would be use-\nless to try and catch him in the bush, and arrangements were\nmade with the respective persons with whom Sutherland has\nbeen staying, to hold him on his return, and report to the\nschool, in order that this youth may be returned to the school.\n\n(3). No further police services being required\nin this connection, I left the Reserve at 4.30 p.m., and return-\ned to Detachment.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n\"FILE CLOSED\"\n\nThe Officer Commanding \"D\" Division,\nR.G.M.P., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nConstable Reg#11457\nForwarded.

Please read this circular again and you will note that it simply pointed out that the Indian Act requires permission to be secured when it is desired to keep children over sixteen years of age in a residential school. The Department fully realizes that there are often very good reasons for keeping children after the age mentioned, but, as stated above, permission should be secured. We are prepared to give favourable consideration to representations made by principals with regard to retaining children over sixteen years.\n\nThe practice which the Department desires followed in future is that at the end of each academic year the Principal should prepare a list of children sixteen years of age and over. He should state definitely those whom he considers should be retained for a further period and give his reasons for this action in each individual case. This report should be forwarded to the Department through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nIn accordance with the above, you should at once prepare a list of children sixteen years of age and over in the Sandy Bay School, giving their names and register numbers, and, in the case of those whom you consider should be retained for a further period, you should request such permission and give your reasons for making the request. This should be forwarded to the Department through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. O.

In the early a.m. of April 1st, 1935, I left Eriksdale by horse livery, and proceeded to the Lake Manitoba Indian Reserve, and made enquiries for Alex Deaffy and Norman Maytwashing. I found out from the Farm Instructor, Mr. C.L. Mitchell, that the former boy had been returned to the School at Sandy Bay, a few days previous, the chief from that Reserve, Louie Prince, having come over for him.\n\n3. I located Norman Maytwashing at the home of his father, John Baptiste Maytwashing, the father was away. The boy had been home since February 22nd, 1935. He was very reluctant to leave, and hung on to the bedstead in the shack. I however got him into the cutter, and we started off across Lake Manitoba, by horse livery, arriving at Amaranth late in the evening.\n\n4. East from Amaranth, we travelled through the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, to the Indian Residential School, where I interviewed the Principle, Father O. Chagnon. He informed me that the other boy, Alex Deaffy, was back at the institution already. Norman Maytwashing was handed over to the Principle by me, and I obtained a receipt for him. The livery driver and myself stayed at the school overnight, and left there in the early a.m. of April 2nd, 1935, arriving at Eriksdale at 11-48 p.m.\n\n5.

Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOn the 15th instant whilst in the Langruth district on other duties the writer ascertained that the above named truant was alleged to be staying at the camp of one Alex. Beauchamp, a half-breed, about a mile north of Langruth, on the ridge.\n\nI patrolled, per Pol. car 1509, to the said camp and found that this was so but this truant, on seeing the uniform, took to the bush and although I chased him about a mile and a half east thru the bush I was unable to apprehend him.\n\nI located the camp of his father, Albert Roulette, but was informed that I would not get any assistance from that quarter. The father himself stated that he would not assist the police in getting his boy.\n\nUnder these circumstances it will be rather a difficult matter to get a hold of this truant. On the 20th instant whilst at Portage la Prairie on other duties I discussed this affair with J. Waite, Esq., Indian Agent and his suggestion is that the matter be held in abeyance until about August 15th or thereabouts when the schools open again.\n\nIn view of this no special patrols to apprehend this truant will be made in the meantime. Should he be located whilst in the district on other matters the necessary action will be taken. Right at the present nearly all of the Sandy Bay Indians are out of the Reserve and camping about the country-side digging seneca root. This continual shifting of camp sites makes it hard to locate the boy.\n\nFurther report will be submitted in due course.\n\nS. U. I. D. D. 15.6.36\n\nN. E. I.\n\nO. C. Brandon S/Div.\nR. C. M.

Mrs. Rattlesnake, the Mother, agreed to let the child go. Now Angus objects to the girl being placed in a Catholic Institution against his wishes. He desires to have her educated in the Birtle school. The mother, I presume, is the legal guardian of these children, as they are illegitimate, but she wished to have this girl educated in the Birtle school a month ago, and I would not approve of her admittance until the Department approved of their admission into the membership of the Band. I would appreciate your advice regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Smith.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed that Margaret Rattlesnake, illegitimate daughter of Angus Bone and Mrs. Rattlesnake, who were recently admitted as members of the Keesekocovenin Band, was taken to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, early this month, by a priest from the school, during the absence of the father, Angus Bone. Angus Bone objects to this girl being placed in a Catholic institution against his wishes and desires to have her educated in the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI would point out that this girl should not have been taken to your school until an application for her admission had been forwarded to the Department and the necessary authority granted for her admittance. In view of the fact that there is a question raised as to the religious denomination of the school in which this child should be placed, I have to request that you will have her returned to her home on the Keesekocovenin Reserve at the earliest possible date. After she arrives at home, the local Agent will be requested to ascertain definitely the religious belief to which she belongs, prepare an application for her admission and have her examined by a doctor and then forward the application to the Department, who will decide the school in which she should be placed. I have to request that you will see that this girl is returned to her home at an early date.\n\nA copy of this communication is being forwarded to Mr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. O.

There are two children, viz.: Margaret and George, of school age. You should have applications for their admission prepared, properly filled in and signed by the father, and the children should be examined by a doctor. You should then forward these applications to the Department, with full particulars regarding the religious denomination of the parents, together with your recommendation as to the residential school in which they should be placed.\n\nPlease inform the Department if Margaret has been returned to her home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Further herein I have to report that, to date, this truant has not returned to the Reserve. Nor have his parents, Mr. & Mrs. Albert Beaulieu, returned.\n\n2. On the 22nd instant I obtained information to the effect that these people and their boy were camping near McGregor, Man. and that the boy was being fed and bedded in the bush nearby to prevent the police getting him. On the 24th instant whilst in the McGregor dist. on other duties I called at the nuisance ground, where most of the Indians camp, and was told that the Beaulieu's left for Holland dist. the day before.\n\n3. It is possible that they may hang around the Indian Springs area. Beaulieu, the father, is a \"loafer\" and seldom works, even in harvest time. In view of this he might be found hanging around the village.\n\n4. I respectfully suggest that a copy of this report be forwarded to Treherne Det. for further investigation at that point. It is very improbable that the boy will be apprehended without resorting to the provisions of the Indian Act whereby a father or guardian may be prosecuted if the boy does not attend school as required.\n\n5. The description of this truant is; 15 yrs. of age, about 5'3\", 115 lbs., swarthy complexion, slightly cross-eyed and has a scar on face (exact position of scar not known). If the father is located I would respectfully suggest that he may be warned re the provisions of the Act and that action against him is being contemplated if he does not produce the boy or return to this district with him.\n\n6. Confidential informants have promised to notify this office when the Beaulieus' return to this dist. or their Reserve.

Gilbert's grand father and grand mother were interviewed and told me that BEAULIEU his wife and Gilbert were gone to Holland but would be back probably the next day.\n\n3. I wrote a letter to BEAULIEU, Albert father of Gilbert warning him that he was given ten days to go back to Sandy Bay Reserve and make his son Gilbert attend to the Sandy Bay Residential School, and that in default he would be prosecuted for failing to cause his son to attend school. I handed my letter to Gilbert's grand father with order to hand it over to his son at his return.\n\n4.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFurther re this subject I have to state as follows: On the 24th instant whilst in the Sandy Bay dist. on other duties I learned that this truant was being harbored by Louis Prince, Chief of the Sandy Bay Band.\n\nThe writer and Cst. R. E. Bradley forthwith proceeded to the Prince premises but found that the boy had again escaped from the house before we got there. The truant's father was there and on asking him where the boy was he said \"You can go to hell, I'm busy here and you have no right to come here to accuse me.\" After informing him that we would only be back in about an hour and that he should locate his son and turn him over we left on other duties. We called at the Sandy Bay Residential School where I arranged with Father Chagnon that should Albert Beaulieu, the father, decide to bring the boy to the school he would take him in and notify this office.\n\nWe subsequently returned to the Prince abode. The father had also left and could not be located. Mrs. Beaulieu, the mother, was present and I served on her a notification as provided for in Sec. 10 of the Indian Act. The father had been previously notified verbally. The mother was served both verbally and in writing. She however refused, at the instigation of the Chief, to accept the service. I put the paper down at her feet whereupon Chief Prince picked it up and threw it into the police car at the same time stating that we had no business coming onto the Reserve without a permit from the Indian Agent and threatened to forcibly put us off. By that time he had gathered some 10 to 12 other Indians with him. I handed the paper back to him and advised him to place it back where he had picked it up. He refused to do so by again throwing the paper at me.\n\nOther members of the band that had gathered, apparently the Chief's cronies, refused to divulge their names and as the writer is not very familiar with the members of the Sandy Bay I cannot say who they were. I would however recognize all, or nearly all of them, if I saw them again.\n\nThe Chief is a particularly obnoxious type of individual and has absolutely no respect for law or order. He admitted harboring the truant in question and stated that we had no \"god-damn business\" trying to take him away.\n\nIt would appear that Prince, in the actions above described, was obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty and should be prosecuted; otherwise he and his followers will get out of control. I might say here that only a small percentage of the members of the Sandy Bay Band have any use for him. He is unpopular with most of them.\n\nFurther; I have no doubt that Albert Beaulieu will refuse to produce hoy within the 3 day time limit and if he does so refuse I suggest that action be taken against him under the provisions of the Act. P.T.O.\nRe: Gilbert BEAULIEU - Truant. Sandy Bay I. R. Res. School\n\n8. I omitted to state in Para. 3. that the notification eventually was left with Chief Louis Prince who was advised to return same to Mrs. Beaulieu; he refused to take it or pick it up after it was placed at his feet; it was there when we left.\n\n9. It would appear from Sub-sec. 4 of Sec. 10 of the Indian Act that the notification of a parent need not necessarily be in writing; there is nothing in the section to indicate this. As the matter now stands both parents have been verbally notified and the mother was served with a written notice as aforementioned; copy of said notice is held at this office.\n\n10. There is nothing to show that this truant would be exempted under any of the provisions of s.s. 5. of Sec. 10, i.e., by sickness, etc.\n\n11. The alleged obstruction of a peace officer in the execution of his duty would no doubt come under the provisions of the Code and in view of this I am forwarding herewith an extra copy of this report for the Crown Attorney, C.

He was brought up as a Presbyterian, and still claims to be one, and I am almost sure that there is a record of his baptism in the Presbyterian faith in the Church at Alphinstone.\n\nBoth Angus Bone and Chief George Bone complained to me about the Priest taking Margaret to School without his consent. Angus Bone signed the application forms for both children in my presence, and they were witnessed by his brother, Henry Bone. Mr White, the Missionary on the Reserve, was also present when Angus signed the forms, and assured me that he was a Presbyterian and wished to have the children brought up in the Presbyterian faith.\n\nI am also sure that the Presbyterian Church have brought no pressure to bear on Angus Bone regarding his children. One girl of Angus Bone's has attended the Birtle School for some time, and both Angus and Mrs Rattlesnake requested me to take Margaret to Birtle School sometime before she was admitted as a member of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nA.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another application for the admission of Margaret Rattlesnake to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. This application form is signed by both the father and the mother and states that the child's religion is Roman Catholic. The medical health form has been signed by Doctor Lerner. As there appears to be some doubt regarding the religious auspices under which the Rattlesnake children should be educated the Department has decided to request Inspector Hamilton to look into this matter fully on the occasion of his next visit to your agency.\n\nWhile the admission of George Rattlesnake to the Birtle Indian Residential School was approved by official letter of October 27th, last, his name does not appear on the December quarter return and it is presumed that he has not entered that school. He should remain at home with his parents until after Inspector Hamilton reports and our decision has been given.\n\nWe are informed that Margaret Rattlesnake is at present in the Sandy Bay School and it has been decided to approve her admission temporarily until the end of June. In the meantime, as stated above, we will have Inspector Hamilton's report.\n\nFrequently, cases arise where it is doubtful under what religious auspices the children should be educated. In all such circumstances, it is expected that our officials will investigate fully and report the facts for our decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department has had considerable correspondence with Mr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man., with reference to the religious auspices under which certain children named Rattlesnake should be educated. These children were accepted as members of the Keeseekeowenin Band last September.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Birtle Agency, you should interview the father and mother and make full inquiries regarding the religion of this family.\n\nYou will note sub-section 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. The intention of this section is that an Indian child should attend a school conducted under the auspices of the church with which the child and its parents are affiliated. The Department believes that strict adherence to this rule is in the best interests of its wards. Whenever any disagreement arises regarding the religious auspices under which a child should be educated, we endeavour to ascertain the religion of the parents and the real wish of the father at the time application is made for the admission of the child to a residential school.\n\nIn the case under discussion, there is disagreement regarding the religious auspices under which the child should be educated and, as mentioned above, the Department desires you to fully investigate the matter and report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

There naturally is no public school district on the reserve. I have asked the Principal of the Residential School, Father O. Chagnon, if these children cannot be accommodated in the classes in the school. He suggests that their classes now are overcrowded. Hon.

Fletcher  \nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, December 1, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI have discussed with Father Plourde the desirability of having provision made for the Cahill and Normandin children at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and he has promised me that he will communicate immediately with the Principal in respect to the matter.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible to have the Correspondence Branch supply these children with the regular public school lessons. If this suggestion appeals to you, you might intimate to Father O. Chagnon that the Department will be prepared to forward from time to time copies of the regular correspondence courses, on the understanding that provision for the accommodation of these children will be made at his school and, in addition to this, a certain amount of direction and instruction by a member of the school staff.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nJoseph Dan Gaywis of the Rolling River Band, and his family were all baptised as members of the Presbyterian Church about two weeks ago, by the Rev. E.H. Lockhart Principal of the Birtle Indian School. Previously Gaywis was a Roman Catholic although his wife was a Presbyterian and one girl, Elizabeth, is a pupil in the Birtle Indian School.\n\nAlec Gaywis, a son of the above, was admitted to the Sandy Bay Residential School as a pupil, in the fall of 1936 I think. Shortly after going to school the boy took ill and was brought home by his Father. Since then he has been at home as he was not very strong and his Father would not give his consent to the boy's tonsils being removed as recommended by the Medical Officer of the Sandy Bay School. The boy seems to be in better health now however, and the parents desire to have him admitted to the Birtle Indian School Residential School as a pupil. This School as you know is a Presbyterian School.\n\nI have no copy of the application form for admission into the Sandy Bay Residential School of this boy, so cannot give you the exact date of admission.\n\nGaywis did not like the Sandy Bay School and his change to the Presbyterian Faith may have been prompted by his desire to have the boy transferred. We cannot say that that is the case however.\n\nPlease advise me if you approve of the transfer of this boy to the Birtle School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.D. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-10, part 2)\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of Alec Gaywis to the Birtle Residential School at the present time. The boy should remain at home and you might bring this case to our attention in about 4 or 5 months' time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. G.

Father COMBS informed me that the above mentioned three Treaty Indian boys had run away from the school at 6:00 P.M. 7-4-39. ALFRED BEAULIEU age 14 years and JAMES MUSSEAU age 11 years were both from the Red and Flow La., while JOE HULE age 11 years was from Long Plains La. Father COMBS requested that I locate the boys and return them to the Residential School at Sandy Bay La.\n\nI proceeded from Ste Rose du Lac on this date at 9:00 A.M. per Pat. Code No.285 to Ebb and Flow La., Manitoba. At this point I located the above three boys.\n\nBEAULIEU claimed that he run away because he was going to be punished. JOE HULE claimed that BEAULIEU asked him to go with him, and he went. JAMES MUSSEAU claimed that he was going to be punished for breaking something on a windmill.\n\nOn arrival at Ebb and Flow La., I proceeded from Ebb and Flow La., accompanying the above three boys to Sandy Bay La. On arrival at Sandy Bay La., Residential School I handed the three boys over to Father COMBS. I returned to Ebb and Flow La., with ALADIN. On my arrival at the Ebb and Flow La., I was informed by ALADIN, Mr. ADAM School Teacher on the Reserve that Mary (Mme. MILLE) MUSSEAU was very sick on the Reserve, and requested me to take her to Dr. GENDREAU, M.D., at Ste Rose du Lac. I then proceeded from Ebb and Flow La., in company with Mary (Mme. MILLE) MUSSEAU, arriving at Ste Rose du Lac at 12:00 P.M. (noon). I ordered her to be taken to the Ste Rose Hospital.

Enquiries were made this date at Nibb and flew I.R. I was informed by Charles FLEET that on either April 17th or 18th he had been to Dog Creek I.R. visiting, and that he had returned to Nibb and flew on April 29th, 1940. He did not meet Edwin SUTHERLAND on the lakes. According to FLEET the ice was safe if one knew where to go, but it was very dangerous if you did not know where to go on the ice. There was a rumour on the Reserve that FLEET had made enquiries at Dog Creek I.R. about SUTHERLAND. FLEET however claimed that he did not know that SUTHERLAND had run away from school until he had returned to Nibb and flew I.R.\n\n9. Due to the fact that it is now impossible to travel on the lakes no further action was taken.\n\n10. It would appear to me that if SUTHERLAND was careful, and watched where he was going, and as he was light being only 12 years of age no doubt he has arrived at the Dog Creek I.R., and can be located at that point.\n\n11. As Alfred BEAULIEU has been returned to Sandy Bay I.R. and SUTHERLAND has left for Dog Creek I.R., no further action will be taken by me in this connection.\n\nCONCLUDED: R.O.M.P.\n\nEXPENSES: SEE FORM 93 FOR PERIOD ENDING 30-4-40.\n\n( G.C.HARDY )\nCat.#11441\n\n1/a Ste Rose du Lac Detachment\n\nThe O.C., \"D\" Division,\nR.O.M.P., WINNIPEG, Man.\n\nSir; Forwarded 30-4-40.

School,\nRunaway boys.\n\n(Keelwood Det. Case)\n\n25-4-40\n\n1. Relative to the above, and further to the marginally noted report I have to report that on this date I was informed by Mr. Adam of the Reddy Creek P.O. District Manitoba that he had heard that Alfred Beaillieu had been to the Nip and Flow I.R. Man., along with another boy by the name of Sutherland. Beaillieu was supposed to have come to the Ste Rose du Lac District to where his father Simon Beaillieu was working, and Sutherland was supposed to have left Nip and Flow I.R. for Dog Creek I.R.\n\nAt 7:00 P.M., I proceeded from Ste Rose du Lac in company with Mr. Adam to the R.M. of Ste Rose Manitoba. The family of Simon Beaillieu was located on the farm of Mr. Vanport, I was informed by Mrs. Beaillieu that her son Alfred had arrived from Sandy Bay I.R. School, and had been living with them. She claimed that he had left a short time before, and did not know where he had gone. A search around the area was made with no results. It appeared that as soon as Alfred saw the Police Car he went into the bush, and was hiding. The area was checked until dark with no results. I informed Mrs. Beaillieu that she was to notify her husband as soon as he returned that he was to bring Alfred to the Detachment Office at Ste Rose du Lac.\n\nI returned to Ste Rose du Lac at 9:30 P.M.\n\n26-4-40\n\nAt 9:00 A.M., this date Simon Beaillieu had not showed up with Alfred. It appeared to me that Alfred had not returned to their camp that night.\n\nI notified the O.C. Dauphin Sub-Div., that I had to leave for the Nip and Flow I.R. at once as a prairie fire was burning, and that the timber on the Reserve had to be protected at once. I informed the O.C. that I had instructed Simon Beaillieu to bring Alfred to this point when he located him, and when he arrived the Dauphin Sub-Div. office would be notified by my wife.\n\nDuring the P.M., while I was at Nip and Flow I.R., on other Police duties Sgt. McDonald, No. 11024 and Sgt. Tisdale, No. 11993 arrived at the Reserve with Alfred Beaillieu, and handed him over to me to take to Sandy Bay I.R. School.\n\nI proceeded from Nip and Flow I.R. to Sandy Bay I.R., escorting Alfred Beaillieu. On arrival at the school I handed Alfred Beaillieu over to Rev. Father Chagnon at Sandy Bay I.R. School. I returned to Nip and Flow I.R. at midnight.\n\nAccording to Alfred Beaillieu Edwin Sutherland had came to Nip and Flow I.R. along with him, and\n\"D\" Brandon. Gladstone.\n\nMan. April 24th., 1940.\n\nAlfred BEAULIEU, et al., (Indians)\nSandy Bay I.R. School,\nRunaway boys. (Kelwood Det. case.)\n\n1. Reference the above named and to Wm. & Alfred ROULETTE, Jimmie and Edwin SUTHERLAND, pupils of the Sandy Bay I.R. I have to report as follows:\n\n2. In the p.m. of the 23rd. inst. Rev. Father Chagnon, 1/c Sandy Bay Indian School, reported to this office that the five above named Indian boys ran away from the school in the a.m. of the 23rd. inst. Their homes being as follows:- Wm. & Alfred ROULETTE, 6 miles n.e. of Gladstone, their father being Pascal ROULETTE; Jimmie & Edwin SUTHERLAND, Dog Creek I.R., their father being George SUTHERLAND and Alfred BEAULIEU, Ochre River, his father being Simon BEAULIEU.\n\n3. In the a.m. of this date, the writer, per P.C. 1918, patrolled to the Hart farm, n.e. of Gladstone where BEAULIEU'S camp is located. The two boys, Wm. & Alfred were located and taken back to the Sandy Bay I.R. and handed over to Rev. Father Chagnon. At this time it was learned that Jimmie SUTHERLAND was seeing going across the ice on the lake, possibly making his way to Dog Creek I.R. The other brothers, Edwin was thought to have gone to Ebb & Flow I.R. in company with Alfred BEAULIEU.\n\n4. At Westbourne enquiries made located George SUTHERLAND, father of Jimmie & Edwin. He is staying at Westbourne. His wife is dead and he has a mother-in-law, Mrs Mary SWAN, and a brother-in-law, Charlie Baptise (?) now living at Dog Creek reserve. He has seen nothing of his two boys and he is sure they will go to their grandmother or uncle & aunt at Dog Creek reserve. Should he hear anything further regarding them he will notify this office at once. He wishes them kept under observation.\n\n5. Rev. Father Chagnon informed the writer, Cst. Harpell of St. Rose Det., is acquainted with Alfred ROULETTE, having returned him to Sandy Bay School about a year ago after he ran away. This boy will most likely be found with his father, Simon, at Ochre River.\n\n6. Very meagre descriptions were furnished the writer but no doubt enquiries will reveal if they are in the dat. The descriptions follow,-\n\nAlfred BEAULIEU, 13 yrs., wearing, cap, khaki coat, blue o'alls, gum rubbers.\nWm. SUTHERLAND, 14 yrs., inclined to be wild & crafty, wearing cap, khaki coat, blue o'alls, gum rubbers.\nEdwin SUTHERLAND, 12 yrs., shy, wearing, cap, khaki coat, blue o'alls, gum rubbers.\n\n7. Should the SUTHERLAND boys be located at Dog Creek reserve, they can be returned to Sandy Bay across the ice on Lake Manitoba, the chief at Dog Creek will act as escort. This according to Rev. Father Chagnon. Otherwise Mr Waite, Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, will have to be communicated with.\n\nCould the necessary enquiries be made at Dog Creek reserve by our Ashern Det., and at Ochre River by our St. Rose Det. please in an effort to locate these Indian boys. It is understood the parents of all these boys are anxious that they remain in the school at Sandy Bay.\n\nP.T.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School,\nRunaway Boys.\n\nKalwood Det., Cass.\n\nWith reference to the above I have to report\nthat during the last of this date the Cst. I/C Ste Rose\ndu Lac detachment communicated with this detachment stating\nthat Alfred Beauleau, one of the boys who had recently\nrun away from the Sandy Bay Indian School, was known to be\nin the Ste Rose district and that the boy's father, Simon\nBeauleau, had promised to locate him and return him to his\ndetachment at Ste Rose, so Cst. Harpell was requested elsewhere\non urgent police duties he requested that in the\nevent that this subject be located by his father that a\nmember of this detachment proceed to Ste Rose and take\ncharge of him.\n\nIn view of the above arrangement, Mrs. Harpell,\nwife of the Cst. I/C Ste Rose du Lac detachment, telephoned\nthis detachment at 13:00 noon of the same date, stating\nthat this subject was being held at Ste Rose pending the\narrival of a patrol.\n\nActing on instructions of the H.O. I/C Beaupin\ndetachment an immediate patrol was made to Ste Rose du\nLac per Cst. SAD by the writer and Cst. Macdonald, where\non our arrival, Alfred Beauleau was handed over and\nplaced in custody. This boy was questioned regarding the\nwhereabouts of the Sutherland boys who had also run away\nfrom the school and were reported to be in the vicinity.\nBeauleau informed us that he had not seen J.Jay Sutherland\nbut that Edwin Sutherland and he had been together since\nleaving the school and that Edwin had remained at George\nHoule's house on the Bob and Floe Lake when he, Beauleau\nhad gone to Ste Rose du Lac.\n\nPatrol was then continued to the Bob and Floe\nReserve where we located and questioned George Houle\nregarding the whereabouts of Edwin Sutherland. Houle\ninformed us that Sutherland had left his place on the 16th.\ninst., stating that he intended crossing Bob and Floe Lake\nand going to the Dog Creek Indian Reserve where he had\nfriends.\n\nWe then contacted Cst. Harpell, who during the\ncourse of enquiries had arrived at the Bob and Floe Reserve.\nCst. Harpell informed us that he had made enquiries\nlocally and already ascertained the information pertaining\nto Sutherland and that on continued enquiries he failed to\nobtain any information as to Sutherland having reached the\nDog Creek Reserve and further that owing to the precarious\ncondition of the ice on the lake it was feared that he may\nhave been drowned. This could not be substantiated as ice\nconditions made it impossible to have a patrol search the\nlake.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was informed that Jimmy and Edwin SUTHERLAND late of the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve were at present residing with their Grandfather Mrs. Francis SWAN and John BAPTISTE on the Lake Manitoba Indian Reserve (Dog Creek). Mr. J. MITCHELL, an instructor was then interviewed in connection with the SUTHERLAND boys and he informed me that he was aware of the fact that they had run away from Sandy Bay. Mr. MITCHELL also stated that he had phone Mr. J. WAITE, Indian Agent at Portage La Prairie and told him that the boys were living on the reserve. Mr. WAITE instructed MITCHELL to keep the boys there at present as he was undecided what to do with them.\n\n3. Since the two SUTHERLAND boys arrived on the Reserve from across the lake on the ice, it is now impossible for them to return via the same route, as the lake is beginning to break up and it would be very dangerous to attempt crossing. It would be necessary to escort them to Winnipeg for further transportation to Sandy Bay Indian Reserve.\n\n4.

When asked where they came from, all three would tell me was Elphinstone. I thereupon brought them back to detachment and contacted the HQ 1/C, Shoal Lake detachment and informed him of the foregoing. He contacted the Indian agent at Birtle and later called me back stating that Michelle BONE belonged to the Limard Point Indian Reserve near Rossburn and was supposed to be at the Indian school at Sandy Bay. They had no record of Jimmy MUNZER.\n\nIn the P.M. of this date I patrolled with these boys to Sandy Bay Indian Reserve and handed them over to Father CHANNON, in charge of the Indian school at that point. He informed me that Jimmy MUNZER belonged to Bob & Flow Reserve and that these two boys had run away from the school the A.M. of the 14th instant and that it was the second time they had run away.\n\nHANDED OVER,\n\nRANGERS, Cst.

CASE )\n\n12-5-43\n\n1. I have to report that at 3:30 P.M. this date I received a telephone call from Rev. Father COMEAU of the Sandy Bay I.R. Residential School. Father COMEAU informed me that Frederick FISH of the Ebb and Flow I.R. had run away from the Sandy Bay I.R. School. Father COMEAU went on to say that they had tried to have the child returned to the school by the parents, but that up to the present time the child had not returned. Father COMEAU asked me to bring the child back to Sandy Bay I.R. School.\n\n2. I proceeded from Ste Rose du Lac Man., at 3:30 P.M. this date per P.C.C.'s No. 1998 in company with Reg.No. 13706, 3/Cst.LTANASKI, S., to the Ebb and Flow I.R. District. We located Frederick FISH at the home of his parents on the I.R.. Roderick FISH, father of the child stated that his son Frederick had returned home on May 2nd, 1943 along with another child Robert FISH a brother of Roderick FISH. Robert FISH had been returned to Sandy Bay I.R. School by his father Joseph FISH. Roderick FISH claimed that his son Frederick had been sick and could not be taken back until he was better. I asked Roderick FISH why the boys ran away from the school. He stated that both boys complained about having to eat brown bread, and had to wear clothing with patches on. I examined the child's clothing, and although I saw one patch on the pants I personally consider the child was well dressed. The child also looked in good health, and one could see that the child had been well taken care of. No doubt the truth of the matter is that the children were home sick and as spring had arrived they wanted to go home. We then escorted the child to Ste Rose du Lac as the roads to Sandy Bay I.R. were impassable for a car. From Ste Rose du Lac we proceeded to McCready where we tried to proceed to the Reserve via Alonza. The roads in this area were also impassable due to recent rains. We then proceeded to the Sandy Bay I.R. via Neepawa.\n\n13-5-43\n\n3. We arrived at the Sandy Bay I.R. School at 3:30 A.M. this date, and handed over Frederick FISH to Rev. Father CHAGNON at the school. We remained at the school until 9:00 A.M. and then left for Ste Rose du Lac returning at 3:00 P.M. during the afternoon.\n\nCONCLUDED: H.O.T.B.G.\n\nEXPENSES: AM FOR 93 FOR PERIOD ENDING 15-5-43\nReg.No. 13706, 3/Cst.LTANASKI, S.,\nReg.No. 11441, Cst.HARPILL, G.C.\n\nCst.#11441\n\n( G.C.HARPILL )\n1/c Ste Rose du Lac Datchment\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nWe, Francis Tanner, Louisa Tanner, do wish to make known to all people from this day forward and forever, that we do hereby renounce our former connection with the Roman Catholic Church and its doctrines, and moreover we at the same time declare our sincere adherence to the Protestant Church and its teachings.\n\nAs for our family, we desire that they should from this day forward receive their education in the Presbyterian School at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nSigned:\n\nFrancis Tanner\nLouisa Tanner\n\nAug. 15th 1942\nWitness: H. Crump\n\n(Presbyterian Missionary on Reserve)\nMarius P.O.\nManitoba\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\n\nThis is to certify that we, the undersigned; Francis Tanner and Louisa (Ben) Tanner, are both Roman Catholics, and also our children, Milton Joseph, Molson Glen Andrew, Henry, Viola, and Marjorie, are Roman Catholics, and consequently we wish to take them away from Birtle Presbyterian School and to have them educated in a Roman Catholic School.\n\nFrancis Tanner\nLouisa Tanner\n\nWitnesses:-\n\nLeon Savoie\nRev. C.H. Comeau O.M.I.\nBirtle Manitoba\n26th August 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a declaration made by Francis Tanner and his wife of the Waywayseecappo Band, renouncing their adherence to the Roman Catholic Church, and desiring that their children be educated in the Birtle School. This declaration was given to me by Mr. Crump, the Presbyterian Missionary on the Reserve, who states that he feels sure that their desire to change is genuine. The Rev. Dr. Cameron, Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, also interviewed the Tanners, and states that so far as he can judge, these people seem sincere in their desire to become Presbyterians.\n\nAlso I am enclosing a declaration which they made in August 1939, stating that they are both Roman Catholics, and desiring to have their children brought up in the Presbyterian faith.\n\nI should have stated that only copies of these declarations are enclosed.\n\nThe Department approved of the discharge of these children from Birtle School in 1939, and later approved of their admission into Sandy Bay School, on account of the wishes of the parents in 1939.\n\nOn this Reserve there is great rivalry between the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic Churches, and the Indians are aware of it and taking advantage of it. There is another case of the same sort pending and no doubt others will crop up, if we allow all these changes. An Indian will have some complaint about the school, and will change his religious views, to have his children moved to another school. I do not know if that is the reason in the Tanner family or not, but I doubt if they were genuine in making both declarations.\n\nThere\nThere are at present eight children in this family, four of whom have attended Sandy Bay School. The others will soon be of school age, so that the decision of the Department regarding this matter will affect these children for many years yet.\n\nI would suggest sending the children who are enrolled as pupils at Sandy Bay School back there to complete their education, and allowing the parents to send the younger children, who have not been to school, to Birtle, if they wish to do so, and make it plain to them that no further transfers will be allowed.\n\nPlease advise me of your decision regarding this matter as soon as possible, as the children will not return to school until then.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Children of Francis Tanner\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th instant and also a declaration made by Francis Tanner and his wife of the Waywayseecappo Band renouncing their adherence to the Roman Catholic Church and desiring that their children be educated at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that everything possible should be done by our officials to discourage the transfer of pupils from one denominational school to another. These transfers have a tendency to interrupt their studies and must result in a great deal of perplexity and confusion to the pupils themselves. The recommendation made by you in the second last paragraph of your communication is perhaps the best arrangement we can make in view of all the circumstances. If you could assure us, however, that there is a day school within easy reach of these people the Department is of the opinion that these children should be discharged from the Sandy Bay School and encouraged to attend a day school. If no day school is available, however, your recommendation that the senior pupils be permitted to complete their education at Sandy Bay and that the younger children be enrolled in due course at Birtle is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G.

She should retain her original number throughout her period of residence and consequently on future returns she should be shown as pupil 0227. Hilda Levasseur is shown on the December return as 0227. On future returns she should be shown as 0231.\n\nThe names of pupils should be entered on the return consecutively according to numbers. This was not done in many cases on the December return and as a result has caused a great deal of unnecessary checking. Please instruct the Principal definitely on this point. The ages of the new pupils are not shown on the December quarter return. This information should be shown on future returns with regard to each pupil in the school.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health should be submitted for Steven Spence, No. 237, and Joe Houle, No. 239.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 15, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G.

Of course, you should point out to the nurse the importance of having all children physically fit before they enter the school, especially in the case of any contagious disease which might adversely affect the health of the other children. Dr. Moore mentioned that there is a Departmental nurse on the reserve and, if desired by the Principal of the Sandy Bay School, she could also be consulted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Waite:\n\nI am coming today for a very delicate question, which I am sure you'll consider with me, and have it placed to Ottawa, Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nLately, the Rev. Father Missionary, after many insistances made, since a year ago, on the part of the Archie Meech's family and himself to become Roman Catholics, has baptized them. Now, Mr. Archie Meech is wishing to have his four children be transferred to this Sandy Bay School... You'll find affidavids under same cover.\n\nMr. George Daniels Pte., insists to have his daughter, Patsy, to be transferred... as the reason of last year doesn't stand anymore, the Principal being changed, we should have our Department to decide.\n\nMr. John Daniels, having his son at the Portage School, insists also to him transferred to this School... being all of them Roman Catholics, they are wishing to have their children to be brought up so.\n\nApplication Forms have been signed by them, but first I would wait to have a reply from our Department before sending them in.\n\nWould you kindly present to our Department Ottawa these cases. I'm sending a copy of this letter to Rev. Father J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., with copies of affidavids.\n\nMany thanks for your great cooperation.\n\nI remain always yours very truly,\n\nFather J. Damire, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lemire in regard to transfers from the United Church school at Portage to the Sandy Bay Residential school. The matter has been taken up with the Principal at Portage and he is definitely against any transfers of this nature.\n\nArchie Meechas, 105 Long Plain was in the office April 9th this year and wished his son Gilbert admitted to Brandon. I spoke about the transfer of his other three boys who are at Portage and he wished them transferred to Brandon also. Transfer was approved by the Department 133-0-10 of June 1st 1943. It would appear that this Indian does not know his own mind and I would recommend that the transfer to Brandon be made.\n\nGeorge Daniels, 191 Long Plain is in the army. His daughter Patsey has been at Portage school since 1936. At the time of her admission she was a baby \u00bd years old, and was admitted because her father could not look after her. The school is in the child's home. A difficulty is experienced in having this child take holidays on the reserve. I feel it would be a hardship on Patsey to have her transferred.\n\nDonald Daniels, 169 Long Plain has a son in school named Donald. He is 11 years of age and has been in school since 1937. He is now 12 years of age.\n\nGeorge Daniels is the son of John, and Mrs. Meechas is a daughter. John Daniels is the Medicine man of the reserve, beats the drum. He has had a grudge against Mr. Jones the previous Principal and appears to be carrying it along towards Mr. McNeill. I would not approve the transfer of any of these pupils but bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The affidavits give the names and ages of all these children.\n\nOn August 5th last, Father Lemire wrote to Indian Agent Waite of the Portage la Prairie agency asking for the transfer of these children, but his request was refused. Father Lemire finds the ruling of Agent Waite all the more unreasonable, as he took four children from his school last September, and transferred them to the Birtle School against Father Lemire's protest. Father Lemire expected these children in September 1942, and as they were not forthcoming he wrote to the Agent to find out why they had not yet arrived. He was then informed that they were sent to the Birtle School at the request of the parents. No objection is taken to the ruling of the Agent in this case, if the wishes of the parents were fully known to him, because, after all, parents have the right to place their children in a school of their own choosing. But if Mr. Waite acceded to the wishes of the parents of the Tanner children, why did he refuse the request of Messrs. Meeches and Daniels?\n\nIf the case is as represented to me by Father Lemire, he certainly has the right to demand that the above children be transferred without delay from the Portage School to his own, as the will of the parents is made very clear in the accompanying affidavits.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Reverend Principal is anxious to take these children in but for some reason the parents will not consent. During our inspection we talked with a number of the better Indians concerning sending their children and I feel sure if the campaign is continued that in time all will attend. These Indians are difficult to handle and for the present I think it would be a mistake to use force. If we could get their consent we would have too their goodwill and that really is most desirable.\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1943.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI am in receipt of Inspector Hamilton's report regarding his inspection of the Sandy Bay Residential School on October 28. It appears that this school has not its full quota of pupils, although there are several children available on the reserve. Mr. Hamilton does not believe it advisable to use force in placing these children in school, but he thinks that if the parents are urged from time to time to send their children they will eventually consent to do so.

I spent several hours on Long Plain Reserve with these people on November 26th and would like to report as follows:\n\nJohn Daniels, Senior, states he was baptized in a Protestant church many years ago, and was married by a Protestant minister. There were seven children all baptized by a Protestant minister and educated in the Birnie Indian School. Six have graduated and only Donald remains. Donald is now being educated in the Portage School about six years. John Daniels states that Father Comeau bothered him for years to turn his children Catholic, but he refused because his wife is Catholic, and he allowed Father Comeau to baptize his children when they were eight years old. He said it didn't make any difference to him whether he was bothered too much. Two years later he applied for religious papers for Donald and gave his religion as Catholic. This application is on file at Ottawa.\n\nDonald stated he did not like Mr. Jones who was sent to Portage. He claims the children were poorly clothed and treated unpleasantly, and that was why he decided to transfer Donald to another school under Mr. McNeill conditions have entirely changed. Donald to remain at Portage. Both John and Donald stated they wanted Donald to remain and finish his education. They claim now to be perfectly satisfied with the Portage School.\n\nLeechas claims he has no religion except the Catholic. His wife was one of the Daniels' girls who attended the Birnie School and was baptized and raised in the Catholic faith. The two girls graduates of the Birnie School went to London School, transferred to Portage School, and then back to the Birnie School. She allowed him to attend the Birnie School and shortly afterwards Donald came to Portage. Donald had the parents sign papers for Donald to attend Portage School and other papers received. Donald stated that some of the forms he forgotten and others he had been back in the Birnie School. Donald because the parents were unable to provide them and because Donald was unable to provide them as positive in the Birnie School.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 2nd ultimo, regarding the Mechas and Daniels children, Inspector Hamilton was requested to investigate the matter thoroughly and, for your information, I quote from a report dated November 29:\n\n\"I acknowledge your letter 126-9-10, dated November 5th, together with the enclosures. I spent several hours on Long Plain Reserve with these people on November 26th and would report as follows:\n\n\"John Daniels Senior states he was baptized in a Protestant church many years ago; and was married by a Protestant preacher. There were seven children, all baptized by a Protestant minister and all educated in the Birtle Indian School. Six children have graduated and only Donald remains. Donald is thirteen and has been in the Portage School about six years. John Daniels stated that Father Comeau bothered him for years to turn Catholic as his wife is Catholic, and he allowed Father Comeau to baptize him about eight years ago. He said it didn't make any difference and he was bothered too much. Two years later he signed the application papers for Donald and gave as his religion \"Protestant\". This application is on file at Ottawa.\n\n\"John stated he did not like Mr. Jones who was principal at Portage. He claims the children were poorly clothed and school life unpleasant, and that was why he decided to transfer Donald. Now John states under Mr. McNeill conditions have entirely changed and he wants Donald to remain at Portage. Both John and his wife stated\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthat they wanted Donald to remain and finish his education at Portage. They claim now to be perfectly satisfied with the Portage School.\n\n\"Archie Meechas claims he has no religion except the Indian religion. His wife was one of the Daniels girls who graduated from the Birtle School and was baptized and raised in the Protestant faith. Meechas has two girls graduates of the Portage School and four children now at Brandon School, transferred from Portage. All the children were baptized by a Protestant minister when quite young. Mrs. Meechas stated that last June Father Lambert urged her to be a Catholic and she allowed him to baptize her. In July he baptized the children and shortly afterwards returned with the application forms and had the parents sign them. I am returning these forms and the other papers received. Both Mr. and Mrs. Meechas requested that these forms be forgotten and stated they would prefer to have the children back in the Portage School. They would prefer Portage to Brandon because the children would be nearer home where they could see them and because they liked the present Principal. Mrs. Meechas was as positive in this as was her husband.\n\n\"George Daniels is now overseas. Patsy has been at the Portage School from which school her dad graduated. Patsy was admitted when she was only two years and three months old and has been in the school for six years. Neither the father nor the grandparents have bothered much about this child until recently. Patsy cannot speak the Indian language. Before her father left he gave the enclosed statement to his father, John Daniels. John states this simply meant that during the summer Patsy was to spend her holidays in their care. They emphatically stated they did not wish to have Patsy transferred to any other school. Patsy is baptized a member of the United Church and her father signed the original application as of Protestant faith.\"\n\nI am returning the various documents which you left with me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A little over a year ago Madeleine was discharged from the hospital and sent to the Sandy Bay Indian School at Marinos, Manitoba \u2014 a clean, happy and well nourished youngster. You can perhaps imagine my surprise and natural indignation when I received this letter from her mother a short time ago.\n\nI know that most Indian children suffer from \"mechanized dandruff\" when they are in groups and I know that all children wear each other's clothes. And, I do wonder if...\nThis school might be quietly investigated? This child especially requires to be well fed and properly looked after\u2014she has a tubercular leg or rather she had\u2014that being the reason for her long hospitalization and surgery. The Federal Government spent a great deal of money on this youngster. It would be a shame not to get a good result! No doubt the child's mother has had a \"run in\" over something with those in authority and thought it might help her. However, I think perhaps you could have it looked into\u2014if you would be so kind. After all, the child is a ward of the government and if she requires help or protection she should get it. When she is through school there, I will give her what assistance I can\u2014to get on with her education.\n\nI have not written to the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie because I felt perhaps the investigation should be done through some other channel and the child and her mother might get into a row over it all which would be too bad.\n\nThanking you in advance for your attention to this matter. Yours very truly\u2014Gertrude A. Johnson\nOttawa,\nNovember 1, 1944.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nOn July 21, 1943, we wrote the former Principal, Reverend J. Lemire, O.M.I., regarding Madeline Beaulieu, who had been confined to the Neepawa General Hospital for a considerable period of time due to a tubercular knee. Our Medical Superintendent thought she could be discharged at that time and felt that it would be in her best interests to place her in a residential school. In a letter dated July 25 Father Lemire stated that he would be glad to receive her. I now enclose, for your information, a letter which has been forwarded to us. This letter was written by the girl's mother, who has remarried, and contains rather serious accusations regarding the care that the girl is receiving. It would be appreciated if you would let me have a report regarding the matters mentioned in the mother's letter and at the same time you should return the letter to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have been unofficially informed that the pupilage of all residential Schools has been increased. May I be advised of the number of pupils now allowed Sandy Bay, Portage la Prairie and Pine Creek Residential Schools.\n\nI also wish to refer to Department letter 126-9-10, dated Ottawa, November 10th 1943 with respect to obtaining pupils on the Sandy Bay Reserve. A little progress has been made, mainly through the efforts of the late Principal, who organized a mens' club on the reserve. This club did splendid work among the Indians and results were very noticeable. I still feel that drastic action, in having the R.C.M.P. police force the parents to have their children attend school, would not lead to best results at this time, and would only stir up a hostile feeling against the school, which has been largely overcome by the efforts of the late Principal.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1944.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, the information regarding the pupilages at certain schools is as follows:\n\nSandy Bay .................. 95\nPortage la Prairie ........ 95\nPine Creek .................. 120\n\nThese are the same pupilages as have been authorized at these schools for several years. However, up to the end of December, 1943, the Department was only paying for 82.84% of the authorized pupilage. In the current year's appropriation funds were provided for the per capita grant required for the authorized pupilage. From one point of view this might be considered an increase, but on the other hand, as stated above, the authorized pupilages which have been in effect for many years have not been increased.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the obtaining of pupils on the Sandy Bay Reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe 126-9-10 November 1-1944\n\nI beg to inform you that all the statements of the said Mrs Willie Whiteford are rather erroneous and grossly exaggerated as you could judge from my investigation.\n\nThe girl, Madeline Beaulieu, came indeed from the Nepean Hospital and decidedly did not put any weight, not on account of lack of care, but by the fault of the girl herself who was so glad of being free from hospital restraint, that she was always on the move in spite of the vigilant watch of the Sisters. She was given special lunch of milk and beaten eggs taken upstairs to the classroom (that are situated here on the top-floor) by the Sister in charge of the Infirmary to avoid unnecessary strain on the sore leg of the sick girl etc...\n\nNow, after Nurse W ilcox herself, who has lived long time in our very house and followed closely the treatment of the children's food is maybe not fancy but certainly better than in any home of the Reserve and very satisfactory to the say of that authority. This is what I am told.\n\nThe story of the clothes kept by the School authority is absolutely false. When the girl went for Holidays she took along a bulky suitcase of the said clothes after promise made by the Mother that they will come back after holidays what she did not do of course because she intends to keep these clothes for the other children she has at home. But the girl's intention is to use these things herself and the Sisters are helping her by enlarging those that are too small. The special ire of the Mother was specially excited when Rev. F. Lemire exacted a letter as proof of the intentions of the donator concerning the destination of the said clothes. The Mother's envy was concerning a kind of eiderdown quite nice and that she wanted on account of the birth she was expecting in her home. The girl was reluctant for giving it by fear of seeing it spoiled, she did not like to tell that herself to her own Mother and she was even at that time averse of receiving the visit of that woman at the parlor to avoid that discussion.\n\nNow you can see from the above details the kind of accusations directed against the School. This of course would have been avoided if the recipient of the letter would have investigated herself from us or if she would have been acquainted with the groundless criticism that often comes from Indians when they are not given according to their boundless fancies;\n\nAs for the last accusation of being lousy, we have to say that we were not called to witness the veracity of that declaration. The children are always given a special care about that matter but the visit of \"lousy\" Indians accompanied often by a numerous progeny that should be in school to be \"deloused\" instead of being...\nallowed to rove at large as they usually do in this Reserve, is very often a source of a new invasion of these vermin that seems to thrive so well on the degenerated specimen of our race.\n\nWe are, of course, ready at any time to have the visit of anybody specially the recipient of the letter written by that Mother who likes better her own interest than the good of her child.\n\nThe matter of lice should not shock you, but permit me to call your attention upon the fact that since the War and its restrictions we would appreciate receiving again some of that wonderful \"Mercuric ointment\", that I am said do so well on the children that are prone to be \"lousy\".\n\nWe thank you very much for your cooperation in that matter in interrogating us about that story.\n\nWe remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. M.de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\n\nPh. Phelan\nChief Training division\nOttawa.\nOct 6th 1944.\n\nDear Miss Gertrude,\n\nI am asking you that when you coming to see Madeleine Beaulieu, you might just as well come as soon as you received my letter as they don't take care of her well she's lousy and thin too. She can't eat what they feed her. The school is nice but they don't care for the children I was at school so I know it, but it's going at the school so I would like you if you could come sooner about her clothes what she had when she was in Nepawa she got lots of clothes and nice and good ones to when they had their vacation on June 26th they didn't let her bring her clothes home. They are stingy of them, it's the nuns and the priest. I went and asked them about her clothes and they didn't give them to me, and when they have party at school the other girls put them on, and this is what I don't like and one thing it would be different if they bought the clothes for her. This is what I don't like, when you come to see please take them all and bring them to me. I could keep them at home for her, and please don't write a letter ahead when you coming you will see her how she dressed when she came home on June she was so lousy, and this is not all I'll tell you more when you come. This is honest no lie or fibs.\nI'm very sorry I put her at school here she was alright at the hospital so please don't write ahead when you coming they might dress her up clean she's not well fed etc.\n\nI guess this is all.\n\nFrom Mrs Miller Whiteford\n\nAnyway you can write to me and I will not tell them\n\nwrite to Mrs Miller Whiteford\n\nAmaranth Man\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Yours 126-9-10 1-11-44\n\nAt the time of filing our mutual correspondence I notice that I forgot to send back to you the Indian Mother's letter.

We have just received a very complete report from the Principal of the Sandy Bay School and I feel I can assure you that the statements made by the girl's mother in her letter to you of October 6 are greatly exaggerated, if not incorrect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Gertrude A.

Today I received the following letter from Mr. Waite:\n\n\"In reply to the above noted letter, I wish to advise that I interviewed the Reverend Principal of the Sandy Bay School, on Saturday, December 9. I was advised at that time that 87 pupils were in attendance at the school at that time and that a number of pupils from the ABB and Flow Reserve had not returned. These pupils would bring the pupilage up to the 95 pupils, together with applications for new admittances.\n\n\"My car is not in shape to make lengthy trips and I am informed that a new car is being shipped. As soon as I receive the new car the matter of the pupils at ABB and Flow will be attended to.\"\n\nYou will note there is now in residence 87 pupils and no doubt Mr. Waite will secure the other eight making a total of 95.\n\nPlease advise the number of grant-earning pupils allowed for the Sandy Bay School.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to the pupilage at the Sandy Bay School, I am informed in a letter today from Inspector Hamilton that on December 9 there were 87 pupils in attendance at the school. At that time a number of pupils had not returned from the Ebb and Flow Reserve, owing to the fact that the Indian Agent's car is in bad shape and it is not possible for him to make a trip to Ebb and Flow at the present time. However, he expects to obtain another car in the near future and he will then proceed to the Ebb and Flow Reserve, if the pupils from that reserve have not yet returned to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant and note that on December 9 there were 87 pupils in attendance at the Sandy Bay Residential School. I also note that as soon as he obtains a new car Indian Agent Waite will visit the Bob and Flow Reserve in connection with returning the children who have not yet come back to the school.

I have been sending my three children to Sandy Bay Residential School because I lived too far (5 miles) from our Ebb and Flow Reserve school for them to walk. Now I have horses and can drive those children to our own school. But I was told by the Agent that I would have to send them to Sandy Bay. Will you please tell me if I can keep my children at home and drive them to our own school each day. For two years now when holiday time came my children were not brought all the way home but were left two miles from home and had to walk. I am not satisfied with the way the children are treated at Sandy Bay and there is plenty of room at our own school if you will give me authority to send them there. Thank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Roderique Levasseur.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.,\n\nI enclose for your information a letter received from R. Lavasseur, with reference to his three children who are in the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nYou will note his reasons for wishing his children discharged.

The request was received at the time of her discharge from the Neepawa General Hospital in 1943. She was enrolled in the Sandy Bay Indian School at Marinos, Manitoba in excellent condition in every way.\n\nThe inference is from the report that the practice of sending the children out with the parents in the summer does not work well in her case. She gets neither care nor enough food and as an old tuberculosis case she needs plenty of both if the money already spent on her is to be gained. I am afraid to say nothing of the child's life\u2014present and future.\n\nCan something be done to see that this child is kept at the school\u2014not sent out with her parents\u2014at any time since they cannot look after her\u2014until she is of an age where I can give her some assistance without interference from her mother?

Our Medical Superintendent thought she could be discharged at that time and felt that it would be in her best interests to place her in a residential school. In a letter dated July 25, Father Lemire stated that he would be glad to receive her.\n\nOn November 1st, 1944, we wrote to Reverend Father de Bretagne, then Principal of the Sandy Bay School, and forwarded to him a letter which we had received. This letter contained complaints that the mother had made to Miss Gertrude Johnson, R.N.\n\nFather de Bretagne replied to us in a letter dated November 7th and gave us a very complete explanation regarding the treatment that this girl was receiving at Sandy Bay School.\n\nI am now in receipt of another letter from Miss Johnson and I enclose a copy of this for your information.\n\nI would like to know if the girl spent her holidays with her parents this year and if so for what length of time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

It is evident that in many cases you are not asking grant which could be allowed. For instance, pupil No. 197, S. Bone, is marked on the return \"Home without reason\" and no grant is requested for him. On the June quarter return grant was requested and allowed for the full quarter, and presumably this boy was in the school until June 30, 1945, and was allowed home on holidays but did not return upon the expiry of his leave. Consequently, in his case, you are entitled to 62 days' grant, namely, the holiday leave. What has been said regarding this boy applies to other pupils on the return. In this connection I would refer you to paragraph 6 of circular letter of December 28, 1944. It is quite evident, in preparing the September quarter return of the Sandy Bay School, that no attention has been paid to that letter.\n\nI enclose another copy of this circular letter and suggest a careful study of it, because it was prepared to assist the Principals of Residential Schools to obtain the grant to which they are rightfully entitled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Hey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Father PLOURDE, Superintendent of the Oblate Indian Welfare and Training Commission, states in a letter which I have just received, that he has asked an increase in the pupilage of this school from 95 to 130.\n\nIf I write you today in this connection, it is simply to let you know that not only do I approve of the step taken by Father PLOURDE, but that I think it is essential for the welfare and training of the Indians of this Reserve. As you may know from the latest statistics, this Reserve has about 150 children of school age, ranging from 7 to 17 in age and of this number, only 42 are at school at the present time. This leaves over two-thirds growing in ignorance and without the benefits of the training received in a Residential School. I think this is unwarranted, in view of the fact that the school can accommodate between 50 to 60 additional pupils.

All form. For instance, pupil No. 0268 is stated on the Quarterly Return to have entered the school on October 5th while on form I.A. 411 it is stated she entered the school on October 17th. There are similar discrepancies in the case of pupils Nos. 0272, 0273, 0274, 0275, 0276 and 0277.\n\nOn the Quarterly Return you show dates for the admission of new pupils subsequent to October 1st, yet in all cases you request 92 days grant. In the case of new pupils, grant is only allowed from the date on which they entered to the end of that particular quarter.\n\nI am inclined to feel you have not read the circular letter of December 29th, 1944, nor reviewed the notes on the preparation of the Quarterly Return as they appear on the last page of the Return.\n\nThe heading on the Return \"Date of Entrance to the School\" means exactly what it says, in other words you should show under this heading the exact date on which the pupil entered the school. This heading does not refer to the date the application was received or the date on which the pupil was formally approved. Either of these dates might be considerably later than the date on which the pupil actually entered the school. It has always been our practice to allow grant from that date on the understanding that the Principal will only accept those whom they consider are eligible and if subsequent facts prove a pupil ineligible for admission it would be necessary to return the pupil but in the meantime the school would have been allowed grant for their maintenance.\n\nI trust that you will make the necessary corrections in the Return to correspond with the above, as these Returns are very carefully scrutinized by the Auditor General and we simply must have them correct and the information appearing on the I.A. All form regarding admissions and discharges of pupils must be exactly the same as that appearing on the Quarterly Return.\n\nTo assist in your finances we are forwarding a part payment of $3,000.00 on the December quarter Earnings and the balance will be paid when you send back the Return completed in the proper manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Circular letter of December 29th, 1944, points out that 30 days are allowed for Hospitalization and therefore the grant for this pupil is 21 plus 30 days allowed, a total of 51 days. It is also suggested that where pupils are absent for a full quarter and are not expected to return, you should apply for their discharge and when granted, their names removed from the return. If the pupil returns to the school, application should be made to the Department for re-admission and when granted the pupil's name again entered on the return, using the same Number and stating in the remarks column of the return, the exact date of re-entering the school.\n\nIt is noted that the Form 411 shows as date of admission, the date the pupil's admission were approved. The information required, is the same date as shown on the return, namely the date the pupil enters school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Jean Lambert, O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res.

However, in the margin you state that each of them was in the school for 90 days.\n\nI do not understand your statement reading: \"A second letter says that date of entrance to the school and the total number of days pupil in residence during quarter could be different\". I am unable to locate the letter to which you refer, and, in any case, \"Date of entrance to school\" is certainly not the same as \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\". These two headings refer to entirely different things.\n\nIf you review the quarterly return, you will note that the heading on the column to which I am referring is \"Date of entrance to school\". This means exactly what it says.

Principal, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Marius, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the June Quarter Return of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I wish to inform you that formal approval for the admission of Eileen Catsgas was sent to Indian Agent J.L. Bryant on 27 February, 1940. In view of the above we made the necessary adjustment on the return by allowing this pupil ninety-one days grant and trust you will allot her a school number in the September Return.\n\nTo simplify the compilation of future returns, I suggest that where pupils are absent from school for a full quarter either through hospitalization, parents keeping the pupil home, etc., that the Department be requested to approve their discharge so that their names may be removed from the return. This would apply to pupil No. 265 Walter McLean who has been attending a school in Winnipeg for the last four quarters. Of course, the discharge of any pupil will only be requested after it has been determined that the child is not expected to return to school for some time. In the event that a child is discharged and at a later date returns to the school, the re-admission of the pupil should be requested from the Department and a notation made in the remarks column of the return opposite the child's name, giving the date of re-admission.\nCare should be taken to allot the pupil the same number as the child had prior to discharge.\n\nBernard F.

Smith, Indian Agent,\nBIRTLE, Manitoba.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the Bone children. Our records show that five of these children were regularly admitted to the Sandy Bay Residential School and attended that school until June 30, 1945. We have no record of Isabelle Violet Bone being enrolled at Sandy Bay. Cathrine Bone is shown on the June quarter return of the Sandy Bay School as pupil No. 9269.\n\nThe Principal of the Birtle Residential school had no right to accept the five children who had been attending the Sandy Bay School. If there was a bona fide change of religion on the part of the parents, this matter should have been brought to our attention and our decision given before accepting them at Birtle.\n\nYou should inform the Principal that these children should be returned to the Sandy Bay School from which they have not been discharged. They were simply allowed home for the summer holidays on the distinct understanding that they would return to the school upon the expiry of their leave.\n\nI feel certain that the Principal of the Birtle Residential School will promptly carry out the instructions contained in this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 1 October 1946.\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nWe have received your telegram of the 26th ultimo with reference to the Bone children. We have also received a lengthy report from Indian Agent Smith.\n\nInstructions are being sent to Mr. Smith to inform the Principal of the Birtle School that the five Bone children enrolled in your school and in attendance at your school on June 30th, should be returned to the Sandy Bay School.\n\nWe are advised that some of the Indians of Riding Mountain Reserve have a grievance against Sandy Bay School. We are informed that last January Marie Bone who was a pupil at Sandy Bay School, and is the daughter of Angus Bone, was sent to hospital in Portage la Prairie. In March, she was transferred to Dynever Hospital and the parents claim that they were not advised of the girl being sent to Portage la Prairie or her transfer to Dynever until she had reached the latter hospital and the doctor in charge advised Indian Agent Smith.\n\nI would like your comments on the above statement. I think you will agree with me that it is most important for a Principal of a Residential School to notify the parents immediately any child is so seriously ill that it is found necessary to send her to hospital. Such information of course should also be given to the parents in the case of serious illness of a pupil who is being treated at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

At the time she was taken to Portage la Prairie hospital, Marie's condition was not thought so serious as to need a long stay in the hospital. In fact we did not think she would return shortly to school. However a letter was sent to her parents informing them that she was in Portage hospital. It appears that this letter was not received by Marie's Parents, but I am certain that I did send them a letter informing them that Marie was in Portage hospital. I was informed of Marie's transfer to Dynevor hospital by Doctor Campbell supervisor of this hospital after she had arrived there. I visited Marie at Dynevor hospital and she complained that she had received no letter from her parents. I gathered from this that they likewise had not been advised of her transfer. I also told me that she had written her parents but had received no answer to her letters. Returning to my school, I wrote to George Bone Marie's older brother, an ex-pupil of this school, whom I knew could read and write, and I told him of his sisters condition. I asked him to make sure that his parents be told of Marie's conditions. I also asked him to write to his sister. However I do not know if George received my letter or whether he told his parents.\n\nDuring the summer holidays I was absent from the school to attend a summer course in Quebec. Before leaving however I asked Doctor Campbell to keep my assistant at Sandy Bay and Indian Agent Smith informed of Marie's condition, and again from Quebec I wrote to Doctor Campbell asking the same. Two letters were received in reply to my request. Indications on these letters led my assistant to believe that the same information was being sent to Mr Smith so no further steps were taken.\n\nHoping that these details furnish the information you need on this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFr. Jean Lambert, C.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSandy Bay Indian School.\nMarius. P.O. Man. 30/9/46.\n\nMr J.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Mr Waite,\n\nRodrigue Fish and Rodrigue Manigens, both of Ebb & Flow are anxious to have their children transferred to the day school at Ebb & Flow. I have no objections to the transfer, if you deem it wise. I leave the matter to your judgment. However, may I submit a few observations which may assist you in judging the case: The teacher at the Ebb & Flow school told me recently that the school room cannot accommodate any more pupils, it is full as it is now with the present pupils in attendance.\n\nJim Manigens 214, Rodrigue Manigens's boy, lives right near the school as you know, and could easily attend daily. Jim is now quite a big boy, and, as we have found out at this school may give the teacher some trouble.\n\nAs for the two little Fish (Levasseur girls; Hilda 0231 & Elsie 0260), they live some five miles from school and are quite delicate as to health. While they were at School here we gave them special care; although their father may have contrary observations concerning this, especially on account of his son Paul 203 who is still in St Vital. I found that the little girls have lost considerable weight during the holidays and personally I doubt very much that they be able to attend the day school regularly. It would perhaps be wiser for them to return to Sandy Bay, because of the distance from the day school and the girls' state of health, but as I have already stated, I wish to leave the matter with you. Their father seems to have an abiding fear, because of his son's long stay in St-Vital, and no length of reasoning will dispel this, and for this reason I prefer to leave Rodrigue entirely free.\n\nThe children present at Sandy Bay School now, have in the month since their arrival, gained from one to thirteen pounds.\nInstruction were given to Mr Smith and Birtle principal to have the Bone children of Elphinstone returned to this school. This information was received in a letter from Mr Philip Phelan, and we transmit it to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFather Jean Lambert, OMI.\nPrincipal.\nPortage la Prairie\nManitoba\n\n24th October 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report received from the Revd. Father Principal, Sandy Bay Reserve, Residential School, which is self explanatory.\n\nWill you please advise regarding the matters contained therein.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 31 October 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing a letter received from the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School, it is considered that Jim Manigens should be discharged from the Sandy Bay School on the understanding that he will attend the Ebb and Flow Day School.\n\nIn view of the Principal's report regarding the two Fish (Levasseur) girls numbered 0231 and 0260, we feel that it would be in the best interests of these girls to remain in the Sandy Bay School. It would be advisable to warn the Principal that he should have these girls regularly examined by the School Physician so as to check any incipient disease.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nOct. 8, 1946\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: M.

Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, it is requested that you bring to the Principal's attention the following discrepancies:\n\n1. New pupils application for admission are dated 26th September, 1946 and their admission to school was approved in Departmental letter dated October 15, 1946, but on the December Return and Form #411 under the column headed \"Date of Entrance to School\" the date 15th October, 1946 is used and ninety-two days grant is requested. It is presumed that the date of official approval was used on the Return and that the children were actually in school for the full quarter and we have, therefore, made the correction thus allowing a full ninety-two days grant for the new pupils. As Quarterly Returns are closely scrutinized by the Auditors Branch errors of this kind are found. It is pointed out that the date the child enters the school should be shown in the \"Date of Entrance\" column on the return and not the date approval was given. Of course, no pupils should be admitted to the school unless the Principal and yourself are completely satisfied that they will meet the application for admission standards of the Department.\n2. Pupils # 0295 and 0296 who were shown on the return should also have been included on the list. The application forms for these children, however, were dated December 4th and only twenty-eight days grant is being allowed.\n\nThe discharge of pupil # 186 is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSandy Bay Indian School,\nMarius P.O. Man.\nJan. 23, 1947.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMr. Smith, the Indian Agent at Birtle, Man. has informed me, upon my enquiry, that he has not as yet received from Ottawa, any definite instructions concerning the Bone children, other than that they return to school. We are under the impression that by \"return to school\" your office means Sandy Bay School where these children are enrolled; since you have already instructed that they leave Birtle School.\n\nThese children show by their letters that they would like to return to school here. However we are unable to state their parents attitude at present.\n\nKindly inform us as to your instructions concerning these children.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay School.\nOttawa, February 1, 1947.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nSome Children - Attendance at\nSandy Bay Residential School\n\nWe have received a copy of the attached letter from the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School. It is self-explanatory but we would request that you enquire into the parents' attitude at the present time towards the return of their children to the Sandy Bay School.\n\nYour recent letter concerning these children received consideration at the Department but has apparently been removed from the file and we have been unable to trace it during the last few days. It would be appreciated if another copy of this letter could be forwarded at your convenience.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter No.106-1-10 (WT), of 5th inst., regarding the Bone children from the Riding Mountain Reserve at Elphinstone, who were admitted to Birtle School without authority, while still enrolled as pupils at the Sandy Bay School. The children are now at home.\n\nI have now interviewed the parties concerned and have obtained all the information I could about their religious belief.\n\nFirst I will deal with the family of Jonathan Bone.\n\nJonathan was baptized in the Presbyterian faith, and his parents were Presbyterians. His wife, Marie, was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. Jonathan never attended school, but his wife was a pupil at Pine Creek School. They were married by a Presbyterian minister. They have four children living, Michael, Ronald, Jean and Josephine, and as babies they were all baptized as Roman Catholics. The parents do not know the baptismal dates, but they are likely on record at the Sandy Bay School. Ronald, Jean and Josephine were all baptized by the Presbyterian minister at Elphinstone on September 5th of this year.\n\nRegarding the family of Angus Bone. Angus was baptized as a Presbyterian, as his parents belonged to that faith. He attended Regina Indian School. His wife, Rose, was baptized Roman Catholic. They were married by a...\n... married by a Roman Catholic Priest. The children of this marriage were baptized when babies as Roman Catholics. Catherine was baptized by the Presbyterian minister in Elphinstone on September 5th, this year.\n\nThomas Bone was baptized Presbyterian and his parents were Presbyterians. He attended Birtle School. His wife, Susette, was baptized Roman Catholic, and attended the white school in Elphinstone as she is a halfbreed. They were married by a Presbyterian minister and later on by a Roman Catholic Priest. The children by this marriage were all baptized Roman Catholics as babies, and Marrillia and Isobel were baptized by the Presbyterian minister on September 5th, 1946. Marrillia was also baptized by a Presbyterian minister on June 16th, 1935.\n\nI have no copy on file of the application for admission to Sandy Bay School for Ronald Bone.\n\nThe applications for admission to Sandy Bay School for Catherine Bone is dated September 30th, 1945; it is signed by the father, Angus Bone, and the religion given was Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Principal of the Birtle Indian School does not know these families, and the Missionary who was there when the children were admitted to Sandy Bay School, is now gone, so I cannot say why the Presbyterians did not complain at that time.\n\nI have known these families for eleven years and have always considered them to be recognized Roman Catholics.\n\nSgd. A.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nBirtle Manitoba\n10th February 1947\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nI have received your letter No.126-9-10 (W T),\nof February 1st regarding the Bone children on Riding\nMountain Reserve. As requested I am enclosing a copy of my\nletter of December 23rd on the same subject.\n\nLast week I was on the Riding Mountain Reserve,\nand saw Jonathan and Thomas Bone. Owing to blizzard\nconditions I was unable to get to Angus Bone's.\n\nJonathan Bone is willing to send his children to\neither Sandy Bay or Birtle school as directed by the\nDepartment. He would rather send them to Birtle School\nas it is much nearer to the Reserve, and therefore less\nexpensive to get to in case the children get ill.\n\nThomas Bone is quite willing to send them back to\nSandy Bay School.\n\nI have no doubt that Angus Bone will also obey\ndirections.\n\nFather Lambert is mistaken in stating that I had\nreceived instructions that these children were to return\nto school.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 22nd, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th inst., it is considered that the Bone children should return to the Sandy Bay Residential School and the Department would appreciate it if you would make the necessary arrangements.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith applications for the admission of the undermentioned pupils to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School:\n\nAllan Roulette #181\nWilliam George Roulette #181\n\nI beg to recommend that the applications be approved.\n\nIndian Agent\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sandy Bay Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: William George Roulette\nEnglish name: William George Roulette\nAge: 8 years old (Dec. 24th, 1946)\nName of Band: Sandy Bay\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 181\nFather's full name and No.: Michel Roulette No. 181\nMother's full name and No.: Angelina Roulette No. 181\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?
