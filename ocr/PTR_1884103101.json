Oram. There was upwards of seventy present. The chair was occupied by President of the Society, Mr. Angus Cameron. The speakers were Mr. Andrew Spencer, Vice-President; Mr. James Miller, Sr., 2nd Vice-President. The party at dinner included the following gentlemen: Capt. J. H. Macdonald, Capt. W. McCallum, Capt. Henry, J. Macdonald, P. Atkinson, R. Gwynne, J. Macdonald, J. Milner, J. Macdonald, T. Macdonald, W. Newton, C. Adams, Mr. Macdonald, Mr. Wm. Niven, G. C. Macdonald, Mr. Shipton, R. Fisher, Mr. Macdonald, Mr. Macdonald.\n\nAfter dinner the President proposed the toast of \"The Prince of Wales,\" which was duly honoured.\n\nThe Chairman then gave \"The Prince of Wales, Prince of Wales, and other members of the Royal Family,\" which met with loud and repeated cheers.\n\nThe toast next from the chair was that of the \"Government,\" which was received with the utmost enthusiasm.\n\nIn a few brief but eloquent remarks the Chairman said (addressing Capt. Macdonald), who had most cheerfully said\u2014\n\nMr. Cameron, speakers and guests, your President has asked me not to give you my ideas on the financial state of the Lorne Agricultural Society, but knowing how little I am conversant with the subject, I am unprepared to go into the subject, but have no doubt all the information required will be given by the Secretary of the Society, Mr. Adams. The farmers are those whom we have to look to as the country grows, as prices advance, and they do all the work on the land of this district. I was very pleased to see the exhibits of house making and dairy products displayed at the exhibition, for it convinced me that bacon, cheese, and butter can be made here equal to, if not superior to, any produced in the territories. Butter, which was shown by many entries, will always command a market price, and if the prices of wheat were very fine, I could find a ready sale, and if cheese was sold here cheaper than it could be bought, there would be no doubt that money would remain with us. The corn was always great demand in the country and abroad. No wonder our farmers have been buying corn during the past in importing bacon, and thus have been able to keep it in the country, if not raising more, and turn more to pork than they had done, and we all look forward to day our machines take care of the work formerly done by hand. I have heard that an oatmeal mill is to be started here soon, although it is an expensive proposition to start such a large scale. Good oats can be grown here and the farmers could prove that wheat can be grown here, and if they could get elsewhere. From my own experience I have found wheat growing 68 and 69 bushels per acre, and I question if there is any place to compete with it in a wheat growing province. Three years ago I was through the large farms of Minnesota, and found the wheat raised by the Manitobans newspapers said some time ago that their wheat although former, very good for flour, but the farmers thought they have a loss in flour made, it is a partial loss, which was much better than losing the wheat crop. The wheat is a good one for feeding cattle, new stock are coming in, and I have no doubt that, bright days are in store for us. They have sent me some samples of wheat, but this was the Society's first show, and we have had a very bad year, these countries had a very hard winter, and being down, ours would have its day of coming up, and that at no distant date.\n\nNow that the question is an object to view, I will give next year four prizes for house making structures. Bacon, first prize $5; second prize $3; third prize $2; fourth prize $1. In conclusion the gentleman proposed the toast of \"The President and other leaders of the society.\"\n\nMr. Miller on behalf of the office bearers responded to the toast and said it was very late, and we must not delay, but on the whole he thought the show very good showing the best pastures conditions. The specimens of beef cattle were very fair for this place, and there was certainly a good display of sheep. The crops were generally put into consideration, were better than hear many others expected. The crop this year is likely to prove a total failure.\n\nCanada Pacific R'y.

The hard-riding centre of gravity against the exhibition of the Society, still the directors, and especially the secretary, Mr. C. Adamson did their best gratuitously, and they collected many exhibitors who would not have been entered, and for the systematic and orderly proceedings of the day were conducted.\n\nAfter the formal opening of the show by the Hon. Mr. Angus Macdonald; His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. L. Clarke, and Mr. Macdonald. The judges afterwards visited each class of contest.\n\nAdmirers were shown by Capt. Adamson, Mr. J. Thomson, Mr. Wm. Plaxton, Mr. T. Scott, Mr. D. Brough, Mr. C. McKay, and Mr. T. Smith.\n\nThe thoroughbred, fat, working, and grade cattle were excellent examples and showed great merit. The district is to be congratulated.\n\nSheep were well represented, a special premium being awarded.\n\nThe show of pigs created great interest among the public during the day. The first prizes for Berkshire sows were won by Mr. A. Cameron, followed by Mr. E. Macdonald, who took second prize.\n\nMr. Dilworth carried off the two first prizes for horses, with his fine stallion and old mare. Mr. Spicer's stallion and mare also received first prize. The show was closed by Mr. C. McKay's showy team taking the place of first for native ponies. All together various classes of horses were well represented.\n\nIn the home manufacture the bacon found its shades of quality and style in between the first and third prizes were awarded to Mr. Cameron, who was placed the first prize for the same reasons. He took second prize for the quality of the bacon and the first. The whole ran very well with bacon of prime quality, and the judges thought it would be a good day for the judge's dinner.\n\nThere was no horse was badly handled, though there was a great deal of talent in the show. The animal won by Mr. J. Macdonald, will be well remembered by the many spectators who came to see him win.\n\nAgricultural productions were well presented potatoes originally being very fine, but not all equally used was shown by Mr. Dilworth.\n\nIn domestic manufacture Capt. Henry took the first prize in stockings and mitts, which he had given away. Captain Henry has won the last two years in solid profit, if he sticks in the knitting pa. Miss E. Fonda had shown some beautiful work, which she had won a special prize given by Mr. Duch.\n\nThe show was well attended, and the profits that would be left over after expenses made the day. The Hon. L. Clarke with his usual generosity contributed $5.00 on last year's contestant Mr. Roman Catholic Education to take stock, and Capt. Henry so generously granted a field holiday. The proceedings were brought together in a close and interesting manner, which will appear in another column. The following was the prize list.\n\n| Class | Description                              | Prize |\n|-------|------------------------------------------|-------|\n| 1st   | W.
