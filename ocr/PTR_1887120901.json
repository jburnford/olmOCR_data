A new assessment was made, and the property assessed was placed upon the property by the Assessor. In the appeal of Thomas Taylor, the charge against him was that the assessed portion included 10 acres on the roll, at which he had been assessed. The charge was also changed from $42 an acre to $40.\n\nIn Hughes' appeal the charge is similar, but the property assessed is different, the property lying aside to the north.\n\nA plot marked on the plan \"Reserved\" contains about 30 acres, and assessed at $40 an acre, whereas the land assessed is only about 10 acres, and assessed at $40 an acre.\n\nThe plot was placed at $600 which does not materially alter the value of the property, but the charge against Hughes was dismissed.\n\nIn the case of W. V. Maclean the total assessment was $1,000, partly caused by the assessment of two lots being taken off, they not belonging to him. The principal part of his appeal was dismissed.\n\nThe appeals of John Macdonald and Lyman Macdonald were dismissed.\n\nIn the appeal of the Rev. Louis Colliers as to the C. C. property the judge held that the C. C. property was exempt under the act of the legislature before the assessment.\n\nIn the appeal of Thomas McKay, no change was made in the value of his property. His assessment was ordered to be reduced to $1,000, and he has agreed to pay the amount of the assessment for sale of same lot. He was also assessed at $11 acres which he did not own, but his assessment was reduced accordingly.\n\nClosing business\u2014See Mrs. J. A.

W., Nov. 27.\u2014The exciting battle for the championship of the world between Hanlan of Toronto and Beck of Australia, was rowed to a close on the Nepean River. Beck won by a single stroke. He started well, took the start and held it to the finish. Hanlan showed a great race and pressed Beck closely until the last stroke. The race was very exciting and was witnessed by thousands of spectators, who held their breath during the contest.\n\nTELEGRAMS CAN BE SENT HERE.\n\nNew York, Nov. 27.\u2014Oscar Hammerstein says that Hanlan's defeat does not affect his claim as the Australian national boxer. He says that in Hanlan's opinion Teerman could defeat Beck in Australia or any where else. Hammerstein says Hanlan's defeat is due to a young man, and the present trip will net him over $5,000, notwithstanding his defeat.\n\nTeerman said to a reporter before the race, \"I may announce that I will go to Australia next year for a championship fight. I am sure that I can win any number of square races for next spring and I think another match will be arranged.\"\n\nCATTLE NUISANCE.\n\nSir,\u2014It is the duty of the Mayor or any one of our Councillors to enforce the laws of the city, and there is nothing more important than the protection of the citizens from the depredations of cattle.

E. Forgett, President of the Board of Trade, expressing regret at the death of Mr. James Murray, Secretary of the Board of Trade, and extending sympathy to his family.\n\nREPORTS.\n\nThe Treasurer's and License Inspector's reports for November were read and approved.\n\nThe matter of fire protection was discussed at length. It was thought desirable to get the fire company organized and fairly equipped. A fireman's hall was spoken of and would be a move in the right direction.\n\nThe Fire, Health and Street Inspector for a time occupied a back seat but finally proceeded toward before the Civic Chamber and gave an account of his stewardship.\n\nThe following matters were ordered to be paid\u2014J. H. Robertson, $24; M. McLaughlin, $17; W. Downie, $36; Isaac Brown, $15.\n\nThe Ladies' Auxiliary Society was granted the use of the Council Chamber for payment of a sum of money to cover the expenses of the last night's entertainment.\n\nA by-law to prevent persons from the fire who have not paid their taxes was passed and ordered to be engrossed.\n\nA motion was presented to the collector to proceed forthwith and have collection certificates issued by the time specified for the next Ordinance meeting.\n\nThe Saskatoon Directory, which is being prepared by Mr. H. E. McPhail, received a very favorable consideration by the Council.\n\nA by-law of very great length, regulating the proceedings of the Council, Committee and Officers, received its second reading.\n\nThe Council then adjourned to meet on Wednesday, 14th inst., at 7 p.m.\n\nST. ANDREW'S FESTIVAL.\n\nSt. Andrew's Day was duly remembered in Prince Albert by the members of the Society and other friends, by a dinner and ball.\n\nThe dinner took place at the Queen's Hotel and was all that could be desired. The speeches were temperate and delivered by most host Oran, and reflected great credit upon him as a custos to the wants and desires of the guests.\n\nAt 7 p.m. sharp the officers elected for the present term assembled in the dining room, where a large number of guests were present. The following president, Lieut. Col. Sproul. After this pleasant duty was performed the new officers were sworn into office and the old ones were present, repaired to the dining room, where a large number of guests were present. The following officers were elected: Lieut. Col. Sproul, and on his right were seated Mr. Barlow, Honorary Registrar, and Mr. Robert Reid, D. L. S. O., and Mr. Mayne McKay and Mr. John Stewart, President of the Society. The First Vice-Chairman was Mr. J. B. Sanderson, and the Second by Mr. J. Sanderson.\n\nAfter all had feasted upon the luxuries the Council presented \"Queen and Country,\" each guest was invited to rise in the usual royal manner. The Lord-Governor was next proposed and seconded by Mr. J. B. Sanderson, and a song in his usual manner was . The Army and Navy was next proposed and brought Mr. McNair and Sergt. Major Scott to their feet. Messrs. J. E. Johnson and R. H. Thomas rose and spoke an excellent song and were loudly applauded. President Stewart then read letters from His Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant, Mr. Wm. Gordon, and Mr. J. B. Sanderson. From the 1st Vice-Chairman the following toast was proposed: \"To Beauty,\" to which Mr. P. M. Barker replied in a very pleasing manner. The \"Learned\" gentlemen complied with the wishes of President Stewart and presented Mr. G. Brown and was received with obeisance.\n\nThe mayor of the city present, then proceeded to the chair, which was in the residence of Senator Hughes. There present were Billy Simpson present, who dropped the light fantastic till the wax was burned.\n\nThis was the third official assembly of the St. Andrew's Society in this place, and fire that which preceded it was a grand success.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nQuite a few and new was made against the Council of 1868-69 not providing the town with such kind of fire protection. The question was fairly discussed, and it could without a large expenditure of money. Since the Council has gone to work and has been doing a good appearance, what are these people doing? Special meetings have been called by the Fire Brigade, Fire Brigade, and almost without a response.\n\nThe question now is going who should take an interest in the establishing and maintaining of efficient Fire Brigade. Undoubtedly there are many carrying on businesses and all who own owners of buildings, yet it is a fact, that hardly a band of firemen could be assembled at the call of the Chief.\n\nOur Council are very liberal to the extent of the aid given to the Fire Brigade, and they have been very generous in aid of flight and wood. Yet no inducement is made towards the payment of the Fire Brigade. It is not necessary to place arguments before the people of any town, but a fire brigade is a necessary and probably small expense. It is to be hoped that the citizens will take an interest in the protection of the town from fire. It may be said that the citizens have been very liberal in providing the apparatus, but we do give very much credit to the citizens of this town for the establishment of a good fire brigade. We feel that the citizens of this town will be interested in the protection of the town from fire.
