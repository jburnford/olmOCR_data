Wood, of Winnipeg, Dominion Agent for Australia. This gentleman, in furtherance of the object of the Dominion Government, issued a trade letter to the merchants and manufacturers of Canada, in which he stated: (1) the extent and value of trade with Australia; (2) the portion of the same done by Great Britain, the United States and Canada; (3) the articles of our produce and manufactures in which we may expect to be successful; and (4) the establishment of a Canadian agency in Australia, for the purpose of facilitating our trade and commerce with that country. He also visited the Maritime Provinces and worked westward, calling at all the trade centers, placed the matter before the merchants and manufacturers, asking their co-operation. When he had completed his rounds he will proceed to Canada and offer special and similar services in the different cities, in the former to keep all information about Canada it may be possible to supply, and in the latter to keep samples of such Canadian produce, as may be adapted to the country's great lists, the same in Canada, with such information as to freight and insurance as may be necessary to give the purchaser delivered prices. Samples will be the property of the consignees subject only to the charges for freight and insurance which may have been paid by the Government. Consignments for sale will not be accepted by Mr. Wood, but he will be happy to give such advice as may be considered as to responsible and satisfactory firms to whom consignments may be made.\n\nBut what is the amount of trade done by the United States and Great Britain with Australia, and whether we are warranted in endeavoring to open trade relations with the latter? In the fiscal year of 1884-5 the United States exported to Australia the value of $19,531,188, and imported from the value of $2,825,283. Great Britain exported to Australia to the value of $24,316,500 sterling or $37,156 pounds. In British goods, wool, sheep and lambs costed for $10,346,546, and wheat for $4,250,000 sterling.\n\nWhile Canada, in the year 1884-5, exported to Australia the value of $1,000,000 worth of goods, all of which Canada is able to supply. Besides she will be able to supply considerable of the staple at present carried on with Australia by Great Britain.\n\nThis was when the impression prevailed that Australia was a country with which Canada could hope to establish trade relations, but with the completion of the C. P. R., things have changed, and we are placed in a position to become a very formidable rival to the United States in the trade of one of our sister colonies in the Southern Seas. It only requires the exercise of the same energy which has characterized Canadians of late years to secure the market of the ten millions now yearly withdrawn from Australia by the U.S., and leave them out last year's portion.\n\nSTRANGE.\n\nMajor General Strange, in a letter to Le Prestre, Montreal, calls attention to the injustice done the 65th Battalion (Montreal's Own St. George's) and the Alberta Rifles, as stated in the report of the Minister of Militia. He also refers to the fact that the rank and title of Major General commandant of militia by His Excellency was also suppressed as part of an official report. Some one in authority is to blame for this, and it is to be hoped, in justice to the Major General himself, that the burden of this iniquity will be placed where it should be. Through the troops under Major General Strange's command did less fighting than their comrades in arms under Middleton; they did a good deal of hard marching, and were not wanting in courage when fighting was to be done, and it is not to the credit of those in authority that after doing their duty they should be treated differently from others. There is a nugget in here for some sound.\n\nAll communications between Korea and Bulgaria has been stifled. The provincial governments have been strengthened, and Prince Alexander again assumed the reins of government. The provincial government has been offered for the Canadian Pacific, and the rate of interest is said to be an increase of $100,000 over the same period last year.\n\nMontreal Star is used for $10,000 damages by Mathias C. Smith for accusing him of cruel treatment of his wife. The Star has been sued for $10,000 by Mr. Cardigan, proprietor of the Commercial Grain and Stock Exchange.\n\nTHE WEEKLY SUN!\n\nArrangements are being made by the publishers of THE MANITOBA SUN for the publication of a Weekly Edition at an early date.

This is a question raised by a statesman who has not changed his opinions, and whose many men supported to-day what they opposed yesterday. These are public men bring who have scarcely uttered two opposite opinions on a subject, and who have never varied their first opinions were. But we are not talking of those men. Their day is gone. We are talking of progressive individuals. Inconsistency of opinion does not mean inconsistency, since it may be the result of imperfect knowledge.\n\nOur forefathers, before the days of candles, is no reason why we should believe that they believed the earth to be flat. We believe that the earth is round when our own observation prove it to be round. There was a time, and not very long ago, when the Jews were despised as the right of citizenship in England through fear and prejudice, but that time has passed, and the Jewish question is now one of the most important questions of modern times. We live to learn. The past cannot be changed, but we can change by it. We must guard against the evil. This is the wisest men make of it. Yes, men change, old prejudices perish, false theories are exploded, and men are free to think and act without restraint, they have for the liberties of their neighbours the closest of human ties drawn together and there are none, of course, who cling to old theories\u2014who do so speak, light them up with new ideas, and make them burn with new light. Twenty years ago Sir John Macdonald held views different from those he holds today. Sir John Macdonald has turned a complete right about during his public career as a very important question, and who he hold to be his friend. Undoubtedly, Sir John Macdonald has been the gaining. The man who aims at the accomplishment of great for the good of mankind, must be prepared for clearing himself open to the charge of inconsistency from danger which is reason enough for the greatest Christian\u2014Christian\u2014from the persecutor to the persecuted\u2014he was, no doubt, charged with inconsistency, but his own conscience told him he was doing right. His when is a man innocent, he will tell you. When he gets into trouble, he will tell you, the point is that he is innocent, and when he returns to follow his conscience, he will be innocent.\n\nWe shall see that the public men of Canada and other countries, for fear of leaving himself open to the charge of inconsistency, will not allow his own conscience, swallow his own convictions, and live his own principles.\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of Advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo.

I am not only surprised and pleased at your expressions of kindness, but am so full of enthusiasm at this kind and unusual mark of esteem and grateful affection that I find myself quite overcome. I desire to assure you that Mrs. Belanger and myself are grateful for the occasion. Although our union has been a happy and substantial one, and the company which we serve, my individual shortcomings may be felt to some extent, but the greatest regret that I feel is from the expenses of the case only, not from the heart. Unfortunately, Mrs. Belanger and myself have been obliged to contribute our share to the expenses of the marriage, and although we have been able to save a little money, it is not sufficient to cover all our expenses. We are grateful for your kindness and consideration, and shall ever remember your kindness and consideration.\n\nBelanger.\n\nROYAL BAKING POWDER\n\nAbsolutely Pure.\n\nDupont's Celebrated Ducking Powder.\n\nLoaded Shells always on hand.\n\nJ.
