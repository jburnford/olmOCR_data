F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nEarly in April, 1948, you advised me that the following funds are provided in your estimates, 1948-49, for the above-named school:\n\n- New roothouse and painting and repairs to staff rooms and residence $3,000.00\n- Refrigeration equipment $850.00\n\nI have just received word from this school that they are worried about the roothouse as your local Agent informs them that he has not yet received any authority for this work. I can assure you, from personal inspection, that the present structure is not only useless but is unsafe for anyone to enter. As the school has 1\u00bd acres of potatoes planted, in addition to other vegetables, it is of great importance that the roothouse be rebuilt before the crops are harvested and it is requested, therefore, that your Agent be given authority to proceed with the work of rebuilding as early as possible.\n\nThe report from the school also contains the following:\n\n\"There are several small repair jobs around the school which really should be attended to while the children are away; for example, some tables in the children's dining room need bracing and a few extra tacks and a coat of paint. Some places in the lower part of the dining room walls need patching with plaster and the whole lower half painting. The washrooms require repairing, the kitchen also should have a coat of paint on the lower part and the floors of the halls and stairs around the battleship linoleum need stain varnishing, etc., etc.\"\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 8)\nIt is requested that your Agent be authorized to have these minor repairs and painting carried out during the holiday period this summer. It is not very desirable to have wet paint around while small children are in residence if this can be avoided by carrying out the work when they are away.\n\nMay I be advised as early as convenient as to what you can do in regard to the above services.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nJuly 22, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. Anthony McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 3rd and our replies of July 12th and 14th.\n\nWe have reviewed your letter and authority is given for an expenditure not exceeding $450.00 in repairing the root house at this school.\n\nYou may arrange to have this work done at once. If you require an accountable advance for labour, please let me know.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nPainting of Barn\nSt. Cyprian's Indian Residential School\nBrocket, Alberta\n\nIn 1947 you provided a very good new barn at the above school.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nI hereby agree to build a 16 x 32 Root House, 6 ft deep, with concrete walls all around, dirt floor, ceiling & peak roof with cedar shingles insulated between ceiling & roof, with straw or shavings with ventilators, double doors into Root House, & all the labor & excavating for the sum of Six Hundred Dollars, all work to be done in a workmanlike manner.\n\nO Plaufford\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th inst File 763-5 (El) re Voucher No 74 issued in favor of the Peigan Indian agency Trust A/c.\n\nI regret that this account for lumber was paid at this end but as Mr Playford agreed to build the root House for the sum mentioned $600.00, and he brought to this Office the items he wished to pay and presented the accounts made out to him I paid them from the sum of $600.00 sent forward for a accountable cheque.\n\nAs Mr Playford kept his accounts and he is now at the C.Y. it will take me a little time to get this account from him; however I am enclosing the contract made by Playfor re the Building of this Root House, and if further accounts are necessary and I am advised I will get a duplicate copy for your files.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\n26th February, 1949.\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to your Voucher No. 74. It is noted that you will obtain the account from Mr. Playford as soon as possible.\n\nPlease note that this account must reach us before the end of March.\n\nMay I also point out that you have no authority to enter into a contract without the Department's approval. In this particular instance, the contract was over $500.00 and we have to have the Minister's approval before we can accept such a contract. I point this out for your future guidance, and would also refer you again to the second paragraph of my letter of 9th February, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 4, 1949.\n\nMr. P. Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe following quotation is from the letter I showed you this morning while visiting your office. You asked that a copy be sent you. I shall write Mr. Oathcart and try to find out from him who authorized the work for which Mr. Harold Lunn of Pincher Creek, Alta., is charging the school $40.00.\n\n\"The enclosed statement has been sent to me by the party who has written the note at the bottom\u2014Mr. H. Lunn. It was for work done just before the freeze-up, on the root cellar and had to be done to complete the job of building the same and preparing it for the winter storage of vegetables. Although before my arrival here it seems to me that it comes under the Dept. of Indian Affairs and should be met by them but Mr. McKillan, the Agent has refused to pay the amount, claiming that we should foot some of the cost, seeing that we had such a big crop of grain, which is an argument he always falls back on. He is also claiming that we have used up the amount for the School because of the unexpected emergencies that arose through the year such as a new water heater the last month which had to be replaced owing to the former one playing out from old age. I grant you there has been a lot of work done here over the past year or so, thus I am forwarding the account to the Office for your consideration and have assured Mr. Lunn that he will not be delayed much longer in his payment as he has already waited a considerable length of time.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC: MMA  \nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 8)\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr Neary,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ult File 763-5 (E) in regard to the purchase of a hot water storage tank for the St Cyprians Residential School at the cost of $485.00.\n\nThe price on this at the time of order was estimated around $400.00, but when the plumber visited Metals Ltd Edmonton, he was advised of the increase in price and when the tank arrived the above mentioned price $485.00 was the account received.\n\nThis tank was ordered quite a long time before your visit when Mr Connolly along with Mr Gooderham visited the Agency and went through the schools, and I regret I did not at that time get the authority in writing.\n\nI have seen Mr Pearson is making a visit to the school as to the best way to put this tank into the school, which will more than likely mean the cutting of a hole in the basement wall, and the work will have to be done in July when the children are out of school.\n\nI will advise you as soon as I have the estimate on the installation from Mr Pearson.\n\nAnthony M. Mullan\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\n11th March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWe recently received a Voucher for $485.00 issued in favour of S. Pearson, Pincher Creek, Alberta, for one hot water tank for the St. Cyprian Residential School. For your information I enclose a copy of our letter of 24th February, 1949, to Superintendent McMillan regarding the matter, and also a copy of Mr. McMillan's reply of 1st March, 1949.\n\nIt will be extremely difficult for us to arrange to obtain a Purchase Order because Mr. McMillan completely ignored purchasing instructions when he secured the tank. As far as we can judge from the contents of the correspondence on file, there was no necessity for purchasing the tank so hurriedly as they evidently do not intend to install it until next July.\n\nHave you any knowledge of this matter which would assist us in obtaining a Purchase Order. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nPincher Creek, Alta. March 21, 1949\n\nM.

There seems to be considerable misunderstanding in regard to this amount allowed for the building of the root house at St Cyprians School. I was advised on August 19th by letter from the Regional Supervisor that he had received an answer to his wire of the 12th August, stating as follows.\n\n\"Re ST CYPRIAN SCHOOL ROOT HOUSE DEPT AUTHORITY HAS BEEN OBTAINED AWARDING CONTRACT ORRIN PLAYFORD PINCHER CREEK ALTA FOR SUM OF 600 HUNDRED DOLLARS?STOP? SUBMIT TENDER PLAYFORD'S WRITTEN TENDER FOR OUR FILES!\" SGD B F NEARY INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nHe also advised me to obtain Mr Playford's written tender before he commences the work.\n\nThat is the reason that I did not get detail accounts for the cheque issued. I however have seen Geo Westcott, and he has promised the next time he comes from the mill he will bring his detailed account in for me.\n\nSuperintendent.\n24th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account covering the cost of a hot water storage tank purchased for use at the St. Cyprians Residential School. Mr. Pearson had in stock the exact type of tank required, and Indian Superintendent McMillan, therefore, arranged purchase.\n\nWe have instructed Mr. McMillan very definitely that he should not incur such expenditures without authority and furthermore, that he should have forwarded a requisition so that purchase could have been made through your office.\n\nThere is no doubt that the equipment was required, and we would appreciate it if you would issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.

We would appreciate your reviewing the account with a view to advising us why it was necessary to incur such a heavy expenditure.\n\nWe will require this information before we can submit the account to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nBernard F.

About a year later, Mr. Pearson had located one at Metals Ltd. in Calgary and ordered it to be sent to the St. Cyprian's school. So far as is known here, Mr. McMillan had never received a purchase order, and did not expect delivery to be made until advised by Mr. Pearson that he could get it.\n\nAs you know, these tanks were in very short supply until recently. The tank is needed, but it cannot be installed until June or July when the institution can do without water.\n\nG. H.

At present there is a staff of ten and an enrollment of fifty-eight students. It is operated by the United Church of Canada with financial aid from the Dominion Government.\n\nA steel-cased artesian well 60 feet deep supplies water to the school. A Robins and Myers' 1000 gallons-per-hour pump supplies water to two large pressure tanks of approximately 1200 gallons each. The well appears to be suitably protected against contamination from the top.\n\nTwo samples of water taken for bacteriological analysis (see attached) indicated the water to be of good bacteriological quality. The chemical analysis indicated the water to be of good chemical quality although the water is fairly hard. The iron content (0.60 p.p.m.) is quite high but does not appear to create a problem apart from staining of fixtures.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe water supply at this school appears to be of good bacteriological and chemical quality.\n\nStanley S.

The school is 100' x 34' X 50' High.\n\nThe Bids enclosed for Labor are as follows:\n\nW H Laidlaw Pincher Creek, without Scaffold $1680.00\nsupply every thing $4400.00\n\nGunner Nilson Pincher Creek complete labor $1800.00\nsupply everything $4500.00\n\nO Playford Doubtful Verbal approximate $1800.00\n\nPincher Co /op Bid on material $2391.95\nFoothills Builders Supply everything $5432.00\n\nRequisition for material enclosed.\n\nThe above bids are for one school, the Requisition I am enclosing is for materiel for two schools.\n\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI wish again to bring before you the question of the Roofs on the two Indian Residential Schools on this Reserve.\n\nSome two years ago the matter was taken up and request were made through Firms in Lethbridge and Calgary re the repair of the roofs, but no one was interested and a bid was not forthcoming; the roofs are still leaking in wet weather and I have been informed that the only method of fixing these roofs, would be to take off the present covering and replace it with a new roof.\n\nI contacted a Calgary man who was putting the roof on the new Hospital in Pincher Creek, and he promised to look at it, however he has not done so yet, and I would appreciate if the Branch would advise me whether to take bids if available for the taking off the old roof, and replacing it with a new one on each of the Schools.\n\nTo date the weather has been fairly normal and it is only severe storms which really leak in, however every time this happens, it deteriorates the inside of the building.\n\nAnthony M. McLean\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor.\nIt is presumed that bids on the work alone will be made for our school, the cost for the two schools would therefore have to be doubled.\n\nW.H. Hardman's price for labour is $1680 without scaffold.\n\nWhat would be the cost to the Department to provide the materials and labour to build a scaffold? However, it would not be practical for us to build a scaffold for a contractor doing the work. It is more economical for the contractor to build his own scaffold, Gunner Nelson prices for complete labour $1800.00.\n\nIt is presumed the contractor will supply the labour to build and dismantle the scaffold, but the Department will have to supply the material costs.

It was brought to my attention that a large pressure tank which was purchased in 1948 had not yet been put up in this school. Mr. McMillan had a tender from S. Pearson, Plumber, Pincher Creek, to do so at a cost of $440.00. I feared that this was excessive and inquired as to what Mr. Pearson was going to do when he installed this.\n\nHe stated that it was necessary to remove two old boilers that were leaking very badly and cannot be used and then replace them with the new boiler. This required the cutting of a portion of the cement and woodwork wall to take out the old boilers and put in the new one. He proposed to fill this space with a window, which, when removed would allow the passage of boilers in or out of the building.\n\nTo convince myself that this was necessary, I visited the school and inspected the basement. I then concluded that the amount asked to do this work was not excessive, but I asked Mr. McMillan to obtain a breakdown and herewith is a copy for your information.\n\nI met Mr. Pearson at Pincher Creek and he stated that the new boiler should be put in before the school opens as the water will be cut off.\n\nIf Mr. McMillan has not already submitted the tender he will do so on instructions from this office. When it is received, I hope that it is acceptable and that you will wire the Superintendent authority to proceed with the installation.\n\nG. H.

I have to inform you that a recent requisition asks the Department to supply:\n\n- 1 wagon with box,\n- 1 gang plough,\n- 1 drill,\n- 1 disc harrow,\n- 1 drag harrow,\n- 1 tooth harrow,\n- 1 cultivator,\n- 1 hay mower,\n- 1 hay rake,\n- 1 binder,\n- 2 teams of horses with harness,\n- 50 hens,\n- 3 geese,\n- 2 brood sows.\n\nI may state that, in addition to this list, the church authorities have requested several small items such as forks, shovels, rakes, as well as a cream separator, a churn, etc., for the dairy. I should be grateful if you would let me have a recommendation. It might be well to have a list of their present equipment prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Inspector Christianson informs me that all that the school has now in the form of outside equipment is a team of horses, an old wagon, and a democrat. I think, therefore, that it would be well to provide them with some of the articles mentioned in your letter referred to, such as:\n\n1 wagon with box,\n1 gang plow,\n1 drill,\n1 disc harrow,\n1 drag harrow,\n1 cultivator,\n1 hay mower,\n1 hay rake,\n2 teams of horses with harness.\n\nI do not recommend a tooth harrow and the purchase of a binder can be provided for but left over until nearly harvest time when we ascertain what has been the result of their farming operations. In regard to the poultry, this is a matter for the Department to decide but the request to be supplied with geese is unusual. If the Department desires, we could buy two brood sows.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-14, part 1)\nbrood sows but this is a new requisition and I can recollect only providing the school at Morley with sows. Small tools such as forks, shovels, rakes, etc., will of course be needed and if the Department will sanction the purchase of what is required, I will undertake to see that they are bought.\n\nWe provided a Cream Separator, a churn, etc., for the St. Paul's and St. Mary's Schools, and if the Department wishes we could make the same provision for the St. Cyprian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-14, part 1)\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that during my recent trip to Alberta and while at the Pelican agency I called at the two residential schools on the reserve.\n\nAt the Anglican school everything seemed to be in fair shape also. The school was clean and tidy and matters in general seemed to be running along smoothly. When I was at Hobema I received a wire from you instructing me to purchase five cows for the school, which I did. I may say that at the present time it is a very difficult matter to buy milch cows. I was in touch with most of the stockmen in Alberta and the only place I could find any cows was at the C.F.A. farm at Strathmore. The cows which I bought are Holstein. They are not pedigreed; two of them are pure bred but have no papers and the other three are practically pure bred. All have passed the tuberculin test and two of them had just freshened, while the other three are due to freshen around the end of this month. The price paid for these cows was $125.00 each, which I consider very reasonable. They are from three to six years of age and if properly looked after will produce a lot of milk.\n\nH. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the Church of England School on the Peigan Reserve are asking to be supplied with a sulky plow, the same kind and make as the one furnished the R.C. School last April. The price of this plow was $31.50 and was purchased from the International Harvester Company at Lethbridge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

I regret that I was unable to confer with Mr. Indian Agent Arthur on this matter, as he was seriously ill with three Doctors in consultation and a surgical operation appeared to be imperative, but I feel certain he would confirm my opinion of the necessity of the sleighs. The snow lies deep on all the country side of Southern Alberta, and as a carload of coal is now on order for this School and must be off-loaded at once, and the coal drawn to the School, the urgent necessity of the sleighs is apparent. As the wagon-box will fit the sleighs, the cost should not be much for the bobs alone, and I shall be obliged if you will either undertake to provide these or authorize me to do so. A grain-cleaner or fanning mill will also be required before Spring seeding begins, but I will address a separate communication to you at a later date in this connection.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cost would be approximately $51.20 f.o.b. Winnipeg.

INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ST. CYPRIAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, DATED REGINA, DEC. 6, 1929.\n\n---\n\nMr. Barlow made a request that he be furnished with two work horses. He explained that next spring he wanted to keep two outfits working on the land and at the present time he only has five horses that are fit to work the others being crippled. He had taken the matter up with the Commission, asking them to furnish him with the three horses in question, and they claim that all they can afford to supply is one horse. There is no doubt in my mind that if he is going to carry on the farming that is necessary for this institution he needs eight work horses. I, however, made no promises to him, any more than that I would bring the matter to your attention.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nDATED DECEMBER 10th, 1929. #406-11.\n\nI do not think the Department should be called upon to buy horses for this school. Surely the school authorities have some responsibility in matters of this kind, and if the Department agrees with me, Dr. Westgate will be so advised.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM NO. 414.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The estimated cost according to the plan adopted for day schools would be about $600.00, on account of the higher cost of labour and materials in that part of the country.\n\nUnder the circumstances I think the request is deserving of consideration, and would recommend that provision be made for the purpose, and authority be given me for the expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy of the\n\nSupt.

The future presents difficulties, but even then I am buying my land. There is no way known a great deal in flour, and already, at $2.25 per sack, I think it's a good deal. I am from 16 x 30 inches of a tremendous size - thus the cost is $1.75 per bag laid down at the young age.\n\nCould you not therefore allow that we get it at any rate until the price moderates? How do you help us, or worse still, not be a good affair?\n\nI feel that we do much in educating these children, making the request, as after all it is for the welfare.

It has been found, up to lately, impossible to fill the school up to the provision made, and at the time the estimates were prepared the attendance was under 50 with slight probability of increasing. Not wishing to encumber the estimates with an unnecessarily large amount, provision was asked for only such a number of pupils as would likely be in attendance.

I feel that it is the wisest and best course. Judging by others I feel that Dr. Naffety has struck the best method of dealing with her. I have every confidence in him. In whom should I look for the payment of the railway fare? Each time I had to take them in too short notice to get a pass. I am therefore on Butte's account financially, but I pocket it up so?\n\nAgain: In Mr. Swanwick's case he had great trouble in his finances through a mistake on his balance. Just as he was last year cut down to $50 now he tells me it is cut to $60. I already have more than that number, a prospect in the near future I hope. You can see that it is not encouraging after working hard to get them to find the grants cut. May I add to be succeeded to at any rate, too far this year, or now if I can get them. Just now the Indians are becoming more friendly, certainly we are doing all we can to make the children happy & comfortable, & the Indians will benefit for this improvement.

School at Blood Reserve, it is below the actual number of children now in the school. This is a financial loss to the school and one for which we were not prepared.\n\nAs, however, in the other schools under my supervision the full complement of pupils has not been made up, as for instance at the Blackfoot Reserve, it would be a great help to us if the Department could pay in full the number of children on the list at the St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, out of the money voted but unused at the other schools.

Mr. Owen was not present, but he had been in conversation with the Anglican Missionary in regard to children at the school over the number for which the per capita grant is provided. As to the hospital his request was that the indebtedness should be paid out that it should be put on the same footing as the Roman Catholic Hospital. As to the children in the school he asked that nothing provision being made for the payment of the per capita grant for those over the number authorized to be allowed rations for those in excess of the number paid for. I discussed the matter with the agent and on receiving a letter from Mr. Owen communicated with him so that I might have his views in writing. He quite agreed that the Anglican Hospital should be placed on the same footing as the Roman Catholic Hospital, but that the assistance to it should be proportionate to its work in rendering the same.\n\nJas.

I am inclined to think this is a work that has been established practically without reference to the department and is in connection with the Church of England Mission. In my opinion it is very doubtful policy for the Government to undertake to make grants for hospitals covering any service, excepting possibly repairs to buildings or something of that kind which would make the service rendered a little better.\n\nAs to the children attending the school being allowed nations I think that this is all right.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

PAUL'S MISSION,\nMackay, N.W.T., June 1st, 1902.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI have been trying everywhere to get some satisfactory information for the year grant, but can get no satisfaction. The wealthy people offer a lot land claims, but a claimer is in the house, so trouble is if any use it must be kept going all the time. A question seems more expense but is the thing. Can the year grant be kept over until we may get more added to it? The agent asked for two more last year, but of course we don't get them if we shall get it. If it must happen you will not forget that we have not yet had it. I have had offers a couple have about the money, but I was not satisfied with them & do not like using Government money unless I am fairly well sure it will be wisely laid out. I will not hear from you till I hear about the year grant. Hoping you are well, Believe me,\n\nMost sincerely Yours,\nArthur de B. Owen.\nOTTAWA, 13th June, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Principal of the Church of England boarding school on the Blood Reserve on the subject of fire protection and to inform you that Mr Owen has been advised that he should have communicated with you on this subject as without your authority no negotiations for such purchase should have taken place.\n\nThe amount of $400.00 is, as you are aware, provided in the Supplementary estimates for the current year and if a suitable plant for fire protection is not purchased before the 30th June, the grant will lapse.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nST.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant on the subject of fire protection for the Church of England Boarding school on the Blood Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that a copy of your letter has been sent the Indian Commissioner, with whom you should have communicated on this subject as without his authority no negotiations for such purchase should have taken place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant re fire protection for the Church of England Boarding School on the Blood reserve. It is but just to the Principal of the School to say that he did consult me about the kind of plant that should be purchased to secure the said protection. He submitted a proposal from the Waterous Engine Company to supply a 5 H.P. gasoline engine, rotary pump, rubber hose and a certain length of hose as the plant best adapted to supply the fire protection required. When I enquired of the Company's Agent here what such plant would cost delivered at Macleod, he replied $676.00. As a building would require to be erected for the plant, and the latter placed in position for operation, bringing the whole cost probably up to nearly $1000.00, I declined to entertain the proposal.\n\nAs the school buildings are not high I suggested to the Agent that an elevated tank to be kept filled by the windmill pump, with a hose to reach the several buildings, might supply sufficient water to extinguish at once any fire that would be likely to start in the buildings, but they appear to have considered the suggestion impracticable, and no other proposal has been submitted to me.\n\nIt\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIt is true the Agent asked that $250.00 additional for fire protection be placed in the estimates for 1902-3, but as the $400.00 and $250.00 would still be $25.00 short of the proposed gasoline engine plant laid down in MacLeod, not to speak of its being set up and housed, I did not deem it expedient to place the additional $250.00 in the estimates. It seems to me that the $400.00 now available might have supplied a simple apparatus sufficient for a small school.\n\nI half suspect that Rev. de B. Owen wishes to procure a plant to supply fire protection to the St. Paul's Mission buildings as well as the School buildings, while the Department is specially interested only in the latter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\nChurch Missionary Society.\n\nSt. Paul's Mission,\nMacleod, N.W.T., Jan. 27th, 1903.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nOn another matter. When I came here grant was given for 80 pupils. Now that went on for some years and was then suddenly cut to 50. Though we had more than that number several times since I have never been able to get the grant allowed for 60 since, though the Agent year by year asks for it. Does the Dept. wish the Indian educated or not? If so is it fair when we rassle them in that we are to board them and teach them at the Churches' expense. I would therefore ask you to get this straightened. I have always made it a point (while not a politician) to stand by the Dept. and do not wish to lose my respect for men in high positions. Hoping that I may soon have the pleasure of your acquaintance, with kind regards, Believe me,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nArthur de B. Owen.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 11th February, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the concluding paragraph of Rev. Mr Owen's letter of the 27th ultimo, on the subject of the grant for the Church of England boarding school on the Blood Reserve, I beg to say that although a grant was at one time allowed for 80 pupils, it was reduced after due consideration to 50, as up to the time of the reduction, which was made in the estimates for 1900-01, the average attendance had never exceeded 47. The Annual Report for 1902 shows that with an enrollment of 56 the average attendance was only 48.\n\nMr Owen is correct in stating that the Agent and Commissioner have recommended that he be allowed the grant for 60 pupils, but the number has been reduced here by direction of the Minister, who has, I am informed by Mr Scott, made the same provision in the estimates for next year, although 60 pupils were again asked for.\n\nThis school was started by the Church Missionary Society in 1892, when the pupils were given rations and clothing. In 1894 20 pupils were provided for at $72; in 1895 the number was raised to 40; in 1896 to 80 and reduced to 50 in 1900.\n\nOut of the 23 boarding schools in the North West Territories, Duck Lake Emmanuel College and St Albert are the only ones with a larger provision. Duck Lake has 100 pupils at $100 per capita, and is considered...\nconsidered to be quite on a par with any of the industrial schools. Emmanuel College has provision for 52, of whom 20 are paid for at $100 each with the view of fitting them for Indian teachers. St Albert is allowed a grant of $72 for each of 80 pupils, which it has had for the last eight years.\n\nThe Roman Catholics have a boarding school on the Blood reserve with a grant for only 25 pupils and I fail to see that Mr Owen has any just cause of complaint. He receives liberal support from the Church Missionary Society and if he wishes to keep expenses down he should confine himself to the number of pupils authorized.\n\nIn addition to the grant allowed this school, the Department has paid over $2000 as a contribution to the buildings, which are not on the reserve and are not its property.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boarding School on the Blood Reserve. Three of the female pupils are connected with the deed and are now under arrest. Their trial will take place at the next session of the Supreme Court at MacLeod, probably in February. The local agent says he will attend to the trial and get counsel to defend the accused, if he is so authorized. I beg to ask whether the Department, in view of the tender age of the girls, and the serious character of the offence, will authorize the employment of counsel, and if so, give the name of the lawyer to be selected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReport on attempted burning of Girls' Home.\n\nOn the evening of Thursday the 20th day of October an attempt was made by the girls to burn their home, but the fire was happily discouraged before any serious damage was done.\n\nThe cause which led to the fire\u2014There seems to have been some dissatisfaction among the bigger girls because it had been found imperative to make certain changes which tended to improve the discipline and thus place the general tone of the school on a sounder footing; hence the girls were allowed less freedom than formerly and they retaliated in the manner mentioned above.\n\nHow the plan originated\u2014At first the matter was treated as a joke, and tho' often spoken of many of the girls never dreamed that it would be really put into effect.\n\nHow the plan was effected\u2014On the Monday preceding the Thursday\u2014the night of the fire\u2014one of the girls, Lucy Welch, dared the other girls to say that she wouldn't light the fire. The girls laughed at her and taunted her, till she resolved that nothing would stop her from carrying out her intention viz.: to set fire to the building. When her companions found that she had really made up her mind, they assisted her. Lucy Welch proposed to fit the house on Monday evening, but on ordinary circumstances they could not do it, however the girls decided to make preparations on Wednesday and Thursday would find everything ready. Accordingly rags were saturated with coal oil and secreted. On Thursday morning some of the better disposed were inclined to waver and confess, but the stronger willed persuaded and prevailed. On the afternoon of this day the rags which had been prepared, together with matches, were laid under the sill of the west window ready to be fired as soon as it was dark enough to escape possible detection, but as no opportunity was afforded before prayers it was decided to see what could be done after.\n\nThe usual hour for prayers is at 7 p.m., but as Mr. Gale did not return to the school till 7.15 p.m., prayers were delayed in consequence and the prayer bell did not ring before 7.45. The girls paraded to end from school. When they arrived back it must have been 8 p.m.\n\nThe lighting\u2014Two girls\u2014Lucy Gladstone and Norah Eagle Speaker\u2014asked permission to go outside and leave was given them, the matron waiting at the door for their return. In the meanwhile Lucy Welch got hold of the kitchen window fastened by Essie Macaslin, the girl who laid the fire! lit the fire and returned without detection. The two girls who were out saw the fire but made no effort to extinguish it, nor did they give the alarm.\n\nHow the fire progressed\u2014Mrs. Gale who was living in the girls' home at that time was putting her two children to bed in the east wing and her husband remarked when he went into his room that there was much smoke in the house. He went down to the kitchen to find it full of smoke altho' 4 girls were working there. He remarked about the smoke but thinking that the stoves were smoking thought little more about it and went back to his wife's room. About 15 minutes after the little girls who were in their dormitory between the two wings found it impossible to stay in their room. The girls downstairs began to speak of the thick smoke and Mr. Gale went down to find the whole house filled.\nHe unlocked the kitchen door and walked outside\u2014what was his surprise to see a sheet of flame shooting up the outer wall. Procuring water he quenched the flames and calling for assistance the fire was soon extinguished.\n\nIt was extremely fortunate that there was no wind, for nothing could have saved the building from being partly destroyed at least.\n\nThe fire was discovered\u2014the fire was discovered at 8.30 p.m. so that it must have been smouldering for some twenty minutes or more before it flamed.\n\nPupils professed ignorance of the origin of fire\u2014A close watch was kept all night as it was feared that the building might again be set on fire. In the morning when all the pupils were assembled they were questioned with regard to the fire, but they professed ignorance of the whole affair.\n\nCorpl. Armer informed\u2014The principal wrote to Corpl. Armer of Stand Off about the matter, but before he arrived the girls confessed their diabolical act. When Mr. Armer came he was informed of the case and he referred it to his superior officers at Macleod. A commission of enquiry was held at the school by Inspector Walke and evidence taken.\n\nPresent situation\u2014There the matter rests & presumably for the present.\n\n(signed) G.

Herewith I beg to enclose a report just received from the principal of the school, in which connection it should be remarked that what the principal styles a \"commission of enquiry\" was the preliminary examination of the criminal charge upon which the girls were committed for trial before the Supreme Court.

H. Boarding School which is worthy of the Department's attention. The method of financing this school is apparently defective as I understand that instead of the Department's grant being paid to the Principal to be disbursed according to his judgement it is paid to some church official at Calgary. Not only was the food open to criticism but I am informed that during the winter the staff and pupils suffered greatly from the cold owing to insufficient coal having been purchased to properly heat the buildings. With reference to the total absence of potatoes at this school since September I may say that 4 tons were purchased and consumed at the other school during the same period.\n\nYour obedient servant\n(Sgd.)

While the destruction of the school garden by flood last year may have removed the ordinary source of vegetable supply, there was no excuse for not having potatoes except in the peculiar system of handling the Department's grant. The R.C.School also lost its garden but instead of starving the pupils in consequence they purchased four tons of potatoes.\n\nIf the Department will insist upon a greater portion of the school grant being expended on food and fuel, and that more time be devoted to recreation, fresh air and sleep there is no doubt that improved health will follow.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th ultimo, I have the honor to say that I am informed by the Principal of the C.

To this end the Medical Officer should be instructed to make a real examination of each entering pupil instead of founding Certificates of Health upon superficial observation.\n\nThe pupils should get more open air or outdoor recreation than at present and instead of being kept out of bed until late at night by night school and band practice they should retire at 8 p.m. during winter and 9 o'clock in summertime with nothing but recreation between evening prayers at 6.30 and bedtime.\n\nLast winter the authorities controlling the finances of this school, who I understand live at Calgary, did not provide nearly enough fuel for the normal ordinary and necessary heating of the buildings, the result being a scandalous amount of suffering from cold by pupils and staff.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the present time I have 39 pupils enrolled and have the best of accommodation for 50, I have several more signed in, but it is a difficult thing to get them even though they are signed in. The reports of my work at this school both local and general, Church and Department, testify that the education imparted here is of the best order, and in consideration of the fact, it is most heart-rending that such difficulties and obstacles should\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is the present school-boys that will be the Indians of the future, and if such a sad state of affairs is allowed to go on unchecked, the future of our Indians will not be so bright as it is painted.\n\nEven though each school on this Reserve were filled to the limit of its accommodation, there would still be a considerable number of children receiving no education. Surely there could be some system of force or compulsion brought into power that would tend to eliminate a few of the gross evils and utter ignorance which seems to exist on this ever vexed question.\n\nI might add that the ex-pupils are an exception to this case as they are most desirous that their children attend school as soon as they are of age.

School and hospital. The little hospital, the school house and the dormitory for the boys which I understand was constructed by your order are the only things which I can praise in the whole institution. They are all that could be desired but that old building which is used for a kitchen, dining-room and girl's quarters are most unfit for habitation. The place is dirty, the children are healthy enough looking but they don't look tidy or well clad; though there is a good deal of excuse for the officials, having to live in such a poor building. The only way in which I can see to remedy the condition is to have a new school and when the two years of this church management is over I hope it can be accomplished and that it be built by the Government on the Reserve and run under some supervision of the Government. I believe this school is also in great danger from the spring flood.\n\nI cannot see how it is but the R.C. people have the C.E. people beaten forty ways in the management of their institutions. The Principal of the C.E. school seems all right, active and energetic and they tell me the young lady who is teacher is a good instructor, but there seems to be something wrong about the housekeeping. They may get good food and properly prepared, but I would like to see more order and cleanliness.\n\nO. I.

But we will endeavor to remedy that and the other matters called to our notice.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\nJ.M. Tims\nTo make matters plainer, I might add that I knew nothing whatever of the impending visit until Dr. Grain arrived within the School precincts. He had then driven from the R.C. School where he expressed himself satisfied with all he saw, but they had been notified of the coming inspection, moreover, every Saturday afternoon is the School vacation, a time most unsuited for an official inspection.\n\nThe balance of the pupils were playing hockey on a near by rink, yet he reports the whole of the School were ill-clad; an absolute contradiction of terms.\n\nIt arouses my indignation to have such a report given on the administration of this School, for this is the first time that an adverse report has been received, and I shall not be satisfied until same has been obviated and eliminated from the annals of this School.\n\nFor this purpose I have had both Dr. Edwards and W.J. Dilworth, Indian Agent, at the School in order to make an official inspection, and will leave it entirely in their hands to have justice given, which in the above mentioned case was entirely miscarried.\n\nWithout quoting Diocese general reports of my work in connection with this School, I only need refer you to the reports in the Blue Books of 1912 and 1913, given under the heading of the Superintendent General of Education.\n\nThanking you etc,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boarding School, that he takes exception to Dr. Grain's report on this institution. He expresses himself in rather strong language as regards the conditions Dr. Grain found at the school at the time of his visit. There is also a letter from Archdeacon Tims on this subject, who says that the dirtiness of the place might be attributed to the fact that the cook and housekeeper were about to leave. Mr. Inspector Markle reported on the 19th instant on this school and he is of opinion that the walls want renovating with paint or kalsomine and that new floors should be laid in some of the rooms. The building is old and in need of general repairs and Mr. Markle says that want of funds seems to be one of the detriments to the success of the school.\n\nI think Mr. Middleton would have done better if he had assured the Department that he would see that the building is kept clean and tidy than expressed his disapproval.\ndisapproval of the medical officer's report in such strong language.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle was not much impressed with the advancement the children had made in their studies under Miss Gardner, the present teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Government of Canada will feed the children in the school.\n\nI am asking this of the Blood Indians, not for the purpose of depriving them of their children in any way, but for the purpose of having the children educated, that the Blood Indians may advance in every way. That with a larger attendance the schools will be in a position to do much better work; That all will reap to the full the advantage of an education.\n\nW J DILWORTH\n\nINDIAN AGENT.\nTO THE PRINCIPALS OF Dunbow Industrial School,\nR C Mission Blood Reserve.\nSt Pauls Mission.\n\nGentlemen:- I wish to inform you that this summer and autumn\nI am starting out on a program which has for its object the\nplacing of every fit child of school age on the Blood reserve\nin your schools, that is as far as your accommodations will\nallow. To assist you in this I am herewith mailing you a list\nof parents who have children of school age, the ages and\ntreaty numbers of the children. I will also take as many\napplications as I can for whatever school the parents wish\nto send the children.\n\nI am doing this not only for the benefit of the\nBlood Indians but also I think the larger attendance you\nmay have the more efficient your school work will be.\n\nNow in doing this recruiting, we think we ought to\nproceed along lines that will obliterate the present con-\nception of the Indian parent; That he is doing the Govern-\nment and the Principal a favor by placing his child in school.\nHe must be made to realize that no one is entitled to the receip-\neint of a favor except the Blood Indians, and himself.\n\nSince my coming to this agency I have noticed\nalso the following attitude amongst Indians, that they ought\nto receive something, cash, in return for their placing a\nchild in school; I also understand that in times past the\nprincipal in his zeal has loaned the father some sum not\nexpecting the loan to be repaid. In future it will not be\nnecessary for anyone to resort to any action of this kind.\n\nAlso I have found that sometimes Indians were\nled to have extravagant expectations thru promises made.\nI would rather that no promises were made except confined\nto the contents of the application form. However if certain\npromises should be made I would thank you to have the agree-\nment written in on the margin of the application form so as th\nthere will be a record at the agency office.

Should you meet with refusal from parents who are poor and have no proper means of taking care of their children, I would thank you to notify me at once and I will bring pressure to bear that their children will when men and women not be in the same predicament as they themselves are.\n\nIf I can lend you any assistance at any time it is my desire that you inform me of your wishes.\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nBlood Agency August 8, 1914.\nSir,\u2014 Since both Boarding Schools are having their annual vacation during the past and the present month up to the 15th inst., there is not much to report re school matters.\n\nI am enclosing you copies of circulars sent out from this office re Indian education. The two schools on the reserve have now the largest attendance in their history, one has an enrollment of 55 one 52. I have now 5 applications taken by myself which will be sent the respective principals upon their return to the schools from vacation. I will experience no difficulty in getting recruits for the schools the only difficulty will be that the schools will not accommodate all of the children that can be placed in them. I am going to do my part at least in making this year coming the banner year for the Indian schools here. Our difficulty from this time on will be to receive accommodation for the children. But I do hope that the standard of efficiency can be generally raised thru the introduction of increased numbers.\n\nI have experience some difficulty here thru the truancy of children from the schools. I had exhausted patience in talking to the parents, finally finding a parent who deliberately took his child from school without leave. I sent him to jail for ten days. This stopped the truancy instantly. Also some difficulty has been experienced thru the elaborated promises made some years ago by principals to parents. The Principal and agent having changed the Indian may now be right, but as there is no record at this\noffice in reference to it, I am unable to do anything.\n\nAlso it has been a practice since ever there was a boarding school on this reserve to literally buy children into school. One principal here no longer than last spring told me that he is always asked by the parent to give him $5.00 for the child. He said that he would loan the parent $5.00 expecting never to have it returned and it never is. Also it has been a practice to hold children in many cases after the age of 16 years.\n\nThe general conception of the Indian is that he is doing the Government and the Principal a favor by placing a child in school.\n\nI wish to altogether change these ideas and make the schools take a different standing, that of being here for the benefit of the Indians alone.\n\nI am firm in the opinion that the schools will do more than any other institution will work out the problems that are to be solved, on the Blood reserve.\n\nI would be pleased to have you inform me if any change in my proposed program is desired by the Department, if it is the pleasure of the Department that I add anything to the above mentioned program.\n\nI have the Honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy Indian Agent\n\nand Sec'y\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 21, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant I beg to say that the Department is pleased with the interest you take in school matters in your agency and it approves of the circular letter sent by you to the principals of the Indian boarding schools under your jurisdiction save as regards promises made to Indian parents who place their children in a school.\n\nThe Department wishes it to be impressed upon the principals that they are not to make any promises when obtaining recruits, as they have already been frequently informed that the Department cannot recognize any arrangements made by them. The printed form of admission distinctly states that the child is to remain in the school for such time as the Department may deem fit and that the principal or head teacher of the institution for the time being shall be the guardian of the said child.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Additional accommodation is being prepared which will make room for about 10 more than the 50. This accommodation will be used up this present month, December.

Boarding School is gradually increasing and that they have now more than their complement of 50 pupils. Additional accommodation is being prepared which will take room for about ten more and he asks that the grant be allowed for this extra number, bringing it up to 60. He says that if the school had room enough for 80 pupils it would be filled inside of three months.\n\nI would recommend that this request be granted on the condition that the church authorities engage a new teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Nearly all sick children are sent to the reserve hospital. Their use as dormitories would in no way interfere with the hospital ward operating room or nurses' room, these would not be in any way used, would be available for the same use as heretofore.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The staff is now a good staff tho short in numbers. The addition of a seamstress will be a great benefit in the clothing of the children.\n\nI will take care that both these schools on the reserve will be filled up to their full complement. I wish their efficiency to be increased. After considerable persuasion and some show of the regulations it is now an easy matter to recruit.

Middleton, Principal of the Church of England Boarding School on the Blood Reserve, for permission to increase the number of grant earners at this school to 58, the number he now claims to have enrolled, I beg to say that the December quarter returns show that he had 54 on the roll.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle in his report on this school, which was made in November, last, states that \"while most of the buildings are in reasonable fair condition they are not modern, excepting, possibly, the boys quarters. All of the buildings, except the girls home, were repainted this season. The interior of all buildings have been kalsomined. The floors of both the boys and girls homes have also been painted. Since an increased number of pupils have been admitted an additional dormitory has been furnished for the senior boys, also a small reading room.\" Fifty pupils are now provided, but Mr. Markle does not say how many more could be accommodated. Mr. Agent\nAgent Dilworth gives the cubic contents of the boys' and girls' dormitories, which will accommodate 62 pupils. In addition to these there are two rooms in the hospital building which can be used as a dormitory without in any way interfering with the hospital ward and which would accommodate nine additional pupils. You will thus see that there is ample room for the extra number asked for.\n\nMr. Markle also says that the school is running with less friction and that there have been fewer children and parents complaining than during past times and that the staff of the school is stronger than it has been for some years. Miss Glover, the teacher, holds a first-class certificate. He states that the crops were a failure last year and they were obliged to purchase hay. Little if anything was made by the farming operations and they would need all the grant earners the school could accommodate. Mr. Agent Dilworth also states that the school has made great strides for the better during the past year and that with the addition of a man teacher and a seamstress the efficiency of the school would be greatly increased.\nOttawa, March 4, 1915.\n\nRev.

Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have to thank you for allowing an increased Grant to be given to this School during 1915, and I now write asking if you will grant a further privilege to increase the accommodation up to 65. The Departmental limit now stands at 58, would it not be possible for the Department to allow me a per capita Grant for 65 pupils?\n\nI wrote an official letter to the Secretary of Ind. Affairs on December 11th, 1915 asking whether he would kindly extend the limit up to 65, stating most fully that Mr. Dilworth and myself had studied the matter most carefully, and that after having 65 resident pupils we would still have more accommodation and air space than is required by the Departmental regulations.\n\nIt was not until January 17 that I received an answer to my letter stating that \"the Department will be unable to comply with your request, as in next year's estimates no provision is made for an increase in privilege at any of our Schools.\"\n\nIt was March 4th, 1916 when I received a communication from Ottawa to the effect that I would be allowed grant for 58 pupils----I now ask for an increase of 7, and apparently\nSt. Paul's Mission\nAnglican Boarding School\n\nBlood Reserve\n\nMacLeod, Alberta\n\nam refused, there is little encouragement to work for the benefit of the Indian when one meets with such a point blank refusal.\n\nI confess that I feel rather guilty of trespassing on your valuable time by placing this matter before you, but understanding the position as you do I feel it is the only course open to me. An increased Grant for 7 may not appear much, but to me it decides the difference between ASSETS and LIABILITIES.\n\nI have 66 pupils in actual residence ---since January I have admitted 8----and have 3 more to enter during the next few weeks. In order to cope with the increased labor involved by the additional pupils I have engaged two extra members on the Staff---nurse and an additional teacher----thus incurring an expense of $600.00 per annum, and in addition to that have just purchased lumber to the amount of $400.00 for the purpose of erecting a larger Play and Dining Room at the Girls' Home.\n\nThat makes a sum of $1000.00 which has to be accounted for, and yet I am refused any GRANT to meet this contingency, moreover, THE PUPILS ARE IN ACTUAL RESIDENCE AND ARE WELL PROVIDED FOR, and it is owing to the influx of pupils that this expenditure has to be made.\n\nI suppose you well remember that when I took charge of this School in 1910 I found 36 pupils enrolled---I have now increased that by 20------and surely you will see your way clear.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The inspection of the cadets was held in the morning before the field day. Major Miller who complimented the officers and cadets of both corps for their achievements. The Indian cadets, under the command of Capt. McMillan went through all their drills and manoeuvres in perfect order and smartness which brought forth favorable comments from the large number of people who were witnessing the inspection.\n\nMajor Miller addressed the cadets and said he was more than surprised to him, and he was very pleased with them and the brothers of the fine inspection which he had made that day. He told them to carry on with the good work. Very often there were things that were not pleasant to perform, but they were only obstructions to be overcome, an introduction to duty and also help to train them for their future life.\n\nSergeants Complimented\n\nHe complimented Sergeants Middleton and Sergeants Herron and Penner on the manner in which they gave their instruction, and he also told the boys that to be successful in life they could not help but get on and that their work would be well received by their officers for the many hours spent on their instruction.\n\nMajor Miller informed the corps that he was so pleased with the performance of the cadets that he had presented a silver medal to be given every year to the cadet corps who won the most prizes in the sports. After the inspection the games were held and then the very keen military show was given by both of the Blood Indians and the boys of the Peigans. The Blood Indians showed their prowess over the Peigans. Nelson Rabbitt, of the Blood school won not only Major Miller's medal, but also a handsome cup presented by the parents of the pupil of either school who won the inspection competition.\n\nArthur Healy, another Blood boy, was awarded the Meritorious Prize, which is given annually for the boy who shows the greatest amount of merit marks during the year. The prizes were graciously presented by Mr. J. Herron, who made a very nice address, commending his boys staff for their excellent work.\n\nSpecial attention should be drawn to the Indian cadet corps of the Peigan school, which has been instructed by Capt. McMillan and Capt. J. Herron, and great credit is due to these officers for the splendid manner in which the signalling was done. The signalmen's work was shown in the school and great interest was taken by the very large number of people who were present.\n\nDeserves Commendation\n\nRev. Mr. H. J. Smith, principal of both schools, deserves the highest commendation for the way in which he has brought the pupils of the two schools to such a high state of efficiency. He has given them a great number of years in Indian service and, being of the Peigan type, has been able to introduce into the school the best traditions, one of which is his cadet corps. It will be remembered that Lieut. Albert Mountain Horse who enlisted in the army in 1914 and was killed about 12 months after, received his training from Capt. Middleton. He has been instructor for years and the Indians have responded during which time they won several cups at various fairs both for sports and for races. More than seven Blood Indians who were overseas in the war and whose supreme sacrifice was also attested by the Blood Indians' cadet corps, which speaks very highly for the work done by Capt. Middleton during the time he has been principal of the school.\nTHE WHITEFOOT PHOTO SERVICE\nMACLEOD \u2014 ALBERTA\n\n540728\n\nTo: D.C.

Mr. Middleton in this direction, and I would ask you to extend to him and to the boys of the cadet corps my congratulations on their success.\n\nThis is another evidence that under proper supervision Indian boys and girls are able to successfully compete with white children. On one or two occasions this Fall, at school fairs in both Eastern and Western Canada Indian children have succeeded in competition with white children in carrying off the laurels.\n\nI am sure that the training that these boys receive in the cadet corps will be an important factor in fitting them for the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Bennett Shield presented to the Champion Cadet Corps of Alberta has been awarded to St. Paul's Indian Cadet Corps of the Blood Reserve. This champion cadet corps was organized by Capt. (Rev.) S. Middleton in 1912 and has on many occasions won distinction, especially so at the Calgary Camps in 1912 and 1913, where they brought back to Macleod several trophies. The Shield was won by R. B. Bennett, Esq., Mayor of Calgary, is awarded to the Cadet Corps in Alberta gaining the highest honors, and as there were over seventy-five cadet corps in the province competing for this shield, the St. Paul's Boys are to be congratulated on their wonderful success.\n\nThe inspection of the Cadets was held June 7th of this year, when Maj.-Gen. Miller, the inspecting Officer commented the Indians on their drill and military maneuvers in the highest terms. The late Lieut. Albert Mountain Horse who died on his return from overseas, was a former cadet of the St. Paul's Corps, and several other Indians who enlisted from the Blood Reserve received their first taste of military training from the St. Paul's Indian Cadet Corps. Every member of the Corps is a full blooded Indian and speaks highly of the training he received from Capt. Middleton and Lieutenants Pearce and Herron, who have worked so hard with the boys to bring them up to present a corps of perfection in military tactics. Special mention should be made to the signalling corps of the Indian Boys, who under the able instruction of Lieut. Herron, gained first class honors in this work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E.\nBoarding School, October 6, 1922.\n\nBasing my opinion on what was seen here, I would grade Mrs. Robertson as a teacher among the lowest of the low. \"She is without question the most unobservant teacher I have ever seen in a classroom. Most teachers will make some attempt at least to keep the pupils who are left at their seats employed at work of some kind. But when Mrs. Robertson dismisses a class she is done with it. The pupils take their seats and with nothing in the world to do they sit there gazing around the room and waiting for long minutes to drag by; when recess or noon will bring a welcome break in the dull, dead monotony of the classroom. Fully ninety per cent of the time of the pupils is spent in this empty, listless, soul-paralyzing sort of existence.\"\n\nNor is her instruction much better. For example, in a spelling lesson taught to Grade II, several words were written on the board and the pupils were asked to spell. The pupils spelled each word a number of times in concert, some looking at the word in the list, and others looking in all directions, were merely keeping company with the rest. Then they were required to spell the words individually and orally without looking at the board. One pupil spelled \"birds\" brides. The teacher repeated the error \"b-r-i-d-s\" somewhat sarcastically and then said, \"You spell it.\" The pupil spelled \"b-r-i-d-s\". Then to another she said \"You spell it.\" The pupil spelled \"b-r-i-d-s\". Then the teacher went to the board and wrote down, spelling as she did so \"brides\" and said is that the way to spell birds. Look at it.\n\nComment is needless. Suffice it to say that this is typical of her teaching.\n\nJ. H. Hutchison,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe report of the Public School Inspector, who visited the Blind C. of E. Boarding School in October last, has just been received. The Inspector has drawn particular attention to the teaching methods employed by Mrs. Jean Robertson, and has graded her work as being of a very low order. He states as follows:\n\n\"She is without question the most unobservant teacher I have ever seen in a classroom. Most teachers will make some attempt at least to keep the pupils who are left at their desks employed at work of some kind. But when Mrs. Robertson dismisses a class she is done with it. The pupils take their seats and with nothing in the world to do they sit there gazing around the room and waiting for long minutes to drag by, when recess or noon will bring a welcome break in the dull, despondency of the classroom. Fully ninety per cent of the time of the pupils is spent in this empty, listless, soul-paralyzing sort of existence.\"\n\nHe further states that her method of instruction is very inferior, some examples of which he has given.\n\nThis matter is being drawn to your attention with a view to Mrs. Robertson still employed as teacher, to a change being made. You will observe from the Inspector's remarks as mentioned above that the pupils are only wasting their time in the classroom. Under the charge of a properly qualified and competent teacher there is no reason why the children of this school should not make good progress in their studies.\n\nWe hope that this matter will receive your earnest attention and that a change in the teaching conditions at this school will result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department, I think, should reserve the right to make this appointment. Mr. Middleton, in my opinion is not competent to select a man and we do not want a man looking after this important work who is not thoroughly qualified and competent in every way to do this work. We cannot afford to take a chance.\n\nI would be glad if this matter could receive your best consideration. I would go further and say that I believe it would pay the Department to pay for this service over and above the school grant if necessary as the looking after of these plants is no small matter, and more damage can be done by having an incompetent man looking after them than would pay the salary of a first class engineer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Principal the Department's wishes and have him make a nomination for our approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nO. H. M. S.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\n\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nFrom:- Office of Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nVictoria, B.C.\nNEW INDIAN SCHOOL NEAR CARDSTON COST $160,000\n\nEIGHT NEW BUILDINGS ACCOMMODATE AGENCY ON THE BLOOD RESERVE\n\n(By D. O. WIGHT)\n\nSeven months ago, the Clayton Company of Winnipeg, contractors, began work on the New St. Paul's Industrial School, just four miles from Cardston. Today the school stands completed ready to receive by name 125 Indian boys and girls of the Blood Reserve. This splendid building is to take the place of the old school at the Lower Agency, and has been built as a part of the plan to make the Indians self-supporting, not only in their agency and their farming interests near Cardston. There is also a school at Stand-Off, which is being controlled by the Catholic Church. The plans are now ready for the construction of a new school at the mission to the Anglicans near Cardston. When this second school is completed, opportunity will be furnished for every Indian child of the Reserve to receive an education.\n\nThe St. Paul's school near Cardston is the best one of its kind in Canada. It is made of brick, faced with stone. The cost of the building alone runs over $135,000, while the furnishings and equipment will mount up to $25,000 more. It has four class rooms, a gymnasium, a library, the regular curriculum of the schools of Alberta, and in addition, rooms are provided for instruction in Carpentry and Blacksmithing for the boys, and Domestic Science and Art for the girls. Instruction will all be given in English and farming. Husbandry. In fact the school is an industrial school of the very latest type. Rev. S. Middleton will be in charge, the other members of the staff have not been appointed as yet.\n\nA Modern Building\n\nThe building itself is thoroughly modern in every respect. Hot and cold water is provided throughout. It is supplied with an electric plant which gives light and power. There is a full size gymnasium, a shower bath. The waterworks is a gravity system, supplied by a deep, drilled well, the water from which is pumped to a 20,000 gallon tank, which stands 90 feet high from the ground, and is located on the highest point of the school. In addition to all these modern features, the dormitories, of which there are four, are finished in the best style of the day and provided with hot water. The staff are also kindly provided for, while the principal has a separate wing of the building for his residence. In fact every accommodation is provided for both pupils and staff. The building, without question, a superior one of its kind in the whole Dominion.\n\nNew Agency Building\n\nIn addition to this excellent industrial school, the Indian department has constructed eight new buildings to accommodate the Indian Agency of the Blood Reserve. These buildings are also placed near Cardston, about five miles from the school and the new agency. They have cost in the neighborhood of $40,000. They are constructed of lumber, and finished with hardwood floor and perfect in every detail of their appointments, being fully equipped buildings. The central square contains the agency offices. His residence stands just to the north of the office, and it is the largest building there. Mr. J. F. Faunt is the agent, the man upon whom the task of educating the Indians is chiefly reposed. Visit him in his home and find him cordial, resourceful, and thoughtful in his office, and ever enthusiastic for the welfare of the Indians. He has grouped the other officials, who in his own residence, where Mr. A. Macdonald, the clerk, and many more, by the farm instructor's home, Mr. Thaddess Gregson, while the interpreter's house is situated just to the west and north. The other buildings are machine shop, blacksmith shop, stable and barns, etc., all planned so that when the tree planting plans are been warned not to indulge in luxuries.\" The other residents individual patents to their land. This will come later. At present, they do have, however, full ownership of their cattle, horses, machinery and the produce from their farms.\n\nOne Indian's Big Crop\n\nThat they are taking advantage of this is shown by the one case of Joe Butten, who this year harvested on his own farm 640 bushels of wheat and 1,500 bushels of oats. But he is only one of 130 other Indians who are operating farms on their own account. Every year more Indians are applying for this privilege, and Mr. Faunt now has waiting list of 40 Indians anxious to get the necessary equipment to start farming. This equipment will be charged against their account, and a he reaps his harvests the returns will be applied to paying for it. Thus it is seen that the first one in which the Indians are wholly out of debt.\n\nIndividual Initiative\n\nIn the system thus evolved, everything depends upon the attitude and individual industry of the Indian as to the progress he makes and the returns he reaps. If he wishes to go ahead, he will go ahead. If he does not, he cannot. But every head of a family is now looking forward to the possession of a half section of land that he can operate for his own profit. The 130 who are doing so have already demonstrated that they can do it, and the whole tribe will be a little nation of expert farmers and ranchers. The schools are helping them materially with their knowledge, but the real secret lies in the care and judicious handling of the Indians by the agent and his staff of farm instructors. For instance, the Indians usually incline toward use of high powered machinery, the big tractor and plow outfits for the breaking of their land, but the wisdom of Mr. Faunt in insisting that each man buy his own broken land has helped the industry of the Indians and their attitude toward their work. Also, if allowed they would all have automobiles, but here again wisdom and experience teaches that barns must be built in order to keep rain, wind, rain, etc., that cars usually unfit the owner to go quietly on with his farming operations. The Indians, however, after the first impulse for these novelties pass away, are ready enough to buy them and are buying them now. With the erection of \"their own homes, they being given almost complete freedom in the choice of plans, and location. Of course a more or less common or unfamiliar style may be adopted by the Indians, but the individuality of the Indian can exert itself in the style and design of the building and the furnishings that go in it. Several of such buildings have been completed and the future will see them rapidly increasing in numbers.\n\nThus the construction of the new St. Paul's Industrial school, near Cardston marks but the beginning of a rapid advance in the welfare of the Indians.\nIt has four class-rooms for general instruction in the regular subjects of the old Albermarle school, and the industrial rooms are provided for instruction in Carpentry and Blacksmithing for the boys, and Domestic Science and Art for the girls.\n\nInstruction will also be given in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. In fact the school is an Industrial school of the very latest type. Rev. G. Middleton will be in charge; the other members of the staff have not been appointed as yet.\n\nA Modern Building\n\nThe building itself is thoroughly modern in every respect. Hot and cold water is provided throughout. It is supplied with an electric plant which furnishes light and power. There is a fully equipped gymnasium and shower baths. The waterworks is a gravity system, supplied by a deep, drilled well, the water from which is pumped into the galvanized tanks located 90 feet from the building and is 10 feet higher than the roof of the school. In addition to all these modern features, the dormitories, of which there are four, are finished in the best hardwood and fitted with every comfort. The staff are also similarly provided for, while the principal has a separate wing of the building for his residence. In fact every accommodation is provided for both pupils and staff, making the building, without question, a superior one of its kind in the whole Dominion.\n\nIndian Agency Building\n\nIn addition to the excellent Industrial school, the Indian department has constructed eight new buildings to accommodate the Indian Agency of the Blood Reserve. These buildings are also placed near Cardston, about five miles from the school and some seven miles from the town. They have been built at a cost of $40,000. They are constructed of lumber, and finished with hardwood floor and perfect in every detail of their appointments, being fully modern buildings. The central square building is the agent's office. His residence stands just to the north of the office, and it is the largest building on the reserve. Mr. A. Faunt is the agent, who is in charge of the task of educating the Indians in citizenship, rests, etc. Visit him at any time and you find him courteous, considerate, and thoughtful in his office, and ever enthusiastic for the welfare of the Indians. Arranged around him are the other officials, each in his own residence. There is Mr. A. McMillan, the clerk, just east, and nearby is the farm instructor's house, Mr. Thaddeus Gregson, while the interpreter's house is situated just to the west and north. The other buildings are modern, splendidly built, and when stable are barns. These buildings are all well placed so that, when the tree planting plans are completed, they will present a most attractive appearance, and be one of the beauty spots of the whole Reserve.\n\nBut why all this expense and attention to the Blood Indians? What are they doing to merit the Government expenditures in this lavish fashion? In answer, let us enumerate some of the actual performances of these Indians during the last five years, since the new policy was inaugurated.\n\nTake On Modern Ways\n\nFive years ago, there was little or no land under cultivation on the big Reserve, the Indians, living a camp life, herding their cattle and horses, and depending on the government for food to supply the deficiencies of their labor. They were still draped in their old robes, and appeared as a most shiftless population. To-day they appear, at least the majority of the younger ones and the number is constantly increasing, as well dressed as any whites, wearing the latest fashions in blankets and shawls, and except some of the older Indians, whose ways are set, they speak English fluently, and are keen buyers at the stores of Cardston. To this last point, every merchant in Cardston can testify. They buy the best and newest fashions, too, to satisfy, and that merchant who tries to fool them in their goods has a slim chance for a repetition of the trick.\n\nTo illustrate their modern aspect, two Indian women were observed in Laidlaw's Ltd., the other day, and one was heard to say: \"Don't buy that, you know you have...\"\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nMarch 28th 1925\n\nTORONTO, ONT.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSince the administrative cost of the new St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, will be of necessity much greater than that of the old institution, we beg to make application that the scale of the per capita grants be increased to the amount of the same for the Elkhorn School, and for the new Methodist School at Edmonton.

For the past few months the Department has made no changes in the categories into which Indian residential schools are classified, as it is our intention to reconsider the various groupings and to make an effort at reclassification. This work will be undertaken before the next fiscal year and the relative claims of each school will be subject to discussion with yourself and other church representatives. In our deliberations the St. Paul's school will not be overlooked.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the pupilage for this school has been voted at $25. I trust this increase will take care of the added current costs for the present fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter, dated April 2nd, serial number 103-1-1, in reply to our request for an increase in the rate of the per capita grant for the new St. Paul's Indian Residential School, was submitted to our Executive Committee at its meeting yesterday. The Committee instructed me to emphasize the following points:\n\n(1) That the M.S.C.C., under its current sanctioned estimates for Indian Residential Schools, without provision for the increased cost of the New St. Paul's School, is under an obligation to provide, in cash, or in the form of cash values of clothing and supplies, a total sum for the year of \u00a38,570.00. It follows, therefore, that any re-classification of the schools which may be made cannot result, if the Church of England is to carry on, in any lessening of the amounts now payable, in the form of per capita grants, to the various schools administered by this Society. The revision, if made on general lines, must, of necessity, be in an upward rather than in a downward direction.\n\n(2) The new St. Paul's School and the new Methodist School near Edmonton are, as far as our information goes, similar in all respects connected with the cost of administration. There exists, therefore, in our opinion, no possible ground on which these schools could be placed, under any re-classification, in different groups. We feel, further, that we have, in consequence, a very strong claim in repeating our request that the new St. Paul's School should be placed at once on the same scale of per capita grants as that being allowed for the new Methodist School at Edmonton; the scale in question being, we understand, the same as that now being paid to the Elkhorn Institution.\n\nI am very pleased to know that the enrollment of the School has been increased to 125; it will, however, be probably some time before this total is reached, and in any case the additional pupils mean a decided increase under all the headings of the estimates adopted.\n\nMay I express the hope, therefore, that this important matter will receive your early and favourable re-consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

REV. W. C. PINKHAM, D.D., D.C.L.\nBishop of Calgary 1887\u20141926\n\nIn recognition of His Lordship's inspiring leadership in progressive Indian education, his untiring service for the welfare of the Blood Indians, his deep and personal interest in the work of St. Paul's, we gratefully dedicate this volume.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\n\"In the old days the Indian centered everything upon his religion. He thirsted for a knowledge of God, though at times he but faintly apprehended Him. His religion entered into every phase of his life\u2014his planting, harvesting, feasting, recreation, hunting, warfare\u2014in short, all his interests were intimately bound up with religion. Therefore the Indian of the old trail was strong and steadfast in his adherence to old ways and in his loyalty to his ancient gods. The very perils and hardships of the trail and warpath called in him a longing for close relationship with the unseen world of mystery round about him. So he established such relationships as he could, through fastings and visions, sacrifices and immolations.\n\nBut the Indian of the old trail has passed on, leaving behind chiefly such vestiges of the old regime as war paint and feathers, bow and arrow, blanket and mocassin. The Indian youth of today is on a new trail. As with every new trail he is facing this dim and uncertain at times. The transition from the old to the new is often fraught with difficulties and perils. He has cast upon the higher plane of knowledge and does not turn back to the old trails. The road of the old is being retained in the new. It is recognised that in the Indian's tribal lore, his art, handicraft, and some of his ceremonies were cultural elements of value which should be retained and encouraged; accordingly, musical and religious organisations, athletic clubs, physical culture and art classes are promoted, to which the Indian temperament naturally inclines. It is also the aim of those who are that is best in the Indian folk tales and their stories as a race heritage to be handed down as an inspiration for racial progress and development.\n\nSt. Paul's, as a School with ideals, endeavours to furnish avenues of expression for all these activities, especially where the appeal is from a religious and instructive motive. The residential school system has demonstrated very effectively its value and adaptation to the needs of the Blood Indian boys and girls. Its results are unmistakable. It has enabled the Indian to make...\"\ngreater progress than any other primitive race in a like period of which there is any written record. Most of its body of workers put into their labours a lifting spirit of altruism above value.\n\nUnder the service of this educational system the Indian is casting away the things which typify his old barbarous life. He has gone from the mocassin to the shoe, from the blanket to the coat, from feathers to the hat. He has exchanged the bow for the plough, and turned from the buffalo to the white man's herd and flock. He is forsaking a weird and uncertain conception of divinity for the Church and organised Christian benevolence of his white brother. He is lifting drudgery and burdens from the women of his race and granting them lighter ideals of home-keeping and womanhood. Generally speaking, the graduates of the School are the transforming influences of the Reserve life today.\n\nIf we give the unenlightened Indian property, he may or may not wisely use of it. If we give him education, he has a working capital, of which he cannot be deprived, that should make him and keep him both progressive and solvent. The oft-repeated saying \"in the Indian youth lies the hope of his race\" should here find its fulfillment. Indeed, one may have faith to believe that here, if anywhere, the Indian youth will respond by \"outward and visible signs\" to the \"inward and spiritual grace\" bestowed upon him through increasing knowledge to the word of the Great Spirit.\n\nAt the parting of the ways, the young Indian says with Tennyson:\n\n\"Come my friends,\n'Tis not too late to seek a newer world,\nPush off, and sitting well in order sail\nThe samplings furrows; for my purpose holds\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\nOf all the Western stars until I die.\"\n\nS.H.M.\n\n*The Year Book could not have been published without financial assistance. The advertising given by the various business firms has thus made it possible. We desire therefore to express our appreciation to each and everyone, and to assure them all a willing reciprocity.*\nOfficial Opening of St. Paul's School\n\nJuly 21-22, 1925\n\n(Reprint from Calgary Herald, June 26, 1925)\n\nAn interesting ceremony took place at the Blood Reserve on Monday, June 22, when the new St. Paul's Indian residential school was formally opened by Right Reverend the Bishop of Calgary.\n\nMore than 400 visitors were present, both Indians and whites, including many who had motored from Edmonton and Macleod, showing their keen public interest in this flourishing and progressive institution.\n\nSome of the old-time Indians were present, the men with blankets, and hats decked with feathers; the women in brightly-colored shawls and kerchiefs, in marked contrast to the serge or tweed suits and stylish hats and dresses of the younger generation. The bright sunlight accentuated chatter of the assembled crowd added to the impressiveness of a memorable scene.\n\nThe proceedings, which took place in front of the main building shortly after 2:30 p.m., started with the performance of exercises by the pupils, the girls marching to one side and the boys to the other side of the steps, to the accompaniment of music provided by the school brass band.\n\nThe singing and physical exercises were excellent, and showed a great deal of care and thorough training. A piano solo by Josephine Davies, piano first by two boys, and concertina by two members of the band were novel features of the entertainment, as it is believed to be the first time in Alberta that an Indian child has played the piano at a public performance.\n\nThe band presented a smart appearance in their navy and red uniforms, and although they have had only a few months' instruction, accomplished several of their exercises very well, and with excellent time.\n\nOlive Davies as the Indian queen, with her two modern slaves, made an attractive picture.\n\nPrizes Presented\n\nFollowing the programme given by the children, His Lordship, Bishop Pinkham, presented the prizes, consisting of five awards to each of the recipients. Josephine Davies, Miss Montana Horse received the prizes offered by the L. O. D. E. for the best essays on the Blood Indians.\n\nBishop Speaks\n\nAt the conclusion of the prize-giving, the aged Bishop, whose voice was full of emotion, addressed the assembly. He recalled the early days of his episcopate, when he made his first visit to the reserve, when there were but one day schools for Indians, and the Indians were practically all heathen. He eulogized the work of the men and women who had so patiently labored for the betterment of the Indians, and acknowledged with deep admiration the manner in which the Indian department of the government had met the present educational requirements by the creation of \"this splendid building.\"\n\nHe then briefly congratulated Rev. Canon Middleton on the progress the school had made during the fifteen years it had been under his charge, and hoped to be spared a few years longer to administer the work of the district, and to see the new school fully justify its erection.\n\nAddress by Archdeacon\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon Timms then followed with a short address, taking the letter \"P\" of \"St. Paul's\" as his text, and speaking briefly on the three points of patience, progress and possibilities.\n\nDedication Ceremony\n\nHe reminded the Indians of the patience required to overcome the difficulties and the almost insuperable difficulties against which they struggled. There were no fences, farms nor railways. The Indians had no idea what education meant, and thought that the reading, writing and arithmetic taught to their children were different forms of prayer.\n\nNext, he spoke of the progress they had made, with special reference to the prizes won by the pupils at the Calgary exhibition, and the efficiency shown by the cadet corps.\n\nLastly, he spoke of the possibilities of the future. He looked forward to the time when the wards of the government would be free citizens. A great deal depended on the parents in the example they set their children. They must therefore be educated, but they must remember that civilization without Christianity must be a failure, he said.\n\nJudge Jackson Speaks\n\nThen in a short speech, Judge Jackson, of Lethbridge, contrasted the Indians of long ago with those of today, commenting on the pro...\ngives that had been made, and saying that education was to be the salvation of the Indian. Mayor Macleod, of Macleod, opened the high school board, and in the old and in the present schools. He congratulated the staff and pupils on their new and commodious quarters, and the change from the ramshackle buildings, where astronomy could be studied through the roof and the sunlight through the floor.\n\nThe last speaker was Mayor Caldwell of Carleton. He was proud of having the new school in the vicinity. He had watched the Indians grow and prosper for many years, and considered the school was a fine educational institution.\n\nDedication Ceremony\n\nAs the conclusion of the speeches, the clergy present retired in order for the ceremony of dedication, and during the interval the visitors were entertained with selections by the band. Then the procession of clergy issued from the south door, preceded by the Bishop and Mrs. Thomas, Rev. G. Johnson, rural dean of Lethbridge; Rev. W. J. Merrick, rural dean of Macleod; Rev. Canon Middleton, Very Rev. deacon Thomas, and Rt. Rev. Bishop Fulton. They took their places on the steps of the main entrance, and after \"O God Our Help in Ages Past\" had been sung, His Lordship delivered the dedicatory address. After the school opened its doors, nothing that was said by his pastoral staff upon the doors, he demanded admittance. At once the doors were flung open by an Indian boy and girl, and the Bishop, followed by the clergy, entered.\n\nThe building was then thrown open to the visitors, and they were received by the Bishop, Mrs. Middleton and Miss Thomas. Groups of visitors were shown over the school, and many expressions of surprise and approbation were heard as the parties progressed through the institution. Later refreshments were served in the dining-room.\n\nLocation of School\n\nThe new St. Paul's school is situated four miles north-west of Macleod, west of Edmonton. It has large sections of splendid farming land, which are to be worked by the pupils. The school grounds include the magnificent view of the mountains, with Chief Mountain very prominent. The building itself is a magnificent structure of red brick, and is splendidly fitted out throughout.\n\nThe chapel, placed opposite the front door, at once acquaints the visitor with the fundamental object of the institution, namely, the illumination and elevation of the children of the prairies under the influence of the Christian religion.\n\nThe whole atmosphere and tone of the place bear eloquent witness to this fact, and the prayers at the morning and evening prayers held daily in the chapel, lead to love and reverence the services of the church. The Bishop dedicated the chapel in a short service on Sunday afternoon, just previous to a con-\n\ndition.\n\nCapacity, 125 Pupils\n\nSt. Paul's is now capable of accommodating 125 pupils, of whom 92 are in residence. It is expected that after the summer holidays the school will be filled to capacity.\n\nCredit Due Canon Middleton\n\nTo Rev. Canon Middleton, for fifteen years principal of the school, St. Paul's owes much for his tireless energy, his optimism and ambition. It is very greatly owing to him and the dedication with which he developed the school opening its doors, nothing that times with his pastoral staff upon the doors, he demanded admittance. At once the doors were flung open and spiritually has taken place. The loyalty of ex-pupils to the old school, and their well- ingess to give their best understandings. Their power, is a striking witness to the lasting influence of St. Paul's upon those who pass through it.\n\nThere is a splendid school cadet corps organized in 1911, which has a most creditable record. They formed the guard of honour for his excellency the Duke of Connaught when governor-general in 1912. They presented the king's colors to the school. The corps has been the winner of four silver cups, three championship cups and three silver medals.\n\nInspected by Prince\n\nIt was inspected by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in 1910 and again in the following year won the R. B. Bennett shield in open competition with the white cadet corps of Alberta. The latest addition to the list of honors is the winning of the Army Cadet Corps medal to the best school training corps of 16 members in the province, outside of Lethbridge, Calgary and Edmonton. There has also been for the last year, a cadet corps of 30 pupils, who meet each week for drill, games, and other forms of guide training, and who will no doubt make for themselves a record as excellent as that of their brothers in the cadet corps.\n\nSt. Paul's has a very full curriculum, the pupils being given instruction in all kinds of practical work, besides the regular lessons in the classrooms.\n\nNow St. Paul's starts on a new stage in its history. In the words of the principal: \"It is the aim of St. Paul's to train the Blood Indian boys and girls to take upon themselves the duties and responsibilities of Christian citizenship.\" And there is no doubt that, continuing the work along the lines which have been formerly maintained, and which have shown such excellent results, that this aim will be fulfilled.\n\nFrom the Lethbridge Herald\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Fulton, of Calgary, assisted by the Rev. Canon Middleton, principal of St. Paul's School, formally opened the new St. Paul's School for Blood Indians. However, near north of Carleton, today, in addition and devotional prayer, both of which were intended to be hundreds of Indians and 200 to 300 visitors from Carleton, Macleod and Lethbridge.\n\nOpening Program\n\nThe official opening of St. Paul's was preceded by a splendid program by the boys and girls of the school, all of whom were dressed in their best. The school was much of the solemnity of Court proceedings by the stately manner in which they stood at attention for more than two hours during the program was unusual. Not only did they exhibit the qualities of their bodies but also the qualities of their instructors in the unusual performance which they gave. The Boys' Band under Bandmaster\nGift of War Pictures\n\nThe conclusion of these ceremonies was the acknowledgment by His Lordship, Bishop Pinkham, on behalf of the Board of Managers and his staff, of the splendid gift of war pictures by the Anglican Band Chapter of Lethbridge, which pictures attracted the attention of all present when inspection of the building was allowed.\n\nBishop Pinkham\n\nThe opening speech by Bishop Pinkham was a most interesting bit of Western Canadian history. He came to Winnipeg in 1885, when but 150 people made up the total population of the city, whereas there are more than that number of thousands of people now. In August, 1887, Bishop Pinkham was committed to his high office but before assuming this position he made an extensive survey of all parts of his diocese of Saskatchewan and thus came personally in contact with the four great Indian Reserves, the Bloods, the Blackfoot, the Peigan and the Cree. From his experience he has contrasted what he now beholds. A building, the equal of which is rarely found in Alberta, one of the kind few in Canada, with its surroundings completed, its accommodations adequate, its staff and principal of the highest quality. Thus did His Lordship refer to the occasion of the day.\n\nPresentation of Prizes\n\nA special feature of the proceedings was the personal presentation by His Lordship, Bishop Pinkham, of the prizes for the annual field day to the respective winners. An outstanding victory attending the military service was the winning by St. Paul's of the Army and Navy School for the best Cadet Corps in Military District No. 13.\n\nMajor J. A. Ross Chapter of the L. O. D. E., represented by Mrs. Middelton, presented two $5 gold pieces to Josephine Davies and Bertie Mountain Horse, a gold piece to each for the best essays on the history of the Blood Indians.\n\nLive by Theft\n\nIn speaking of the Indians themselves, he reminded that they earned their bread by the sweat of their brows, that they stood as an example to their brothers, the white race, and that they were anxious to work. There were no Christian Indians prior to 1887, but through the splendid work of Canon Middelton and his staff on their opportunities of today, he referred to the practical education the Indians are receiving under the Canadian government and of the material achievements under the directing wisdom of Indian Agent Farnell.\n\nWonderful Progress\n\nLast year the Indians harvested more than 260,000 bushels of wheat at Carleton elevators, said the speaker. This year they have 7800 acres of wheat growing; they have 400 acres of sunflower growing, and 2000 acres of corn grown for the first time and drill. \"We are proud of our Indian neighbors in Carleton. We welcome them, and want the best of feelings between us. This is a great worth to them, and we congratulate them and this staff, and the Dominion government on the excellent school which now stands ready to be formally opened.\"\n\nMinister Wood\n\nA telegram was then read from the Hon. Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior, expressing regrets that official parliamentary business had prevented him from being present at the opening of St. Paul's. There were also letters of regret from Commissioner Graham and Assistant Superintendent Scott of Reserve. The Rev. C. Swanson of Lethbridge, the Rev. W. G. Merrick of Macleod, Dr. and Mrs. Conlyburne, Mr. and Mrs. Lafitte, Mr. Swinney and Mrs. During, superintendent of the Gulf Hospital at Lethbridge, and many other visitors of note were present. Hundreds of Carleton visitors attended, including President Wood.\n\nBishop's Prayer\n\nThe Bishop of Calgary offered the Dedication Prayer as follows:\n\n\"O almighty Father, Who rulest in the affairs of men, we thank Thee that Thou hast put it into the hearts of Thy servants the consecration of the Board to erect this School to the glory of Thy Name and the advancement of the cause of Indian education on this Reserve, grant, we beseech Thee, that who administer it and those who receive its ministrations may that they may together strive for the advancement of Thy Kingdom on the Reserve; that the generations of those who shall pass through its halls may enter into the fullness of Christian Citizenship, to the Glory...\"\nThe Origin of the Sun Dance\n\nOr, The Story of Scar Face\n\nBy S.H.M.\n\nThe chief dance among the Blood Indians was the Sun Dance, and its beginning is described in this way.\n\nThe great festival of the year was the ceremony of the Medicine Lodge. It was a time of happy meetings, feasting, and giving presents. Besides this, the men who wished to make a vow took many of their undertakings tried to prove their prayers sincere by sacrificing their bodies, by some form of torture, etc. This was a most painful suffering, but vows for the Medicine Lodge must always be taken by a good woman if she has a son or husband or even a child that is sick; she will offer prayer to the sun, and in case of recovery she will build a Medicine Lodge. The pledge or vow must be made in a solemn manner, so that all might hear the promise had been made.\n\nAbout the time the berries ripen the tribe would come together and pitch their lodges in a great circle, and in the centre the Medicine Lodge would be built, but not until the minor ceremonies had taken place. The ceremony usually lasted four days and four nights, during which time the person who had taken the vow would neither eat nor drink, excepting in a sacrifice.\n\nThere are quite a few ideas as to the origin of the Medicine Lodge. Some say that it was designated by the Creator to an ever-lasting friend of His. Others tell you that it was caused by an Indian named Scarface taking a journey to the Sun, and whilst staying near the lodge of the Sun and Moon he was initiated into the following rites:\n\nA long, long time ago there was a very pretty girl, the daughter of a chief. Many of the young braves wished to marry her, but she always refused. At last her father asked her the reason she did not marry, but she replied that she did not desire to marry anyone until the young braves became so persistent in their admiration for her and the constant repetition of her father's request, she at last told her father that the Sun had...\nFULL REGALIA\n\nspoken to his mother nor to me for she belonged to the Master Person. Immodestly her father acquiesced, and nothing more was spoken about it.\n\nThere also existed at this special time a very poor young man who had no parents. He was much smaller than his fellow and for that reason he was called by the Indians \"Scareface,\" or \"Ciski.\" Owing to the young man's extreme poverty he was always in need for every occasion and was often taunted by the fact that if he had enough courage the Sun girl might marry him. In order to make up for the trifles he daily received, one day he met the Sun girl down by the river and asked her if she would marry him. She replied in the affirmative and he told her the secret she had made him very happy. \"But,\" she replied, \"I have one stipulation to make, and that is that you must go into the woods and get something and also ask him to remove that scare from your face\u2014for that will be his sign. If you can find your way back to the Sun, then I shall marry you on your return.\" Scareface was very sad and asked her how far the Sun was from the earth; but she told him to take courage, and then left him.\n\nScareface lay down and tried to think, and at last he arose and went to an old woman who had been kind to him, and asked her to make seven pairs of moccasins, and to give him some advice for his journey on a long and dangerous trail. He then went out a little and looked over the camp. He turned and looked at the Sun and wondered if he would ever return home again. He offered a prayer to the Sun and then set out on his journey. He traveled many days and many weeks, crossing prairies, rivers, mountains, and many difficulties. Gradually the road became more severe, and he had to resort to the berries, etc., he found on the way. He met a Wolf on the trail and the Wolf replied that it was a long way to the Sun's camp. The Wolf replied that it was a long way and no one had ever been able to find the trail, but he advised him to go and see the Bear, who knew all the trails.\n\nTo the Bear he went and was treated with the same courtesy. Again he was directed elsewhere, this time to the Badger, who told him to go and see Kit-Face. Kit-Face was the very best guide, and to the edge of the great water which had to be crossed ere getting to the Sun's camp.\n\nEarly next morning he went down to the edge of the big water and then he fell down and cried aloud, for he had never seen such a large expanse of water before; for he could not see the other side. His mother answered him by his name, and he was almost at the point of exhaustion, and just as he was offering another prayer to the Sun, asking for his guidance, two young men came running to him and asked him why he was crying.\n\n\"I have come here today,\" said Scareface, \"for Scareaway in my country is a very petty place. I want to marry her but she belongs to the Sun, and I set out to find him and to ask him for her. But I have been here a long time, and I have no clothing and food and game. I cannot turn for I do not know the trail, so I must die here.\" The Swans replied that they would take him across the great water. There was then that the Sun and Moon lived.\n\nThis gave Scareface great courage; he now knew that he was almost at the end of his journey, so he jumped on the Swans' backs and they swam away. It was a most awful journey, for there were a lot of creatures and people living in the deep water that he had never seen before, and he was very much afraid. But the Swans took him safely to the other side. There he saw the trail and the Swans told him to follow it. He had not gone far when he heard lots of very fine things lying all over the trail, bows and arrows, war instruments and very fine beads to work. He saw them all but he did not take any of them. He ran on the trail until he met a very handsome young man. His clothing was made of strange skins and his moccasins were sewn with bones.\n\nThe young man greeted him and asked him if he had touched any of the things he had seen lying on the trail. Scareface said that he had not. He was then directed where he was to go and what to do. Scareface coldly. Then the other replied that his name was \"Morning Star,\" and said:\n\n\"The Sun is my father and the Moon my mother. My son is not at home now but I will take you to our lodge.\" After a time they came to the lodge and there was a very pretty scene with the bright colors. Scareface had never seen such a fine lodge before, so he was afraid to go towards the lodge, until Morning Star's mother, the Moon, who was standing outside, spoke kindly to him and gave him food and asked why he had left his people.\n\nScareface then told the Moon his story and when she was satisfied she sent him back to his mother. So the Moon hid him under some buffalo robes. But the Sun knew that a stranger person was in the lodge for he asked, \"Who is this?\" the stranger was not from whence had he come? . . .\n\nAfter coming from under the robes, the Sun came to Scareface and was pleased that he had returned and asked him to stay a long time as his son was very lonely.\n\nNext morning the two young men went hunting, but were joined by the Moon no to go near the big water, and they went together together for a long time. Morning Star was sometimes very unruly and disobeyed the Moon, so she told Scareface to be careful not to wander too far that he should go near the big water. But on this occasion Morning Star was persistent and went out into the water and was almost drowned, when Scareface went to his rescue. Scareface carried her back to the lodge and told the Moon what had happened and she was very cross with Morning Star. And when the Sun came home that night she told him what had happened. The Sun said he would not forget what he had done and promised to give Scareface a promise sacred to ask for. So Morning Star told the Sun that she was pleased to hear that his girl had been true to his commands by not making use of the things he had assured her that he could make him nine men are returning to his people.\n\nSome time after the Sun took Scareface to the edge of the sky and told him to look down upon the earth. The Sun then said to Scareface: \"Everything you see is mine, the mountains, trees, prairie plants and animals all belong to me. I am the only chief. I am never die. The winter makes me old and weak but I grow young again every summer. And when I am old I give you the sign by which my people are known. If any person is sick or in danger, promise me to build a lodge if the person recovers.\"\n\nDRESSED FOR THE SUN DANCE\nand the lodge is to be built like the world, round, with arched sticks, one half to be painted red for me and the other half to be painted black for the Moon.\u201d The Sun then told Scar Face and his wife different kinds of belongings which he wished some medicine on the young man\u2019s face and the scar disappeared. He then gave Scar Face two ermine feathers to stick in his hair as a sign, the sign for the girl that he has given him, and they were to be worn by the husband of the woman who took the vow for the Sun Dance.\n\nScar Face went away to pray to the Sun after the Sun and Moon and Morning Star had given him lots of presents the Sun took him to the edge of the sky and showed him the short way back to earth, and then they along the Milky Way through the heavens. He followed this \u201cWolf Trail,\u201d as the Indians call it, and soon arrived back to this camp.\n\nInstead of going direct to the camp, he sat on one of the surrounding buttes and watched all the people as they were in the midst of having a feast. As he sat there one of the chiefs saw him, and thinking him to be a stranger sent a messenger to inform him of the visit. Scar Face came down to the camp and the old Chief recognized him, and immediately sent for the Sun girl, who came very quickly by his message. All the Indians saw that the scar on his face had disappeared and that he was very handsome, and all his clothing was of strange manufacture. He then spoke to the two crow feather and told them of his visit to the Sun and of the mysteries into which he had been initiated. The chief proclaimed that he should be their chief, and he married the Sun girl the next day. They lived to a ripe old age, but they were never sick, their bodies being free from blemish, and after giving to his tribe the mysteries taught him by the Sun, both heard his wife passed away to the Sandhills, where their spirits were in safe-keeping as they had gone to the place thus ordered by the Sun.\n\n---\n\nTO A BLOODY INDIAN HERO.\n\nRed comrade, come,\nYouth marked against, yet never reached across\nThe wide between the plains of loss,\nUnarmed, unaided.\n\nRed comrade, go,\nBeyond the line above the battle crest,\nAnd linger call and lost great west,\nAnd to the east, long ago.\n\nRed comrade, all,\nYou have yourself, and tribal will\nStill in the heart, the part your evening sail,\nAcross the passing fall.\n\nRed comrade, keen,\nA little of the west under, a little of the sun,\nOf morning visage, and the great wind-swept run,\nAnd peace be with you, comrade, sleep.\n\n---\n\nTeaching is founded on scientific principles, but teaching is an art. It is the finest of the fine arts. It demands the most varied resources, the skill of the sculptor molds clay and curves marble. The product is lifeless. The painter works upon the canvas and paints scenes, figures, landscapes. The teacher touches the life of the child, puts love in his heart and kindness into his soul, What a responsibility! What an opportunity!\nSocieties\n\nThere are seven societies under the supervision of the Teachers: Cadets, Girl Guides, Junior W.A., Red Cross, Band, Orchestra, Choir.\n\nThe Band and Orchestra help to make a spirit of happiness and contentment among the students.\n\nThe social activities consist of parties, meetings and moving picture shows. Miss A. Smith, of London, kindly presented us with a splendid cinema machine last year. Every two weeks films are given for the seniors, juniors, and pictures are shown weekly for the whole student body.\n\nAll social affairs are conducted with great care, so that while getting and giving pleasure the students have an opportunity to learn to do many things that will help them to have the best social conditions at home.\n\nForty-eight prizes were awarded to pupils at the Calgary and Carleton Exhibitions during 1925. Needlework and drawings received special commendation. The prizes consisted of seventeen Firsts, sixteen Seconds and fifteen Thirds.\n\nST. PAUL'S CADET CORPS\n\nC.A.G., D.S.O. The medals were presented in February by Major Mernagen, O.B.E., V.D.\n\nThe usual training and routine has been carried out during the year. H.F.S.\n\nJUNIOR RED CROSS\n\nA very successful Tag Day was held in Carleton last winter, from which a substantial sum was realised and sent to the Calgary Headquarters.\n\nDuring the winter Nurse Megarry took classes in First Aid and St. John Ambulance work. Twenty-five of her students were successful in passing the authorised examination. A winning certificate in each case has been awarded. \u2014 J.M.\n\nST. PAUL'S GIRL GUIDES, 1926\n\nDuring the past year St. Paul's Girl Guides have carried on with their usual routine which includes Drilling, Games, Girl Guide Lore, etc.\n\nMiss Olive Davis is the new Lieutenant.\n\nOn April 23rd twelve Guides were presented with the Tenderfoot Badge. They are now working for the Second Class Badge and concentrating particularly on the Morse Code and Signalling.\n\nAt the School Concert held in Carleton on May 12th the Guides took a prominent part, presenting such items as club swinging, flag drill, etc.\n\nThe first game of basketball of the season was played on May 24th; the Greens beating the Reds with a score of 24-1. \u2014 M.H.\n\nST. PAUL'S JUNIOR W.A.\n\nThe J.W.A. was re-organized in October last with an enrolment of 56 members, which has since increased to a membership of 71.\n\nAt our first meeting the following officers were elected:\n\nOlive Davis \u2014 Secretary-Treasurer\nJenny Hardy \u2014 Deputy Secretary\n\nIt was decided to devote one out of every four meetings to Bible Reading and Bible Study, the other three to be used for needlework preparatory to a Sale of Work.\n\nIn January we entered a Diocesan competition in Bible Reading Monthly, and won the Banner for the highest percentage of marks. The Banner was presented by the Bishop at the Annual Diocesan Junior W.A. and was received with much enthusiasm.\n\nWe expect to hold our first Sale of Work since organizing in the near future, and are looking forward to a successful day. \u2014 N.S.\nIndian Games (By S.H.M.)\n\nThe Indian boy is much like his white brothers and loves to play games whenever he has the opportunity. In the \"long ago\" he played at mimic warfare, hunted around in the brushwood, or performed some of the feats of animals; and in summer spent about half his time in the water. In winter he spent his top on the ice, slid down hills on an annoyance made of buffalo ribs and hunted rabbits.\n\n\"Top\" was always a favorite game with the boys. The wooden top was usually made of birch. The bark was removed entire or in sections. The top heads are marked with studs or painted partly for ornamentation and partly for decoration. The whips have four or six strands. When the game is played in soft snow, the object being to determine who can drive his top over the greatest distance without interrupting the spindle.\n\nAnother \"Top\" game is played upon smooth ice. The tops are water-worn egg-shaped pebbles. In the game the reels are set spinning by whipping them about at high speed and then together, the one that stops spinning first loses.\n\nAnother game commonly played during spring time is the \"whipping\" of flying arrows. No bow is used and the so-called arrows being but straight slender sticks. The players take an equal number of sticks. They are thrown by hand, striking them against the ground or earth. In some cases a large stone is used for elevation. The player throwing the greatest distance takes the prize.\n\nThe game of wooded darts or arrows is another boys' game, of the same general type. The darts are willow sticks of medium length. Each is sharpened at one end and split into three parts toward the other. These darts are usually decorated and some are attached tufts of hair. In the game the darts are thrown toward a target. First one is cast into a clump of bushes and the players in turn cast at it as a target. The use of the hair tufts serves as a guide to the count, thus if several darts fall almost equally near the target dart, the one whose hair tuft touched it is declared the winner.\n\nBoys often amused themselves by placing embers from the fire on stone and striking them with another stone. When skilfully done, this gives off a report like a gun.\n\nThe Indian boy is an expert artist and music. Since coming under the instruction of white teachers, he has readily assimilated the games taught, and now ranks, in games and athletics, not only as an equal, but in some cases sets the lead.\n\nSUNRISE IN ALBERTA\n\nA sunrise fills the eastern sky;\nSuffusing thus the entire sky;\nIt spreads, and soon the shades of night retreat before the King of light.\nThe morning star is in its prime,\nYields crown and sceptre at the dawn:\nThe morn's first blush is seen by me,\nFades from my sight at break of day.\n\nAnd now to my enraptured view\nMy sky is filled with golden hue;\nThe sun hastened to proclaim\nSends herald forth its living flame.\nO God! how lovely is the sight!\nThe clouds on fire in sea of gold;\nThe clouds on fire in sea of gold!\nIn fitting splendour then arise born!\n\nThe snow-crowned Rockies to the west\nReceive the rising sun's first beam;\nThe rising sun's effulgent light\nTints every peak and every height;\nA wave of glory sweeps each fold,\nThen slowly turns to burnished gold;\nNext, as the sun's first rays convey\nSuch baptism of the new-born day!\n\nAh! Nature hail thee with delight,\nGlad of thy rising, God of light!\nThe prairie in her spring-time dress\nWakes to the gladness of the breeze.\nThe early bird, in search of food,\nFor faithful mate and well-scented bread,\nFor the young ones, whose first gleam\nAnd sweetly tells his love-born theme.\n\nCreator of such vast array,\nThat fills the soul at birth of day,\nUncreated works formed by Thy hand\nProclaim the greatness of the command.\nWhat are a million years to Thee?\nA thousand years? aye, nay!\nThy wisdom's boundless, who can explore?\nI can but marvel and adore.\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nA Fascinating Indian Legend Relating to Waterton Lakes\n\nBy S.H.M.\n\nIn the long, long ago when the great country of North America was all prairie and inhabited only by Indians and wild animals, a party of Indians were camping by the banks of one of the rivers of what is now known as the Great North West. In this camp was a young Indian boy known as Sokumapi (the Boy). He was a strong hunter, a great athlete and an unsworn warrior, yet despite this he was very unsuspicious, and owing to his many evil deeds he had incurred the wrath of the Master of Evil.\n\nAfter a long and serious conflict, Ausetutsoki, according to the agreement Sokumapi accompanied him to his abode to be his servant.\n\nOn arriving at their destination Sokumapi found to his dismay that the only other living thing there was a large number of snakes and a very emaciated looking ass, which on no account was he to feed. The Master of Evil left the place for a few days, fearing Sokumapi would disobey orders that he must not feed the animal. The Indian noticed the poor unfortunate creature getting thinner each day, and out of sheer compassion fed them.\n\nThen a wonderful thing happened, for when Sokumapi went feeding the same number of snakes, and was most abusive about the treatment given by Ausetutsoki, and the ass then communicated to Sokumapi the secret of its unhappy state.\n\nIt appeared from the conversation that the ass had at one time been the unfortunate wife of an Indian chief, and that it was Ausetutsoki who had stolen her to his abode and changed her into an ass. She was now receiving punishment for her past misdeeds. The Boy and the ass then made some arrangements and contrived to effect their escape from that loathsome spot, and decided that during the next absence of Ausetutsoki they would make an attempt to find more habitable quarters. Immediately upon the return of Ausetutsoki he noticed the ass looking much better, and immediately Sokumapi not to give it any food, consequently just as soon as the Master of Evil went away on one of his periodical visits to his asscetero Sokumapi and others took him away, thus losing the part of a saddle horse.\n\nBefore taking their departure they made a thorough search of the whole place, but as they could not find anything of value, they tied these securely to the ass and started on their journey. Shortly after their departure Ausetutsoki returned, only to find that the ass and Sokumapi had gone away. The Master of Evil was very angry and immediately started to follow them.\n\nHe tracked them for a long time and just when he was getting tired of the chase he saw them in the distance and loudly called upon them to return. But they were so weak exhausted by the long journey he soon got up to them. Both the ass and Sokumapi were now desperate for their lives, scared and taken back to the abode of the lost. Just as Ausetutsoki was almost within striking distance of them, Sokumapi threw a stick at him, which struck him in the leg, a dense thicket of trees and shrubs, which to a certain extent impeded the progress of the Master of Evil. Such a quantity of the turnip-root was eaten by them that they desired and they started with renewed energy.\n\nIt was not long, however, before Ausetutsoki realized himself of his own strength in which he had been caught, and then started again to overtake the fugitives. They had not gone far before the Master of Evil was again in sight, but they were in this case therefore, Sokumapi depended upon the magic of the ass by throwing the stone at Ausetutsoki, with the intention that it might have been thrown up, so that while Ausetutsoki was climbing over the mountains the ass and The Boy made good their escape.\n\nIn due course Ausetutsoki came down over the nearby hills and demanded them to stop. He offered different bribes but all to no avail, and to show their contempt Sokumapi threw the bunch of moss at him in derision, which upon falling to the ground...\nproduced a tremendous swamp or marsh between the mountain and the province.\n\nDuring this long and very exciting chase neither the ass nor The Boy had partaken of any food, but they struggled on and moved in order to rid themselves of their dreaded pursuers. At the same time the Master of Evil was experiencing great difficulty in crossing the swamp, but after a time he managed to arrive on solid land, and with a determined grit started after his fugitives.\n\nIt was now seen that the sun was rising and Ausetanu appeared in the distance both the ass and Sokumpi resting under the shade of \"Dead Indian Mountain.\" Cautious, wending his way towards them, thinking that he could thus have them there, his catcher, Sokumpi suddenly turned, and much to his dismay saw the Master of Evil only a short distance from him. With tameless fury he pursued them, they had left, so in desperation he flung the root (which had peculiar medicinal properties) into the Indians' little ground whereupon it broke into many pieces. As they separated strong magic was again in evidence, for streams of water commenced to rise, which joined together and formed the lake (Pakmotokimin), which carried them along with it until its progress was arrested by the contact of other mountains; thus Ausetanu was safe upon the lake and the Master of Evil upon the other.\n\nSeeing that he had defeated the Master of Evil and was to his abode, there to be near his love. The ass and The Boy were delighted to realize that at last they were safe from the enemy's clutches. Sokumpi then started to return to his old camping ground. When he arrived there after many moons riding on the back of the Indians, he was surprised that they had left him as a great enemy, especially as he had overcome the Evil One. His past misdeeds were forgiven and he was made the Head Chief of the Tribe.\n\nFor some time after this he was deeply interested in relating his adventures to the Indians that he had visited, forget the ass which had so befriended him, until one day he noticed it walking around the camp very forlorn and miserable. The ass approached him and said: \"My life is a true one and I am not a tomahawk four times so that I may pass away to the Sandhills.\" Sokumpi objected to such an act and tried to remonstrate with him, still the beleagued animal at last, to stop the pitons well, he struck it on the head four times, and with the last blow it fell to the earth.\n\nBut the end was not yet, for there immediately arose from the fernbraes a beautiful Indian Maiden. All the camp heard the wonderful tidings. The Assume was so overcome with joy that he asked his newly found partner to become his wife.\n\nMany children were born to this happy couple whose spirits have long since passed to the Happy Hunting Ground, but \"Dead Indian Mountain,\" whose stoic profile hovers to the heavens above, stands witness as the memorial of this eventful chase. The spirits of their departed children still hover and watch over the silent glades and deep canyons of that enchanted and delightful spot, Pakmotokimin (Waterton Lakes.)\n\nWISE AND OTHERWISE.\n\nMr. Mackinley\u2014Point out what is wrong with this sentence. \"An unfortunate ramster has had his head broken and is dead from the fall they have taken him to the hospital, but they do not think he will recover.\"\n\nReply from promising pupil\u2014\"The ramster broke his unfortunate head, and fell into the hospital.\"\n\nMiss Martin to Jean\u2014\"Jean, you name four seasonsings.\"\n\nJean (without hesitation)\u2014\"Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.\"\n\nMr. Wilson\u2014\"What's the matter with you, Sam, you look hurt?\"\n\nSam\u2014\"I am, an idea struck me.\"\n\nMr. Hillier\u2014\"Digging a hole, George?\"\n\nGeorge B.

Feb. 16th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Rev. Canon Middleton, Principal of St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, has forwarded to me the following resolutions, which were passed at the 14th Annual Reunion of St. Paul's Old Boys and Girls, held on the 16th and 17th of Jan. last. The Resolutions are two in number and written as follows:\n\n1. That this Association request the Ind. Dept. to increase the per capita Grant towards St. Paul's School.\n\n2. That all children attending St. Paul's School be allowed a vacation of one week during the Christmas Season, this to be in addition to the usual summer vacation.\n\nWith regard to the increase in the per capita Grant as your department has, as I am rightly informed, undertaken to make a substantial increase in the per capita Grant to our Indian Residential Schools, the need of St. Paul's would probably be met by this increase, when the same has been approved and authorized by parliament.\n\nWith regard to the vacation of one week during the Christmas Season, I trust that this request may receive your consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nFebruary 24, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to resolution passed at the 14th Annual Reunion of Graduates of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. As you have pointed out, the Department hopes to make a general increase in the per capita grant to this type of institution. I regret that one week's vacation with grant at Christmas cannot be allowed as it is contrary to our general practice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.H.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that while at the Blood Agency during the first week of the present month I visited both schools. At the time of my visit there were 131 children in the R.C. School, and 128 in the C. of M. School. There are still a few children on the reserve who are not attending school, and I gave the Agent instructions to see that every child who was physically fit was placed in school. If all the children of school age were in, it would probably bring the attendance in the R.C. School up to about 130, and in the C. of M. School to about 135. Of course, this will vary in another year, as there are some children to be discharged, but there are a considerable number who will be old enough to be admitted to school next year.\n\nEverything at both schools is in excellent shape. The buildings are well kept from top to bottom, and I consider that everything is going along satisfactorily at these institutions. The usual squabble, of course, takes place between the schools every now and again, over some child who is admitted to one institution or the other, and it is sometimes a difficult matter for the Agent to pacify both sides.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Both these schools are getting along well, as reports show.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Oct. 28th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report on the affairs at the schools on the Blood Reserve. As you were there at the end of August and inspected both schools, you know what conditions are like, and I will confine my remarks principally to the school attendance.\n\nBoth buildings are in first class condition, being practically new. The only trouble is that the rain seeps through the brick work at both schools. This matter was discussed with you and the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the cupboards, shelving, awning, etc., and 200 barrel cistern at St. Paul's School, this has all been attended to, as per your instructions. Mr. Weston is doing the work and the cistern was under way when I left. We had also obtained prices on the material for the cupboards and shelving. As near as I could figure, the cistern will cost about $400.00, probably $450.00, and the cupboards and shelving, etc., will cost about the same.\n\nNew flooring is to be put in the two playrooms at the R. C. School. This is to be a cement covering with master mix and will be the same as the floors at the St. Paul's School and I must say they are most satisfactory. This is the kind of flooring that\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6971, file 764-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe Reverend Principal wanted. I did not get a price on this work as Mr. Weston agreed to do it on a 10% basis, which I thought was satisfactory.\n\nShortly after you left the Agency, I received a list from the two Principals, of children who had not returned to school after the holidays, also a list of children who were of school age and had not been enrolled in the schools. I found there were something like 75 children on the two lists, and I must say that I spent a great deal of time rounding these children up. I first saw most of the Indians and notified them that they would have to send their children back to school, and explained to them that all children of school age must attend. This brought in some of the children. There were, however, a number of Indians who seemed to have no intention of placing their children in school, and I finally had to have the Police notify them all in writing, as well as seeing them again myself. This brought all the children in who had previously attended, as well as a number of the children who were of school age and had not previously attended school. When I left the Agency, there were very few children of school age who had not been signed up in either of the schools. When examined, quite a number of the children were found to be not physically fit. These, of course, were not placed in school. The parents of a few children who were only 7\u00bd years of age signed up for them while I was there and they are to be placed in the schools as soon as threshing is over. I think the attendance is now fairly satisfactory as there are only a few children at large who have not been enrolled.\n\nThere is, however, a lot of desertion going on at the schools, especially at the R.C. School. During the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nDuring the last month some of the boys seemed to be continually getting away. In some cases, they are brought back by the parents, but we have to secure the services of the Police to bring others back. To give you an instance, I had a great deal of trouble in getting Joe Crow Spreads His Wings, a boy of 17, into the school. I visited his grandfather's place several times, where he stays, but the boy always avoided me. I finally got him in a week ago last Monday. At the same time the police scout brought in the son of Bob Steel, who had not returned to school; we had been after this boy several times. The same evening both boys ran away from the school. The Monday before that, I believe four boys got away in one evening, and a week did not pass but what some boy, sometimes three or four, would get away.\n\nI do not know the reason for this truancy. The boys evidently feel they can get away easily and take advantage of it. The man in charge of the boys at the R.C. School certainly could do a lot more than he is doing to keep the boys from getting away. My own opinion is that he is lazy and would rather read a book than be around where the boys are playing. The school authorities seem to be under the impression that if the children run away, it is up to the police to bring them back. The Department can well understand that the police soon get fed up when they are called upon to bring the same boys back time after time.\n\nWhile I was there, there was very little truancy at St. Paul's School, but about two weeks ago Mr. Middleton, the Principal, left for Eastern Canada.\nand a few days after he left, Miss McGarry, the matron in charge, called Mr. Pugh up, saying that they were having trouble at the school with some of the boys. The Agent immediately went to the school and investigated the matter. He found that one of the boys had struck Miss Neville, the boys' matron, in the face. This boy was about 15 years old. Another boy, about 17, told him to hit her again, which I believe he did. If the matter had not been straightened up immediately by the Agent, who happened to be in the office at the time the school called up, there would have been more trouble as Mr. Smith, the Farming Instructor, is not capable and certainly cannot handle the boys when the Principal is away. I do not consider it just the right thing for a Principal to leave the school without a competent man in charge. Miss McGarry, the matron, is certainly capable, but where there are a lot of big boys, from 16 to 18 years of age, it takes a man to supervise them properly, and I am of the opinion that the Department should take strong exception to the Principal of any school being away without leaving a competent man in charge.\n\nOn my next visit to the Agency, I will again check up on the list of children who are of school age and not attending, and as I have done a lot of recruiting for these two schools, having spent a great deal of time on it when I was in charge in 1926, as well as this fall, I cannot suggest anything further in the manner of recruiting. The Principals have suggested appointing a scout for each school. I cannot see that this would be any improvement on what we have now as we have the services of the police at McLeod, Lethbridge.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nLethbridge and Cardston, and the officer in charge at Lethbridge certainly acted whenever I asked him to and gave me all the assistance in his power. I do not think scouts would be nearly as effective, if they were simply under the supervision of the school, as the police have an Indian scout in Cardston, as well as Lethbridge. The only thing I have to suggest is that it might be well to send some of the worst offenders amongst the boys at the R.C. School, say to Lebret, and one or two from St. Paul's School to Elkhorn. If the Department gave the Agent authority to do this, he would be in a better position to deal with the matter if he found it necessary. I think this probably would have a good effect.\n\nIn conclusion, I might state that in my opinion, I think it would be in the interests of the school children if the proposed arrangements, which were discussed when you and Dr. Scott were at the Agency, that Dr. Molloy be appointed as Medical Officer of the two schools, be carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nREGINA, SASK., November 4th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the two schools in the Blood Agency which were recently inspected by Mr. Christianson. You will note that the work authorized by you is now under way, and probably finished by this time. You will also note that there has been a great deal of truancy among the boys at both schools, particularly the R.C. School, and that the Inspector had these children returned to school. I quite agree with the Inspector when he says that the Principals of these schools should not leave for any length of time unless some person who is competent is left in charge.\n\nMr. Middleton has never, in my opinion, been surrounded by a competent male staff; it has always been a one-man show. I also agree with the Inspector that it is not the business of the police to do all the work of bringing these truant children back to the school. However, I made a special report on this matter last week in connection with a request to have more police stationed at Cardston and other points.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM.

Had it occurred previous to that time it is quite impossible, I think, that I should not have heard of it either from one of the three male agents on the staff who were there at that time or from the Head-matron. I should also have heard of it, I think, from Mr. Indian Agent Pugh who very kindly came to the school at the time of my visit and with whom I had a long conversation. By today's post I am writing to Canon Middleton, the Principal asking him for a full statement with regard to the trouble mentioned by the Inspector in his report and as soon as this has been received I will communicate with you again.\n\nWith regard to the opinion expressed by the Inspector \"that the Department should take strong exception to the Principal of any school being away without leaving a competent man in charge\" I beg to state that our Commission have always insisted on satisfactory provision being made for the management of a school during the absence of the Principal whether during the holiday period of the pupils, or for any other reason whatever such as illness, recruiting or escorting pupils etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nIn the case of St. Paul's our Commission received what they considered a fully satisfactory statement showing the arrangements which the Principal had made for the supervision of the work during his absence and I am surprised to learn that any trouble developed during his absence of sufficient magnitude to be incorporated in a report to your Department. As stated above I will write to you again when I receive further information from the Principal.\n\nI am also noting that it the desire of your Department to be informed of the absence of any Principal from his post other than during the holiday period of the pupils.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Nov. 12th No. 103-1-1 and my reply to the same on Nov. 16th I beg to inform you that I referred the extract from the report of the Inspector of Indian Agencies on his visit to the St. Paul's School, to the Principal of this institution and requested him to furnish me with a statement in connection with the same. In his reply dated Nov. 22nd, he furnishes me with a copy of the written notice he presented to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh on Oct. 11th relating to his approaching visit to Eastern Canada and the arrangements he had made for the supervision of the work during his absence. He also states that the Inspector of Indian Agencies was aware of these arrangements as the Indian Agent informed him of the same the day he received them.\n\nWith regard to the \"trouble\" at the school, the Principal states that the details of the case were of a minor character and were confined to the insubordination of a junior boy who was backed up in his conduct by one of the seniors. He expresses surprise that the name of Mr. Smith, the farming Instructor should have been mentioned in the report as the boys were not under his supervision in his department of the work when the incident occurred, nor was he in any way connected with the case. Mr. Smith is a very energetic and competent farming Instructor, but Mr. Wilson, the engineer, and not Mr. Smith had charge of all the departments of the work during the Principal's absence with the exception of those which came directly under the Head Matron in the main school building.\nAs I received no report of any serious trouble at this school when I visited it on Oct. 21st last and have every reason to believe that satisfactory discipline was being maintained I am of the opinion that no further action is necessary in this connection.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTBRW/EM\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev.

Although the school buildings it appeared at first sight as though there could not be more expected, but on closer view, this turned out to be a line-up of Indians gathered around a cluster of good-looking sedans parked near the school. The sedans parked near the school were, at any rate, of the Blood tribe, which confirmed the gathering as such coming and going. Here was a statement of the Blood tribe in its most modern and civilized fashions, accompanied by Indians as most of the white sisters in any neighboring town would have been.\n\nThere were Indians, with pig-tails and moccasins, and Indians of all grades between the two mentioned. The most striking feature was that all these Indians spoke English very well, and very good English at that. Only the old-fashioned ones tried to turn into Blackfoot to express themselves. The business of the day after-school models of what such meetings should be, were brought forward and put to the vote in the most approved manner, and all ideas carried through without a hitch.\n\nwere inclined to look back at the old days with longing and regret, and at the present time with dissatisfaction. A reunion was a time when we arrived at the end of a period of experience. We looked back and saw the things we had missed, the memories of joy, happiness, fear, sorrow\u2014but it is that road that we must travel, and meet with His opportunities and privileges.\n\nWe must not say that we have no road, no tracks to guide us, for none has been laid down for us. But the track of the future is a clarion call to the voice calls us to go forth and make a seed plot of Christian teaching and living. It is to the world is the only source of Christianity, and the only means of spreading and interesting Christian influence. We must use the knowledge we possess, the greater knowledge we possess, to make use of, and to share that knowledge with others. As the old king of France said, \"I am not the one who had his coronation, but I am the one who had his Margaret.\"\n\nThese three supreme qualities are the only things that every man and woman needed to know.\n\nIt was an impassioned oration, full of feeling, and full of justice. One who has heard the bishop speak will realize it was the highest note that he had ever sounded. One heard him afterwards, both of Indian and white, that they were very moved, and this sixteenth reunion was a day destined to be remembered as the one at which the bishop spoke.\nTwo Hundred Present\n\nIn some ways, the main business of the day was the banquet at night in the large school hall. Such a thing would always be done at the business meetings, but the spirit of a great gathering, esprit-de-corps among the ex-pupils on the reunion committee, the hearty banquets and the ideals then held up to the young Indians, were worth any other cause. And if anyone doubts whether the old mission work has done good work, let him compare a typical present-day Indian with an old-time missionary, and he will be convinced. So it came about that the assembled company of 214 sat down to a dinner which was served by the ever-zealous members of the staff and their helpers.\n\nThe dinner, however, was really an excuse, for had not the Indians come there to have a good time? It was with keen interest that they listened to the reminiscences of these reunions, sketched by the Rev. Cyril Smith, who, during the early days of his work, he met various ex-pupils of St. Paul's, who were unable to talk very much English, and discovered that in most cases they had returned to the school since they had left. With time and opportunity now added in mind, the principal set about organizing the reunion, so that he might be able to hold for the school those who had graduated, and the result was seen Monday night. From a little over 50, the numbers had swelled to over 100.\n\nThe evening opened with the \"royal toast,\" had been duly honored. The first was to the late Bishop and chief supporter by Rev. W. T. H. Cripps, of St. Mary's, Lethbridge. He spoke briefly of the mission, but recalled visiting the school and returning several times from his experiences, then, he called forth the enthusiasm of the gathering. Loyalty was the keynote of what St. Paul's taught, and of what she demanded.\n\nThe old boys of the school have shown themselves true friends during the days of the war, and the example shown them will be remembered by the present generation and those to come.\n\nThe principal, Mr. Percy Creighton, replied, assuring the gathering that they had given him much encouragement that cooperation is the root of all progress, and that they would continue to work together for the upbuilding of Canada and the world forever.\n\nE. T. Featherstone also replied, stating that they would try to put into practice in life the lessons that they had been taught.\n\nBefore the next toast, Mrs. J. B. Shields, of Calgary, spoke briefly and tastefully. The toast, thus to the veterans of the Canadian Regulars, Mountain Horse, who in a sincere speech welcomed the guests, and thanked them for their interest in the school by their attendance. This was replied to by Mr. E. T. Featherstone, who was the recipient of congratulatory letters, and the promotion. He showed, with humorous grace, that the school stood for righteousness, learning and progress and responded to the Spirit's call, also expressing his pleasure at being present and humbly serving the Lord. In a speech of various hopes, the most important, being the one that Mr. Cyril Smith, inspector of cadets, also spoke briefly, summing up the theme, \"Fear God, honor the King, shoot straight and keep clean.\"\n\nSelections Given\n\nBefore the next toast, a humorous skit, \"Cohen on the Telephone,\" was happily rendered by Mr. and Mrs. Topper of the school. Perhaps one of the most spirited items of the program was the recitation of \"The Castle of Perseus,\" by the present pupils. Bertha Ruth, of the class of 1936, read \"The Castle of Perseus.\" So impassioned was the rendition that even the most casual observer felt distinctly uncomforatable.\n\nFollowing this, when the young fellows of the school, who were very intelligent performers, sang \"Home, Sweet Home,\" following which two Cornellians from the school recited a few choice bits.\n\nA most interesting presentation was next heard from Mr. Cyril Smith, who explained the circumstances of the awarding of the Canadian department for the best essay by any student on the subject of \"Confederation.\" Among those honorably mentioned was the name of St. Paul's, the only school in any Anglican school in Alberta to enter a competition. The bishop made the presentation, expressing his delight at the display of talent, thus greeted W. Beattie, of the G.P. farm, received a lovely platinum watch as a prize.\n\nToast of Evening\n\nThe toast of the evening, that of St. Paul's school, was proposed by Mr. Cyril Smith, who reminded the Indians by a feeling reference to the absence of the late Mrs. Smith, the matron of the school, who is temporarily in the hospital at Lethbridge. The keynote of his re-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal also informed me that there are 15 or 20 children on the reserve, past the age of 7, who are not attending school. The same applies here as at the R. C. School; the Agent is going to endeavour to get as many as possible of these children in during the Christmas holidays.\n\nI did not see the children in the classroom as they had just been discharged as I arrived at the school. However, I saw all the children and, from the standpoint of health, they all looked well. The grades taught are from 1 to 10.\n\nEverything about the school was in good order, and the building was clean and tidy throughout. The Government property is being well taken care of, and the school is in a good state of repair, with the exception of some of the walls where the water has come through the plaster. These will have to be re-kalsomined next spring as we hope that trouble has been solved by extending the roof, which work, I presume, has now been completed.\n\nThe school has about 50 head of cattle and at the time I was there they were milking 23 cows, so the children are getting all the milk they require. The school also had a fair crop last summer, raising 1,000 bus. of wheat and 2,200 bus. of oats, as well as a good garden.\n\nThe grounds\nST. PAUL'S C. OF E.

Canon Middleton, for 23 years the missionary at the Blood Reserve and principal of 69 pupils, addressed the board meeting of the W.A. at the school hall Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Blood Reserve is by far the most outstanding in the Dominion. Canon Middleton has been at the Blood Reserve, comprising 570 square miles, longer than any other reserve. It is larger, moreover, than the other three reserves\u2014Pikangikum, Moosonee\u2014Reserves combined, which with the Blood Reserve make up the Blood Confederacy. The four reserves have a total of 5000 Indians.\n\nAge of Romance\n\nScoring the appalling ignorance of children attending the schools of the Indians and the work being done among them, Canon Middleton gave a description of the history of these people. He said that the Indians he termed that of about 1000 years ago. The Indians had formed part of the Blackfoot confederation, which included the Sioux, and had developed a certain degree of civilization and had developed a certain degree of civilization. The conception of the Ten Commandments had been a very important part of the five commandments. Theft was the first crime on the list of commandments, the second being to steal, to give back stolen goods by way of compensation, and the third punishment of being shot at sight. Addictions were also punished by the body by degrees for cowardice, the fourth commandment. Toil, work and wear women's clothing, which was considered a sin, was a life for a life.\n\nAge of Transition\n\nIn the age of transition, that of giving up old ways and adopting new living to meet the changes brought with the white man's advance, the Indian fell to his lowest level. The government rations of meat, sugar, and other supplies, based on the means of livelihood the Indians had always known, did not meet the taking of such means by the white settlers. Canon Middleton pioneered the movement to help the Indians, and the government is now coming to realize its responsibility to these people.\n\nThe present age, that which the speaker terms the Age of Progress, is bringing education and cultural advantages to the Indians. These advantages to these people which the Blood Indians has been quick to recognize.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nMarch 19, 1931.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Minister has instructed me to send you a copy of a letter from Brig.

Murphy -\n\nDealing with Brig-General Stewart's letter of March 12th, I beg to report as follows.\n\nWe can hardly improve on the answers which were sent to certain questions asked by the Chiefs of the Blood Band, and I think it would not be useful to endeavour to expand these answers. I do not think any particular good would come of a visit to Ottawa of these Chiefs accompanied by their agent, and it would not be possible for me to go out there now. I know it would be productive of good if you could make it convenient this summer to see that reserve and to meet the chiefs. If you could be certain of such a visit it would be well to promise it, but if not, it would not be wise to say anything about it.\n\nI am not at all satisfied with the condition of this reserve. The Indians are difficult to handle. I know we have an excellent agent in Mr. Pugh. At any interview which I would have with them I would point out the fact that until they settle down and refrain from attending stampedes and fairs and attend to their farming work and cattle, they cannot expect to make any progress or attain comfortable circumstances. They are giving themselves up more and more to the aboriginal customs and the secret societies are playing havoc with any good that our educational system may inculcate. I am very loath to recommend repressive measures but it is almost useless for us to expend money in the West unless the Indians can be controlled.\n\nI will have an opportunity of discussing these matters with you before long.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Stewart, M.P.\n\nWill you please return it to Mr. Murphy together with a draft reply for his signature.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, April 27, 1931.\n\nDear General Stewart:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with enclosures, with reference to a situation on the Blood Reserve, near Cardston, Alta. The church rivalry on this reserve is very keen. Thirty years ago, after both churches interested had been labouring in the field for many years, there were about 100 Church of England Indians and a like number of Roman Catholics, the rest - approximately 1000 - being classed as pagan. Today, there are about 550 Anglicans and a like number of Catholics and only 100 odd pagans. Of course, this competition between the churches leads to many problems, which are difficult of solution. This is particularly true when the principals of the two Indian residential schools are recruiting pupils, and I propose, first, to refer to those enclosures with your letter which deal with the school question.\n\nSome of the Indians on this reserve do not take the white man's religion very seriously, and, when they have a pupil old enough for school, they have been known to play one principal against the other and to accept church rites from both. Then, there is the vexed question of Indian marriages. A mother will remove herself with her young children from her first husband and will take another who is perhaps a communicant of the other church. In a year or two, we find both schools claiming the children. Further, the adoption of children is common in Indian communities and, sometimes, it is very difficult to decide between the rights of the natural and foster parents. To\n\nBrigadier-General J. S. Stewart, M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\ncomplicate matters still further, very often, the ecclesiastical law does not harmonize with civil law, and, of course, the Department, when making decisions, must be guided by the practice of Canadian courts. With the assistance of the Department of Justice, there have been prepared regulations concerning the admission of children to Indian residential schools.\n\nWith reference to the case of Annie Chief Moon, who has been admitted to the Catholic School, I may say that the father, on his deathbed, received last rites of both churches and, consequently, both principals are claiming his children. He has been dead for 4\u00bd years and the widowed mother's wishes must be given some prominence. A full sister was admitted to the Catholic school nearly 3 years ago, and the Anglican missionaries have not protested. The Indian Agent was asked if he thought Annie, upon graduation, would likely go home to her mother, who is now cohabiting with a Catholic Indian. He replied that this was the probability. In view of these facts and the desirability of having the sisters educated in the same religion, the Department decided to approve of her admission to the Catholic school.\n\nWhenever a religious case is really difficult of solution, one or other of the reverend principals of the Indian residential schools is sure to be dissatisfied with the Department's decision. I wish to refer to two Indian girls who were admitted by the Department to the Anglican School, in spite of the protest of the Reverend Father in charge of the Roman Catholic School. He carried the matter to his Provincial Superior, the head of the Oblate Order at Edmonton, who placed it in the hands of a firm of lawyers. The protest, which was in considerable detail, was duly received and carefully considered.\nconsidered, but the Department did not change its decision. I refer first to the case of Irene Chief Mountain, who was left at the Blood hospital when the mother died in childbirth. This girl was raised by the Roman Catholic Sisters there, but, when the girl became old enough to go to school, the father refused to relinquish his paternal right to direct her religious education. Irene was placed in the Anglican School and is still there. The second case is that of Agnes Crop Eared Wolf, or Night Gun. Father Mauzy contended that Crop Eared Wolf, the father, who was Roman Catholic, should have the right to dictate concerning his child's religious education. The evidence brought out at the time showed that Agnes, when 2 years old, was given to Mrs. Night Gun, and, at that time, no mention was made of religion or school. Crop Eared Wolf had been giving the interest distribution to Night Gun, the foster father, and the adoption was apparently regular in every way. Crop Eared Wolf told one of the Department inspectors that he had no say in the matter - that it was up to Night Gun. The Department decided that the wishes of the foster father, who had provided for the child for 7 years, should be regarded. This girl also remained in the Anglican School.\n\nI mention these cases to show that principals of the two schools on this reserve are sometimes disappointed in the Department's decisions. Concerning the case referred to in your enclosures, it is the Principal of the St. Paul's, the Anglican School, who is dissatisfied. As already mentioned, department officers give these cases very careful consideration and always decide as they believe a civil court in the province would rule.\n\nWith reference to the Department hospital on the Blood reserve, I am informed that the Sisterhood\n\n- of the Roman\nof the Roman Catholic Church established a hospital on this reserve about thirty years ago and they have conducted it in a most efficient manner. When the Indians moved to the southern part of the reserve, and when the old buildings were proving quite inadequate for the demands made upon them, the Department decided to erect a new building near Cardston and to continue the superintendence of the Sisterhood in acknowledgment of their pioneer work and their devotion to the Indians.\n\nRegulations were made for the freest use of the hospital by Indians of all denominations: no clergyman of any denomination is permitted to reside at the hospital; no religious emblems or pictures are allowed on the outside or in the wards of the building; freedom must be allowed for religious services and ministrations of all denominations: the Indian agent is responsible for the conduct of the institution.\n\nAs I am informed that the hospital is being operated efficiently, I would not be inclined to make any change in the management. If the clergymen on the reserve will cooperate in a friendly spirit in educational and hospital matters I think there should be little cause for complaint.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not think I can send a substitute unless one of the senior officers of the Department happened to be in the district at the time.\n\nWith my earnest good wishes for a most successful Jubilee, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Scott, Esq., L.L.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nYou will recall that I wrote last year regarding the School Jubilee. It has now been decided in view of the postponement from last September, to hold same on June 21, 22, 23 & 24th.\n\nFrom all indications the House will still be in session, which will probably render your coming out of the question. If such is the case we shall deeply regret your absence.\n\nWould it be possible however for you to appoint a substitute to attend the celebrations and thus represent the Department. Various officials, including the Lieut-Governor of Alberta will be present, making a representative gathering. Would indeed appreciate any suggestions you may have for the successful carrying out of such a jubilee programme, and a letter dealing with the history and growth, from a Departmental aspect, would be doubly acceptable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection made at the St. Paul's School in the Blood Agency. In this instance the same applies as to the St. Mary's School; I did not inspect the class rooms as I intend to do that during the winter. I did, however, go over the school, their farm and garden, &c., and went into the general administration of the institution.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 127 children in residence and I was quite interested to note that there were 7 in Grade VIII, 3 in Grade IX, 1 in Grade X, and 1 in Grade XI: This certainly speaks well for the school. At present one girl is training for a nurse in the General Hospital at Nelson, B.C., and is in her third year; another girl is to take up nursing in Grace Hospital in Winnipeg, and begins her training this fall.\n\nThe boy cadets at the school won fifth prize for the Dominion of Canada in the St. John's Ambulance Corps. The girls of the school won fourth prize for the Dominion. The girls are taught sewing and general house-work and cooking, but they do not do any of the milking. They do a certain amount of work in the gardens, &c.\n\nThe boys get a certain amount of training in farming and gardening,\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\ngardening, and they attend to the stock, &c.\n\nThe school has quite an extensive farm. This year they have sown 220 acres to wheat, 80 to oats, 20 to grass and about 65 acres are being summerfallowed. Ten acres are under potatoes and other garden stuff. In all, the school has about 400 acres under cultivation.\n\nThey have 65 head of cattle, 17 horses, 100 chickens, 40 ducks, 15 turkeys and 23 pigs. At present they are milking 23 cows. During the year 1931 100 dozen of eggs and 8900 gallons of milk were produced at the school, and 1400 pounds of butter made. This produce was all fed to the children.\n\nI must congratulate the school management on the grounds around the school. After the school was built, Canon Middleton, the Principal, secured a man from the experimental farm at Lethbridge to lay out a plan for the grounds, and in carrying out this plan Canon Middleton has certainly met with great success. A terrace has been built up about 30 feet wide around three sides of the school. The length of the terrace is about 350 feet, and it is surrounded by a hedge. Inside the hedge grass, flowers and shrubs are planted, and the same are being planted in other places on the premises, and the whole effect is most pleasing. Words cannot describe the grounds, but they are simply beautiful, and the Canon certainly deserves a great deal of credit for the work that has been carried on at the institution. I am not always in accordance with Canon Middleton's policies, but am always willing to give a man credit where it is due, and I can only say that he is running a good institution.\n\nAs far as outside appearance is concerned, St. Paul's and Sacred Heart on the Peigan Reserve are the two outstanding institutions insofar as grounds, &c., are concerned, in the province.\n\nThe children.....\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-1, part 1)\nThe children all looked well, and from the higher education they are getting here (as mentioned above in this report) no doubt the class-room work is good. Canon Middleton is very fortunate in having a matron in the person of Miss McCary, who is a trained nurse and her work at this school has always been outstanding. I would be very pleased to have the Department congratulate Canon Middleton on having 12 children above grade seven, and also on the appearance of the grounds around the school, for in my opinion that is an important item in the education of the Indians. Surely at least a few of the children brought up in these surroundings will endeavour to live in better homes when they start out for themselves. I always emphasize this point when speaking to the children in class.\n\nThe school and outside buildings were all in good shape and in a good state of repair. One thing I might mention is that the horse stable is far too small. The Department are aware of this, but I know nothing can be done to remedy it at the present time; I am simply bringing it to the attention of the Department.\n\nThe staff at the school at the present time consists of the Reverend Principal, Bookkeeper, Engineer, Farming Instructor and a Labourer; the Matron 2 Female Teachers, a cook and 5 other women helpers of no definite capacity; so that the staff consists of 5 men and 10 women, or 15 in all.\n\nThe school crops looked well as do all the crops in that part of the country, and unless something unforeseen happens, the school should receive considerable revenue from their farming operations this year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs.

They also summerfallowed 110 acres of land.\n\nAt the present they are milking 23 cows have 72 head of cattle, 45 pigs, 100 chickens and 17 horses.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nSt. Paul's School is a very good institution. It is well managed and a great improvement has taken place generally in the last few years, which is very evident from the appearance of the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

There are three classrooms in the school, and the following number of children were in the higher grades:\n\n5 in Grade VIII None in Grade IX, and\n3 in Grade IX 1 in Grade XI.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, will, of course, report in due course on the classroom work, but I spent a couple of hours in each class, and in my opinion the work is being performed very satisfactorily. The teachers in each room seem to be very well qualified to perform the work assigned to them.\n\nHEALTH OF CHILDREN:\n\nThe children all looked exceptionally well, and there was no sickness amongst them at the time of my visit. They are well fed and well clothed. In looking over their supplies I found that each child has three changes of clothing. They are all kept clean, and present a very healthy and tidy appearance.\n\nBUILDING: The building itself is in first class shape throughout, and is kept that way at all times.\n\nDoctor Harold W.

PAUL'S SCHOOL (Continued).\u2014\nThe furniture is all well taken care of and in good order. The bed clothes, &c., were fresh and clean and all dormitories were in splendid order.\n\nMACHINERY:\nI found the boilers, laundry machinery and lighting plant in good shape, outside of the general wear and tear on the lighting plant, which has been in operation ever since the school was built.\n\nTEACHING OF CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF CLASSROOM WORK:\nI happened to be at the school on Monday, which is their wash-day, and was glad to note that although the greater part of the washing was done by machinery, several of the older girls were washing by hand. A great deal of the ironing was also done by the ordinary flat irons.\n\nThe girls are also taught to bake bread by the old method, and they are given a general knowledge of cooking. They do the cleaning up around the school, as well, and they are also taught sewing. Therefore, most of them, when they leave school, are properly prepared to take up ordinary household duties.\n\nOUTBUILDINGS:\nThese are all in a good state of repair. More outbuildings are, of course, required: For instance a utility building where a proper repair shop could be operated. This, I do not suppose, will be granted for a few years under present conditions.\n\nFARMING:\nThe school had a fair crop this year:\nOttawa, December 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 402-11A., C.E., of the 30th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, on the Blood Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department is pleased to note that general conditions at this school are satisfactory. It is noted, further, that the school is well managed; that satisfactory progress is being made in the classrooms and that the buildings are in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Canon Morrison, B.S.C., was host of the evening, assisted by his wife and Miss Mary Murray.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, M.C., Indian agent, proposed the toast to \"The Guest,\" corresponding to which Mr. J. S. Stewart, M.P., who touched upon the work done at the school and the progress of St. Paul's in the last twenty-one years.\n\nRev. Mr. Orton, M.A., spoke of the warmth of friendship that had always greeted St. Paul's entrance and he traced back many memories here.\n\nChief Crosschild, influential and progressive chief of the reserve, brought a message on behalf of his people, thanking them for the good work being done at St. Paul's and on the reserve.\n\nA toast to the \"Old Boys and Girls\" was proposed by the Rev. H. Parkinson, M.A., who expressed his delight to see so many old boys and girls.\n\nFrank Goodstriker, graduate of the school, gave the response, folowed by a speech given by an older member\u2014Mountain Horse. A musical interlude then rendered by W. Beete, B.S.A.\n\nThe toast to \"St. Paul's School\" was proposed by Rev. Mr. Orton, M.A., who stressed the responsi-\nbility of school life and an appealing and impressive response followed by Mrs. F. G. Greer, of Calgary, who saw not only the outstanding progress of the Indians, but a greater day ahead, when by education and proper training, fore-\nsight and new opportunities the Indians would attain full rights of citizenship in the Dominion.\n\nH. P. Filliou then proposed a toast to \"The Diocese of Calgary,\" commending the work of St. Paul's parish, its standard and position, and the advancement it had attained.\n\nHis lordship Right Rev. the Bishop of Calgary gave the final toast. He was glad, he said, to see such enthusiasm for the cause of Canadian life. Education was one of the leading forces, and the work of the school would have far-reaching effects.\n\nFollowing the speeches, the annual ball was held in the school auditorium, which was crowded by a large number of graduates and friends.

Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that it is our intention to petition the Provincial Government for a special school for the children of the employees of this Agency and I am given to understand that the petition will be granted. The trouble now before us is a suitable building in which to hold the school. There being but three of us\u2014myself, the clerk and the interpreter\u2014who have children to send to the school, it will be very costly for us to put up a building, provide the necessary furniture and school equipment as well as pay the teacher. It is also too expensive for us to put the children in a boarding school or for them to live in town and attend the ordinary public school; neither can we send them to a school outside the town as the nearest is 5 miles away. I have therefore to beg that the Department will come to our assistance and provide the means to build a school and furnish the same. The cost of a building is $22 will be about $600, including the furniture. (attached is a specification of material required and the approximate cost). If the Department should see its way to accede to my request, a saving could be made by purchasing the lumber at once from the Indians who are now sawing their logs and would be glad to fit\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nso close a market for their lumber.\n\nIt might be well to tell you that there are as many as 12 children of school age ready to go to school as soon as all arrangements are in order.\n\nI am aware that no provision has been made for this expenditure, but to wait for a year or more would be a year lost in the education of the children. I have therefore to beg that the request will be favorably considered.\n\nThe carpenter who is now building the ration house will have finished that building in about 6 weeks and if authority be given for the school he could start on it and perhaps have it ready for school to open at the end of the coming summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 15, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Verreau has informed the Department that it is the intention of the employees of the Edmonton agency to petition the Provincial Government for a special school for their children and has asked the Department to assist them in providing and equipping a building for this purpose.\n\nThe Department considers it very necessary that an opportunity should be afforded these children for receiving an education, but it does not see that it would be justified in making a grant exclusively for white children. It would like to have a report from you as to whether, in the event of pecuniary aid being afforded for the erection of a school building in the vicinity of Enoch's reserve, the attendance of any of the children of that band could be secured, and, if so, about how many. There are no day schools in the Edmonton agency and it is thought that, if a joint white and Indian school could be established, it might be successful and prove of benefit to the Indians.\n\nBe good enough to give this matter your early consideration and let the Department have your views.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and in reply beg to say that the conditions for operating a day school are ideal on the Enoch's Reserve, excepting only that there are few children of school age\u2014probably 6.\n\nThe living of these Indians has been provided for as you know through a surrender of land a little over a year ago and there is not now any good reason why they should not now send their children to a day school as regularly as any whites send theirs. In fact to compel them to do so will be no hardship.\n\nThere is one point which, I think, should not be overlooked if a school building is to be erected on or near to the reserve and that is the risk of encouraging the parents of non-treaty individuals, or their friends, to think that this school is intended for them, if they do they are likely to be a troublesome lot to deal with as they will be trespassing on the reserve very frequently if they do not take it by force. I refer to half-breeds, many of which are closely related to Indians of Enoch's Band.\n\nThe reserve is now 5 miles from East to West and 4 miles from North to South. If the school is located on the Northern boundary, say 2 miles from the N.E. and 3 miles from the N.W. corners it would be convenient for the Indians and for the Whites who reside northerly from the reserve. If the Department meets the cost of the building it might be under-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nunderstood that Indian children were to attend and that the Department would also pay on the per-capita basis for each child, say 5/ per day and the parents of the children of employees also to pay a reasonable monthly fee for the benefits the school would be to them, say $1.00 per month. The sum so received for fees will partially meet the salary of a teacher and with a school building the Whites, I think, would be able to maintain a school on the northern boundary of the reserve. My opinion is that if such a school is to be started that it should be inspected by the regular Provincial Inspector and the teacher should be qualified.\n\nThe within is an outline of my view, subject, of course, to your revision. A number of the Enoch's children are now in boarding and industrial schools. The band is a small one and I do not think that more than 6 or 8 Indian children can be relied on to attend a day school. The Agent should be in a position to give you a list of the children of school age on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 30th., 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to inform you that this Department has received a request from the Indian Agent for the Edmonton Agency to assist in establishing a school on the Reserve which might be attended by the children of the employees at the Agency. There are a number of Indian children of school age on the Reserve and also a number of halfbreed children in the vicinity. If it were possible to have a combined school for Indians, whites and halfbreeds the Department would be willing to bear a share of the cost proportionate to the usefulness of the school to Treaty Indians. Inspector Markle of this Department reports that the School might advantageously be located on the northern boundary of the Reserve; two miles from the North East and 3 miles from the North West corner.\n\nI should be glad to hear from you on this subject at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education\nProvince of Alberta,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ult., File 34560, with reference to the establishment of a school which might be attended by the children of the employees of the Indian Department on the Reserve near Edmonton, and also by the Indian and half-breed children in the vicinity.\n\nThis Department is desirous of encouraging in every way possible the education of all classes of children, but in the establishment of a school it may be difficult to estimate to what extent the Indian children would attend, and consequently the accommodation necessary as well as the amount of assistance which might be expected from your Department, would be very uncertain. However, I am taking the matter up further with the Agent and shall communicate with you further as soon as fairly definite information regarding the situation is to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSec. Department Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter to the Provincial Government respecting the establishing a school for the half breed, Indian and employees children at this Agency I beg to say that it is such a school would be impracticable to us for many reasons.\n\n1. The most of the Indian children are full of all kinds of disease and for no reason whatever would we allow the health of our children to be endangered by being in such close contact with tuberculous subjects which we pity but we could not place our children in a position where it is more than probable that they would become victims of the same malady through our imprudence.\n\n2. The social standpoint too is an all important matter and one which the Department seems not to have taken into consideration.\n\n3. The site suggested by Mr. Markle is 1\u00bd miles from the Agency and no nearer to any other place or house and to have it in such a place would not add 3 children to the roll. There are no half breeds around. There are 12 children of school age right at the Agency.\n\nWe can afford to keep up school and pay the teacher's salary if the Department will build and furnish a school house.\n\nTrusting in your high ideas about education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The building in question would require a lot of repairs to be fit for a school and I would be glad if the Department would order the main repairs to be done viz. new foundation, windows to be put in, and 500 ft. of lumber to ceil around the walls. The cost of this would be about $35 to $40, and would make the building so much the more valuable. The other repairs could be made and paid for by the supporters of the school unless the Department in its generosity helps them out. This extra cost would be from $65. to $75.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, asking for permission to use the old office for school purposes and for a contribution to put the building in repair.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot make any grant for the purpose of establishing a school exclusively for white pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nUrbain Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. I beg to inform you that the old disused and unoccupied office building at this Agency has been fixed up as a school for the children of the employees.\n\nA school teacher has been engaged and the school opened today the 17th January 1910.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 25th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you will recollect some months ago the Department had correspondence with yourself and the Indian Agent at Edmonton in reference to the fitting up of the old office for school purposes. The Department took the matter into consideration and was willing to incur the necessary expenditure to make the building habitable on condition that the Indian children were allowed to attend. To this the employees of the Agency took exception and on November 6th Mr. Verreau was informed that the Department could not make any grant for the purpose of establishing a school exclusively for white pupils.

Mr. Lancaster, Mr. Sandgathe and the writer have 9 children of school age and have no school to send them to within reach. I have written the Provincial Government and received in reply the information \"As you are employees of the Dominion Government and as there is no assurance that you will remain in your present positions for any extended length of time we do not see that it would serve any special purpose to grant you the privilege of having a special school district, you had better write the Dominion Government whose employees you are\".\n\nNone of us are able on our salaries to pay tuition and board for our children in school and the paying of a teacher on the reserve would also be a heavy expense we are rather in a quandary. There are two children the son and daughter of Joe Mountain Horse the interpreter at the agency who have been taught by their mother to speak English and to read and write. We would be willing to have these Indian children go to school with our children if the Department could favor the giving to the school the grant that it could give if these children were attending boarding school.\n\nThere is an old log building here that was used by Mr. Jas Wilson when he was Indian Agent here as a school that we could put in shape for a school.\nOttawa, September 12, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the establishment of a school for the children of the employees of the Department at the Blood agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the old log building to which you refer may be used for this purpose, but the Department cannot make any grant for carrying on the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As you are aware there is no land here that could be formed into a school district, so that source of revenue is deprived from us.\n\nAt the present time there are 15 children of school age living in Brocket, & these children are having to go without education because their parents cannot afford to board them out.\n\nTake for instance the case of Mr. Ed. LaGrandeur the farm instructor. He has eight children of school age three of these he sends to Pincher Creek this costs him $25.00 per month.\n\nHis salary is $65.00 per month in other words to educate over\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are in Brocket's children of school age whose parents are employed by the Indian Department.\n\nNow can you see your way to approach the Indian Department for a grant of $500.00 per annum to assist in maintaining a school here, we shall be able to get $225.00 from the Provincial Government; the balance we are prepared to raise among ourselves to maintain a school.\n\nRe. the erection of a school house there is one of the old houses still remaining on the old agency site if the Department could see their way to give us this we would take it down & rebuild it at Brocket at our own expense.\n\nAny other information you would like we shall be pleased to let you have.\n\nTrusting you will be able to give us all the assistance in your power.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The mission school is, I am told, 16 miles distant from the Agency. I do not know what obligation we have to provide educational facilities for the children of our employees, but it might be well to write the Agent and obtain a report from him embodying definite information as to the location, names of employees, number of children, and also the number of whites other than our employees, who would benefit in the establishment of a school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Megginson states that there is an old house still remaining on the old agency site which could be utilized for this purpose.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you on this application. There is said to be a white school about 4 miles away from Brocket, if so what reasons are there to prevent these children from going there?

A short distance west of Brocket there is an area which would be ample to form into a school district but a school placed in the centre of that district would be too far for the Brocket children to attend.\n\nInasmuch as taxes cannot be levied on Crown lands the usual method of financing a district at Brocket cannot be adhered to.

Boyle,\nMinister of Education,\nEdmonton.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am now Medical Officer of the Blood Indian Reserve and am compelled to reside on the Reserve. I have two little girls, 9 and 10 years of age, respectively, and we are six miles from the nearest school. I cannot afford on my small salary to send them away to school and I can see no way to give them an education.\n\nFarm Instructor Graham who resides close to me has five children of school age. His salary is $65.00 a month, so he cannot afford to send his children away to be educated. We live near Stand Off which would be a good point for a school. Unfortunately the settlers in the vicinity of Stand Off have very few children of school age at the present time, so that sufficient children of school age are not numerous enough to warrant the erection of a school at Stand Off.\n\nNow what Mr. Graham and I propose is that we pay between us $200 a year toward defraying the expenses of hiring a teacher with a school room free as our houses are very large. Mr. Graham further agrees to board and lodge the teachers free.\nWe ask that the balance of the teacher's salary be made up by a grant from the Education Department.\n\nAs we are employees of the Dominion Government a grant for the education of our children should be made by the Department of the Interior. We have already asked for some grant from Ottawa but we have not been successful. This is a serious matter and the children of the employees of the Reserve should not be allowed to grow up without any education whatever. A grant is given by the Dominion Government for the education of Indian children but not for the white children who are compelled to reside on the Reserve. We hope that your Department will take this matter up with the Minister of the Interior and see if something cannot be done for our relief. Our position is peculiar; we are residents of the Province of Alberta but employees of the Dominion Government and perhaps we have a claim on both governments.\n\nI have asked permission from the Indian Department to reside in Macleod but my request has been denied.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) W.D. Steele, M.D.\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nJanuary 22, 1918.\n\nHon. Arthur Meighen,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of letter received from Dr. N.D. Steele of the Blood Indian Reserve. This Department in the last few years has received many such appeals from officials of the Dominion Government situated like Dr. Steele with families on Indian Reserves in this Province. It would appear to me that it is not in the public interest that white children, members of the families of these officials, should be permitted to grow up in this country in ignorance.\n\nThe Province has no jurisdiction over Indian Reserves and in the nature of things it is not possible for us to establish school districts there. I have taken the matter up however with the Premier and members of the Executive Council of this Province and it has been decided to offer $100.00 per annum out of the provincial revenues to each\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think we have other similar cases and will you please let me know how many.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nMr. Scott,\n\nDr. Steele applied to the Department last Fall to reside with his family in Macleod until such time as his residence on the reserve could be repaired and made comfortable. He also stated that he had two children 5 and 9 years old, and as there is no provision on the reserve for their education, he had to rent a house in Macleod where they can attend school, and whether the house was repaired or not his family would have to live in town for schooling.\n\nIndian Agent Dilworth writing in regard to Dr. Steele's application made the following statement, viz:\n\n\"This letter stripped of its superfluous part means that the Doctor would still like to draw his present salary and live in Town where part of his time would be devoted to private practice. The part of it dealing with the education of his children applies to three other families on the reserve. I myself have to maintain a house in Macleod so that my children can attend school. Mr. Sandgathe has three children boarding in Town, Mr. Graham has two.\"\n\nI may say that Farmer Sandgathe has resigned and leaves the service this month as the Agent states he cannot live on his salary and educate his family. He draws $60.00 a month and is provided with house, fuel, light and the usual rations. Farmer Graham gets $55.00 a month.\n\nDr. Steele's salary is $1,500.00 with house, fuel, light, rations and transportation funds.\n\nAgent Schmidt at Duck Lake has made application to have his headquarters transferred to Prince Albert or be given an increase in salary to enable him to educate his children. These are the only cases that have been before the Department of recent years I think.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, February 4th., 1918.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am writing him today.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 5th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Dilworth,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter from Dr. N. D. Steele, medical officer for the Blood Reserve, addressed to the Hon. J. R. Boyle, Minister of Education, Edmonton, regarding the question of education for his children. Will you please let me have a full report on this matter. I may say that I have received a communication from the Education Department to the effect that after consideration of the matter it has been decided that the Province will offer $100.00 per annum to each school for white children established on Indian Reserves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. Dilworth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacleod, Alta.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\u2014I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo re Dr Steele's communication to the Hon J R Boyle Alberta's Minister of Education, and to say that the point made in Dr Steele's letter, is one that has caused a great deal of annoyance to the staff at this agency. I took up this matter before with the Department in 1914 but the Department could not afford any relief, I have also taken up the matter with the provincial authorities, with no relief.\n\nThe facts are that Mr Graham has 5 children of school age, Mr Steele 2, and have no school closer than 7 miles. The writer has 5 children of school age and no school, so that I am compelled to keep my family in town in order that they can attend school costing me $85, per month extra expense. As it is desirable that we employ married men on these reserves, it would seem to me only justice that some provision should be made for educational purposes. We cannot expect anything from the provincial Government it seems, the $100 offered would leave us in a worse plight than at present as we would be compelled to build schools and employ a qualified teacher, and in other ways meet the standard of equipment required of all Alberta schools.\n\nThe easiest way I see out of the difficulty is to raise the salaries of our men, Mr Graham and Mr Hillier to $75, per month and let them educate their children how they will. There is no doubt but that these men earn $75, per month, in fact any common laborer in this Province gets $60, and board. And as I have reduced the staff by one on farming I would advise that this course be taken.\n\nDuncan C Scott Esqr\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOtta\n\nIndian Affairs.

This could be solved by providing a team and suitable conveyance at the agency for that purpose, which of course will involve added expenditure, the cost of which will have to be weighed and considered.\n\nWhere schools are out of driving range, say more than six or seven miles distant, I think then the Department itself should provide facilities on the Reserve.\n\nThe state of affairs drawn attention to by School Inspector Torrie as existing at Brocket no longer exist as a matter of fact, for Gunn and Lagrangeur are no longer in the employ of the Department, but the instance is typical of conditions elsewhere.\n\nThe difficulty is one which I conclude the Department desires to remove, and a sympathetic treatment of the subject by negotiation with the Provincial Ministers of Education should pave the way to a solution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will recall that the application for a transfer of Mr. Mast, clerk at the Carlton Agency, was based on this objection. I met with the same complaint also from Mr. Weir and Mr. Walls when discussing with them their appointments to the Pelly and Qu'Appelle Agencies respectively, and there are many others similarly situated, in fact, it has been a serious problem for a great number of years. Because of this lack of educational facilities employees have been called upon to incur expenditures which have been a great drain on them and entailed real sacrifices.\n\nI think the difficulty might be met if the Department would take up the question with the several Provincial Governments.\n\nDuncan C.

I would appreciate any assistance you could render us along the lines I have already mentioned; any second-hand school furnishings that the Dept. may have on hand or any left over from some of the Industrial Schools that have been closed.

For the past year they have only had an average attendance of 35 at this school and in January, 1914, they were furnished with 100 single desks and there should be a sufficient surplus on hand to meet the requirements of the school the departmental employees wish to establish at Brocket. A globe, blackboard and teacher's desk would have to be purchased in any event, as there are none available.\n\nAccording to Mr. Graham's letter there are 15 children who will attend the school and 7 double or 14 single desks would meet their requirements. These can be purchased new for about $45.00 or $50.00, a 12 inch plain globe would cost about $8.00, a hyloplate blackboard, 12 feet long by 3 feet wide, would cost about $10.00 and a teacher's desk about $12.00 to $15.00, a total of about $80.00. It might be possible to purchase second-hand equipment from the Calgary School Board for considerably less than this amount.\n\nIf you are disposed to grant Mr. Graham's request, I would suggest that the Principal of the St. Joseph's Industrial School be asked whether they could let the Department have 15 or 16 single desks. Mr. Graham might apply to the Calgary School Board and see if they could furnish...\nfurnish the other supplies, which the Department could pay for; and, if not, he might get prices for a teacher's desk, globe and blackboard.

The neglect of these children is absolutely indefensible and the Provincial Government is helpless in the matter unless we simply provide, in the nature of a gift from the people of the Province, schools and education for these children.\n\nThe former Minister made a proposal to pay to any school established in this connection, the sum of $100 per year. This Government has decided now to make a better offer and to any such school, run in accordance with the school law, we will pay the usual grant to a rural school in this Province, namely $200 yearly, providing of course the school is operated for the full year. I shall be glad to have a definite decision from your Government at an early date.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd.) Geo. P. Smith,\nMinister of Education.\n\nHon. Arthur Neighan,\nMinister of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Neighen -\n\nWith reference to attached letter from the Hon. the Minister of Education for Alberta, I beg to say that I received the other day from our Acting Agent, Mr. Thomas Graham, a letter with reference to the establishment of this school and I propose to supply a few desks and other furniture and material for the school and to give them a grant of $250.00 a year to assist in maintenance. This, with the other financial assistance given by the Provincial Government, will enable them to conduct the school without undue strain. I am writing Mr. Acting Agent Graham to this effect.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Ont.\n18th April, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of April 9th, with reference to educational facilities for white children on Indian Reserves. After enquiry of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, I was informed that the Acting Indian Agent has been alive to the necessities there, and has submitted a communication to the Department as to the establishment of a school. The Department proposes to supply a few desks and other furniture and material for the School, and to give them a grant of $250 a year to assist in maintenance. This with the financial assistance given by the Provincial Government and from other sources will enable them to conduct this school satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Ad) G. Meighen\n\nHon. Geo. P. Smith,\nMinister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nApril 16th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your note of April 7th, with reference to the establishment of a school for your children at the agency. I am very much interested in the establishment of this school, and am very glad to give the assistance that you request. The following supplies have been ordered to be sent to your address from Regina and you should receive them in due course:\n\n10 double desks, a teacher's desk, a 12 in. globe and hyloplate blackboard.\n\nI am also allowing you $250.00 per annum as financial assistance if the school is conducted continuously throughout the school year. I trust that with this assistance you will be able to establish and maintain the school.\n\nWishing you every success, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas Graham, B.S.A.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nApril 17/19\n\nMiss Smith,\n\nPlease order 1-12' plain flake and\nspecial Kynloplite 12'x3' with necessary\nmoulding schedule through to be sent to\nMr. Thomas Graham,\nacting Indian agent.\n\nBrockley, Alta.\n\nfor schools for children of employees of\nPeyton Agency.\n\nN.S.A.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note your remark that the arrangements made will enable them to conduct this school satisfactorily. I am in receipt, however, of a very strong letter from Thomas Graham, the Indian Agent at Brocket, setting out that this will not cover the situation and appealing to the Provincial Government to go still further and give them a special grant over and above what is given ordinarily to a rural school. This appeal I consider to be altogether unreasonable and it is beyond all possible argument that it should be directed to the Ottawa Government.\n\nYou may not be aware that, in this Province, it is necessary to pay $900 for teacher's salary alone. I think the provision made is inadequate. The small amount of money involved is not the matter of serious consideration, but you will readily understand that this Government cannot accept responsibility where it has no legal standing, and that what we are offering to do admits nothing excepting our anxiety to see that children are not deprived of education. Our assistance is purely a gift.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Geo. P. Smith.\n\nMinister of Education.\n\nHon.

O. Patenaude, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDominion Government Stationery Office,\nOttawa.\nTo\n\nThe Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nThere are seven or eight heads of families in Brocket who are anxious to get a school established here for their children. Mr. Dolan, School Inspector, on one of his trips through Brocket, met the people here and we discussed the matter with him. At his suggestion we bought a good building and had it moved to Brocket for a school house. The Department of Indian Affairs have agreed to furnish it with desks, blackboard, globe, etc., and have also promised a grant of $250.00 per year, while the provincial government, through their inspector Mr. Roberts of Macleod say they will only give us $1.00 per day grant. This small amount would entail a hardship on some of us who would have to pay from $50.00 to $100.00 per year, and as we are tax payers in other school districts we do not think it just. Mr. Dolan intimated that in some cases the provincial grant allowed was as high as $400.00, and if so, surely this is a worthy case. I would like to point out that the employees of the Department of Indian Affairs who will have children attending the school are three in number, while those who are not employees and have nothing to do with the Department of Indian Affairs number five heads of families, so you will see that this school is not being established purely and solely for the benefit of Department employees. There are 15 children of school age in Brocket and I feel sure that we will have your sympathy and consideration. We have written the local school inspector to come and discuss this matter and advise us as we are anxious to get the children to school, but so far he has not put in an appearance. As we have gone to a great deal of expense already in buying this building and having it moved we would like to get the school under way as soon as possible.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 431\nAND\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nON.\n\nSir,\n\nThe following is a list of those who have promised to contribute toward the up-keep of the school:\n\n| Children School Age | Children Not of School Age |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|\n|                     | DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS $250.00 |\n|                     | PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT 200.00 |\n|                     | ALBERTA PACIFIC GRAIN CO 100.00 |\n|                     | SOUTH ALBERTA HAY GROWERS 50.00 |\n|                     | W.C.

This would not cost the Department much & considering the circumstances & the fact that Mr Graham was a good servant of the Department, I thought I would just bring the matter to your attention.\n\nThanking you for your consideration of the suggestions offered.\n\nI am,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C.

I regret that the Department cannot come to Mrs. Graham's assistance in the way that you suggest, as this would not be a proper charge against any Parliamentary appropriation. Mrs. Graham should look to those interested, who should be willing to purchase her equity.\n\nWhile I sympathize very much with Mrs. Graham and her family, it is quite impossible for me to issue any rations. The cost would not stand in the way, but such action on the part of the Department would be quite improper. When Mrs. Graham communicates with the officers at the Peigan agency I should be glad to be advised as to the result.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. T.

It was thought by him to be better to send all his children to Pincher Creek school in view of the fact that the two eldest had to go there to high school.\n\nThe school at Brocket is supported by the Agent, Stockman and Farmer and one non-employee, a merchant.\n\nPlease state in your ruling the amount payable to each employee under this grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

I have noted that the agent, stockman and farmer each have one child of school age, and that the clerk has 5 children, 2 of whom are in high school.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that, as this special grant was primarily for the conducting of school activities at Brocket, and as 6 of the 8 employees' children are of public school age, three quarters of the grant should be paid towards the expenses of the local school. One quarter of the grant might be given to the clerk, to assist him in the education of the 2 of his children who are attending high school. It is no concern of this Department if he sees fit to send his 3 younger children, also, to Pincher Creek for their schooling. Our aim and wish is to provide educational facilities at Brocket.\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention that Mrs. Thomas Graham, widow of the late agent, is living in Macleod and is in very straitened circumstances. Her husband paid $65 toward the expenses of the school building at Brocket. Would it be possible for the present employees to purchase this equity from Mrs. Graham?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

October in which you advise me to forward a voucher for $5.00 in favor of Mrs. T.

This man refuses to permit Mrs. Graham to sell her interest in the building. He is a most unreasonable man, disagreeable and thinks he is doing something smart in holding up this widow.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMarch 1st 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nI have heard the Department has taken over Mrs. Graham's share in the school at Brocket.\n\nAs I am no longer an employee of the Department and receive no benefit from the above school, I would be greatly obliged if the Department would consider taking over my share as I could use the money to a great advantage elsewhere.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlexander Bain\nOttawa, March 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 4th instant, in which you ask the Department to purchase your equity in the school at Brocket, Alta., which was established by the white residents of that locality. In reply I have to inform you that the Department considers you should sell your share to any parents who are now benefitting by the school and who did not contribute any of the initial capital expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Alexander Bain,\n436 Eighteenth Ave. N.W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI would be obliged if you would take up the following with the Dept.\n\nSince coming to the new Agency I have used my private car in conveying to Cardston my children so that they may attend School; I have travelled in this way the matter of 850 miles and have had considerable repairs to pay in connection with the car. As I understand there is a grant allowed for the Education of White Children on Indian Reserves I would request you to place this letter before the Dept., so to\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. T. Faunt Esqr.\nIndian Agent.\nCardston Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter received from Mr McMillan, the Clerk at this Agency, which speaks for itself.\n\nIn the connection I might mention that the problem of educating the children of the employees on the Reserve is a serious one. Since last September three of my children have been going to school in Macleod, in fact my family stayed in Macleod till Easter, necessitating my keeping up two establishments, but at Easter when we moved to the new Agency, we gave up the house in town & have been boarding out the children since, which you will realise is rather expensive.\n\nDuring that period Mr McMillan's children have not been getting any schooling until we moved to the new Agency which is eight miles from the school in Cardston, where Mr McMillan has been driving them in the morning & bringing them home at night.\n\nI am given to understand that at certain other Agencies allowances are made towards facilitating the education of the white children & would ask that some such allowance be made in connection with this Reserve.\n\nI am not asking you to pay for the education of my children or the children of anyone else, but would ask that some means be provided of getting the children to & from school & if possible allow something by way of reimbursement for expenses already incurred on account of no educational facilities being provided by the Department.\n\nThe Stockman & Farm Instructor who are located at Farm 4 are in the same position, with no chance to educate their children.\n\nTrusting that you may devise some means of helping us out,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 4, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the education of children of employees of the Blood Reserve.\n\nOn the Peigan Reserve a school was established by our employees and others interested for the education of children who could not, on account of location, take advantage of public schools. The Department assisted to a small extent in the establishment and also gives an annual grant of $250.00 towards maintenance. This grant was made on condition of a somewhat similar contribution being made by the Provincial Government and by the individuals themselves.\n\nI should like to have a definite statement as to what you consider would be reasonable assistance. You should give me the names of all employees, the number of children in each case and the arrangements which might be made for their education. You will understand, of course, that any contribution from the Department will be only towards primary education. Kindly go into the matter in more detail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. F. Emont, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of 4th Inst., which I have been delayed in answering on account of Jubilee Celebrations, Indian Commissioner's visit &c.\n\nFollowing is the list of Employees & children on the Reserve:\n\n- J. T. Faunt, 4 children, 3 of school age.\n- A. McMillan, 2 children, 2 \" \"\n- W. T. Ottewell, 2 \" \"\n- J. C. Metge, 3 \" \"\n- W. Betts, 3 \" \"\n\nAccording to the above there are ten children of school age on the reserve, but unfortunately they are not located all together, else we could establish a school as was done on the Peigan.\n\nI do not know what you would consider reasonable assistance in this connection, but I know that it cost me from $65.00 to $75.00 per month from the first of September 1923 to June 30th 1924, for three children & a corresponding amount the previous year for two.\n\nMr. McMillan has outlined his expenses for two months & a half while his children have been going to school in Cardston. I have not a statement from Mr. Ottewell of his expenses in connection with the boarding of his girl in Cardston in order that she attend school, but I know that it ate pretty heavily into his salary.\n\nMr. McMillan's, Mr. Betts & my own children could be taken to & from school daily if a proper conveyance were provided, such as a Ford truck rigged up as a bus, in which they would be warm in the Winter & if the Department saw fit to do so make a small allowance for the children to have a bowl of hot soup in the extremely cold weather.\n\nI understand the school on the Peigan Reserve has been closed up for some considerable time & if the allowance of $250.00 per annum is still being made, it no doubt is being used in some such way as outlined above.\n\nI don't know if the Department would consider the making an allowance for what expenses have already been incurred, which expenses you will note have been rather high & would prefer to leave it to your generosity to make what you\nyou would consider a fair arrangement for the education of our children.\n\nMr Ottewell will still have to board his children in Cardston on account of the great distance from school & Mrs Metge is teaching her own children for the present, but it will only be a short time till these children also will be beyond her capabilities as a teacher.\n\nI think, Sir, I would be well advised in leaving the matter in your hands for adjustment.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nI should like to discuss this matter with you at your convenience.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am prepared to give favourable consideration to an annual allowance of $250; but, before allowing this assistance from Appropriation, I should be pleased if you would indicate how the money would be divided between the five employees who have children of school age and in what manner each would utilize his share of the grant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. T. Faunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nReferring to your letter of 9th August regarding assistance for the employees in the education of their children, I have consulted with those interested & it would appear to be the feeling generally that the amount of money allowed annually be divided amongst the different families according to the number of children in each family.\n\nThere are at present 10 children interested which would allow of the allowance of $250.00 being divided into ten equal parts of $25.00 each & I would suggest that the money be paid in quarterly or half yearly instalments so that there would be no hitch in case of a possible change in the staff.\n\nThe above arrangement is what is proposed for the coming year & would not apply in connection with the year just past, when there were six children attending school & away from home.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 5, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to a grant to assist the employees of the Blood Agency with the education of their children. I have noted that you recommend a division of the grant of $260 on a per capita basis. You may forward a voucher for one half the yearly grant, now that the children are enrolled at school. The voucher should be in your favour, in trust, and should read: \"Payment of half yearly grant allowed by the Department to assist in the education of children of employees on Blood Reserve, for academic year 1924-25.\" On the voucher should be the names of the children and the school they are attending in each case.

T. [signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Alex. Bain at one time an employee at the Peigan Agency asking if the Department will take over his share in the Brocket School, which was erected by the employees at the Peigan Agency some years ago.\n\nIn 1923 I had correspondence with the Deputy Superintendent General with reference to the purchase by the Department of the share in the school of Mrs. Thos. Graham the widow of the late Agent, and under cover of Department letter No. 456560 dated 22nd December, 1923 I was directed to forward a voucher in her favor for \u00a35.00.\n\nMr. Bain not now being an employee of the Department should I think be reimbursed for the sum expended by him in company with others in building this school, and I would ask the Department to grant authority to issue a voucher in his favor.\n\nI might for the information of the Department state that the five original owners of the school building in question were:\n\nMrs. Thos.

Bain, a former employee at the Pelican Agency, that the Department take over his share in the building which was erected by the employees of the Pelican Agency some years ago for the purpose of conducting a school for the benefit of their children.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say it is considered that the remaining employees of the Pelican Agency who have children of school age should arrange for the purchase from Mr. Bain of his share in the school building. In the case of Mrs. Thos. Graham, widow of the late Agent, whose share in this building was purchased by the Department, this was in the nature of a compassionate arrangement, and it was not intended as a precedent in the case of other employees who might leave the employ of the Department and desire to get rid of their interest in the building.

It is expected that you will be responsible for the payment to him of the cost of the crating and for the transportation to the station of these desks. We hope that when they arrive they will be satisfactory for the school at Brocket.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A. Arthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with the instructions of your letter No. 345560, dated the 13th instant, I beg to state that I have today had six large size double desks brought down from Louis Bull's Day School, crated, and shipped to Mr. Agent Arthur of Brocket, Alta.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the position the employees at this Agency are in with regard to the education of their children.\n\nThe nearest school is five miles distant from the Agency. During the summer months the children are able to drive themselves, though the roads are almost impassable in wet weather, but in the winter it is practically impossible to get them to school as the road, which is used very little, becomes blocked with snow and the distance is too far for children to drive in cold weather. There are six children going to school from the Agency at present and there are two more of school age, varying in age from thirteen to sixteen years old. It is out of the question to expect the second semester to drive them there and bring them back, nor are there horses available, and we have no means of having the children nearer the school, so that it means that for the next five months our children will not be able to go to school.\n\nI understand that in some cases under similar circumstances the Department or the Government has afforded assistance to its employees, for the purpose of getting their children to school, and with this in view I am putting forward a suggestion that the Department or Government will help us to engage a teacher who would reside at the Agency and teach the children there. I have no doubt that with board and lodging provided free we could get a teacher for $60.00 a month, which would mean $300.00 for the five months. Would it be possible to request the Department or Government to consider this plan and to grant the amount as stated above?\n\nAs it is a matter of great importance to us that our children be educated, may I request that you give this your attention, and bring it to the notice of the proper authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Geo. S. Dodd\nIndian Agent\n\nW.M. Graham Esq\nIndian Commissioner\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter I have received from Mr. G. S. Dodd, Indian Agent at Qu'Appelle with reference to the difficulty of continuing the education of the children of the Department's employees at this Agency during the winter months. The Agent asks if it would be possible for the Department to contribute $300.00 towards the payment of a teacher for the five winter months, and I think this is a proposal that the Department might give earnest and favorable consideration to. The problem of educating the children of our employees is continually cropping up and in this instance it would appear that there six children actually going to school from this Agency and two more of school age who ought to attend, so that the engagement of a teacher for the eight children would be warranted. The Department has assisted in this manner before at other Agencies, and I trust will give this application favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 311-4C of the 7th instant, with reference to assistance to the employees of the Qu'Appelle agency in connection with a winter school for the education of their children. I should be grateful if you would prepare a list of the employees, showing the number of children in each case and their ages. You should enquire if it would not be possible for the employees themselves to provide some of the expenses. You might also intimate if a room suitable for a classroom could be set aside for this work and indicate what desks, etc., would be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your #345560 dated the 12th instant, I beg to advise you that the employees of the Qu'Appelle Agency are prepared to furnish a room suitable for a classroom and the necessary seating accommodation, and supply free board and lodging for the teacher. They do not ask for, or would I recommend elaborate equipment, but submit a proposal that in return for the use of a classroom and the board and lodging of the teacher, they might be allowed a grant of $60.00 a month for the five winter months. There are eight children whose education should not be interrupted; of these Mr. G.S. Dodd, the Agent has two, Mr. D.G. Stuart, the Clerk has three, and Mr. N.B. Fisher, the Teamster has three.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The agent, Mr. Dodd, has 2 children; the clerk, 3; and the teamster, 3; a total of 8.\n\nI wrote Mr. Graham, asking what classroom could be used, what equipment would be required and what portion of the expenses the employees themselves would meet.\n\nMr. Graham replies that the employees are prepared to supply a room and equip it and to board the teacher. They ask the Department to make a grant of $60 a month for the five winter months. Precedents in this connection are the schools for employees' children at the Peigan and Blood agencies, established in 1919 and 1924, respectively. The grants for these established schools are $250 each. I shall be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 311-4C of the 20th instant, with further reference to a school for the children of the employees of the Qu'Appelle agency. In the past, favourable consideration was given to an activity of this type at the Peigan agency. In this instance the responsibility was divided among the employees, the Provincial Government and the Department of Indian Affairs. The scheme was carefully thought out before the Department gave any assistance. As you are aware, Parliament does not provide funds for this purpose and at the present time I am unable to give you a favourable answer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The new schools are each situated about six miles from the Agency.\n\nBelonging to the employees at the Agency are the following children of school age:\n\n| Name                  | Boys | Girls |\n|-----------------------|------|-------|\n| Dr. Hill, Resident Medical Officer | 2    |       |\n| P.

E. Lloyd, is considering the project of establishing a Day School in the building recently vacated by the Anglican Indian Residential School at Onion Lake; the principal obstacle to this is the devising of ways and means to meet the cost of maintenance. A School District cannot be formed here as there is no assessable land. The Saskatchewan Government, recognizing our difficulty, has promised us $300 annually towards the upkeep of a private school, such as the one projected; but, even so, the balance required, devolving upon so few parents would be considerable; and I have been asked to approach the Department with a request for a small annual grant towards the upkeep of this school for employees' children until such time as the railway is built through this district and relieves the situation.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give sympathetic consideration to this request,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 25, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nI have your 137 of the 17th instant, and I note that you and the other department employees of the Onion Lake agency are endeavouring to establish a school for your children - such action being necessary, following the establishment of the Indian residential schools of the agency on new and distant sites. I note that there are seven children of our officers of school age; that the Provincial Government will grant $300, annually; and that you are enlisting the cooperation of the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nIf you can make satisfactory arrangements for a classroom and its equipment and can secure sufficient funds for a satisfactory day school, the Department will allow a grant of $250 per year. You might let me have a report in due course, and, if our grant is required, you may apply for it. A cheque would be issued in your favour, in trust.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

The late Mr. Roy McLaughlin, who was farming instructor at that Agency and died on the 7th November, 1925, also had a share in this school house, and I have just received a letter from the Indian Agent pointing out that his widow is in rather straightened circumstances and the purchase by the Department of her late husband's share, which formed part of his estate, would be of great benefit to her. I directed Mr. C. A. Arthur to prepare a voucher, which I now enclose, and I hope you will give it favourable consideration and in this way purchase Mrs. McLaughlin's share also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

In 1923 the Department purchased Mrs. Thos. Graham's interest, and I see by the correspondence on the file that there is nothing to prevent other interested parties disposing of their interest to the Department if they wish. As Mrs. McLaughlin is reported to be in straitened circumstances, I would recommend that the Department purchase her share in the building referred to.\n\nActing Chief Accountant.\n\nJuly 4th, 1928.\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan,\nSeptember 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of August 25th., 1927, No. 345560, in which I was informed that the Department would give an annual grant of $250.00 for tuition fees for the children of employees attending a private school at Onion Lake; and to ask that I may be favoured with a cheque for that amount for the current year.\n\nThe school has now been in operation for about one year and is running well. All the children of school age of Department employees attend, together with several outside white and halfbreed children. The average attendance for the past year has been 21.51 and, I believe, the school can now be looked upon as a decided success. All the necessary school equipment has been purchased and, with the exception of $45.00 still owing, has been paid for.\n\nWe have an excellent teacher in the person of Mrs. Smith, the wife of the minister in charge of the Anglican Mission here.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 11, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, requesting a renewal of the grant of $250 for tuition fees for the children of the employees of the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nThe Department is favourably disposed towards making a grant for the pupils mentioned, but before definitely deciding the amount, I would appreciate your supplying a statement showing the approximate cost of conducting the school mentioned in your letter for one year. You should show in this statement how much is paid by the parents of the outside white and half-breed children whom you state attend the school.

So the Committee therefore respectfully request that you consider this matter and let us know at an early date what...\nhelp we might expect from that quarter.\n\nBy way of information may I here state that the men then employed by your dept. have seven children of school age and their wives cannot very well get along without a school for their children.\n\nTrusting you will give this your careful consideration we are\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.B.

Before giving this request consideration, the Department would like to have further information. You might let me know the names of the white residents at Hobbema who have children of school age. You should state what the wage earner in each family is doing for a living and indicate the number of children of school age in each family. The names and ages of the children of our employees and of the Indian missionary should be given.\n\nThe Department would also like to know the approximate cost of conducting a school per academic year.

W.R. Cantelon and Mr. Farmer McLeod in connection with a school. I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nAt a meeting of the residents of Hobbema Village and surrounding country held a short time ago, at which the Provincial School Inspector was present, it was resolved to form a School District, and Mr. Joe Kramer, O.S. Nelson and W. Leckett were appointed Trustees, with T.G. McLeod as Sec-Treasurer. All of whom are not property owners.\n\nThe remainder of the District is made up of the following: Mr. F. Lentz Farmer with two children of school age, Mr. H. Rix farmer no children, Mr. Arnold farmer no children, Mr. Herring farmer no children, and the residents of the village, Rev. W.R. Cantelon two children of school age, J. Kramer merchant no children, O.S. Nelson garage no children, Chinese Restaurant no children, Revelstoke Lumber yard no children, Mr. F. Stewart who works on the Highway one child of school age, and A Whitford who works on the Railway Section has a half-breed boy of school age.\n\nThe only children living on the Indian Reserve are, T.G. McLeod, Farming Instructor, one child eight years old. John White, Half-breed Interpreter, five children of school age. J.T. McLeod Farming Instructor living on the Samson Reserve has no children old enough to attend school, and there is the \"Bobtail School\" 3\u00bd miles South of his home. In the case of John White, Interpreter, his children have all been receiving an education and are still attending the Ermineskin Residential School, as day pupils, and there is no reason why this arrangement should not continue.\n\nAt the\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nAt the present time the Rev. Mr. Cantelon and Mr. McLeod are sending their children to the \"Manito School\" which is located some four and a half miles south of the Agency. The proposed school would be about one and a half miles from the Agency.\n\nIt is expected that the maintenance of a school at this point would run into about $1,500.00 per academic year.\n\nI understand that the Missionary Society does not contribute any allowance in this case, but the Missionary would receive a grant towards the education of his children if they were sent away from home for an education. The Trustees state that they expect to get $180.00 a year from the Provincial Government as grant, and that a levy of about $5.00 per year would be made on the parents.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 4, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 7 of the 21st ultimo, with reference to assistance for a special school district at Hobbema. I note that the expenses will amount to approximately $1500 per academic year, that a $5 per year levy will be made on parents and that the Provincial Government is giving a grant of $180. I presume that the district school taxes will make up the balance.\n\nWhereas Rev. Mr. Cantelon does not live on the reserve and as there is but the one child of school age of our employees that would benefit, the Department believes that there is very little claim on Parliamentary Appropriation for this purpose. The interpreter's children are attending the Ermineskin School as day pupils, which arrangement appears satisfactory. There remains the 8 year old child of Mr. T. G. McLeod, the farm instructor. The Department prefers to postpone a decision regarding a small grant, until such time as the school is operating and the costs and receipts are determined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to request that I may be favoured with a renewal of the grant of $250.00 for tuition fees for the children of Departmental employees, who attend the Onion Lake private Day School, on the Onion Lake Indian reserve.\n\nThis school has been in operation now for about two years, and is a decided success. An average of about 25 children attend, made up of 11 employees' children, and 14 outside, white and halfbreed children from eight families. The employees' children are as follows:\n\nL. Turner 2\nDr. Hill 3\nD.H. Cameron 1\nR. Hamer 2\nD. Vanasse 3\n\n11\n\nThe amount received, and paid out, in running this school last year, was as follows:\n\n| Received                  | Expended         |\n|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Grant from Sask: Gov:     | Teacher's salary |\n| \" \" Indian Dept.:         | Firewood         |\n| Fees collected from 11    | Janitor          |\n| families @ $30            | Repairs          |\n|                           | Equipment        |\n\n$900 $900\n\nA matter of about $35 is still owing for equipment, but, apart from that, the school has no debts.

Mr. Cantlin, the Farming Instructor at the Agency, Mr. McLeod, and Mr. Kramer, with regard to a day school that has just been opened in the Village. At the present time there are ten children attending this school; three children of the Missionary, one from each of the Farming Instructor's homes, and the other five from the village\u2014children of Elevator men, etc. They are having great difficulty in financing this school, and asked me to take up with the Department the matter of giving a grant to the school. I may say that although there are only two children of school age at the agency now we might, in the changing of staff, have employees there with more children, and it is certainly of great benefit to have a school so near at hand. The only promise I made these people, however, was that the matter would be submitted to you.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM\nDATED FEBRUARY 18, 1930, ENCLOSING MR.

We have nothing to do with Mr. Kramer, but Mr. McLeod is well paid, and can easily afford to contribute towards the teacher's salary out of his own salary. His position is worth from $175.00 to $200.00 a month, situated as he is.\nKamsack, Sask.\n\n25th Feb. 1930\n\nSir,\n\nHaving reference to children of the Agency staff that are of school age, has or is ever a grant given for this purpose?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to a grant towards the cost of educating children of the Pelly agency staff.

Miller\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nSome years ago, the Department agreed to pay a grant of $250 a year to assist the employees of the Peigan Agency to establish a school for the education of eight children. Recently, the Department received a letter from W. C. Miller, Brocket, Alta., requesting us to purchase his share in the building used as a school for the employees' children. In making this request, he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"When the School District was organized on the Indian Reserve at Brocket about six or seven years ago, five of us, including Roy McLaughlin, Thos. Graham, H. Lancaster, Alex Bain and myself, put up $50.00 each to purchase the building for school purposes. The last few years we have had no school. The farm instructor of the Indian Reserve is, at the present time, living in this building\".\n\nYou will note from the above that Mr. Miller states that, for the last few years, there has been no school. The Department has, however, continued paying this grant, the last payment being made in November, 1931, when a cheque for $250, in payment of the grant for the academic year 1931-32 was forwarded to Mr. Agent Lancaster. The Department would appreciate your investigating this matter and letting me have a full report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I also note that you have received a letter from W. C. Miller requesting that the Department purchase his share of the building used as a school for the employees' children.\n\nThe information that Mr. Miller gives is quite correct: that the school has not been in operation for a few years. There have, however, been a number of children going to school from the Peigan Agency, as Mr. Lancaster had six children of his own and the other employees also had some children of school age, but instead of operating the school there, the children attended school at Pincher Creek, 10 miles from the Agency.\n\nAs the matter stands at present, Mr. Lancaster has one boy going to school, the others having finished school last spring. Mr. Patterson, the Stockman, has no children of school age, and Mr. Webb, the Clerk, has two children attending school at Macleod.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I have just learned that this boy has taken a position and has given up school. Therefore the Agent has no children going to school at the present time, and the only children attending school from this Agency are Mr. Webb's two, who are going to school in Macleod.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, December 31st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letters of the 21st ultimo and 14th instant, with reference to the annual tuition grant that has previously been allowed towards the cost of the education of the employees' children on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nThe Department recently received a request from Mr. W. C. Miller, in which he expressed a desire to have the Department purchase his share of the cost of the building used as a school for the employees' children. Mr. Inspector Christianson was asked for a report and it appears that this school has not been in operation for some years. Instead, the employees' children have attended the white school at Panther Creek. This was the first intimation that the Department had received that the school on the reserve had been discontinued. The Department is further informed that, at the present time, only two children from the Peigan Agency are attending school, viz., Mr. Webb's children.\n\nWhen the Department first provided this annual grant of $250., the employees on the Peigan Reserve had ten children of school age. This meant that the Department allowed $25.00 per child. As this number has now been reduced to two, it is felt that a grant of $50.00 is insufficient during the current academic year and a cheque for this amount is, therefore, being sent. Our funds are so limited that it will not likely be possible to allow any grant after the end of June, next.\n\nPlease let me know what amount Mr. Miller contributed towards the cost of the building that was first provided for the employees' children and if any previous arrangement had been made to reimburse him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following regarding the day school where the children of the employees of the Agency are attending.\n\nThe building used is one that was vacated by the Church of England's Indian Residential School authorities when they moved into their new quarters. It is on the reserve, conveniently situated, and serves the purpose well.\n\nThis school was started in 1927 when the staff and children of the two Indian Residential Schools moved to their new location five miles distant. At its inception it had the support of eleven families who contributed $30.00 each per annum, a provincial grant of $300.00 and an Indian Department grant of $250.00. Last year, 1932, it had the support of seven families only, who were assessed and paid $60.00 each. The provincial grant was reduced to $200.00, and this was aggravated by having to refund $100.00 to cover a mistaken move by that Department in 1930, leaving us with $100.00 to meet that source, and the usual Indian Department grant was not received.\n\nMay I respectfully refer you to Departmental Letter No. 345,560, of August 25, 1927, addressed to Mr. L. Turner, now superannuated, which has a direct bearing on the subject. In view of the fact that each family is paying $60.00 per annum and feel unable to contribute more, it was decided at a meeting that unless $300.00 from the usual Departmental grant the school would have to close.\n\nTwenty-three children, ten of whom belong to Indian Department employees, are attending this school at present. An early reply would be much appreciated as we do not wish to get further involved.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the day school conducted for the children of the employees of the Onion Lake agency.\n\nA cheque for $250, being the usual grant allowed by this Department, for the academic year 1932-33, is going forward and will reach you in the near future.\n\nAs it is possible that our Appropriation will be considerably reduced next year, it is very doubtful if the Department will be in a position to continue this grant for the academic year 1933-34. Please write the Department in connection with this matter early next July, when a definite decision will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nPeigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\n\nJanuary 6th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference your letter No. 345550 of rec 31st re. the School grant and Brocket school Building I beg to say the building was purchased in March 1929 from the Oblate Fathers and moved to its present site, the cost with improvements (floor etc.) amounted to $325.00, this was divided into five shares of $65.00 of which Mr. Thomas Graham (agent) H.C. Lancaster (clerk), Alec Bain (Farmer) and R. McLaughlin (stockman), all employees, and W.G. Miller (postmaster) each took one share.\n\nWhen the late agent, Thomas Graham died the Department purchased his share and paid the money to Mrs. Graham, and when the stockman, R. McLaughlin died the Department also took over his share and paid Mrs. McLaughlin. The Farmer, Alec Bain, was discharged and I wrote Commissioner Graham requesting that the Department pay him for his share and also later that the department take over the building and pay out the other three shares but this he never did.\n\nThe School has not been used as a school since 1926 or 1927 and employees children have been attending school in Pincher Creek or Vacoas and last summer was used by the Department as a dwelling for Mr. McNiven, farmer. As the Department has had an equity in the building for several years we have been unable to dispose of it and get our money back and I would request that the department pay the other three shares and own the building as it can be used for Agency purposes.\n\nIn regard the grant I would recommend that at least $100.00 be allowed Mr. Webb as he is at the expense of keeping two homes going and having several years experience of this with two homes and schooling six children on a small salary I know this leaves one with very little to get by on.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH.C.

C. Lancaster, Indian Agent, Peigan agency.\n\nYou will note that the building formerly used as a school for the employees' children, and which building was paid for by voluntary subscriptions of those whose children were attending the school, is now being used as a dwelling house by the farm instructor.\n\nWhen the former Agent, Mr. Thomas Graham, died and also when the former stockman, R. McLaughlin, died, the Department purchased their shares and paid same from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nThis leaves the following with an equity still in this building: H. C. Lancaster, Alex. Bain and W. G. Miller. Mr. Miller has recently requested that he be paid his equity. You will note the suggestion of Mr. Lancaster in the third paragraph of his letter, that the equity of the remaining three be paid by the Department. As the building is now used as a residence for the farmer, it could hardly be expected that the funds for this purpose be taken from the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nWith reference to the memo hereunder from the Schools Branch re purchase of the remaining three shares in a building which was acquired some years ago for school purposes, it seems to me that if it is decided to act on the recommendation of the Agent, that is purchase from Messrs. Lancaster, Bain and Miller their equity in this property at a total cost of $195.00, that the expenditure should be charged to the Schools Allotment notwithstanding the fact that the building is not now used as a school. I have two reasons in mind for adopting this attitude.\n\nFirst - Previous expenditure of a similar nature was charged to the Schools Vote and it would, therefore, seem that in order to be consistent, the balance of the purchase price should also be charged to the same vote.\n\nSecond - Funds are available in that part of the vote, whilst Administration, the only other Allotment which might properly bear the charge, has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nOttawa, January 24th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the building purchased for school purposes in 1919 by certain employees of the Pelican Agency. It is noted from your letter that the cost of this building amounted to $325.00, which was divided into five shares of $65.00 each.\n\nAs you state, $65.00 was paid to Mrs. Thomas Graham and a similar amount to Mrs. Amy McLaughlin, covering the amount paid by their respective husbands towards the cost of this building.\n\nIn applying for his share of the cost of the building, Mr. W. C. Miller, in a letter dated August 30th, last, stated that the amount contributed by himself and the others in the purchase was $50.00 each.\n\nThe Department is now prepared to purchase the equity of Mr. Bain, Mr. Miller and yourself but, before issuing cheques, it will be necessary for you to state whether $50 or $65 is the correct amount of the equity of each.\n\nThe cheque for $50.00, which the Department recently sent you, is all that can be allowed during the academic year 1932-33.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ten of the children belonged to Indian Department employees. Each family was assessed and paid $60.00 for maintenance, which, with the Indian Department grant of $250.00 and the Provincial grant, was just sufficient. Two of the families who supported us last year will not be able to do so this year as Mr. Roberge, general merchant, has left the district, and Mr. Hamer's successor has no children of school age. Five families will remain to carry on the work, which means, on the basis of last year's assessment, there will be $120.00 less revenue.\n\nIt was the intention of the school board to pro rate this amount and each family would contribute $24.00 in addition to the $60.00 paid last year. Any reduction in the Indian Department or Provincial grants would result in the closing of the school, as the above amount is considered the maximum that can be paid by the parents. I understand the Provincial grant will be the same as last year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the providing of a grant towards the school which is being conducted for the education of employees' children on the Onion Lake reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has been requested by the Treasury Board to consider a further reduction of ten per cent. in our Appropriation for Indian Education during the balance of the present fiscal year. This matter is now receiving consideration, and, at the present time, I am unable to inform you as to the amount of the grant, if any, that can be allowed towards assisting the day school conducted for the children of the employees of your agency. I would request that you renew your application for a grant after the middle of August, next, when we will be in a position to decide whether it will be possible to provide the funds for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The number of families supporting it this year is reduced by two, which means that the $120.00 they contributed will have to be proportioned and made up by the remaining five who are already taxed to the limit. The closing of the school is unthinkable as our children must be educated and there is no other school to which we could send them. The employees at the Agency will very much appreciate a favorable decision and a continuance of the grant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

The employees themselves have been responsible for the payment of all expenses over and above the amount we allowed. The grant for the purpose has been paid during the past from the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nRequests have been received for a renewal of the grant for the coming academic year. In my opinion, if it is decided to continue the grant, same should not be a charge against the Appropriation for Indian Education. I would point out that the funds provided by Parliament are for the education of Indian children only. These schools are for the benefit of the employees of this Department and, as such, any grants allowed should be paid from the General Administration Vote. I should be pleased to have your ruling in the matter.\n\nI might add that the fact that the Appropriation for Indian Education has provided these grants in the past is no reason why they should continue to be paid from School Vote, which, as you are aware, is extremely limited. The whole question as to whether this Department should be called upon to provide school facilities for the children of employees should receive consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Betts has done the same thing, and Mr. McMillan until this year, when he has returned having no children attending this year. Consequently we have rents to pay, fuel and light, and as school districts in Alberta do not recognize Indian Reserves as part of school districts and residence rules apply, we are expected to pay school rates when demanded. I may say that where families are residing in Cardston, in good weather week ends and holidays, return to reserve is invariably done for those periods. This cannot, however, be done in bad weather. I would like it understood that very rarely do employees themselves stay in Cardston over night.\n\nBy the arrangements as at present, I may say in the Agent's case, no inconvenience is caused Officials visiting the Agency, and are at all times taken care off, a factor which one in an Agent's position has to consider, and the Department may rest assured that this feature will always be taken care of.\n\nThe problem of getting the children to school from the four places is difficult in that the distance is great, and to solve the problem of education of employees' children, without effecting the Department either financially or from a duty point of view is difficult. Schooling for the Indian children is of course provided for under Treaty conditions, but there seems to be no way of approach to the problem for employees' children where premises are widely scattered on a large reserve such as this, and not adjacent to town or village, with its advantages. A copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nI should be glad to discuss this matter further with the Department if they have any suggestion to make regarding the problem.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

This should have been brought to your attention before this, but owing to my illness it has been held up until now.\n\nThe education of employees' children at the different agencies has always been a bone of contention; At least it has been ever since I came into the Department, and on various occasions employees have taken this question up with me. In a great many cases they live miles away from the nearest school and it has been necessary for them to either move their families to town, or find a boarding place for their children in the nearest town. Employees only getting a small salary are not able to do this. You will readily understand that a Farming Instructor, for example, who has several children, cannot send them to a boarding school. Neither can he afford to get boarding places for them in town, as the salary he receives will not allow him to do this.\n\nI took this up several times with Mr. Graham, our Commissioner at that time, but nothing was ever done in the matter. At one time I was out in Alberta with Mr. Graham and Dr. Scott, then Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and I discussed this with them personally. Dr. Scott instructed Mr. Graham to go into the matter thoroughly and make a recommendation as to what should be done, as he was quite prepared to give it consideration, and to give assistance wherever it was necessary to send the children away from home to school. Mr. Graham, however, did nothing about it and the matter dropped there.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nDoctor Scott gave some agencies an allowance of $250 per year. For instance, the Blood Agency and Peigan Agency received this amount, but it was never properly handled: On the Peigans the late Mr. Arthur, then Agent, had one child; Mr. Lancaster, then Clerk, had 6 children, and the late Mr. McLaughlin, who was then Farming Instructor, had one child; and the $250.00 was divided three ways. Other Agencies, however, that were in the same position received nothing. This gives you an outline of what has taken place.\n\nI have always been of the opinion that parents are responsible for the clothing and feeding of their children, and would have to pay a certain amount of school tax no matter where they were. But, where we found that an employee had to send his children to town to board I have always thought that some assistance should be given by the Department, but only during the time they are attending public school. No grant should be given after the children have reached the age of 16 years, whether they are still attending public school or not. The amount thus expended would not be great as a few of the agencies are within fairly reasonable distance from school. Also, some of our Agents have families that are already grown up. I shall be forwarding you in a few days a list of the employees in the different agencies, the number of children in each family, and the school facilities in each case. I feel quite sure that you will give this your earnest consideration. It is one of the matters I had intended discussing with you last summer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 400-4 of the 11th instant, regarding the providing of a grant to assist in the education of the children of our employees of the various agencies in the province of Alberta, where they reside at too great a distance to attend neighbouring white schools.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, at the present time we allow a grant for the employees' children on the Blood reserve, to the amount of $250 per annum, also a grant of $50 on the Peigan reserve - these payments being at the rate of $25 for each child. The names of the employees' children on the Blood reserve are given as follows:- Margaret, Florence, Willie, Eva Betts; Westray and Marjorie Pugh; Joyce and Doris McFarquhar; and Yvonne Wellman. Last year, only two children of the employees of the Peigan agency were attending, viz.: those of Mr. Webb. We understand the children of the other employees attended the white school at Pincher Creek last year.\n\nIn order to arrive at an equitable arrangement as to the grant that should be provided to assist the employees of those agencies where it is impossible to have the children attend white schools nearby, I would request that you furnish the Department with a list for each agency, separately, showing the names of the employees and the number of their children of school age for whom educational facilities have to be provided. You should state the amount of the grant per capita that\n\n- you would recom-\n\nM. Christienson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nyou would recommend be allowed. It is considered that a grant at the rate of $25 for each child would be fair, but I would be pleased to have your views. Please state, also, how you would recommend that same be paid, that is, through the individual employees or to the local Indian agent, who could distribute the grants and forward receipts. I understand that the clerk at the Stony agency has two children, for whom he has to pay a grant for schooling. You might consider his case along with any others. It should be understood that, in the case of any agency where the children of employees can attend neighbouring white schools, travelling to and from their homes each day, the Department will not be prepared to allow any assistance.\n\nI may add that, during the present academic year, the grant will be allowed for the employees' children on the Blood reserve to a total amount of $250 and for the employees' children on the Peigan reserve, to a total of $60. At the present time, these grants are paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, but, when we have this report, as requested above, if it is intended to continue these grants, they will be provided in our Estimates for the next fiscal year, under General Administration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nMorley, Alberta, October 13th, 1933\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have your letter No. 400-4 of the 10th instant regarding educational facilities for the employees' children at this Agency, and reply as follows:\n\nDr. W.

Besides Mr. Reid's children, Mr. Staley, Principal of the Indian Residential School, has two children and the Morley Trading Co., Manager, one child attending this private school. Mr. Reid pays at present, $10.00 toward the teachers salary, (per month). He has been approached on at least two occasions to pay more but has been forced to refuse as his salary will not stand it.\n\nAs well as the teachers' salary there are a few miscellaneous items such as fuel etc., that would not have to be met at a public school. Mr. Reid should now be paying $15.00 toward the teachers' salary, to conform with what the other families are now paying.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW. Barr Murray\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 13th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference your circular letter No. 400-4 of the 10th inst., regarding education of the white children on the Reserve, I hereto submit the following information:\n\nThere are two employees Mr. H.E. Hetherington, Farm Instructor, and myself. Mr. Hetherington has six children with ages as follows 22, 20, 18, 12, 8 and 5. Dr. Murray's children are of the ages 12, 6, and 4. Mr. Hetherington's two oldest children are earning their own living and the youngest one is not yet of school age. One child (18 yrs. of age) attends Central High School in Calgary, and the other two attend the day school at Midnapore, Alta. Dr. Murray's youngest child is not yet of school age but the other two attend St. Mary's Separate School in Calgary. Midnapore, where two of Mr. Hetherington's children attend school, is situated five miles from the Agency. Transportation for the children attending school in Calgary is provided for by the Agency car unit by the Rev. Mr. Gibney, who has children attending school in Calgary. None of the children attending schools in Calgary, is boarding in the City nor have any of the family moved to the City.\n\nMr. Hetherington pays $50.00 per year high school fees to the City of Calgary and $16.00 to the Midnapore School. Dr. Murray has been paying a proportionate cost for the operation of the Agency car which has amounted to approximately $225.00 in the past two years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. M.

This was the nearest available school where satisfactory arrangements for board and lodging could be made for the child. The distance is about 18 miles. Tuition fees - $15.00; board and lodging - per month - $15.00, tuition fees - $1.60, transportation rate - $6.55, a total of $23.15 per month. She is staying in a private home. Under this arrangement, the child is brought home on Friday nights and taken back to St. Paul on Sunday nights.\n\nMr. Boorse has made arrangements to have his boy Kenneth attend school at Roseneath, the distance about 11 miles from the agency. The cost at present is as follows: board and lodging $15.00, transportation costs - about $4.50, making a total cost of $19.50 per month. This boy is also brought home on Friday nights and taken back to school on Sunday nights. There is no special tuition fee in this case as Mr. Boorse is paying taxes on land owned in the Roseneath school district. This boy is also staying at a private home.\n\nThe two children are the only ones of school age in this agency at present.\n\nI might mention that for one year, while my boy was of school age, we tried out the plan of employing a qualified teacher to conduct a school for the employees' children at the Agency. Four children attended school at that time and the cost was $20.00 per child per month, exclusive of the cost of school materials paid. The teacher was engaged through the Provincial Department of Education and a grant was applied for. The grant allowed amounted to about $12.90 per term. This plan was discontinued when two of the children were removed from this agency as the cost then was found prohibitive. I then found it necessary to send my boy to Edmonton. The cost of keeping him there was approximately $40.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.Gullion\nIndian Agent.\n\nM.

It has been called to my attention by Mr. T.G. McLeod, the farm instructor, that he has been paying a school tax of $24.00 per year on the house that he has been living in, which is of course Government property.\n\nThe reason for this is, that owing to this school district being so small, being nearly surrounded by the Indian Reserve, Mr. McLeod, who was the principal organizer of this school district, had to consent to pay an assessment on the house he is living in, in order to furnish enough taxable property to organize a school district. If he withdrew this support, the present school would be closed.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I would recommend very strongly that the Department allow an annual grant toward the school taxes, in order that the present school could be kept open.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCol.

In the case of the G.P.Farm, five miles to school, Cardston is the only available school. Road conditions at times in winter prevent the assurance of attendance.\n\nAgency. Same as above.\n\nFarm Hour. These children could go to Glenwood, but have the river to cross, and a mileage of about nine miles. The river would prevent attendance at least two months in the year, and it would be nearer to Cardston if all land routes were used. Cardston is the only solution in this case.\n\nStand Off. At this point there is a school situated three miles away (Lone Rock). The river has to be crossed here and then this river is high, during June and July, and at times at flood stage. Under conditions the children either do not attend or have a further three miles to go by land route, making it six miles. There is a possibility that the Lone Rock school may close down, in which event Macleod is the logical point, and residence or boarding would apply here.\n\nIt will be noted that in three years time there will be fifteen pupils to attend schools, and if the present employees are retained, the average will be high for five to eight years, and will not be below fourteen pupils.\n\nOwing to distances on the reserve, the establishing of a school would not meet the conditions, and it does seem to me that the present system is the only solution that suits the conditions, as the greatest hardship is on the shoulders of the employees who are carrying the expenses of maintaining two homes and its consequent cost, or paying for the boarding one's children and the consequent loss of contact with them under the latter condition.\n\nIn outside districts it will be noted that all schools are not more than four miles apart in organized districts, and children have not more than an average of 2\u00bd miles to attend. In proximity to town, it will be noted that van service is maintained.\n\nI may say in a recent ruling of the city of Lethbridge that non residents, even though they rent in town, must pay all fees in connection with children's education, from outside districts. This is also my information as obtained from the Department of Education in Edmonton.

Christensen, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nC.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent,\nCalgary Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nCALGARY, ALTA., October 24th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 11th instant in connection with the difficulties experienced by some of our employees at the different agencies in this province in the education of their children, I have the honour to submit herewith letters from each Agent, giving the number of children at the Agency, their ages, &c., the distance from school and cost in each case of having them educated.\n\nThe Blackfoot Agency does not give much concern as a number of the employees just live a short distance from Gleichen where their children attend school. The two stockmen are some distance from the nearest school, but at the present time their children are driving to Gleichen and Cluny. Previous winters both families have lived in Gleichen.\n\nThe Blood Agency is one place where there is a real problem: There are 16 children amongst the employees and all have to be sent away to school.\n\nYou will note that the children from the Edmonton Agency drive 4\u00bd miles to school. I think this is working out satisfactorily. The Farming Instructor at Alexander's Reserve, Mr. Pete Conway, has three children driving a distance of 6\u00bd miles to school. There does not appear to be any real problem at this Agency. At Hobbema Agency there is a school just a short distance from the Agency.\n\nMr. L'Heureux, the Agent at Lesser Slave Lake, has four children going to school at a cost of $15.00 per month and $16.00 a year, tax. At the Peigans, only the Clerk's two children are attending school at the present time and they drive to Pincher Creek each morning at a cost of $10.00 per month. At Saddle Lake there are only three children of school age and they\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nhave to be sent away to school.\n\nAt the Sarcee Reserve, the Agent's two children are driven to town each morning and the Farming Instructor's children drive to Midnapore. There are only two children attending school at Morley Agency and these are the Clerk's children. They attend the day school there for which Mr. Reid has to pay $10.00 per month, and this will probably be raised to $15.00. This is more than he can really afford to pay.\n\nIn many cases employees from different agencies move their families to town when school commences; this is something I am very much opposed to. When the Department furnish an employee with a home, that is where his family should be. An employee \"batching it\" at an Agency and his family living in town is not, as a rule, satisfactory. Too much time is lost travelling back and forth.\n\nIf there is any further information that you require I shall be only too pleased to furnish it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, November 15, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith regard to the grants made by the Department towards providing facilities for the education of employees' children, it would appear that payments have been made for some years on the authority of the Deputy Minister. Whether this is sufficient authority is open to question as such grants may be regarded as supplementing the salaries and allowances of the personnel concerned. The Deputy Minister's authority for these payments apparently has become the accepted practice although I was recently informed by an official of the Auditor General's Office that he was contemplating writing the Department regarding the matter. I intimated that the Department had the matter under consideration, and was then informed that under the circumstances no official observation would be made for the present. It was suggested, however, that the whole question be investigated with a view of drafting suitable regulations regarding conditions under which such assistance would be granted and that proper authority be obtained for the expenditure.\n\nAs only three Agencies, Blood, Peigan, and Onion Lake, are affected at present, and the amount involved is only around $600.00, I would suggest that, pending consideration of the whole question, any payments which may be authorized be charged to the Education allotment as formerly.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith regard to the grants made by the Department towards providing facilities for the education of employees' children, it would appear that payments have been made for some years on the authority of the Deputy Minister.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department's letter No. 345560 of the 24th ultimo in connection with the education of employees' children in the various agencies in the Province of Alberta. In this connection I wish to point out that the grant would have to come under two or three different headings. For instance, in certain agencies the children have to be sent away to board or the mother has to move to town with the children. In other cases the parents are put to the expense of hiring a teacher; and in a few agencies the children are able to drive to public schools that are situated near the reservations.\n\nI forwarded to the Department letters from all the Agents showing the number of children in the different agencies and giving the school facilities. I would recommend that where the children have to be sent away to school and the parents have to pay board at a cost of from $15.00 to $20.00 a month, the Department give a grant of $5.00 a month for each child for ten months, which would amount to $50.00 for the school year. Other cases could be dealt with accordingly.\n\nI shall now take each agency separately and outline the situation, giving my recommendations in each case:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY:\n\nThere is no difficulty at this Agency in connection with getting schooling for the employees' children, as they are all able to drive to nearby towns. Most of them attend school at Gleichen, with the exception of Mr. Evans' children who attend at Cluny.\n\nSADDLE LAKE AGENCY:\n\nMr. R. W. Secord, the Clerk, has one girl seven years old, and the nearest available school is at St. Paul. He pays $16.60 a month for board and tuition. Mr. J. H. Boorse, Farming Instructor, has one boy attending school and it costs him $5.00 a month for board. I would recommend that each of these two employees receive a grant of $5.00 per month towards the education of their children.\n\nBLOOD RESERVE:\n\nAt this point we have a real problem: The children of employees number 16 at the present time. Mr. Pugh, the Agent, has two children attending school, and Mr. Betts, the Farming Instructor, has four. Mrs. Pugh and Mrs. Betts are living in town where both families have rented houses. I would refer you to the Agent's letter which I forwarded to the Department along with the other letters in this connection. At the present time there are seven children that would come under the grant, and you will note by the Agent's letter that inside of three years there will be 15 children attending school if the present employees are retained.\n\nPEIGAN AGENCY:\n\nThere are only two children from this Agency attending School, as you will note by the list submitted by the Indian Agent. Mr. Webb, the Clerk, father of the two boys attending school, pays $10.00 per month to get them to school, which would mean $100. per year, as well as $16.00 per year for school fees. I note by the Department's letter that he is getting a grant of $50.00 per year, and I consider that this is quite satisfactory.\nSTONY AGENCY:\n\nThere are only two children of school age at this agency: two boys, 10 and 11 years of age, sons of Mr. George Reid, the Clerk. At the present time the old hospital building there is being used as a school, and Mr. Reid, Mr. Staley and Mr. Rogers, who runs the Morley Trading Company, have hired a teacher. Mr. Reid is paying $10.00 per month towards the teacher's salary at the present time. If Mr. Reid received the same consideration as the Peigan Agency Clerk, viz., $50.00 per year, I believe this would be quite fair.\n\nHOBBEMA AGENCY:\n\nThe education of employees' children does not present any problem at this Agency: Mr. McLeod, the Farming Instructor has one girl twelve years old, and Mr. Moore, the Clerk, has two children. These three children are attending a day school about a mile and a half from the Agency.\n\nLESSER SLAVE AGENCY:\n\nAt this point, Mr. L'Heureux, the Agent, has a real problem on his hands. At the present time the Agent has four children of school age and they have to be sent away to a boarding school at Donnelly, a distance of 70 miles from the Agency, as there is no day school within miles of the Agency. For each child he has to pay $15.00 a month, and $16.00 a year as a tuition charge. In other words, at the present time he is paying $60.00 a month for the education of his children, not counting the tuition, books, clothing, &c. As you will note in his letter, he states that the average cost is about $20.00 per month for each child. I think the Department will agree with me that $5.00 a month for each child would help him out greatly and at the same time, it would not be unreasonable to ask for that amount in this case.\n\nEDMONTON:\n\nThere is no problem here: The children all attend day schools and drive to school every day.\nSARCEE AGENCY: As the Department will note by Dr. Murray's letter, his children are attending school in Calgary, and Mr. Hetherington's go to day school at Midnapore.\n\nThis covers all the agencies in this province with the exception of Athabasca. From time to time various problems will arise and these of course can be adjusted. I would just like the Department to be sympathetic towards employees' requests. For instance, where a Farming Instructor is living on a reserve away from the Agency, where his children have to drive quite a distance to school and he is put to great expense in procuring driving equipment for them, I would ask that on recommendation from me the Department would consider furnishing a small grant towards the expenditure incurred in this connection.\n\nRegarding the payment of the school grant, I would recommend that a cheque be made out to each individual employee who is getting the grant, and the cheque can be forwarded through the Agency office. I do not think I have anything more to add to this, except to say that for the present time the amount required to take care of my recommendations would not be large, but at the same time it would be of great help to the employees. Take a Farming Instructor, for instance, who has to keep two homes going, or has to send his children away to school and pay board; He has not very much left out of his salary each month. During the period that I have been with the Department as Inspector I have seen so many cases where the parents are really denying themselves everything to see that their children receive an education. I suppose this applies to outsiders as well as to employees of the Indian Department, but as I have said before, this is a matter that should have had attention years ago, but was never given any consideration. I trust the Department will give favourable consideration to my recommendations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDecember 5, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the grants which have been paid by the Department towards assisting the employees of a number of the agencies in Alberta and Saskatchewan in providing educational facilities for their children, I would refer to a communication hereunder from Mr. Inspector Christianson. At the present time, the employees on the following reserves in Alberta find it necessary to arrange schooling for their children in towns adjacent to the reserve. The children have to be sent away to board or the mother has to move to town with them:\n\nSaddle Lake Agency: - The daughter of the Clerk.\nBlood Reserve: - 7 children.\nPeigan Agency: - 2 \"\nStony Agency: - 2 \"\nLesser Slave Lake Agency: - 4 \"\n\nBesides, in the Onion Lake agency, Saskatchewan, there are 10 employees' children for whom school facilities have to be provided. For a number of years, the Department has allowed grants, which have been paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, to assist employees' children of the Blood, Peigan and Onion Lake agencies. The grants for these children are being paid from Indian Education Vote during the present fiscal year.\n\nIn future, however, if it is decided to continue grants to assist the employees in the education of their children\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\ntheir children, I would submit that these grants should not be a further charge against Indian Education Vote. The matter should receive consideration with a view to drafting suitable regulations regarding the conditions under which such assistance should be granted. It may be necessary to obtain proper authority for the expenditure. Grants to employees, to assist them in the education of their children, might be viewed by the Auditor and the Civil Service Commission in the light of an extra allowance on salary. In any event, I would respectfully submit that this is a matter which should not further be a charge against Indian Education and should be dealt with by the Administrative Branch and the funds required provided from their Appropriation.\n\nIn Mr. Christiansen's correspondence hereunder, he recommends that, if these grants are continued after the present fiscal year, they be paid on a per capita basis of $5.00 per teaching month for each child.\n\nFunds for future payment of these grants are not being provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year.\nAMALGAMATED CIVIL SERVANTS OF CANADA\n\nOffice of National Secretary,\nDecember 4th, 1933.\n\nHon. T. G. Murphy, M. P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs a result of our recent Convention held in Windsor, Ontario, I am requested to place before you the following matters in connection with the Department of Indian Affairs. The numbers preceding the resolutions are for the use of this office.\n\n\"173\" Whereas large numbers of employees of the Department of Indian Affairs, resident of Indian Reserves throughout the western provinces, are debarred from giving their children an adequate education except at great expense to themselves, owing to the distance they reside from the nearest school district, and whereas these employees are compelled to expend large sums of money each year out of all proportion to their salary to pay for board and room for their children while they attend school, and this works a great hardship on the said employees, therefore be it resolved that the Department of Indian Affairs be requested to assist these employees up to the amount paid as grants for the education of an Indian child, upon the recommendation of the Inspector of Indian Agencies and the Indian Agent of the Agency concerned, such assistance to be proportional to the Number of children being sent to school; that is the larger the number of children from one family, the smaller the Per Capita grant. No child to receive assistance after reaching the age of eighteen years.

I may say that, during the past 14 years, the Department has provided grants in assisting employees in providing school facilities for their children. At the present time, we provide grants for the employees in the following agencies in Alberta and Saskatchewan:\n\n- Onion Lake - 10 children - $250 per annum.\n- Blood - 7 to 12 \" - 250 \" \"\n- Peigan - 2 \" - 50 \" \"\n\nThese grants have been paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, on the authority of the former Deputy Minister.

This would necessitate providing a grant for approximately 26 children of the employees, which, at the rate as recommended by Inspector Christianson, would amount to $1,300 per annum.\n\nNo similar request has been received from Mr. Knowles.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 400-4 of the 8th instant, in connection with the providing of a grant to assist in the education of employees' children in the various agencies in the province of Alberta and stating the employees and the number of their children in each of the agencies requiring assistance.\n\nAt the present time and during the balance of this academic year, a grant of $250 is being allowed to assist the employees in the Blood agency and $50 for the employees in the Peigan agency. It will not be possible, during the present fiscal year, to grant any assistance to the employees of the Saddle Lake, Stony and Lesser Slave Lake agencies, as there are no funds for the purpose.\n\nI have noted your recommendation, that payment of these grants be based on a per capita rate of $5.00 per teaching month for each child. In the past, the grants to assist employees' children in the agencies above mentioned have been paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, on the authority of the former Deputy Minister.

The teaching is very indifferent, so much that Mrs. Lewis and I decided we must send or take the children \"Outside\" to school or bring in a Governess. We decided to do the latter as the most economic way. We have now a qualified teacher living with us and have turned a small room in the Agency residence into a school room. This makes the problem of primary education expensive for us but the only way we could keep our home together.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Armit's boy is attending the public school at Fort McMurray at a cost of $30.00 per month and this amount deducted from his salary leaves him with barely enough to live on.

For a number of years, the Department has provided grants, which have been paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education - the last payments being for the current academic year, ending June 30th, 1934.\n\nThe Auditor General's office, unofficially, have questioned the authority for payment of these grants, it being held that they supplement the salaries and allowances of the personnel concerned.\n\nIn correspondence under, Mr. Inspector Christianson has given the names of the employees at the various agencies in Alberta who reside at agencies located at too great a distance for their children to attend neighbouring white schools. At some agencies the employees have conducted a school for their children, engaging the services of a teacher and sharing the expenses, assisted by the grant which the Department has allowed. Inspector Christianson has recommended that grants be\n\n- continued\ncontinued and that payment be based on a per capita rate of $5.00 per teaching month for each child. This would necessitate providing grants as follows:\n\nBlood Agency - 10 children - $500.\nPigeon \" - 2 \" - 100.\nStony \" - 2 \" - 100.\nAthabasca \" - 5 \" - 250.\nLesser Slave Lake Agency - 4 \" - 200.\nSaddle Lake Agency - 2 \" - 100.\n\nBesides, it would be necessary to continue a grant for 10 children of employees of the Onion Lake Agency, Saskatchewan - 10 children - 500.\n\n$1,750.\n\nIf it is decided to continue these grants, it will be necessary to provide the funds for the purpose in the Administration Vote for the coming fiscal year, and, in that case, the amount should be included in the Supplementary Estimates. In any event, I submit that payment of these grants should not be, in future, a charge against the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMuscow, Sask.,\nAugust 4th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to call your attention to the fact that there are eight children of school age at this Agency with ages ranging from 15 years to 6 years. Two of the children will be taking up grade 9 work next term, one grade 7, one grade 6, 2 grade 4, one grade 3 and one starting in grade 1.\n\nThe nearest school is Donamar, five miles away, which is too far from the Agency for the children to attend.\n\nWould it be possible to form a new school district for the Agency children and obtain the usual Government grant? The children must receive an education, and you will readily see that the nearest school is too far away for them to attend, and even if they could it is doubtful if there would be room in the school for them.\n\nIf the Department of Education could do something to help out the situation, I would be greatly obliged.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Frank Booth.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Huff,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nREGINA, Sask.\nRegina, August 8th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter received from the Indian Agent at Macow, Sask., with reference to the possibility of providing educational facilities for eight children of school age residing at the Agency. The Agency being on an Indian Reserve it is impossible to organize a school district under The School Act as the area contains no assessable property. As the children affected appear to be only those of employees of the Indian Department, perhaps your Department may be in a position to assist with the solution of the problem.\n\nWith the educational needs of these eight children in mind I would appreciate information concerning any provision which may exist for dealing with such cases.

You will quite appreciate the fact that they are living on territory which is not under the jurisdiction of this Province, and it would be unreasonable therefore to expect the Province of Saskatchewan to furnish educational facilities. The nearest school is some five miles away and as it has already a reasonably large enrolment, the addition of the eight children of the Agency would place too heavy a burden on the school.\n\nOur Department would be glad if you would take this matter up with your Minister with a view to making a grant for the children at this Agency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nA.

Recently, however, exception was taken to our making this expenditure a charge against the Appropriation, for Indian Education.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 1)\nRESOLUTION RE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES' CHILDREN\n\nPassed by the Staff of the Department of Indian Affairs in Alberta:\n\n---\n\nWhereas large numbers of employees of the Department of Indian Affairs, resident on Indian Reserves throughout the Western Provinces are debarred from giving their children an adequate education, except at great expense to themselves, owing to the distance they reside from the nearest school District, and whereas these employees are compelled to expend large sums of money each year out of all proportion to their salary, to pay for board and rooms for their children while they attend school and this works a great hardship on the said employees,\n\nTherefore, be it resolved and it is resolved that the Department of Indian Affairs should assist these employees up to the amount paid as grants for the education of an Indian child, upon the recommendation of the Inspector of Indian Agencies and the Agent of the Agency concerned such assistance to be proportional to the number of children being sent to school, i.e., the larger the number of children from one family the smaller the per capita grant. No child to receive assistance after reaching the age of EIGHTEEN years. In the case of an Indian Agent being affected the recommendation of the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province to be sufficient.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., September 28th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to refer you to Department's letter No. 745560 of March 13th, last, in connection with the question of school grant for the education of employees' children in this province. I note in the closing paragraph of the Department's letter they state that after June 30th, last, no further payment could be made.\n\nAt the meeting of the employees held here in June a resolution was passed and I have been asked by the President and Secretary to forward same to you, and you will find copy of same attached hereto. I sincerely hope this matter is not entirely closed.\n\nWe have people in our employ who are doing good work, but for the lack of funds find it practically impossible to send their children to school. Just to mention one case: I was down at the Peigans with Mr. Conkey recently and the matter of schools was referred to. You know what Mr. Webb's net salary is: He has to pay $15.00 per month for the transportation of his two boys to school in Pincher Creek. Besides this he pays a fee of $30.00 a year for one and $16.00 for the other, as well as having to provide books, &c. You will therefore see how much he has left out of his salary. There are other similar cases, and I feel something should be done for them.\n\nDoctor Harold W.

Mr. Booth obtained the services of a lady teacher holding a first class certificate and the school opened with seven children in attendance, three belonging to the Labourer, two to the Clerk, and two children of Mr. Booth's as well as a girl whom Mrs. Booth is boarding and giving school privileges in exchange for assistance she renders in the house work.\n\nI trust this arrangement will receive your approval, but in order that it may be perfectly regular I would be glad if you could see your way to granting official authority to carry out the arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDecember 5, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nIn August we made application to the Department for the annual school grant, $250.00, towards the education of the employees' children in the Onion Lake Agency, but we were turned down flat. We were told that the Auditor General has taken exception to the Department making the expenditure from the appropriation to which it was charged and that owing to certain regulations it could not be provided for by a special vote. All this is very disappointing to us and we have difficulty in reconciling it with the Department's letter (No. 16565) dated August 28th, 1927, a copy of which reads as follows: \"If you can make satisfactory arrangements for a class room and its equipment and can secure sufficient funds for a satisfactory day school, the Department will allow a grant of $250.00 per year.\" On receipt of the letter from which the above is an extract, we procured suitable building and equipped it at some considerable expense, and made the necessary arrangements for financing. In view of the above the official reply came as a shock. It simply means that we will have no school for our children.\n\nThe cost of operating our school is $900.00 per annum, and the only assistance we now receive is the Saskatchewan school grant of $200.00, leaving a deficit of $700.00 to be made up by ourselves, and it is beyond our capacity to do so. At its inception in 1927 there were seven children of employees of school age - now there are ten attending. Even with the Department's grant of $250.00, $100.00 had to be put up privately to make ends meet, and without the grant the situation is hopeless. Our nearest Saskatchewan public school is nine miles distant.\n\nI am addressing this personally to you as I have a feeling that in some way you may be able to help us. I trust you have fully recovered your health and that you will enjoy a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nDept. Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1934.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the grant which was formerly allowed towards the education of the employees' children in the Onion Lake agency.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Auditor General took exception to the Department paying for this service, as such grants were regarded as supplementing the salaries and allowances of the personnel concerned. The employees in other departments whose duties require them to reside in isolated positions, such as lighthouse keepers, also requested that assistance be allowed them towards the education of their children. After investigating the whole question, the Government authorities have decided that grants towards assisting employees in the education of their children could not be further allowed.\n\nI am well aware of the circumstances in connection with the employees at Onion Lake - the distance they would have to send their children to school and the expense that would be involved. Personally, I regret being unable, in view of the regulations, to do anything to assist yourself and the other employees at the agency in obtaining a grant towards the operating of the school which is being conducted.\n\nWishing you and the family the Compliments of the Season,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

B.

O. Allison, Pincher Creek, Alberta, regarding educational facilities for white children of the employees of the Department of Indian Affairs, residing on the Peigan reserve.\n\nFor several years, the Department has provided a grant to assist in the education of employees' children at a number of the Indian agencies. However, the Auditor General took exception to continuing payment for this service, as such grants were regarded as supplementing the salaries and allowances of the personnel concerned. Employees in other departments, whose duties require them to reside in isolated positions, such as lighthouse keepers, also requested that assistance be allowed towards the education of their children. Upon investigating the whole question, the Government authorities decided that grants towards assisting employees in the education of their children could not be further allowed. I regret, under present regulations, being unable to grant any assistance towards the education of the white children on the Peigan reserve.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBrigadier-General J.

McGill\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., Jan. 31st, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of January 1937.\n\nIt became necessary to move some of our Staff children into Cardston for schooling, as travel was not possible or safe this past month and the month of school was lost. This is mentioned as a matter of protection under the existing circumstances of bad roads.\n\nJ. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to advise that on the last visit of Inspector J.F. Schmidt, the question of employees' families living in Town for educational purposes was discussed and I wish to advise that Mr. T.M. Gregson's (Farm Instructor at Farm 4), family is now located in the Town of Carleton where his children are attending School.\n\nMr. Gregson's family consists of 3 Boys & 1 Girl of school age. Farm 4 is located 19 miles from Town and it is impossible, without considerable loss of time, for them to go in and out.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopy for:\nJ.F.

Mr. McMillan's letter has been\ncarefully considered but we are at a loss to\nunderstand what action, if any, he wishes us\nto take.

SCHMIDT'S VISIT TO BLOOD INDIAN AGENCY ON THE 12 to the 17 INSTANT.\n\nRemarks re Staff:\n\nRe: Mr. M. MacLeod, Agency Clerk:\n\nAs the Department know (Vide Dept. #140-103 dated October 1, 1942, and subsequent correspondence) Mr. MacLeod, the Senior Clerk, has moved his family to a rented house on the outskirts of the town of Cardston, so that his two boys may be able to walk to school. Mr. MacLeod still occupies the Clerk's house at the Agency, where he batches from Monday morning until Saturday noon. The Agency H.Q. is nine miles from town.\n\nRe: Mr. T. Gregson, Farming Instructor on Farm 4\n\nArea - North of the Agency H.Q.\n\nI was surprised to find that Mr. Gregson had also moved his family to Cardston so that his four children could walk to school. I asked both Mr. Gregson and the Indian Agent whether the Department had been informed of this; the reply was in the negative. I then told the Agent that he should inform the Department at once.\n\nThe Home Farm where Mr. Gregson lives is 18 miles from Cardston and school. In the past he drove his children to and from school each day. Owing to gasoline and rubber restrictions he decided to move the family to town where he owns a house. As it is now, it may be said that his home is in Cardston, as he spends the greater number of his nights there.\n\nI remarked that I appreciated the fact that his children have to be educated, but thought the Department might and should have been informed and consulted in the matter of his moving. I also stated that I was aware that he had to go to town quite frequently for repairs and other business, but that this was not an every-day occurrence or necessity. Mr. Gregson remarked that he figured it was cheaper for the Department (as he uses a departmental farm truck) for him to move to town, than to drive the children to and from town each day. Agent McMillan then mentioned a letter written by the Deputy Superintendent General some years ago re schooling for employees' children; this letter was not produced. I told him to mention this letter when writing to the Department to inform them that Mr. Gregson\nhad moved to Cardston, adding that I did not wish to argue on this matter, and that the Department would give their approval or vice versa.\n\nThe farming area on the Blood Reserve is divided in two by a section line running East and West at a point approximately nine miles North of the South Boundary of the Reserve. The South (or G.P.) Area is under the supervision of Farming Instructor W. Bette; his home is approximately 4\u00bd miles from town. The North Area is under the supervision of Farming Instructor T. Gregson, whose home is not far from the Belly River, near the North-west corner of Section 24, Township 5, Range 26. It might be said that there is no farming done East of Range 25 and North of the centre of Township 5.\n\nOwing to the storm and the roads being drifted, I was unable to make any other visits on the reserve. I left Saturday at 11.00 A.M. for Brocket to see Mr. J.T. Faunt, whom I had not visited since Autumn.\n\nx x x\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRemarks re Staff:\n\nRe: Mr. M. MacLeod, Agency Clerk:\n\nAs the Department know (Vide Dept. #140-103 dated October 1, 1942, and subsequent correspondence) Mr. MacLeod, the Senior Clerk, has moved his family to a rented house on the outskirts of the town of Cardston, so that his two boys may be able to walk to school. Mr. MacLeod still occupies the Clerk's house at the Agency, where he batches from Monday morning until Saturday noon.\n\nThe Agency H.Q. is nine miles from town.\n\nRe: Mr. T. Gregson, Farming Instructor on Farm 4 Area - North of the Agency H.Q.\n\nI was surprised to find that Mr. Gregson had also moved his family to Cardston so that his four children could walk to school. I asked both Mr. Gregson and the Indian Agent whether the Department had been informed of this; the reply was in the negative; I then told the Agent that he should inform the Department at once.\n\nThe farm where Mr. Gregson lives is 18 miles from Cardston and school. In the past he drove his children to and from school each day. Owing to gasoline and rubber restrictions he decided to move the family to town where he owns a house. As it is now, it may be said that his home is in Cardston, as he spends the greater number of his nights there.\n\nI remarked that I appreciated the fact that his children have to be educated, but thought the Department might and should have been informed and consulted in the matter of his moving. I also stated that he was aware that he had to go to town quite frequently for repairs and other business, but that this was not an every-day occurrence or necessity. Mr. Gregson remarked that he figured it was cheaper for the Department (as he uses a departmental farm truck) for him to move to town, than to drive the children to and from town each day. Agent McMillan then mentioned a letter written by the Deputy Superintendent General some years ago re schooling for squatters' children; this letter was given to me and I told him to mention this letter when writing to the Department to inform that Mr. Gregson had moved to Cardston, adding that I did not wish to argue on this matter, and that the Department would give their approval or vice versa.\n\nThe farming area on the Blood Reserve is divided into two by a section line running East and West at a point approximately nine miles North of the South boundary of the Reserve. The South (or C.P.) Area is under the supervision of Farming Instructor W. Betts; his home is approximately 4\u00bd miles from town. The North Area is under the supervision of Farming Instructor T. Gregson, whose home is not far from the Belly River, near the North-west corner of Section 24, Tp. 5, R. 26. It might be said that there is no farming done East of Range 25 and North of the centre of Township 5.\nCalgary, February 16th, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference your No. 345560 of the 10th instant, re Indian Agent A. McMillan's letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Farming Instructor T. Gregson, I beg to advise that this matter was mentioned in my report No. 402-9 dated January 27th, 1943, Page 4, abstract of which I attach hereto. As stated therein, I enquired whether the Department had been informed that Mr. Gregson had moved his family to town; the reply being in the negative, I asked that this be done.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. McMillan and Mr. Gregson that the Department had residences on the reserves for their employees, where they expected them to live; and after having lived there for a number of years, that before moving to town for the academic year -- or a period of ten months -- I thought the Department should at least be informed of their intention to do so.\n\nMr. Gregson has, for several years, driven his children to school at Cardston, using the Department farm truck which is supplied him for his use as Farming Instructor. (I understand there were odd days when his private car was used). This was being done when I first went to the Blood Agency when Mr. Gregson brought his children from his home to the Agency U.S. -- a distance of approximately 10 miles -- in the Department truck, then Agent Pugh picked them up and drove them to Cardston -- a distance of 9 miles -- together with his own (Agent Pugh's) and, I believe, Agency Clerk M. MacLeod's children as well. During the last year or two that Agent Pugh was at the Agency, his two children lived (boarded) in town, coming home for week-ends only.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Mr. Gregson and Agent McMillan, Mr. Gregson mentioned that he had to go to town quite often (almost every day) on official business, for machinery repairs, oil, grease, gasoline, or to look after the sale of grain at the elevator, etc. It was then that I remarked that I did not think this was an every-day occurrence or necessity; nor did I think that it required two trips to town each day.\n\nMy reason for bringing this matter to the attention of the Department is, that I considered the Department should at least have been informed that Mr. Gregson was moving his family to town; and when I was told that he himself made it his home, by spending most of his nights there, I believed it to be my duty to instruct that the Department be advised. I did expect that Agent McMillan would give more information than he did in his letter.\n\nFor your information, please,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nS/B Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th.\n\nDated Oct. 30th, 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nBlood Indian Agency\n\nDated at OCT 3rd, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReqs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is obtained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepu.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. If no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated December 31st, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils in residence during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31.\n\nDated March 31.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Blood Indian Agency this APRIL 5, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Requ.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the St. Paul's Anglican School at Cardston, Alta., on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended March 31st, 1944.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 209             | Bret.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: March 31, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, but is calculated by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended...December 31,...1943.\n\nPrincipal...\n\nDated...December 31,...1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nSt. Paul's Anglican\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 2nd July, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30th, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, File 764-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pending it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30th, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. J.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Blood Indian Agency OCT 3 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated December 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORA No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils per quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils per quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this place\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils enter on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated March 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper order thereon.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the quarter during which the Return is submitted, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DECEMBER 31 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MARCH 31, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MARCH 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1946.\n\nprincipal\n\nDated SEPTEMBER 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which pupils are entered on the Return, as determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 1946\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DECEMBER 31 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonag No. I.

If this is accomplished it is intended to enlarge the floor space of the refectory by including therein the girls' playroom. The proposed new wing to be used for a girls' play and bath room and for a laundry. The estimated cost is $500.00. Funds to meet the cost is apparently the difficulty to be overcome.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nSt. Paul's Mission\nAnglican Boarding School\nBlood Reserve\nMacLeod, Alberta\n\nThere is also another point which I wish to mention. Since the inception of this Institution people have been satisfied to utilise the School as a Church, with the addition of a convertible Chancel. As such a building is not conducive to worship, especially amongst native people, I am contemplating building a new Church during the coming autumn\u2014that is\u2014if there is no possibility in the near future of a new School being built on the Reserve.\n\nSo in order to simplify matters, will you kindly inform me whether in your opinion it would be worth going to the expense of erecting a new Church on the present Mission site?\n\nAssuring you of my deepest interest for the Indian cause,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nSt. Paul's Mission\nAnglican Boarding School\n\nBlood Reserve\n\nMacLeod, Alberta\n\nMy statements are corroborated by interested outsiders, when I say that the education, fundamentals and disciplined training which are imparted here rank second to none, for I always demand that my Staff must be duly qualified to fill the positions they occupy. Such being the case, a new School\u2014semi-industrial, if possible\u2014to accommodate 100 pupils built on the Reserve, on such a scale that experiments of a practical nature could be carried on, so that not only the pupils, but also the ex-pupils could obtain and derive great benefits therefrom, is the great need of the Blood Reserve.\n\nThe pupils I have in School respond nobly to the curriculum and system now in operation, but we are only touching the fringes of what we ought to be doing, for it ever resolves itself into the old adage\u2014\"be content to \"Mark Time\",\u2014have no worry\u2014for the Indians will never repay what has and is being expended on them!\"\n\nSuch a hopeless fallacy is not consistent with progress and is contrary to the laws of intellectual development. Therefore, I do emphasise the need for a new School in order to replace our present Institution, and I thought that during the intervention of an \"Agreement\" being re-modelled this would be a good time to write you concerning the above.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy-Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAs the five years \"Agreement\" between the Department and the School authorities has now lapsed until such time as another is drawn up, may I crave the indulgence by calling your attention to the total inadequacy of educational facilities on this Reserve. In doing so I am by no means depreciating the results which have been accomplished by both Institutions, especially the one under my supervision, for no doubt you are well aware of the fact that during my five years tenure, owing to the increased amount of pupils I have admitted, I have been necessarily enforced to appeal to the Department on two occasions for an increased per capita Grant, which I note with pleasure you have sanctioned.\n\nBut the point I wish to emphasize is this----That it is utterly impossible with the meagre facilities we have at our disposal to give either boy or girl, the necessary education demanded by a progressive population like the Blood Indians are at the present time.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 30th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Middleton -\n\nI have your letter of August 10th, last, with reference to erection of new buildings in connection with your mission on the Blood Reserve.\n\nI regret very much that I am unable to give you any definite answer, much as I would like to do so. At present it is impossible to make any forecast as to the moneys that will be made available by the Government for Indian Education. I think I have mentioned before our grant this year was materially reduced, and just when the vote will assume the proportion it did before the war I am unable to say. The needs of your school will not be overlooked when the Department is able to resume active building operations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nRev. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nIndian Office, Winnipeg,\nSept. 26th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the afternoon the Doctor drove me to the Anglican School where we found everything clean and in splendid order. The building has been painted and renovated all over, during the holidays, and it was so different to what it was when I visited it the first time. The children had not then returned from their holidays, as some of them were just recovering from measles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. I. Grain.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nSome few days ago while visiting the St Paul's church of England school here, the Rev S Middleton asked me to write the Department concerning the erection of an addition to his present school building.\n\nAt present, the principal uses his church as a school building; this is not only inconvenient, but largely destroys the building for use as a school. The principal also informed me that he had disposed of an old church building belonging to the church for $150.00. He purposes using this money as a help to erect the school, and would respectfully ask the Department to assist him to the extent of $300, to complete it.\n\nI might say that during the quarter ending June the principal built an addition to the present girl's dormitory, 20x50. This new addition is used as a play and washroom, and the old play room is incorporated with the old dining room making a roomy and comfortable dining room.\n\nThis addition was erected without any assistance from the Department, and in view of the fact that this school is doing a good work for the Indians, and moreover shows a great improvement over the conditions three years ago, and also in view of the Department's ability to assist to Principal of the Blood R C School, which school is not doing as good a work for the Indians as St Paul's I beg to suggest respectfully that if the Department can, it will render the principal of St Paul's the assistance asked for.\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy I Have the Honor to be\n\nAnd Sec'y Sir\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nSir\u2014 I have the honor to inform the Department that at last after much beating about the bush, the Sisters of Charity in the Department's Hospital here have agreed to undertake the work of accouchment cases. A change in matron's has been made as well as in some of the nurses. The matron being able to speak English. As the new ward will be separated from the balance of the hospital furnishings will be required, to equip it for maternity cases. An expenditure of $150.00 should suffice for this year.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy\nand Sec'y\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant applying on behalf of the Principal of the Blood (C.M.) Boarding School for a grant to assist in the erection of an addition to the present school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will allow $300.00 for this purpose, payment of which will be made upon the receipt of properly certified vouchers for the cost of material and labour to this extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Dilworth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacLeod, Alta.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR HARKLE OF THE BLOOD C.R. BOZ. SCHOOL.\n\n5.... An addition was added to the girls' home during the spring of 1916. It cost about $500.00. An Indian waiting room was added adjacent to the offices and now the Indians do their business through a sliding window instead of in the office as heretofore. The cost of these were met by the school. The frame work is up for an addition to the building now used for worship and classes. It is intended to use the new portion, together with a portion of the old, for two class rooms. I understand that the Department have promised $300.00 towards this annex etc. There is telephone connection between the office, girls' home and the school hospital. This has proved to be a great convenience.\n\n6... The cost of many articles of food has greatly increased of late as every one knows and admits. Mr. Middleton stated that the additional expense would be fully $1000.00 greater for 1917 than for 1916. He had no idea from where the $1000.00 was to be secured unless the Department gave an additional $5.00 per quarter for each pupil.\n\nReport dated, January 29th, 1917.\nOttawa, February 10, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report of the 29th ultimo on the Blood (C.E.)

I beg to present herewith for your inspection the account as received from the Stacey Lumber Co., Macleod, amounting to $531.90.\n\nWhilst admitting that I have considerably extended the original grant, I have been as economical as possible, in so far that the building is now finished, and the labor has only cost $80.00. Naturally, in such a case a considerable amount of the work has been done by the School staff in order to reduce the cost of construction. Would therefore beg that account as attached be submitted to the Department in its entirety, asking, that in view of the absolute necessity of remodelling the School, the amount of labor expended by members of the School Staff, and the entire amount of the purchase price of the old Church being spent in connection with the above\u2014hauling etc., that they be asked to defray the cost of the lumber, as per the account attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent, Blood Res., Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nMedical Report for February, 1919.\n\nThe pupils of the boarding schools have been generally free from sickness. On this date, 7th inst., I made an inspection of the boarding school at St. Paul's Mission.\n\nThere is nothing modern about this building. The heating of it is very inadequate in cold weather, and there are no facilities for proper bathing. The bath rooms both for the boys and the girls are in my opinion insufficiently heated and only one small portable laundry tub is supplied for each bath room. All the garbage and refuse from the buildings have to be carted away. There is no furnace in the buildings and the heating of the various rooms is accomplished by 34 small heaters from which pipes run into three brick chimneys. With these small stoves it must be very difficult to make the rooms sufficiently warm for the health and comfort of the inmates during very cold weather.\n\nThe dormitories are heated only by the stove pipes from the stoves on the first floor. The privies consist of a small building over a hole sunk in the ground. There is only one for the girls and one for the boys. When this hole gets filled up, the little building is moved to another hole.\n\nWhen it is considered that there is an average attendance at this school of 30 girls and 30 boys the equipment and crude conditions at this school preclude what would at this day be considered proper sanitation and bodily comfort. It seems to me that more heat ought to be supplied to the dormitories.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nAltogether the whole buildings should be condemned from foundation to garret. There is no apparatus for heating water for bathing, laundry purposes &c., except cook stoves and heaters.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nN.D. Steele, Medical Officer.\nMarch 24th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your report for February on the St. Paul's Boarding School, Blood Reserve, and in reply to inform you that the matter contained therein has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDr. N. D. Steele,\nStandoff,\nAlta.\nExtract from report of Dr. N. D. Steele on the Blood Reserve for the month of June, 1919. Original on 427024/3.\n\nThere is a crying need for improvements to the buildings at St. Paul's Mission. Only a new modern school building will be at all satisfactory. To attempt improvements to the old buildings would be a waste of money. They must be condemned as unfit for occupation as a boarding school.\nOttawa, August 19, 1919.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nAs you may be aware it is the policy of the Department to rebuild our industrial and boarding schools when necessary on more improved plans. Previous to 1914 we had an extensive plan outlined looking forward several years under which we were to replace in order of necessity, as far as possible, buildings considered no longer fit for the purpose which they were serving. The war, however, intervened and we were obliged from economical reasons to curtail very largely our building schemes.\n\nOn the list for rebuilding were the Victoria Home and the Roman Catholic school buildings on the Br\u00fbl\u00e9an Reserve, and I had planned later to renew both the Roman Catholic and Church of England buildings on the Blood Reserve. However, owing to the necessity of strict retrenchment these matters have been reconsidered and it has been decided that four schools on these two reserves are not necessary, their erection and maintenance henceforth being cancelled for burden both on the Government and the church authorities. It has been decided that one school for each denomination situated at the most convenient points should provide sufficient accommodation for the education of the children of the reserves in Southern Alberta.\n\nI have already informed His Lordship Bishop Monseigneur accordingly, and I am now writing to apprise you of the decision of the Department, arrived at, as said above, after due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England,\n151 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nCOPY.\n\nOttawa, July 28, 1919.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen,\n\nThe Estimates for the current fiscal year provide for the creation of a new Roman Catholic boarding school on the Peigan Indian reserve. In this connection I beg to draw your attention to an interchange of letters between Commissioner Graham and myself, particularly with reference to the boarding schools on the Blood and Peigan reserves. You will observe that Commissioner Graham agrees with the policy which I wished to establish in this matter, and I would ask your concurrence. I am so convinced of the reasonableness of this proposition that I think the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches will have to meet our wishes, or else we should not incur any further capital expenditure for school buildings on these reserves.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 14th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nYou will remember my letter of the 4th July, to which you replied on the 31st of the same month, in which we discussed the educational affairs on the Blood and Siksika Reserves, and you supported my view that it might be advisable to have two schools only on these reserves, one for the Anglicans and one for the Roman Catholics. Since then I have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with Rt. Rev. J.T. Macdonald, Roman Catholic Bishop of Calgary. He is very much opposed to that suggestion thinking that it would destroy the work of his mission in the south. He also discussed the matter with the minister who threw out the suggestion that we might perhaps amalgamate the reserves of the Blackfoot, Siksika and Blood Indians. Hon. Mr. Neighen was speaking with me on the subject this morning and mentioned this suggestion. I said I did not think it would be at all possible to move the Blackfoot Indians, but I was not certain that it was impossible to amalgamate the Bloods and Siksikas. The minister wished me to write to you and ask you to consider the matter also to discuss it with Bishop Macdonald.\n\nOf course it would be an immense advantage to have the Siksikas and Bloods together on the Blood Reserve. If we could sell out the Siksika Reserve and add the revenue to the capital of the Bloods we would get rid of a place of expense which the Indians have always found it difficult to support themselves. Will you kindly give the matter your best consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, B.E.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C., it is highly probable that the erection of a new school in lieu of the present associated buildings at the above noted Institution will not materialise this year.\n\nI write therefore on the advice of the Field Secretary to ask if you will kindly endorse the enclosed request for assistance in making the necessary repairs to the present buildings in order to render them more habitable and suitable for the pupils.\n\nThe foundations are fast decaying under all the existing buildings. All the buildings need re-flooring, the stoves and furnaces are almost beyond repair, and the new lumber on the buildings is cracking for want of a coat of paint. I have attached a list herewith, giving in detail the repairs necessary which I trust you will carefully examine and recommend to the Department the adoption of same. It is hardly necessary for me to say that if any work is done it ought to be commenced at an early date.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nS.

Approximately $1,000.00.\nSir,\n\nI enclose, herewith, copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Hunt, Agent at the Blood Reserve, by the Principal of St. Paul's Church of England School, together with a list of the repairs which it is deemed should be made without delay at this Institute.\n\nMr. Hunt has been over the premises with Mr. Middleton, and is satisfied that conditions have not been exaggerated. I am also aware of the state of the building referred to, and agree that repairs ought to be undertaken if the building of a new school is not contemplated for a year or two. I, therefore, beg to suggest that I be authorised to provide for an expenditure of say $150.00 in order to make the buildings habitable. I think, however, that an inspection of the buildings should be made, and this I propose to make myself, or have made by an Inspector shortly.\n\nI shall be glad to hear if the Department concurs in my recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It is really hard to say what should be done here to make the building habitable even for a temporary period. However, I am satisfied that the class room should be re-floored; this room is unfit for use in the condition that it is at the present time.\n\nThe size of this room is 15x36. A new floor is also needed in the dining room. This room is 40x40. The play room floor is also in bad shape and should be renewed. The size of this room is 20x24. The steps leading up to the first floor are worn out completely and would have to be replaced. The sidewalk in front should be patched up with common boards.\n\nA quantity of paint is required to brighten up the interior woodwork and the walls need some calomine. The class room is without window blinds and the sun beats in on the heads of the children and this is not satisfactory. I would recommend that seven or eight window blinds be purchased.\n\nThis work can be carried on by day labour and the material purchased in accordance with\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nwith Department regulations if authority is granted. It is hard to say what the cost would be, but it would not be very great.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. MacPhailan,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. Graham, regarding the repairs required to the St. Paul's Anglican Boarding School, I beg to say that the cost of laying a new floor in the class-room, dining room and the play room, repairing of the steps leading to the first floor, supplying of window blinds for class-rooms, and a small quantity of paint for the interior woodwork, would be approximately $800.00.\n\nArchitect.\nJune 21st, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, No. 402-14, regarding the inspection made by you of the building in connection with the Blood Anglican Boarding School, and enumerating the repairs which you recommend should be carried out in order to make the building habitable.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may expend an amount not to exceed $800 in laying a new floor in the classroom, dining-room and playroom, repairing the steps leading to the first floor, supplying window blinds for classrooms and a small quantity of paint for the interior woodwork.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase of the material required; such purchase to be made in compliance with the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada.

Out of these, 130 are under the age of seven years, and 109 range between the ages of 7-16 years.\n\nFrom personal knowledge and observation, ten to fifteen percent of this number would not be able to pass the requisite medical examination for admittance, thus reducing the above to approximately 225 children.\n\nThere are sixty pupils now enrolled at this institution which leaves forty children on the Reserve, all of school age, who are receiving no education. Based on the figures on a conservative estimate about forty per cent of the 130 children under seven years, will attain school age during the next two years. It would therefore appear that a building to accommodate at least 150 pupils would be necessary to ensure an education for the non-resident Anglican and pagan children of the Reserve.\n\nTrusting this brief summary will give you the desired information.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nExtract from report of Nurse Ramage re Church of England School - Blood Reserve:\n\n\"Suggested that something be done about the boys dormitories as the air space was not sufficient, the beds are placed close together and very crowded.\n\nNew baby likely next year\n\nR.F.\"\nOttawa, Dec. 18, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 8th instant, in which you estimate the number of children available for the Blood C. of E.

There are also 130 under the age of seven, making a total of 239 available now & in the future for admission to the C. of H. school. Of the children under seven years there would probably be 10% who would not pass the medical test, but in the 109 of school age, I have only included those in good health & of whom 69 are already in school.\n\nI would estimate that inside of two years 150 children could be enrolled in this school.\n\nTrusting that the above information may meet with your requirements,\n\nI am,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, Dec. 20, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, in which you intimate the number of children available for the Blood C. of S.

Scott, Esq., D.C.H.,\nDeputy-Minister Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nThis letter is entirely personal, and is in no way to be regarded as official. During a recent visit of the Rev. Dr. Westgate, of the M.S.C.C., we were discussing the contemplated new school for this reserve, and the ultimate development of the scheme.\n\nIn drawing up an outline of the proposed buildings, I naturally included a residence for the Principal. It has been my privilege, during the past twelve years to reside in a house entirely apart from the main school buildings, and I am writing this, in the hope that you may be able to grant this request, when considering the final plans for the proposed new school.\n\nRest assured that when undertaking the new scheme, a capable assistant will be engaged, who will reside in the main building itself, and will exercise the necessary supervision.\n\nThe matter of the new school for the Blood Reserve, is a question of no small importance, both to the Indians and the community at large, I am therefore most anxious to make it the best of its kind, and shall not spare any effort in order to bring about the desired culmination.\n\nThanking you for past favours. Closing with every kind wish.\n\nYours most sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nFebruary 10, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Middleton,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th ult., with reference to the proposed new Blood residential school. I am sending you today under separate cover blue print copies of the sketch plan which has been prepared, showing a suggested layout for the new school building.\n\nYou will notice on the ground floor plan that provision has been made for living quarters for the Principal. These quarters, as provided, are a self-contained unit. I do not think it advisable to provide a residence for the Principal outside of the building, and much prefer that he resides in the institution.\n\nThe building as planned provides accommodation for one hundred pupils, and, as you will notice on the attic floor plan, there will be space available which can be used later and fitted up as dormitories to accommodate an additional forty or forty-five pupils.\n\nIt is proposed to heat the building with a vapour system of steam heating, and to light the building by installing an electric lighting plant in the space indicated on the basement floor plan.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the toilet fixtures as shown on the plans. You will observe that all of the wash basins and baths are located in the basement and the only plumbing fixtures provided as far as the pupils are concerned, on the other floors, are night toilets for each of the dormitories.\n\nReverend S. Middleton,\nPrincipal, St. Paul's School,\nBlood reserve,\nMacLeod - ALTA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nRegarding the closets, you will notice that no doors are shown, and that a screen is provided in front of the toilets. These screens and the divisions between the toilets, including the divisions shown between the baths, will be built of steel twelve inches from the ground and approximately five feet high. This makes a very sanitary arrangement and easy to supervise.\n\nI may say with reference to the basement, that this floor will be built almost entirely above ground; the basement floor will be approximately three feet below the level of the finished grade line.\n\nThe building as planned should face South.\n\nI would ask you to please examine these sketches and, if there are any changes in the layout which you would like to have made, kindly indicate same in pencil or otherwise on the blue print which you are returning.\n\nIt would be advisable to discuss these plans with Indian Agent Faunt, before returning the copy to the Department with your criticism.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg,\nFeb. 17th, 1923.\n\nDuncan C.

Scott, Esq., D.C.L.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have to acknowledge with many thanks the arrival of the 'sketch plans' of the proposed new school.\n\nI have given considerable time to the examination of these plans and have carefully taken each floor as a unit and then considered them as a whole.\n\nLet me say in brief, that the outline and contour of the building is splendid, and I hope the main points of architecture will be preserved in the actual building.\n\nI heartily endorse the heating, and lighting systems, likewise the arrangements of the baths and toilets for the pupils; the screens and divisions between the toilets is a most commendable idea.\n\nBearing in mind the future development of the school and realizing it is advisable to make any suggestions for alterations now, I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the whole building is too small and cramped, to give adequate accommodation for the number of pupils indicated.\n\nOn each plan I have attached the suggested alterations and additions. May I give a few explanations for the suggested alterations.\n\n\"BASEMENT PLAN.\"\n\nWould strongly advise that the front of building, i.e., 'Dining Room' be extended eight feet, thus giving more floor space; and the main wall to be continued throughout the whole building up to each storey.\nFollowing out this plan it would give two open balconies on \"First Floor Plan\".\n\n\"GROUND FLOOR PLAN\"\n\nBy extending the main front, more space would be given for additional rooms, or to enlarge the rooms as already indicated on the Plan.\n\nOn this floor no provision is made for a \"Reading or Sitting Room\" for the senior pupils. It is highly essential that such a room be provided on each side of the building; one for boys, and one for girls. A room to which the pupils can retire during the evening for reading or quiet study is an asset to such an Institution. I have therefore incorporated two rooms on the plan attached.\n\nI much appreciate the Principal's quarters being set aside as a unit; but do you not think they are small and somewhat cramped? The only entrance apparently is through the main entrance of the School, no exit is even made for the kitchen. Moreover, the position of the toilets in the Dormitory above does not favour or the best arrangement, when considering the quarters through which the drainpipe passes. Further, if the Principal is to reside in the quarters as outlined in the Plans received, would it not be much more dignified to have his quarters at the front of the building, rather than at the back?\n\nI have however, attached a plan showing the additions and alterations suggested for this floor, which, if favourably considered, will add to the efficiency and service of the whole building. The addition has been suggested with the main idea of providing more accommodation and better facilities for both staff and pupils.\n\nWhatever rooms are suggested for one side the building, must needs be duplicated on the other side, for there will be an equal number of boys and girls. Moreover, the \"Class-Rooms as shown,\" will not give the required space for the pupils in residence. Four \"Class-Rooms\" will at least be needed\u2014two for boys, and two for girls. A \"Sewing-Room\" will also be needed on the boys' side, similar to the one provided on the girls' side of the building.\n\nIn the plan attached I have made provision for this by locating these two rooms in the Principal's quarters (as now shown).\n\nI beg to suggest however, that a two-storey building, as indicated on the plan I have submitted, be erected for the Principal. I have also enclosed a print of my old school, showing the idea for the Principal's quarters. This was an ideal arrangement, both from the standpoint of position, efficiency, and utility, for although separated from the main building, our revered Principal, was still resident in the school itself, and had access by means of a corridor as outlined on the attached plan.\nYou will further notice that I have made provision on this floor for the two \"Reading or Sitting Rooms\" for the pupils, between the Chapel and Staff rooms.\n\nI add one word about the Chapel. Would it be possible to introduce the Gothic stained glass windows, rather than the open square windows, which are so common?\n\n**FIRST FLOOR PLAN.**\n\nThis is the best arranged floor in the whole Institution. It is an ideal plan, may I make one suggestion. No provision has been made for an Auditorium or Assembly Hall. For such an institution it is absolutely necessary to have one. By taking the \"Roof\" over the Chapel one storey higher, that would give the desired location. Such a room could be used for drill, games, meetings, concerts, reviews etc. Unless this is provided for, there is no room in the building where all the residents of the school can meet in common.\n\n**ATTIC FLOOR PLAN.**\n\nProvision is made on the 'First Floor Plan' for 80 pupils. The Attic floor gives room for 22, this note is located on the Girls side of the building. I would fain suggest, at the outset, that similar provision be made for the same amount of boys on the other side of the building. There are enough children on the Blood Reserve to occupy the space indicated.\n\nI trust I have not wearied you with all these suggestions etc. All have been made from a personal knowledge of the actual requirements for such an institution, and am sure, that if same can be incorporated in the final plans, the future administration of the school will be simplified and greater proficiency will be obtained.\n\nAgain expressing thanks for giving me the opportunity of offering suggestions.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. Would be pleased to receive a copy, after revision, of the final draft plans.

Boarding School, I have sent you today under separate cover, two blue print copies showing some changes in the layout for this building. Please return one of them to me with your comments.\n\nPractically all of the suggestions have been embodied in the sketches, with the exception of the assembly hall over the chapel, as it would be impossible to make provision for this; also, it is not thought advisable to provide boys' and girls' reading rooms as marked by you on the blue print.\n\nYou will observe that the building has been extended in the front a distance of four feet; this will provide more accommodation in the dining room and rooms above on the different floors.\n\nWith reference to the plans, Rev. Canon Gould called at the office today and has made a couple of suggestions after looking over same. He suggests that on the ground floor, the two staff bed-rooms and the bath rooms to the right of the main entrance be converted into a sewing room, and that the right wing on which is now shown two class rooms and a sewing room, be made into two class rooms with a folding partition between. By this arrangement the two rooms could be turned into one and used when required, as an assembly hall.\n\nReverend S. Middleton,\nPrincipal, St. Paul's C. of E.\nBoarding School,\nMacLeod - Alta.\nIt is also suggested that the sewing room could be used by the girls as a reading room, and the room marked on the amended sketches, on the left wing, as a sewing room, be used as a boys' reading room.\n\nI would ask you to please return the sketches to me as soon as possible, in order that the plans for the building may be prepared without too much delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**STATEMENT**\n\n**McLAREN LUMBER COMPANY**\n\n**FOREIGN AND NATIVE LUMBER, BUILDING MATERIALS**\n\n**MANUFACTURERS & DEALERS**\n\n**WHOLESALE AND RETAIL, ONE PIECE OR CARLOAD**\n\nMacLeod, Alta., Canada\n\nOctober 16th, 1922.\n\nSold to Blood Indian Agency.\n\nAddress Mr. Taunton Agent C.E.

The plans did not arrive until April 5th; in the meantime the additional copies came to hand the day following.\n\nIn replying may I say that I am heartily in accord with the approved alterations. The one Staff Room and Bath Room, to the right of the main entrance on the ground floor, could well be used for the dual purpose indicated, likewise, the \"Sewing Room\" on the left wing.\n\nCanon Gould's suggestion to convert the two Class-rooms into an Assembly Hall will make a splendid arrangement. May I ask however, if provision for a platform or stage could be made at the north end. This would in no way militate against the space required, and yet would meet the requirements of the usual school auditorium.\n\nProceeding to the Attic Floor, I note with satisfaction, that the left wing is to be fitted up in conjunction with the right wing. As it would not be advisable to have pupils separated entirely from the Staff, I would further beg to suggest that additional accommodation be provided for the necessary Staff, by fitting up a room at each side, as indicated on the plans returned.\n\nThanking you for the consideration shown.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S.

It is quite obvious that the work of your department would be facilitated by having a set of these plans in capable hands here.

It is not our intention to employ anyone other than the Inspector of the Work when the construction of the building is undertaken, so that it will not be possible to accede to their request.\n\nLast summer the Civil Service Commission advertised the position Inspector of Construction for the province of Alberta, and, as a result of the competition, they established an eligible list. Mr. E. Gardner Smith, of Calgary, received the highest rating and was placed at the head of the list. Mr. Smith has done considerable work of this nature for this Department, his services have been very satisfactory, and we intend to employ him to supervise the work when the school building on the Blood reserve is being erected. We feel that he is competent to oversee, not only the work, but that the materials used are proper and up to standard.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nRA332 11\n\nCALGARY ALTA 0 314 P\n\nDUNCAN G SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL OF DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nKINDLY WIRE US IF ST PAULS INDIAN SCHOOL CONTRACT IS LET YET\n\nBENNETT AND WHITE CONSTRUCTION CO.\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nOttawa, November 9, 1923.\n\nBennett and White Construction Company,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nContract St. Paul's school not yet awarded.

These enquiries are all based on a general understanding that is prevalent in Calgary, Alta., that the contract is or will be, awarded to us. We enclose a copy of a letter received from one of the Calgary wholesalers, which will show you what we are getting.\n\nIf advance news has leaked to Calgary, that contract is heading towards us, we should be very pleased to have official confirmation of this happy result and prepare for the work by getting all the materials we can, moved to the site this year. It will also help us in the disposal of our plant and surplus supplies at contract near Edmonton, for when we were estimating on the work near Cardston, we gave that job the full benefit of economical movement of material and the existing organization at Edmonton, and it will help very much if we can receive positive news before the Edmonton work is cleaned up.\n\nIf the awarding of contract is delayed into actual winter conditions, thus preventing excavation work being done before ground is frozen, it may mean a very much later start under more unfavorable conditions, next year.\n\nFrom the above you will see that we are most anxious to hear about the work and if you can conveniently give us some definite news, we will be very grateful.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nIndian Affairs.

Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE BLOOD RESERVE SCHOOL - CARDSTON, ALTA.\n\nWhen we submitted our tender on this work, there were a number of special inducements for us to quote a very close figure and certain items of cost which were taken advantage of at that time.\n\nIt is now over two and a half months since our tender was compiled and during this time, most of the inducements and advantages which influenced us in bidding very closely on the work, have disappeared or are rapidly disappearing. We gave the Department the whole of the benefit from the situation as it stood at that time. The chief items in this consideration are as follows:\n\n(1) The advantage of being on the ground at Edmonton gave to the prospective work at Cardston, which is almost an exact duplication of the Edmonton contract.\n\n(2) The location of Cardston is about the only district in the West where work of this kind can be advantageously commenced to make it a between season's job, owing to the more open fall and spring as compared with the rest of the Prairie Provinces. Coupled with this, was our desire to find continuous work for the best men in our organization and so prevent in some measure, the continued exodus to the United States.\n\n(3) The opportunity to take delivery during the balance of 1923, of all materials excepting plaster, maple flooring and some interior trim and thus avoid paying the heavier sales tax which became effective January 1, 1924.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n(4) The exceptionally low price for excavating and teaming which the Indians were very anxious to do between the end of their harvest time and the commencement of farming operations on the land in 1924. It was estimated that a lot of the heavier materials could be moved by sleigh in preference to wheeled vehicles, as this is a cheaper method of transportation.\n\n(5) The lower prices generally quoted for lumber in the fall, which are not available on the approach of the spring demand.\n\n(6) The lower cost of doing work at the end of the year and before operations become general in the season of the following year.\n\n(7) The stability during the balance of 1923 and the early part of 1924, of wage scales. In this connection, kindly note that effective May 1st, bricklayers wages in Toronto will be increased from $1.00 to $1.25 per hour and it is quite expected a similar increase will take place on the same date in Western Canada, and which we believe, will spread to other trades.\n\n(8) By commencing work in 1923, we could have finished by midsummer of 1924 and thus have available, our deposit cheque to use in securing further business for 1924.\n\nYou will see from the above that our cost basis and the general situation, is on a somewhat different footing from that prevailing in October 1923, and while we have no reason to think that the Department would not make proper allowance for items of this nature, it seemed to us that we ought to advise you of circumstances as they affect us at this time.\n\nIf the work had gone ahead as planned and as contracts almost invariably do, we would have escaped any increased cost and be practically through with this contract before the season of 1924 is well under way, and we trust we may expect to be reimbursed where the delay has increased our unit cost. With the exception of sales tax, it is not expected that everything we buy will cost more, but in some cases, the future is uncertain. To date there has only been one increase and that is in the wholesale base of lumber which has advanced $1.50 per thousand.\nIt is to be remembered that the American Railroads and the United States generally, have had a very prosperous year and the placing of heavy orders for railroad equipment, rails, etc., and the expansion which may result from the prosperity of 1923, may cause increase in prices of steel and iron goods and this in turn, would affect plumbing and heating supplies and the structural miscellaneous iron work on our contract at Cardston. We are keeping in close touch with the situation and this week have been told by our sub-contractors, The Vulcan Iron Works, that prices are unchanged. They hinted however, there may possibly be an increase in the next month or two. We have also accepted October prices on sheet metal and roofing, cut stone, bricks and cement, so that prospective changes in market price will only be applicable to such supplies as are subject to price at time of shipment.\n\nIf it is at all possible, we would like to give shipping dates on some goods and take advantage of winter teaming costs before the roads get muddy, and make such arrangements as are necessary to enable us to get the major portion of the work done before midsummer.\n\nWe have taken the Cardston contract on the basis of it being a between season's job and wish to retain as far as possible, the advantage of such a situation. We would therefore, be glad to know if the site has been decided on and we can make some more definite arrangements about the work. If you can give us further definite news by return mail or in the near future, it will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The reductions proposed are as follows:\n\n**GENERAL MASONRY.** In general masonry to reduce the thickness of some walls in concrete and brick; to lower some of the story heights by one foot; to substitute common for face brick on exterior walls and where specified inside the building; to reduce the centre portion of the building four feet; and to omit the cut stone trim using concrete in its place. -$6,115.\n\n**CARPENTRY.** To omit storm sash, it being considered that Cardston being the extreme South-West corner of Alberta this is warranted by climatic conditions; to omit cupola on the roof; to omit the rough boarding on the underside of joists and to put sheet metal lining directly on the joists. $2,000.\n\n**PAINTING.** To simplify the painting and glazing by about forty per cent. $1,900.\n\n**LAUNDRY MACHINERY.** To reduce the laundry machinery by approximately twenty-five per cent. $1,100.\n\n**STEEL AND MISCELLANEOUS IRON WORK.** To revise fire escapes and to substitute some steel beams by wooden beams. $300.\n\n**ROOF COVERING.** To omit the asbestos shingles and to use in their place B. C. cedar. $1,418.\n\n**TERRAZZO & MASTIC FLOORING.** To omit all this work and substitute therefor cement finish with patent hardener. $3,068.\nFeb. 29, 1924.\n\nPLUMBING & HEATING.\nTo simplify and revise by omission all separate fixtures using trough or general fixtures. $2,150.\n\nRESIDENCE.\nTo simplify and cheapen residence in general. $1,100.\n\nSUNDAY REVISIONS, of a minor nature. $900.\n\nThe total saving to be effected by using all of the above will be $21,050. If they are all put into effect the building will be cheapened to the very lowest possible extent, and in my opinion, beyond a scale hitherto attempted in a public building.\n\nYou will note from the above that the residence has not been omitted, but if it is decided not to build it at this time a further $7,000 can be deducted. Also please note that the design of the roof has not been changed. If a flat roof is put on and an attic formed in the centre portion only, a further saving of from $2,000 to $2,500 can be made.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident,\nClaydon Company Limited.\n\nDuncan G.

I do not think, however, that it would be economical to omit the residence as planned and build a separate residence, as the cost would be more than the amount saved by omitting the residence.\n\nBelow is a summary showing the amount of the original contract and the total cost of the building if the proposed changes were made.\n\nClaydon's original tender ........................................... $143,128.\nSeptic tank and water supply ........................................ $ 3,000.\nElectric lighting plant .................................................. $ 1,600.\n\nTotal ................................................................. $147,738.\n\nDeduction for changes as shown in detail in Mr. Claydon's report ........................................... $ 21,050.\n\nTotal cost of building with changes and including drainage & lighting plant ........................................... $126,688.\n\nARCHITECT.\nLIST OF STOCK and FARM EQUIPMENT required for the new St. Paul's School.\n\nBlood Reserve.\n\nFeb. 28, 24\n\nSTOCK.\nEight (8) work horses and harness.\nThirty (30) milk cows.\nFour (4) breeding sows.\nPoultry. 200.\n\nMACHINERY.\n1 16 inch breaker plough, rolling coulter and gauge wheel.\n2 16 inch gang ploughs.\n1 16 inch sulky plough, extra breaker bottom.\n1 walking plough.\n2 lo plate disc harrow with fore carriages.\n2 quickfoot cultivators.\n1 20 run double disc drill\n1 20 ft. grain auger with cart\n1 6 ft. binder.\n1 two row corn cultivator.\n1 manure spreader.\n1 potato planter.\n1 potato digger.\n1 five ft. mower.\n1 self dump rake.\n1 heavy wagon.\n1 truck wagon (wood)\n1 truck wagon (iron).\n1 telegraph pole.\n1 set 600 sleighs.\n1 6' bevel plate grinder.\n1 10 horse portable engine with friction clutch.\n1 blizzard cutting box.\n1 corn binder.\n2 hay racks.\n2 dump boxes.\n1 grind stone, tubular steel frame.\n1 root peeler.\n1 10c three tined pitch forks.\n4 four tined forks.\n4 five tined forks.\n1 eight tined ensilage fork.\n2 Jack Johnson manure forks.\n5 barn shovels.\n2 scoop shovels.\n2 grain scoops, bucket type.\n3 wheel barrows.\n1 10c garden hose.\n1 doz. hoes, \"arden.\n6 spades.\n6 shovels.\n1 hand seeder, garden.\n1 garden scuffle.\n2 plows.\n2 post augurs.\n2 cyan bars.\n2 pitch bars.\n1 cream separator.\n1 churn.\n1 butter maker.\n2 logging chains.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They want them to possess character\u2014express picturesqueness, dignity, elegance, and most important of all, simplicity or homeliness.\n\nIn days gone by people were satisfied to build homes that complied with the prevailing styles of architecture. Today home-builders demand the right to express individual preferences. They require a building material that will not cramp their imagination in the design and construction of their homes.\n\nTo meet these demands of the home-builders we have produced the EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES for roof and side-walls. There is no other building material so flexible\u2014so responsive to your will\u2014no other material that is so readily adaptable to any and all styles of architecture. EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES afford you the opportunity to make your home substantial and durable. They are manufactured in our modern mills from the famous stand of British Columbia Red Cedar\u2014admittedly the finest in the world, owing to soil, climatic and drainage conditions. Nature herself has aged...\nendurance into this famous wood. Torrential rains, scorching suns and Arctic colds have absolutely no ill effects on the roof or side-walls covered with EDHAM SHINGLES.\n\nTo make your house beautiful, certain essential qualities must be embodied in the building material that you use on your roof and sidewalls. If the design is to be pleasing to the eye it must possess proportion, texture, scale, rhythm, repose, and most important of all\u2014COLOR.\n\nWe emphasize color particularly, because beauty is not only a permanent source of satisfaction to the owner, but it also gives a very definite and tangible added market value to the house.\n\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES are taken direct from the dry-kilns, which are operated in connection with our mills, to the staining machines. The shingles are still warm and thoroughly dry\u2014the pores of the wood open and receptive to color pigments. Stains prepared by our color experts, containing the strongest color pigments, pure linseed oil and \"binder,\" are forced by power application into the fibre of the wood, in the same manner that dye colors cloth.\nEDHAM power method of impregnating Red Cedar Shingles with color ensures that each and every shingle is thoroughly saturated from tip to butt, coloring the wood in a manner that seems to emboss the grain, causing it to stand out and ensuring durable, permanent colors that are rich and soft in tone. Compare the difference between the shingle that is brushed, sprayed or dipped in the ordinary manner, with the EDHAM method of driving the stain into the open pores of the wood. It is at once evident WHY the EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES will not wash out, rub off, or check and peel like ordinary stains and paints;\n\nWHY they retain their beautiful coloring eight to ten years, while the ordinary stained job requires rebrushing every year or two; WHY the brushed shingle decays first between the laps, where the brush fails to function; WHY the EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLE is permeated from tip to butt\u2014both top and bottom\u2014with a stain containing creosote oil that is poisonous to destructive insects, repellant to decay-promoting fungi and impervious to water, heat and cold.\n\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES are permitted to use the inspection\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nmark \"EDG-GRAIN.\" This inspection mark is the property of the SHINGLE MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. Permission to use it is only obtainable after an independent inspection. This inspection orders a 100 per cent Edge-grain Shingle that can't warp, cup or curl, strictly clear \u2014 free from knots, shakes and sap\u2014the highest grade shingle that it is possible to manufacture.\n\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES offer a fire resistance that is even greater than that of the natural shingle, because the surface is smooth, and there is no lodging-place for combustible material. Exhaustive and searching tests made by government and university authorities in both the United States and Canada have proven the \"EDG-GRAIN\" SHINGLE to possess equal fire-resistive qualities to that of any other roofing material now on the market, with the exception of slate and tile, which are prohibitive in cost. Full particulars of these tests will be supplied upon request.\n\nHeating engineers state that a wall of EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES laid over a 1-inch roofing, building paper, 2x6 studding,\nwood lath and plaster inside, is equal in heat resistance to a solid brick wall 20 inches thick. Unlike other building material, EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES are non-conductors. They do not permit the cold to enter to the same extent in winter, and for the same reason they do not permit the heat to enter in summer, with the result that you have a warm, cosy home during the cold season, and a cool, comfortable home during the hot weather. Likewise, in the rainy season EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES repel moisture, thus ensuring dryness throughout all seasons of the year. There is practically no upkeep cost to a roof or side-wall covered with EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES except a single brushed coating of stain at intervals of five to ten years, depending upon the color or weather conditions. The life of EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES themselves is fifty years, if laid according to the instructions that go with our fifty years' guarantee.\nA RUST-RESISTING NAIL ADDS YEARS TO THE LIFE OF THE ROOF\n\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES must be laid with nails that are absolutely rust-resisting, otherwise they cannot last their appointed period of a half century. The ordinary blue wire nail lasts but ten or twelve years. It must be at once apparent that to use such a nail is to invite trouble. Use a rust-resisting nail. Galvanized, cut-iron or zinc-coated nails are good. The difference in cost is a mere nothing. Do not fail to advise your contractor of the importance of the proper selection of nails.\n\nNot only are EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES achieving beautiful architectural effects in thousands of new homes, but they are also being used largely in remodelling old homes. Their adaptability and moderate cost make them especially desirable for rebuilding purposes. At a surprisingly low cost, EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES may be laid over the old, obsolete forms of side-wall covering. No other base is necessary.\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES offer the home-builder a \"50-YEAR ROOF,\" and a side-wall that will last as long as the house. The first cost is moderate \u2014 the cost of upkeep practically nothing \u2014 the final cost, when measured by the years of service, less than the cost of any other building material.\n\nEDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES are stocked by your local dealer in standard colors:\n\nTILE RED\nMOSS GREEN\nBUNGALOW BROWN\n\nSpecial colors to suit the individual taste of the home-builder and the architect may be secured promptly. Consult your architect, contractor or lumber merchant as to the size and color of shingles you should use.\n\nNote\u2014If your local lumber dealer does not stock EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES, write us direct and we will gladly supply you with complete information.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Minister, Dominion Gov't.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe understand that the Dominion Government is contemplating the building of a school at Cardston, Alberta, so we are enclosing our booklet, \"The Fifty Year Roof\"\u2014READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER.\n\nMany modern homes from Coast to Coast have already been roofed and had their side-walls covered with EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES\u2014WHY? Because of their superiority over other forms of roof and side-wall covering and because of the beautiful architectural effects that can be secured with them.\n\nThere are many things you will want to know about EDHAM KOLORED SHINGLES, about their lasting qualities, the quantity required when laid in the most artistic way, and what it will cost.\n\nWe can give you only a general idea about this with our literature and correspondence, but if you will let us know your requirements we will be glad to figure costs and assist you in selecting suitable shades, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEDGECUMBE-NEWHAM CO., LIMITED.\nBritish Columbia\n\nEDG - GRAIN\n\nShingles\n\n\u2014Will Not Warp, Cup or Curl\n\nThe ordinary flat-grain shingle WILL warp, cup and curl. The reason for this is explained by the fact that when a cedar log absorbs moisture and then dries out, it shrinks more than twice as much in the direction of the circumference as it does in the direction of the diameter. Likewise, when a shingle cut with a flat grain becomes moist and dries, it, too, shrinks more than twice as much in one direction as in another. These unequal stresses and strains cause warping.\n\nEdg-Grain Shingles Make Forty-year Roofs\n\nTo overcome this warping, which shortens the life of the roof, we are cutting a one hundred per cent. EDG-GRAIN SHINGLE, which bears the registered trade-mark, \"EDG GRAIN.\" In all EDG-GRAIN SHINGLES, the grain of the wood is vertical and parallel. The result is that when an EDG-GRAIN SHINGLE becomes moist, then dries, all the stresses and strains are absolutely parallel, with the result that an EDG-GRAIN SHINGLE CANNOT WARP. A shingle that won't warp can't check, cup or curl, and will lie close and tight to the roof for forty years and more when laid with Zinclad Nails.\n\nInspection Service\n\nEDG-GRAIN SHINGLES are subject to an independent inspection service. This inspection orders a strictly clear shingle, free from knots, shakes, worm-holes and sap; all shingles must have a smooth surface and butt, and they must be one hundred per cent. EDG-GRAIN, as a roof is no stronger than its weakest shingle.\n\nWrite for Further Information\n\nDrop us a line indicating that you are interested in EDG-GRAIN SHINGLES. We will be glad to place your name on our mailing list, sending you other information that we will be mailing from time to time regarding EDG-GRAIN SHINGLES.\nThis simple and practical design for an inexpensive home has been given real character by the EDG-GRAIN SHINGLE SIDE-WALLS and ROOF. The natural beauty of the reddish-brown shingle lends itself to lawn shrubbery and flowers in a manner that prevents any suggestion of the commonplace, yet conveys an atmosphere of genuine home-comfort.\nMarch Twenty-eighth Nineteen-Twenty-four.\n\nDuncan C.

This site appeared to have everything to recommend it, and would of course have eliminated all teaming of materials from the station at Cardston to the site. I carefully checked through Mr. Claydon's original figures for this work and found that he had included a sum of $2,900 for teaming. This amount, in view of the railway siding being installed on the site selected by Mr. Faunt was one of the items deducted from the original tender in reducing the cost of the building from $143,123 to $123,231.\n\nAs it has been decided to erect the building on the original site it will be necessary to cancel the credit of $2,900 allowed for in the reduced figures, and same will have to be added as an extra to the contract.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 2nd, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI wish to recommend the following changes in connection with the interior of the proposed school at the Blood Reserve:\n\nFirst, that 52\" burlap be placed along the corridors instead of 36\", as the latter would be just high enough to expose the plaster to hand marks, and for this reason the 52\" would be much better.\n\nSecond, the bathroom arrangements are not quite right. The private bathroom for the staff is opposite the Principal's office, and unless the door is closed, it is not pleasant for the staff to go in and out. Could this room not be put down at the end of the hallway?\n\nThird, regarding the laundry equipment. I understand this is to be the same as that installed at the new Methodist school at Edmonton. The Principal there has not yet started up his machinery and he regrets that it is so elaborate. I believe it would be more satisfactory to have two ordinary electric machines which could be run from the school electric plant, and a couple or three hand power machines, and these could be installed for about $400.00. It is a bad plan to do all the washing in the laundry by machinery. At File Hills we have hand power machines and get good results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbe removed and shipped to the Kamloops School, as this is the style of machinery that the Sisters at Kamloops are very anxious to have installed. The big difficulty at Edmonton, I believe, is that they have not sufficient water in their well to make it possible to use the laundry machinery.\n\nThe washing machine specified for this school and that has been provided to nearly all the schools now is a small size, power driven washer, and is of the size required to handle the larger articles.\n\nThe extractor is used to remove the water from the clothes after they are taken from the washing machine, and the drying tumbler is used to dry the clothes after they are removed from the extractor. Unless the schools are furnished with a drying machine of some kind, it is impossible to properly dry the clothes, more especially in the winter time.\n\nIn all of the schools where this machinery has been installed it has given entire satisfaction, and has been of great assistance in this branch of school work.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA Ottawa, April 9, 1924.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Scott.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's letter of the 2nd hereunder, regarding the proposed changes in the plans for the Blood School, I beg to give you the following information.\n\n1. With reference to the burlap, it was found necessary in order to reduce the cost of the building to omit all burlap specified, and the plans at present, therefore, do not provide for any burlap.\n\n2. With reference to the bath room arrangement, I think Mr. Graham should consult the plans again, and he will see that there is no bath room located on the ground floor opposite the principal's office. The bath room on this floor is at the other end of the hall, opposite the staff living room.\n\n3. With reference to the laundry machinery, I would say that the machinery for this school will be similar to that at Edmonton, with the exception of the flat work ironer. This has been omitted and the machinery it is proposed to install is as follows:\n   - 1 - 36 x 54\" wood washer.\n   - 1 - 26\" extractor.\n   - 1 - 40 x 32\" drying tumbler.\n\nThese are the size and style of machines that are being supplied to all of our schools, and without them I do not see how it is possible to carry out the work in the laundry.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's remarks that the principal at the Edmonton school regrets that the machinery is so elaborate, I would suggest that if the Reverend Principal is not satisfied with these machines, that they\nApril 9, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant with your suggestions for the changes in connection with the interior of the Blood School, and in reply would say -\n\nFirst. With reference to the burlap; in reducing the cost of the building it was found necessary to omit all burlap specified.\n\nSecond. With reference to the bath room arrangement, I think that if you will again consult the ground floor plan of the proposed Blood School, you will see that the staff bath room is located opposite the staff living room, and not opposite the Principal's office.\n\nThird. With reference to the laundry machinery it is proposed to install at the Blood School - 1 washing machine, 1 extractor and a drying tumbler.\n\nWith reference to your remarks that the Principal of the Edmonton School regrets that the machinery installed is so elaborate, I would say that if he so desires I will have the machinery removed from the school and placed in other institutions that have been pressing for some time for this class of machinery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We do not break land in this country after August 1st.\n\nAs this Principal has asked for four horses and I have recommended that they be purchased, my advice is that the horses and harness be supplied, also a plow, and that he employ a man to do the breaking. I do not think we should be called on to break the land and supply the horses besides. We should either break the hundred acres of land by contract, or buy the team of horses, plow and wagon, and have a man break the land, and then hand the team over to them. The approximate cost of four horses, plow and harness would be about $500 to $600. If you would recommend this, let me know at the earliest possible date, so that I can get the matter under way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nP.O.

I have noted your recommendation that the Department purchase a team, a plough and wagon, engage a man to break the land and then turn over the horses and equipment to the school. You are authorized to assist the school in this manner and you should immediately write to Mr. Indian Agent Faunt and explain to him the change in plan. Refer him to official letter of this file number of the 7th ultimo, which gave him authority to break 100 acres at a cost of $350.

It is with regard to a request from St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, for farming equipment and stock for that Institution. I would ask you to see the original list, as it was from your office I received it.\n\nThe first thing I did was to get a price on the articles asked for, and as near as I can make out it would cost approximately $2500, if all the goods asked for in this list were supplied, which of course is most unreasonable. I have gone carefully into the matter, and would point out that the following is a list of what we found on hand:\n\n- 4 Work horses, fairly good,\n- 3 Saddle Horses,\n- 1 Yearling colt,\n- 6 Milch cows, grades, and 2 Holsteins;\n- 10 Pigs, 1 Sow,\n- 2 sets of harness (work),\n- 1 set driving harness,\n- 1 Set single harness,\n- 2 Saddles,\n- 1 democrat, old and dilapidated,\n- 1 buggy, old,\n- 1 Set light bob sleighs,\n- 1 waggon, old,\n- 1 Section Harrows,\n- 1 Sulky Plow, in good shape,\n- 1 Hay mower, in fair shape,\n- 60 chickens.\n\nGoing through the list I have struck off the following articles, and my recommendations would cost the Department about $2000.00:\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n14\" or 16\" combination breaker and back-setter plow, walking; you will note that 5 plows are asked for\u2014One sulky plow they have on hand, and the combination breaker and back-setter plow recommended, is all that is necessary;\n\n2 16 plate disc harrows with fore carriage\u2014one is all that is necessary;\n2 Buck-foot cultivators. It will be three years before they should use cultivators at all. I have struck both these out;\n1 Drill might be supplied;\n1 15 ft. iron drag harrow with cart\u2014I have struck off the cart. Indian boys should be taught to walk behind the harrow, like white farmers have to do;\n1 Binder is asked for, this will not be needed until 1925;\n1 two-row corn cultivator\u2014This is not necessary at all; I have struck it out;\n1 Potato planter is absolutely unnecessary\u2014Indian boys should plow furrows and plant potatoes as the average farmer does;\n1 Potato digger. Potatoes on most farms are plowed out and picked up by boys;\n1 Mower, there is a mower on hand which is good for another couple years;\n1 Rake, this should be supplied;\n1 Heavy wagon should be supplied;\n2 Trucks\u2014I have struck these out, there is a wagon on hand which can be used for truck work;\nOne Democrat asked for should be supplied;\n1 Set of bob sleighs; I have cut this out, as it might be two or three years before they use sleighs;\n1 Manure Spreader\u2014This is not necessary. I have struck it out;\n1 $1 bevel plate grinder\u2014This should be struck out;\n\n1 10 Horse portable engine with friction clutch. What this is for I do not know; but if an engine is required after they get established here, it can be procured; in the meantime I have struck this out;\n\n1 Plowzard cutting box. This is not necessary;\n1 Corn Binder\u2014This is not necessary;\n2 Hay racks\u2014One is all that is necessary;\n2 Dump boxes\u2014can be struck out;\n1 Grind Stone with steel frame\u2014This might be supplied.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 1)\nRoot pulper\u2014This is not necessary;\nDoz. three tined pitchforks; I have cut down to half doz; if we supply a dozen they will all be in use probably\u2014a half dozen will be ample;\nFour tined and four five tined forks are necessary;\nEight tined fork is necessary; ?\nhave struck out two Jack Johnson manure forks;\nBarn shovels\u2014necessary;\nScoop shovels I would allow;\nGrain Scoops\u2014not necessary;\nWheelbarrows\u2014I have cut this down to 2;\nDoz. garden hoes\u2014Half a dozen sufficient;\nDoz. garden rakes\u2014Half a dozen is all that is necessary;\nSpades instead of 6;\nShovels instead of 6;\nHand seeder I would allow;\nGarden scuffle I would allow;\nPick instead of two;\nPost augurs\u2014one is all that is needed;\nCrow bars\u2014one is sufficient;\nPinch bars\u2014one is sufficient;\nCream separator, 1 churn and 1 butter maker are necessary;\nLogging chains asked for, one is all that is necessary;\n\nEight work horses are asked for; he has four fair horses now. At the outside he should get four more. He asks for thirty milch cows. This is absurd. He has eight milch cows on hand now. I would increase this by six. Of course if the Department wish him to dispose of the six grade cows he has now, and apply the proceeds to the purchase of a better milking strain, with what assistance he would give us, we might buy twelve cows. If this is not done, however, I would ask that only six additional cows be allowed. He asks for four breeding sows. He has a breeding sow on hand. Two hundred poultry should be struck out.\n\nIt seems incredible that such a request should come; and it does not seem to me that the party responsible for sending this in, has the interests of the Department or the Indians at heart. If such an unreasonable request were granted, it would be an enormous waste of money.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 402-114 of the 11th instant, with reference to the equipment and stock required at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, on the Blood Reserve.

I did not have before me the plans of this school when writing to you. I thought they were precisely the same as those used in the construction of the Edmonton School, but I see they are not. In the Edmonton School the bathroom is right opposite the Principal's office.\n\nI am very sorry to hear that burlap is not going to be used in the building. I do not think this is economy. Could not some of the staff bed-rooms instead of having number one maple flooring, have edge-grain fir flooring? This would last for many years as there is not much traffic in bedrooms. Some of the finest buildings in the country have the staff-rooms finished with edge-grain flooring. The halls and corridors will be in an unsightly state in no time unless there is burlap on them or wainscoting of some kind.\n\nI note what you say with regard to the laundry machinery to be installed. I would be very sorry indeed to see any other school equipped with such an elaborate plant as we now have at Edmonton. It would mean sending out girls from our schools who would not know what a wash-board is. It seems to me we could reduce expenses here a good deal. I am satisfied the girls would not get the training they should have with so much machinery about the place.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

April 27th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Well drilling, Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn a recent letter I mentioned that a large flow of water had been secured in the well drilled on the approved site of St. Paul's School. A 2nd well was authorized to be drilled for supplying water for the outbuildings and stock. This 2nd well was drilled about 150 yards to one side of the first well. The physical conditions seemed exactly similar, but, strange to say, after drilling 200' without indication of water, and through a discouraging red shale, we had to conclude that the water was missed, and so the drilling stopped. The explanation is that often the water follows narrow veins through the rock below, and if the drill misses the vein the result is a dry hole, even though the water may be close by. The drilling rig has been moved away, and no further attempt has been made to get a second well.\n\nI do not consider that there will be any serious detriment in the failure to get a 2nd well for St. Paul's School, for the reason that the capacity of the first well is so great that there will be ample water for all requirements, about 1000 gals. per hour. It will be very feasible to supply water for outside purposes by connecting up with the school supply, although this extra demand must be taken into consideration in designing the pumping plant and water storage. I am at present preparing data on this subject, and will go into the matter fully in a special letter.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the well at the new Agency had been diminishing in the quantity of water to a very serious extent. At first this well was reported to be giving lots of water; but during building operations it was pumped dry, and, on investigation, it was found that less than 75 gals. per hour was coming in. This diminished yield seemed to be caused by sand filtering in and choking the intake, which is a condition often difficult and sometimes impossible to overcome. The well was 180' deep, mostly through clay, and stopped at a rock bottom. As matters stood it looked possible that the well would entirely choke up. After a consultation with the drillers it was decided to drive the casing down and bed it on the rock bottom, thus shutting off the sand, and then drill with a smaller bit down into the rock on the hope of piercing a lower water vein. This has been done, and I am very glad to report that a splendid water vein has been tapped at a depth of 210'. I made a careful test of the capacity of the well, and after baling steadily for\none hour, during which time 600 gals. of water was discharged, we had not succeeded in lowering the water below a point 40' from the bottom of the well. This means that we can count on a capacity of at least 600 gals. per hour, drawn from the solid rock, and free from the former danger of being choked with sand.\n\nI have ordered suitable well piping, sucker rods, working barrel, pump head and jack, and it is expected that the new water supply will be available next Thursday. There is a small gasoline engine on hand that will answer present requirements for pumping.\n\nThe well drillers are under instructions from the Commissioner to proceed to the site he selected for the proposed Roman Catholic school, and drill for water there. This site is about three quarters of a mile North of the New Agency, on the main highway to Macleod. I expect this drilling will start on May 2nd.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nGeneral Delivery,\nCardston, Alta. April 27th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St.Paul's School. Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am in daily expectation of receiving the Department's instructions regarding changes made -if any- in the plans and specifications of the above-mentioned school. It will be my pleasure to co-operate with the Department to the very utmost of my ability in the performance of the duties assigned to me to the end that the completed building may reflect creditably on all concerned.\n\nThe contractors have not yet arrived on the scene, nor have I received any recent word from them. At their request, I wired them promptly as soon as the water supply was assured\u2014that was on the 8th inst.\u2014and I have not since heard from them. Presumably they are engaged in ordering their materials, and making arrangements with sub-contractors, etc., after which negotiations the active work on the ground may be expected to commence energetically.\n\nAs the site for the School has been finally selected in a locality adjacent to a series of ridges, it has occurred to me that consideration might well be given to an alternative system of water supply other than the system of pneumatic pressure supply shown on the Plans. The two pressure tanks provided in the Plans have a total capacity of approximately 3300 gals. and a working capacity of about 2200 gals. This does not seem a very large supply for an Institution that expects to house 175 people. Then to this we must add the outside demand for live stock, lawns, fire protection, etc. It would mean a frequent pumping of water to keep up sufficient pressure, and, in case of a sudden large demand, such as a fire, the conditions would probably not be very favourable for meeting such an emergency.\n\nAlso, it is noted in the Specifications that the water closets throughout the building are to be equipped with \"Sloan\" valves, and although I have not yet looked up this make of valve, I assume it is of the \"flushometer\" type, probably similar to the ones in use at the new Edmonton Indian School. While this system is undoubtedly the most modern and satisfactory method of flushing the closets where a sufficient and uniform pressure can be maintained, do you not think we might find them troublesome at St.Paul's School if dependent on a very fluctuating water pressure?\n\nAs an alternative proposal to the pneumatic pressure tanks, I would respectfully suggest that consideration be given to the placing of a larger supply tank, say about 25,000 gals. capacity, placed at a sufficient elevation so as to give a uniform pressure throughout the school equal to all requirements, including fire protection. According to the Plans the height of the ridge of the roof above grade is 53', and in determining the desired water pressure it would seem desirable that it be sufficient to enable a stream of water to reach any part of the school and with such a pressure there is no question as to the satisfactory working of the flushometers.\n\nMr.Fairchild, the Department's surveyor, assisted in preparing the plans.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nSupply tank might be placed. These elevations are situated to the South West of the School, and consist of parts of the series of ridges already referred to. The school will face due East.\n\nTaking the grade at the well as our datum, the first elevation we took was a knoll a little apart from the larger ridges. The summit of this knoll is 23.21 ft. higher than the said grade at the school site, and the distance from the well is 1296 ft. This is the nearest and most convenient elevation, but not of sufficient altitude to give the required water pressure unless supplemented with a tower.\n\nThe second elevation we took was a point on the nearest ridge, at which the rise above the school grade is 57.60 ft. in a distance from the school well of 2300 ft.\n\nThe third elevation was a higher point on the same ridge at a distance of 2648 ft. from the school well. At this point we have a rise of exactly 100 ft. above grade at the school.\n\nAt either of the two last elevations given the supply tank could be placed directly on a concrete foundation, but at the first elevation it would be necessary to place the tank on a tower in order to gain the required altitude. This might yet prove the most economical site.\n\nCALGARY, April 29th,\n\nI did not finish this letter at Cardston, but will do so now. I have just received the amended plans and specifications from Ottawa, with a letter of instructions from the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nI have not yet had time to go very carefully into the changes from the original plans, but, from what I have seen of them, I can realize that a very great saving in the first cost of the building is being effected. As soon as possible I will go over the plans and specifications with the contractors, and will endeavour to come to an understanding on many points that are necessarily somewhat obscure and vague at present. I will then write the Department fully, stating what tentative arrangements are being considered, subject to official approval. I refer more particularly to the auxiliary services of water supply and storage, mechanical plant and sewage disposal.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, May 7, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the new St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, and I note your remarks with reference to the water supply system.\n\nI would be glad to have a full report from you with an estimate of the cost of installing a tank, as suggested in your letter.

Paget\nAccountant\n\nC.O. Fellowes Esq.,\nManager,\nDominion Bank\nOttawa.\nDominion Battleship Linoleum\n\nAs requirements become more finely developed it is necessary to pay greater attention to the selection of the modern floor. This is essential from the standpoint of eliminating strain, promoting comfort, and ensuring permanence; the requirements being identical in a wide range of buildings, public and private.\n\nDominion Battleship Linoleum is one of the most durable floor coverings known. It is specified by the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, and meets the rigid requirements of the British Admiralty. For offices and buildings where severe tests require floors of first quality, it is highly desirable and most satisfactory in service. It eliminates strain because of the soft, resilient walking surface it affords; it promotes comfort because of the treated treadling surface it ensures; permits of easy cleaning because of its smooth, creaseless surface when properly laid with water-proof backing. Its strength makes it distinctly gambolable under all conditions, whether used indoors or outdoors.\n\nThe grades in which Dominion Battleship Linoleum are made permit of its selection for every type of building, depending upon the requirements. Grade \"AAA\" is 6 millimetres thick grade \"AA\" 4.5 millimetres, and grade \"A\" 3 millimetres. Lengths of 12 feet in each grade. Two other grades are available as Plain Linoleum, \"B\" 3 millimetres and \"D\" 2.6 millimetres. In addition to being usable in two yard widths \"A\" and \"D\" grades are to be had four yards wide.\nSelection of the most suitable floor covering for churches, halls, school auditoriums, conservatories, sun parlors, assembly halls, banks etc., has confronted many with a real problem. The solution of this is made easy by the adoption of Dominion Cork Carpet.\n\nIt is essential that noise, if possible, be either eliminated or reduced to a minimum in church, school hall and other types of buildings. This is secured by the use of Dominion Cork Carpet, a soft and carpet-like flooring for use in buildings already enumerated, as well as in many places where a permanent quiet restful treading surface is necessary and desirable.\n\nWhile the basis of Dominion Cork Carpet is similar to that of Dominion Battleship Linoleum the ground Cork used as a surfacing material is of different texture, affording a decidedly springy and resilient walking surface. This makes it very suitable for the large auditorium, as well as for all places where much walking is done by worker or occupant.\n\nThe ground cork, suitably coloured, is pressed firmly on a base of strong canvas burlap, the pressure exerted being so great as to effectually key the two, making them practically inseparable. This ensures permanence, and when well laid with reliable cement or adhesive this floor lasts indefinitely.\n\nDominion Cork Carpet is supplied in two grades: \"A\" 1 inch thick and \"E\" 3/16 inch, and in plain brown and plain green shades. Width of rolls is two yards and lengths 25 and .0 yards respectively. Reliable floor covering merchants will gladly quote you on your needs.\n\nThe proper care of Linoleum or Cork Carpet floors requires that they be clean and perfectly dry before treatment. If necessary, wash with mild soap and lukewarm water, then apply and two or three coats of reliable floor wax, and polish of same between coats. Before using Cork Carpet it may be filled with good shellac or floor varnish, this being desirable owing to porous nature of the product. Use dry mop with waxed surfaces and polish mop over varnished finish.\n**GENERAL INFORMATION**\n\n**DOMINION PLAIN LINOLEUM**\n\n| COLOR                | GRADE | THICKNESS | WIDTH | LENGTH | WEIGHT |\n|----------------------|-------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Grey                 | AAA   | 6.00 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 735    |\n| Green                | AAA   | 6.00 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 600    |\n| Terra Cotta & Brown  | AAA   | 6.00 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 560    |\n| Terra Cotta & Brown  | AA    | 4.50 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 420    |\n| Terra Cotta & Brown  | A     | 3.60 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 350    |\n| Terra Cotta & Brown  | B     | 3.00 m.m. | 2 Yards | 25     | 280    |\n| Terra Cotta & Brown  | D     | 2.05 m.m. | 1 Yard  | 39     | 220    |\n\n**DOMINION CORK CARPET**\n\n| COLOR | GRADE | THICKNESS | WIDTH | LENGTH | WEIGHT |\n|-------|-------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Brown | A     | 1 1/4 in. | 2 Yards | 25     | 420    |\n| Green | A     | 1 1/4 in. | 2 Yards | 25     | 420    |\n| Brown | B     | 3 1/8 in. | 2 Yards | 39     | 400    |\n| Green | B     | 3 1/8 in. | 2 Yards | 39     | 400    |\nDOMINION OILCLOTH & LINOLEUM CO.

Of special construction, with a large content of finely-ground cork, this product makes a particularly pleasing treading surface, being resilient and restful. In active service it wears a great while, in fact indefinitely, when properly laid according to our approved specifications, with waterproof linoleum cement.\n\nYou will want more information regarding this excellent type of floor, and this is supplied on the illustrated folder enclosed here with. Please go over this at your early convenience and if we can supply additional information your request will receive our best attention.\n\nHave you our samples?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank St. Clair\nManaging Director\n\nAH-1RD\nENCL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Superintendent General of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI wonder if you would kindly favour me by sending a copy of the amended plans of the new St. Paul's School, also a copy of the amended specifications.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., APRIL 17th, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nI am sending to you under separate cover plans for a new barn and horse barn which I propose building at the new Anglican School on the Blood Reserve, and for the Roman Catholic School on the same Reserve, which school is to be built in a year from now.\n\nI wish particularly to draw your attention to the construction of these buildings. The cattle barn is on a sound concrete foundation with proper footings. The walls have two thicknesses of siding, with paper as well as drop siding. It has a concrete floor throughout. The stanchions are of iron as well as the divisions between the stalls; in fact the building throughout is modern construction. The horse barn is built almost in the same way, except that the stalls are plank, the driveway is concrete and the hangars are wooden.\n\nIn addition to these two buildings there is a warehouse required at the Agency. This building is to be 46 ft. long and 24 ft. wide, heavy construction.\n\nI have received an offer to build the whole three buildings for $3500. In other words, we are getting the three buildings for one-third what it cost to put up one stable at Edmonton, or one-half what it cost to build one stable at Blackfoot. There is nothing cheap about these buildings. The construction is heavy. I just want you to see the plans before I start in doing the work. I would either let a contract or send a man up to take charge and buy the material locally. If I let a contract, it would be necessary to have blue prints taken. This could be done here, as well as getting out a list of material.\n\nI am sending these plans so that you can see what we are getting for our money, and I would ask you to kindly return them after you have examined them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nMay 6, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nThe Minister handed me your letter of April 17th in which you enclosed plans for barns which you propose to erect at the Blood Anglican and Roman Catholic schools. The plans were returned the other day, but I have not had an opportunity of discussing the matter further with the Minister. The plans appear to be satisfactory if there is sufficient room in the building for the needs of the schools. As there is no appropriation for the warehouse at the agency or for the barn at the Roman Catholic school, I cannot at present authorize their erection, but I will speak to the Minister about the matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMay 12, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith further reference to your letter to the Minister of April 17th, I beg to say that I discussed this matter with the Minister yesterday. I think he intends to reply to you direct with reference to the barn which you proposed to erect on the site chosen for the Roman Catholic school on the Blood reserve to the effect that we cannot find funds for it this year.\n\nYou may proceed with the erection of the two barns for the new Anglican school. I note from your letter that you have received an offer \"to build the whole three buildings for $5,500.00.\" I presume you meant the three barns. If so, the two barns which you were authorized to erect will cost less than this amount and we will therefore be able to find funds for their construction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M.

Box 54,\nCardston, Alta., May 16th, 1924.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nIn my letter to you of the 15th last, I referred to the size of flue in the main chimney, and I mentioned that the heating sub-contractor was expected here shortly, and that I would write you further on the subject after talking the matter over with him.\n\nThis morning this sub-contractor Mr. Snyder (whom you will remember put in the heating plant at Old Suns School) was present at a discussion on this and other matters connected with the School. Mr. Ernest Clayton, and his partner Mr. Mitchell, were also present. Mr. Snyder is emphatic in stating that the flue area must not be less than $3' \\times 3'$, and states that he will assume no responsibility for the efficient working of the heating plant if the flue area is any less than this. The contractor shares in this view. My own investigation, as I stated in my last letter, led me to the conclusion that $3' \\times 3'$ was the minimum size possible for correct draft. Under these circumstances, I feel that we have no alternative but to comply with the sub-contractor's demand. I would, therefore, ask you to please give me instructions in the matter. Provision must be made for the larger chimney, if authorized, in putting in the footings.\n\nIn the Specifications (Clause 9, Page 15) it states that \"If gravel is used in place of sand and broken stone, proportions shall be one part cement to four parts gravel\". As no broken stone is available, the contractor has no alternative but to use the river gravel found in the river beds. We have located what appears to be very suitable gravel, with about the right proportion of sand mixed with it. In the event of satisfactory gravel being obtained, do you not think such a rich mixture as that specified would be wasting cement? My own opinion is that we might safely change the proportions to one of cement to six of gravel. The Contractor states that he used the latter proportions at Edmonton with excellent results.\n\nIf you sanction this change, I would respectfully suggest that the fuel room be changed from that shown on Plan to one similar to that built at Edmonton, and that a debit and credit account be kept as between the saving in cement as suggested, and the cost of the change in fuel room. I feel convinced that the larger fuel room would prove a tremendous advantage over the other, and this is a way it might be obtained without adding to the cost of the building, for the saving in cement should meet the cost of the larger fuel room. Please include your decision on this point in your wire about the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nsize of flue in main chimney.\n\nMr. Claydon intimates that there are several possible substitutions under consideration between his firm and the Department with a view to decreasing the cost, or as an offset against other things which may be added to their contract. In this connection he mentioned a possible change in the high pressure boiler, the dispensing with I columns, a change in hot water storage tank, etc. You will, of course, please keep me fully advised of any changes from the specifications and printed amendments.\n\nAs the brickwork is changed from using #1 pressed bricks to \"best quality common bricks\" I assume that you will not now require the joints raking out, as formerly required. Do you wish any colouring of the mortar? Unless otherwise instructed, I will not require the contractor to rake his joints, nor use mortar colour. The joints will be about 3/8\" thick.\n\nIn the discussion this morning, the question of using flushometers came up, and Mr. Claydon stated that you had agreed to dispensing with them in favour of the tank feed. Mr. Snyder also advises against their use unless under ideal conditions of water pressure, and stated that in Calgary their use has been found troublesome and unsatisfactory. Also, it is stated that the ordinary country plumber is incapable of fixing them in the event of repairs or adjustments being needed. Kindly let me know what your wish is in this respect.\n\nAttention is being given to the question of a water system for the School, and I will shortly write you a special letter on this important subject.\n\nYou will remember telling me to move the double doors in the laundry to the opposite end of the room, so that large machines could be brought in from the machinery room entrance. Do you still wish this done? If so, should we not put an ordinary door in the former entrance?\n\nThe excavating is proceeding well, and, weather permitting should be completed in two more days, after which work on the footings will follow. After several very hot days, reaching 90' in the shade, the temperature has dropped so low that fires are needed for warmth, and rain is threatening. Moisture is needed for the young crops, and to check bush fires which have enveloped the district in smoke.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nE. Gardner Smith,\nCardston,\nAlta.\n\nApprove enlarging chimney to thirty-three by thirty-three inches - also concrete to be one part cement five parts gravel and enlarging coal room; all changes subject to the condition that money can be saved on other items so as not to increase cost of building.\n\nR. Gurney Orr.\n\nChg. I.A.\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the work at the St. Paul's School, and I beg to confirm the telegram sent you today as follows:\n\n\"Approve enlarging chimney to thirty-three by thirty-three inches also concrete to be one part cement five parts gravel and enlarging coal room; all changes subject to the condition that money can be saved on other items so as not to increase the cost of building.\"\n\nI approve of the changing of the chimney flue to 33 x 33 inches, providing there is some way of saving on other parts of the building to offset the additional cost.\n\nWith reference to the concrete I approved in the telegram of using one part cement to five parts gravel mixture. I would not care to use six parts as mentioned in your letter. As you know one part cement to four parts gravel is equal to a 1 - 2 - 4 mixture of cement, sand and stone. In the 1 - 2 - 4 mixture the sand is simply filling the voids in the stone, which makes it equal to a one by four mixture.\n\nI also approved of enlarging the fuel room, providing money can be saved other places to offset the additional cost.\n\nWith reference to the brick work, it will be satisfactory to leave the mortar without colouring and unbraced.\n\nWith reference to the Sloan valves specified, I would like very much to install these valves, but I think that with the uneven water pressure we might have trouble with them. I may say that the Manager of the company was in the office the other day, and he stated that the Sloan valve is guaranteed to operate satisfactorily under varying pressure of from five to one hundred pounds. If this is the case they would work satisfactorily but if we installed them, I would suggest that the plumbing contractor withhold payment on these valves until they prove satisfactory, under the varying pressures. I will be glad if you will give this matter further consideration and investigation, before we decide to change to the low down tanks.\n\nWith reference to the doors in the opposite end of the laundry room, I would say that it was my intention that we leave the opening in the wall large enough to pass the machinery through, this opening to be closed with a removable wood partition, so that at any time it would not be a difficult matter to move the machines in or out of the laundry, the doors to remain as shown on plan. If I remember correctly this was what was done at Edmonton.\n\nI will certainly keep you posted regarding any changes that are agreed upon between the Department and the Claydon Co.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

The contractors have a large crew at work, and large deliveries of materials have taken place. About 20 white men, and about a dozen Indians, are employed on the works, in addition to which there are about 20 Indians camps established near by, from which the Indian teams are hauling gravel, sand, bricks, etc., etc.\n\nMr. Farnell, the Indian Agent, furnished a list of names of Indians who have no farming duties at present, and it is from this list that the teamsters are selected. The Contractors are finding no difficulty in getting sufficient labourers; in fact so many Indians apply for work, especially for teaming, that the Contractors say they would require several schools to build to give employment to the full number of Indians applying.\n\nThe quality of the materials delivered is satisfactory on the whole. My only complaint is in the extent to which the mills reduce the lumber by excessive planing. It does not hold up to the specified dimensions, especially in the dimension two by fours, and two by sixes. These all are finished only 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" thick, instead of 2\", and are lacking in width. The joists are somewhat better in proportion. These are coming 1\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\" in thickness, and also lack \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" in width. The Contractors state that these sizes are now standard in the trade. Presumably, it is in order to keep down freight charges that the lumber is so scandalously planed away. I think it would be well for the Architect to note this discrepancy in the sizes of lumber supplied in comparison with the figured dimensions, so that he will be able to secure the needed strength, by specifying larger sizes when he deems it necessary. The lumber is all well seasoned, and sound.\n\nThe concrete footings were completed a few days ago. The footings of the main walls were increased to 42\" as authorized by you, and were increased to 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" in depth. This was necessary to insure against uneven settlement in consequence of soft places in the foundation soil. The pouring of the concrete walls is now being done, and is about half completed. We are putting in 12\" concrete walls, increased to 16\" at the wall piers, as shown on the amended plan. The concrete throughout is being proportioned 1 to 5, as authorized by you, and every batch is accurately proportioned. The wall piers will\ncarried up in solid brick, with cement mortar, instead of part brick and part tile. You probably intended this, for we have no margin of strength to play with in these walls since they were reduced.\n\nThe concrete footing of the main chimney, enlarged to suit the larger chimney decided on, has been carefully put in. This footing is 24\" deep, in two steps, with the lower step doubly reinforced. All the concrete is setting up well.\n\nRegarding the flushometers specified for the toilets, I passed on the subcontractor (Snyder & Co.) your suggestion that a guarantee be obtained from the makers that the valves will operate successfully under widely varying pressures. Mr. Snyder replies as follows:\n\n\"We have written to the factory asking if they are willing to furnish them with a guarantee to work under from 10 to 60 lbs variation in pressure; this guarantee to be that they will wait for payment until their goods have proved themselves satisfactory to the Department's Inspector. Knowing the construction of this valve we know that they cannot work with a difference in pressure of nearly as much, consequently we think we should await their reply before ordering, after which we will take the subject up with you again\".\n\nMr. Snyder evidently means that he will await the reply from the factory regarding the guarantee, and will not order until told to do so. I will notify you of the stand taken by the factory in the matter of the guarantee.\n\nRegarding the Milwaukee Air Pressure system of water supply, the makers report as follows:\n\n\"We have your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing specifications and drawings pertaining to a water system for a school job. We are very much afraid that the delivering capacity of our #5 pump, which is the largest pump that can be placed in a 5' 5/8\" casing, would not be sufficient to take care of the large number of fixtures which you show.\n\nWith the number of fixtures specified there would doubtless be times when 3 to 10 of them may be open at the same time, and, with a delivering capacity of only about 15 gals. per minute, the lower openings would get the water and the higher ones be robbed.\n\nWhile we like to sell water systems we are very careful not to recommend our equipment excepting in cases where we are absolutely sure that it will give satisfactory service.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing it would appear that the Milwaukee system is more adapted for suburban and farm installations rather than for large institutions where the consumption of water is bound to be heavy. I am investigating other systems, and hope soon to be in a position to forward full data, with recommendation, on what may be the best system of water supply for the conditions obtaining.\nYesterday I had a call from the Reverend Principal, Mr. Middleton. He has been scrutinizing the plans and specifications very closely\u2014which is always commendable\u2014and, as would be expected, has a few suggestions that he thinks are worthy of consideration.\n\nHe very much desires an outside entrance to the Chapel, stating that it may be a considerable time before a Church is provided, and in the meantime the Chapel will have to serve the outside Indians as well as those living in the School. I remember the same request was made when we were building the Kuper Island Indian School in 1915 by Father Lemmons, which request was complied with, and we built a neat iron stairway giving outside access to their Chapel, to their great satisfaction. I enclose a photo showing the said stairway, (which kindly return as it's the only one I have.) It would not be an expensive matter to meet Mr. Middleton's request if it is done during construction, and, in order to keep down the cost, a neat wooden stair would suffice. A much less stairway than that shown in the photo would reach.\n\nMr. Middleton is also anxious to know what is the intention regarding locker accommodation in the dormitories and playrooms. Nothing is shown on the plans, and he states that these are indispensable.\n\nOther matters he brought up are not of sufficient moment to mention, and consist of little details that can be worked out as the work proceeds. One of the minor points he touched on was the elimination of the steel partitions screening the toilets. In order to bring out his meaning, he instanced the washing of the smaller boys by their supervisor\u2014possibly little more than a girl herself\u2014when at the same time there might be an 18 year-old-old Indian boy performing at a toilet in full view! I replied that, in doing away with the steel partitions, the object was to cut down the cost of the building, and that probably the ordinary demands of decency will be met by substituting a cheaper wooden partition.\n\nRegarding the changes that, in the interests of the building, we have been compelled to make, and which inevitably add to the cost, it has been suggested that we substitute No. 1 E.G. Fir flooring in place of the hard wood floors, in all the rooms where the firm fir wood floors are provided, with the exception of the class rooms, sewing room, first floor dormitories, and ground floor (excepting the kitchen) of the Principal's residence. This saving would approximately cover the cost of changes made, and would still give very good floors. Also, if wood lath were substituted for metal lath above the dadoes throughout the new building, another considerable saving would result. Kindly instruct me regarding your wishes concerning these suggestions. If some means could be found to restore the nailing surfaces for the metal ceilings it would be very advantageous.\n\nIt is expected that the brickwork will start next week; and all the indications point to the building being completed well within the time set in the contract.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The contractors have a good organization, and the exceptionally good progress that has been maintained since the commencement of building operations is a tribute to the business methods practised by this firm.\n\nThe lumber delivered on the job is all well seasoned, and in all respects but one, is fully up to the specifications. As mentioned in a previous letter, the dimension lumber, particularly the two by fours and two by sixes, have been so excessively planed away that the strength of these members has been reduced by fully 25%. On my calling the contractors' attention to the serious discrepancy in this respect he explained that all the mills have adopted the same standard, presumably to save weight in shipping. The joist lumber is holding up better in size, being \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) instead of 2\", and lacking \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in width.\n\nThe bricks have been arriving in large quantities, and in great varieties of colour. The amended specifications, as you know, have dispensed with the #1 Redcliffe pressed brick for face work, and in their place we have #1 common bricks. Mr. Mitchell tells me that his firm made a special arrangement with the brick yard whereby, for a small additional sum, sufficient #3 pressed bricks are being sent to do all the face work on the building. Several cars of these #3 bricks have arrived, and I must say that they are a nice uniform even-coloured line of bricks, much better than I expected to get when I saw the change in the specifications. They are red in colour, just dark enough to be distinctive from the ordinary red common bricks, though not a dark red.\n\nThe brickwork is now finished to the top of the basement windows of the main building, so it is now possible to see how the brickwork is going to look, and I am well satisfied with its appearance. In fact I believe it will not suffer in comparison with the facework on the Edmonton school. The white joint looks well against the red background. We are making a \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) struck weather joint.\n\nThe common bricks rival Joseph's famous coat, and represent most, if not all, the colours of the rainbow. Some of them are almost white, which was going to be very striking underburnt, but on closer examination, I find that they were as hard as the others. The difference in colour can only be accounted for by the light coloured bricks being made from a different clay than the red ones. Among the common bricks are a good sprinkling of semi-vitrified ones, very dark in colour, and just what we needed to carry out the Architect's request that dark red bricks be used for lintels and trim, and which will introduce a nice bit of detail to the face brickwork. I have personally selected and approved each of these dark bricks, which have been set aside for the purpose intended when the brickwork reaches that stage. The recreation rooms in the basement have been lined with the common bricks, and the walls look passably well considering the material we had to use. It is a good strong job, well suited to the walls of a play-room.\n\nRegarding the elimination of cement mortar, and the changing to lime mortar, in the amended specifications, I would say that in this respect we are not fully carrying out the change called for. I have felt that there is a point beyond which stability might be sacrificed, and it seemed to me advisable to retain some cement in the\nmortar, especially in view of the reduction in the thickness of the main walls. I discussed this point with Mr. Mitchell, and he shared my opinion that some cement should be retained to give greater strength. We are, therefore, using half a shovelful of cement per wheelbarrow full of mortar in both the brick and tile work. This is not a rich mixture, and the added expense will not be very great. Mr. Mitchell knows I have no authority to add to the cost of the building, and he states that, even if his firm never get paid for the cement, he would not feel that the cement should be entirely omitted.\n\nThe contractors have several men at work making the cast-concrete in the place of the cut stone originally specified. They are fortunate in having two men in their employ who have had experience in this special work, and the results so far are fairly satisfactory. The workmen are performing this work in the open without any protection from sun or weather; which condition is not as favourable for good work as where a shed is provided and the maturing of the concrete retarded. However, until the last day or two the weather has been cool and showery, which was favourable to the work. I will watch this phase of the work closely, and, if necessary, will ask that the freshly-made pieces be covered with boards, and dampened to retard the hardening process. On the whole, the cast-stone is setting well, and will probably serve the purpose as well as the expensive cut stone. It seems somewhat presumptuous for me to assume to do in a few days what it took Mother Nature thousands of years to accomplish!\n\nAs stated in a previous letter, we have had a great deal of moisture, starting on the 3rd of June and continuing at intervals throughout the month. The contractors, realizing their crew camped on the site, did not lose a good deal of time, for often a heavy rain would end suddenly, and the men would resume their work. The heavy rains caused our foundations to be flooded a number of times, which caused me some uneasiness in consequence of the added danger of settlement. The contractors always put men to work to remove the water when requested to do so, but, in spite of the frequent removal of the water, some softening of the foundation soil could scarcely be avoided. I have since been watching my foundation walls very closely, and only in one instance have I detected any evidence of trouble. At one point, about 15 feet from the N.E. corner of the main building, a crack has developed vertically across the footing and foundation wall. I noticed it first a week ago, and have observed it closely since. It is a very narrow crack, less than an eighth of an inch in width, and has not opened any wider since I first noticed it. I do not think it will give us any trouble nor affect the building itself in any way. I think the cause of it is in the settling of the foundation soil in places, aggravated, no doubt, by the excessive rains. I am very glad that we were allowed to increase the size of the footings, for, had we not done so, it is possible that we would have had other and more serious cracks from unequal settlement.\n\nThere are eight bricklayers at work, and the quality of their work is about average. In the crucial matter of filling all their joints with mortar they are defective, and I am forced to the conclusion that filling all joints with mortar is fast becoming one of the lost arts. However, by dint of frequent reminders, they are doing fairly well in that respect, and I think our brickwork will be better than the average done throughout the country. In all other respects, apart from not completely filling all joints with mortar, the bricklayers seem good careful workmen. The same brick foreman that was employed on the Edmonton school is looking after the brickwork here.\n\nThe heating boilers, and the laundry boiler, also the hot water storage tank, have been delivered at the site, and are all in accordance with the specifications, excepting the brick lining of the heating boilers will be dispensed with, and a smoke extension placed at one end, so as to comply with the Provincial regulations in force here.\n\nWith regard to the important matter of water system, I regret that I am not yet in a position to make a recommendation for this service, but hope to be able to do so within the next few days.\nIt seems that our choice will have to be between a sturdy pumping plant with pneumatic tanks for storage and pressure (such as we have at Old Suns School); or with the same kind of pumping plant but with a tower and elevated tank. The latter system has obvious advantages from a pressure and fire protection standpoint, but cost is a prime consideration and may be compelled to adopt the cheaper system. However, I have discussed the matter with Mr. Mitchell (the partner in charge) and he has asked their Winnipeg office to forward to me an estimate and specification of a heavily framed wood tower 60' high, with a 20,000 gal. tank. This estimate is long overdue, but I am told that it should arrive in a day or two, the delay being explained by their having to send away for information concerning the office staff and arrangements with preparing tenders on other work. There is no need for special hurry as there is an abundance of time to install the outside services before they will be needed.\n\nAs soon as I have received the necessary data, I will go fully into the matters of water service, sewage disposal, and the mechanical plant for pumping and lighting.\n\nThe erection of the steel I-beams and columns has been completed in the basement. Two of the beams have come too long, probably the result of the steel people not having allowed for the rounding off the ends as called for in the amended specifications. The contractor has sent bridging from local men from Cardston who will cut pieces off the beams by the oxy-acetylene process. Probably the I-beams in the floors above will be similarly too long, and can be cut shorter at the same time. In all other respects the steel work seems very satisfactory.\n\nAbout 30 men are being regularly employed, and I have questioned the time-keeper as to whether or not the schedule of rates mentioned in the specifications are being complied with. He states that the said schedule is being followed, excepting in the case of common labourers, who are being paid 40\u00a2 per hour instead of the 45\u00a2 mentioned in the schedules. Mr. Mitchell informed me that Mr. Orr agreed to this rate if it was the going rate in the locality for common labour. Only one labourer enjoys the distinction of being classified as a \"building labourer\", and, as he is in charge of the mortar mixing, he draws 55\u00a2 per hour. I have had no complaints from any of the men regarding the rate or wages being paid, so I suppose they are all satisfied. All the men are working 10 hours per day, when weather permits, and it is the intention to work on Dominion Day too.\n\nThe Reverend Principal says that his wife is anxious for some pantry accommodation in the Principal's residence, and he wants to know if the space shown alongside of the stairs cannot be converted into a small pantry. I replied that I would bring his request to your attention, and, if you are agreeable to it, we might work in a small pantry in the space referred to, with an opening into same from the kitchen. Will you please give me your views on the subject.\n\nAfter about a month of cool wet weather, we have suddenly jumped into clear skies and summer temperatures. To-day the thermometer is standing at 82 degrees, but a light breeze from the mountains tempers the heat.\n\nThe Indian labourers and teamsters have all deserted us to attend a celebration at Macleod, lasting most of this week. There is no shortage of help, and their places are readily filled.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal's request that pantry accommodation be provided in the residence I beg to say that I do not think that this is necessary. When we are making arrangements for the furnishings for the building, provision can be made for the building of a cupboard in the kitchen which should answer the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. Maclean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. G. Smith, Esq.,\nBox 54,\nCardston, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. E.F. Claydon, president of Claydon Company Limited, the contractors for the above building, absolutely refuses to submit any receipts, vouchers or evidence of any kind that materials for this job are being paid for. He claims that, under his contract, he is under no obligation to submit proof that his company are paying for materials, and that he should not be asked for it.\n\nTo date the sum of $37,782.00 have been paid to the contractors on this job, much the larger part being for materials, and I, as Inspector, cannot say that any of these deliveries are paid for, with the one exception of a receipted invoice for nails and tar-paper which Mr. Mitchell, the partner in charge showed me.\n\nIn private building construction, a contractor would be refused a certificate unless he satisfied the Architect, or Inspector, that all bills were paid, or payments arranged for; in which latter case the Owner would be protected by the supply houses executing waivers of claims, liens, or rights to liens against the buildings or lands.\n\nIt is possible that in Government work it may not be necessary to enforce such stringent conditions, although in my experience as Inspector for the Department, I have made it my business to see that there should be no aftermath of unpaid bills in connection with building contracts. As this is something in the nature of a test case, I would ask the Department to kindly give a ruling for my guidance in this and similar cases which may arise.\n\nI have not the slightest ground for thinking that the contractors for this school building are not meeting their obligations; I simply lack evidence that they are doing so. As I have no wish to start a controversial correspondence with their Winnipeg office, I will await your reply and be guided accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nInspector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nP.O. Box 54\nCardston, Alta. July 17th, 1924\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nRe: St. Paul's Indian School Blood Reserve\n\nSir,\n\nAs mentioned to you when you called at the School building yesterday, a number of points have occurred to my mind as the work of construction proceeds, some of which, perhaps, are worthy of consideration. I will make a mention of some of the things that I referred to. My ideas are offered merely as suggestions, and, as such, I would respectfully submit them for your consideration and decision. I will briefly comment on the items on the accompanying list in the order in which they appear.\n\n1. Fire protection. I would suggest that an additional standpipe be placed in boiler room, with about 30' of hose. I would also suggest that 50' of hose be added to one of the standpipes on the ground floor, in order that the chapel and chancel might be reached by water in the event of fire.\n\n2. I believe that there would be excessively hot water delivered through the faucets, with detriment to same, unless the hot water storage tank be provided with an automatic temperature regulator, by means of which the temperature of the water would be prevented from exceeding a pre-determined point. This applies to the season of the year when the boilers are being fired and the tank heated direct from the steam mains. We have installed \"Towson Automatics\" in connection with the above named results. I am also advised that the Alberta provincial regulations require that a safety valve be provided for hot water storage tanks drawing steam from boilers.\n\n3. It occurred to me that if it is the ultimate intention to make use of the 2nd floor (attic) dormitories, perhaps night toilets will be required there. If so, should the required rough-in for same be done during construction?\n\n4. Would not a return circulating hot water line prove an economy\n\n5. I have not yet had any definite instructions as to what is to go in the place of the basement lavatory basins that have been cut out of the plans.\n\n6. Is it the intention to have only a concrete floor in the janitor's room in the basement? If this room is to be his living and sleeping quarters, should there not be a wood floor?\n\n7. In the amended specifications the ship-lag boarding of the ceiling joists has been omitted. Unless restored, it will be difficult to secure the metal ceilings; we will be compelled to use long plain lengths of metal, and with no chance of selecting patterns or designs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 637L, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n9. In the laundry we will have some exposed belts and pulleys, which should be protected with guards. In a city the factory inspector would compel us to install protection guards, for the safety of the operators.\n\n10. The storm sash have been cut out of the specifications. If possible these should be provided before the winter; without them there is danger of frost damage from pipes freezing and bursting; the sash will be greatly increased fuel consumption, the resulting frost will disfigure the woodwork and plaster. Inside basement storm sash would be preferable to the ordinary storm sash placed on the outside of the windows. The inside casements could remain permanently in place, and thus save the trouble, confusion and breakage that invariably results where outside storm sash have to be taken down and replaced with screens in the spring, and the operation reversed again in the fall.\n\n11. Owing to the difference in floor levels between the Principal's house, and the floor levels in the main school building, the pipes which carry the condensate back to the boilers by gravity flow will pass in front of a number of windows. I expect our heating sub-contractor here tomorrow, and I will discuss with him the question involved, and will write you fully on the subject.\n\n12. The radiators specified in the Principal's living room, dining room and library will come slightly higher than the level of the window sills. These should be replaced with lower ones which, if equal radiation is provided, come somewhat more expensive.\n\n13. There is doubt in my mind as to the draft to our bakery and kitchen chimney, when the wind is from the east, owing to the reduced chimney now being 17' below the level of the ridge of the main building. However, we might wait and see.\n\n14. The contractors inform me that they are procuring a name stone.\n\n15. The creosote shingle stain specified would probably be a waste of money. In this climate the creosote stains evaporate and are gone within a year or two. I would recommend a good oil stain of known merit.\n\n16. The Reverend Principal deplores the cutting out of the plan, the burlap originally specified, and states that unless some such protection is provided it will be impossible to keep some of the plastered walls from becoming disfigured.\n\n17. The Reverend Principal is desirous of having pantry facilities in his residence.\n\n18. Should the space over the charcoal be allowed to extend up 24\" to the roof, or should we have a plastered ceiling either horizontal or oval, at about the level of the longest member of the trunk and screening same. I think the latter would give the better acoustic properties.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n19. In this windy district I think it will be necessary to carry the framing of the spire down to the attic floor joists in order to hold it solid. I believe this was done at the Edmonton school. This method would take about 9'x9' of the floor of the centre dormitory.\n\n20. It is proposed to carry the waste from the laundry and kitchen also the roof water, separately from the general sewage, and discharge same into the main sewer beyond the septic tank. This method is in order to avoid detrimental consequences to the bacterial activity of the septic tank.\n\n21. There is no flue provided for the laundry. This would appear essential, in order that use may be made of a laundry stove for heating the irons. The existing chimneys cannot be tapped from the laundry.\n\nI am at present gathering data on the water system, sewage disposal system and mechanical plant, and will shortly make a special report to you on these essential services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nD REGINA, SASK. July 21st, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI received the attached letter this morning from Mr. Gardner Smith, Inspector in charge of the works at St. Paul's Indian School on the Blood Reserve, and I am hastening to forward it on to you by today's mail, so that no time will be lost.\n\nWith reference to recommendations contained in the letter, I will deal with them as they appear.\n\n1. I agree with the Inspector that an additional standpipe should be placed in the boiler room, this is, I understand, a common custom in all buildings to have a standpipe in the boiler room. The 50' of additional hose should be attached to one of the standpipes on the ground floor in order that the chapel might be reached by water in the event of fire.\n\n2. If we are to have a low pressure boiler system installed at this institution, it is not at all necessary to have the \"Powers' Regulator\" that Mr. Smith asks for.\n\n3. If the attic dormitories are to be used, it would be economy to do the roughing in at the present time. It would cost a lot of money to put this in after the building is completed, and it would cost very little to do it now. It is for you to decide whether you want this done or not.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n4. A return circulating hot water line would, in my opinion, be economy. In the first place where so much pumping has to be done, and water is so hard to get and the outlay so small, it seems to me this return circulating line should be put in. It should not cost more than from 20 to 25 cents per foot installed.\n\n5. You will be able to advise me regarding paragraph 5.\n\n6. I think that there should be a common wooden floor in the sleeping quarters of the janitor. He cannot be expected to get up in the dead of winter on a stone floor. This should cost very little and fir flooring is all that is necessary.\n\n7. Surely it will not be necessary to put in plain galvanized iron for ceilings. This would be a mistake. There is very little economy in cutting out the lining of the floor joists with common lumber, and if you decide not to do this it will have to be stripped with 2\" battens to nail this metal to. I understand that the metal ceiling is sold in 24\" squares. The very commonest of lumber would do for this and I would be glad if you would authorize it.\n\n9. It is for the Department to decide whether they will install the guards asked for.\n\n10. The matter of storm sash can be left for the time being. I doubt very much whether it would be economy to have inside casing storm sash. We can get the ordinary sash made at the factory and it would cost a lot less money, and would probably give as good results, especially in the country, where this school is situated.\n\n11. This matter speaks for itself. A mistake has been made here. I would advise waiting until we hear further. The system will not work as at present specified.\n\n12. There is no doubt in my mind that lower radiators should be installed. These, of course, will cost a little more money than the ones at present specified, but we cannot have the radiators higher than the window sills. They would work but it would be very unsightly and inconvenient.\n13. This was pointed out to me while on the ground. I suggested that the matter stand until we see how it works.\n\n15. Creosote shingle stain should not be used. A good oil stain is what is required; this is used on all good buildings in this country. It is also used by the Provincial Government.\n\n16. I quite agree with the Principal that it is a sad mistake to cut out the burlap. Inside of two months the walls will be in an unsightly condition. I do not see where there is much economy here, and I would again plead for burlap.\n\n17. I saw the plan of the kitchen when I was at the reserve. There is not a place where a dish or a pan can be put and a pantry will have to be installed. This could be in the form of a built-in cupboard.\n\n18. You will better be able to decide what should be done here.\n\n19. It was pointed out to me that the spire on this school would have to be changed and built in as described by Mr. Smith. I took this matter up with the foreman.\n\n20. To carry the waste water from the laundry and the roof is going to be an expensive job as it needs a separate drain from the building beyond the septic tank. The matter of drainage has not yet been gone into.\n\n21. It will be necessary to have a chimney from the laundry in order to keep the irons heated.\n\nMight I suggest at this time that the proper pressure system be installed in this school instead of an elevated tank, which I was told the Department had under consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\ncupboard in the kitchen when the furnishings are being provided.\n\n18. The ceiling of the chapel should be finished at a lower level as recommended by the Inspector.\n\n19. The contractor will be expected to frame the spire on the building the same as was done at the Edmonton School, that is carrying the supporting timbers down to the floor joists.\n\n21. When the contractor was in Ottawa the question of the chimney was taken up and he promised to provide a chimney with a $9 \\times 9$ flue for the laundry.\n\nWith reference to the water supply system for the building no decision has been arrived at as to the nature of this system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 25, 1944.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant enclosing a report from Mr. Gardner Smith, with reference to the work on the new St. Paul's School, and in reply I will deal with the items in your letter and in Mr. Smith's report in the order in which they are mentioned.\n\n1. Before authorizing additional stand pipe the Inspector should obtain a price from the contractors and this price should be agreed on before the work is authorized.\n\n2. The Inspector should obtain a price from the contractors and submit same for the work mentioned in this paragraph.\n\n3. This may be authorized.\n\n4. Full instructions will be sent you for the guidance of the Inspector and the contractors with reference to the table which it is proposed to install in place of the wash basins which were omitted.\n\n5. This may be authorized.\n\n6. The question of providing sheeting on the ceilings to receive the metal ceiling is under consideration and when a decision has been arrived at you will be advised.\n\n7. This can be left in abeyance for the present.\n\n8. It will be possible to rearrange the location of the radiators and the piping without additional cost.\n\n9. Oil stain is approved providing the cost is the same.\n\n10. The question of burlap was taken up with the contractor some time ago, but no decision has been arrived at.\n\n11. Arrangements can be made for the installation of a cupboard.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nReferring to my letter of the 1st instant under cover of which I forwarded one received from Mr. Gardner Smith with reference to certain matters in connection with the building of St. Paul's Indian School on the Blood Reserve, I beg now to enclose a further report from him dated the 21st July, in which he deals more fully with some of the matters enumerated in my previous letter referred to. He gives an estimate of the cost of the proposed roughing-in of the attic dormitories, as also of circulating the hot water mains running to the various fixtures. He deals also in greater detail with the question of heating the Principal's residence.\n\nTwo lesser items of expenditure refer to the spire and laundry chimney. As it is important that the heating contractor should know what decision the Department arrives at, I would be glad to receive an early reply.\n\nI also enclose a report by Mr. Gardner Smith bearing date the 30th June, which is a resume of the work which had been done on the building up to that date. It is a long one, and from a business point of view I think Mr. Gardner Smith might well abridge his reports and eliminate some of his comparisons which add to the amount of text to be reviewed, but are of no practical value.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nP. O. Box 56,\nCardston, Alta. July 21st, 1924.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nRe- St. Paul's Indian School, Blood Reserve\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the list of suggested accessories, or small additions, to the plans, that I handed to you, I am now able to give more detailed information on some of the items on said list.\n\nWith regard to an automatic temperature control for the hot water storage tank when heated by live stems from the mains, a \"Power's Automatic Temperature Control Valve\" in 12\" would cost, installed complete, $220.00. A safety valve attached to same tank, as required by the Provincial regulations, would cost about $17.00.\n\nRegarding the suggested roughing-in, for two night toilets in dormitories of attic, these would cost $137.50. If said roughing-in is done close to existing soil pipes. It is thought that this provision, if authorized, should be made in the winged bath set in the centre dormitory, for the reason that the centre dormitory is not being finished under the present contract, and will not be heated.\n\nWith reference to circulating the hot water main running to the various fixtures such as washbasins, baths and sinks, it would be necessary to run a 1\" main with 2\" and 3\" branches, and the hot water main should be covered. This provision would effect a great saving in hot water. The cost would be $220.00.\n\nRegarding the heating of the Principal's Residence, I would draw your attention to some of the special features, and if you turn to the basement heating plant in the main building, you will be able to follow my meaning more easily. You will see that the steam line follows around the walls, and in order to deliver heat to the radiators on the ground floor above, risers are taken from the main at points at or near the radiators. The condensate is also carried from the radiators through Dunham traps, and returns by gravity flow to the boilers, below the basement ceiling.\n\nOwing to the ground floor of the Principal's residence being 30\" lower than the adjoining floor of the main building, the pipe line carrying the condensate by gravity back to the boilers, and which line is suspended from the ceilings, will have to be lowered to suit this condition the entire length from the Principal's residence to the boiler room through several rooms of the basement. As there are casement windows to be passed, you will note that this pipe line will have to be 30\" from the wall to clear the casement windows when open, and from 3' to 4'-10\" below the basement ceilings. As such condition would be very slightly, as well as in the way, I think it would be advisable to overcome the objection referred to in the following way: the dry return carrying the condensate from the radiators of Principal's residence could be vented into the existing dry return of the adjoining main building. It would then be necessary to carry an extra wet return line along base of basement walls from Principal's residence back to the boiler room, and connect to the inlet side of the return trap at boilers. This method is recommended by our heating contractor as the cheapest way out of the difficulty, and would cost in labour and materials $110.00.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nWould it not be adding greatly to the cost, the best way of efficiently and economically heating the residence would be by an entirely separate steam main from the boilers, with separate returns. This would involve valving the existing steam lines which leave the steam header, and installing a 6\" by 3\" Tee, and a 3\" valve and continue the 3\" pipe line to the residence, where it would be necessary to drip and vent this steam line, carrying the drip line under the basement floor back to the boiler. Also, the vent line would be taken into the existing dry return of main building.\n\nThe advantage of such a separate heating system for the residence would be that steam could be shut off temporarily from the main building and delivered direct to the residence. This would make it possible to get heat quickly into the home at times when little or no heat may be required in the main building, and would thus save the over-heating of the main building at times in order to get heat into the residence. As the plan shows, the residence, being the farthest from the boilers will be the last to get the heat under the present system. A separate method of heating the residence, such as I have described, with the steam line covered, would cost $600, which, presumably, is prohibitive under present financial limits.\n\nThe heating contractor desires the earliest possible decision regarding this point. He has been kept up in connection with the heating of the residence. He is almost ready to lay the pipe lines, but I have asked him to defer same until I get your decision as to what we had better do under the conditions I have described.\n\nWe have found a means of putting in lower radiators in the ground floor of Principal's residence, without adding to the cost.\n\nThe contractors state that it will be almost impossible to secure the spire unless the framing of the posts is carried down to the attic floor, for which they state the cost will be $45 extra. Please instruct me about this.\n\nIf a laundry chimney is built, the cost will be $15, including a concrete footing, and flue lining. This would seem essential if a stove for heating irons is desired. I should know about this soon.\n\nI am awaiting some further cost data; after receiving same, I will make a special report, with recommendation, on a water system for the school. I hope to be able to submit this report within the next few days for your consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThe work of construction on the above building is continuing in a satisfactory manner. The contractors have a good organization, and the exceptionally good progress that has been maintained since the commencement of building operations is a tribute to the business methods practised by this firm.\n\nThe lumber delivered on the job is all well seasoned, and in all respects but one is full up to the specifications. As mentioned in a previous letter, the dimension lumber, particularly the two by four and two by sixes, have been so excessively planed away that the length of these members has been reduced by fully 25%. On my calling the contractors' attention to the serious discrepancy in this respect he explained that all the mills have adopted the same standard, presumably to save weight in shipping. The joist lumber is holding up better in size, being 1 5/8\" instead of 2\", and lacking 1/4\" in width.\n\nThe bricks have been arriving in large quantities, and in great varieties of colour. The amended specifications, as you know, have dispensed with the #1 Redcliffe pressed brick for face work, and in their place we have #1 common brick. Mr. Mill tells me that his firm made an additional agreement with the brick yard whereby, for a small additional sum, sufficient #3 pressed bricks are being sent to do all the face work on the building. Several cars of these #3 bricks have arrived, and I must say that they are a nice uniform even-coloured line of bricks, much better than I expected to get when I saw the change in the specification. They are red in colour, just dark enough to be distinctive from the ordinary red common bricks, though not a dark red.\n\nThe brickwork is now finished to the top of the basement windows of the main building, so it is now possible to see how the brickwork is going to look, and I am well satisfied with its appearance, in fact I believe it will not suffer in comparison with the facework on the Edmonton school. The white joint looks well against the red background. We are making a 3/8\" struck weather joint.\n\nThe common bricks rival Joseph's famous coat, and represent most, if not all, the colours of the rainbow. Some of them are almost white, which I was going to condemn as being underburnt, but on closer examination, I found that they were not half as bad as others. The difference in colour can only be accounted for by the light coloured bricks being made from different clay than the red ones. Among the common bricks are a good sprinkling of semi-vitrified ones, very dark in colour, and just what we needed to carry out the Architect's request that dark red bricks be used for lintels and trim, and which will introduce a nice bit of detail to the face brickwork. I have personally sorted out a great many of these dark bricks, which have been set aside for the purpose until the face brickwork reaches that stage. The recreation rooms in the basement have been lined with the common bricks, and the wall looks passably well considering the material we had to use. It is a good strong job, well suited to the walls of a play-room.\n\nRegarding the elimination of cement mortar, and the changing to lime mortar, in the amended specifications, I would say that in this respect we are not fully carrying out the change called for. I have felt that there is a point beyond which stability might be sacrificed, and it seemed to me advisable to retain some cement in the\nmore, especially in view of the reduction in the thickness of the main walls. I discussed this point with Mr. Mitchell, and he shared my opinion that some cement should be retained to give greater strength. We are, therefore, using half a shovelful of cement per wheelbarrow full of mortar in both the brick and tile work. This is not much extra, and the added expense will not be very great. Mr. Mitchell knows I have no authority to add to the cost of the building, and he states that, even if his firm never get paid for the cement, he would not feel that the cement should be entirely omitted.\n\nThe contractors have several men at work making the cast-concrete in place of the cut stone originally specified. They are fortunate in having two men in their employ who have had experience in this special work, and the results so far are found satisfactory. The workmen are performing this work in the open without any protection from sun or weather, which condition is not as favourable for good work as where a shed is provided and the maturing of the concrete is retarded. However, until the last day or two the weather has been cool and showery, which was favourable to the work. I will watch this latter part of the work closely, and, if necessary, will ask that the freshly-made pieces be covered with boards, and dampened to retard the hardening process. On the whole, the cast-concrete is proving itself, and will probably serve the purpose as well as the expensive cut stone. It seems somewhat presumptuous for mere man to assume to do in a few days what it took Mother Nature thousands of years to accomplish!\n\nAs stated in a previous letter, we have had a great deal of moisture, starting on the 3rd of June and continuing at intervals throughout the month. The contractors, having their crew camped on the site, did not lose a great deal of time, for often a heavy rain would end suddenly, when the men would resume their work. The heavy rains caused our foundations to be flooded a number of times, which caused me some uneasiness in consequence of the added danger of settlement. The contractors allowed the men to work to remove the water when requested to do so, but, in spite of the frequent flooding of the water, some softening of the foundation soil could scarcely be avoided. I have since been watching my foundation walls very closely, and only in one instance have I detected any evidence of trouble. At one point, about 15' from the N.W. corner of the main building a crack has developed vertically across the footing and foundation wall. I noticed it first last fall, and have watched it very closely. It is a very narrow crack, less than an eighth of an inch in width, and has not opened any wider since I first noticed it. I do not think it will give me any trouble, nor affect the building adversely in any way. I think the cause of it is in the softness of the foundation soil in places, aggravated, no doubt, by the excessive rains. I am very glad that we were allowed to increase the size of the footings, for, had we not done so, it is possible that we would have had other and more serious cracks from unequal settlement.\n\nThere are eight bricklayers at work, and the quality of their work is about average. In the crucial matter of filling all their joints with mortar they are defective, and I am forced to the conclusion that filling all joints with mortar is fast becoming one of the lost arts. However, by dint of frequent reminders, they are doing fairly well in that respect, and I think our brickwork will be better than the average done throughout the country. In all other respects, apart from not completely filling all joints with mortar, the bricklayers seem good careful workmen. The same brick foreman that was employed on the Edmonton school is looking after the brickwork here.\n\nThe heating boilers, and the laundry boiler, also the hot water storage tank, have been delivered at the site, and are all in accordance with the specifications, excepting the brick lining of the heating boilers will be dispensed with, and a smoke extension placed at one end, so as to comply with the provincial regulations in force here.\n\nWith regard to the important matter of water system, I regret that I am not yet in a position to make a recommendation for this service, but hope to be able to do so within the next few days.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nIt seems that our choice will have to be between a sturdy pumping plant with pneumatic tanks for storage and pressure (such as we have at Old Suns School): or with the same kind of pumping plant but with a tower and elevated tank. The latter system has obvious advantages from a pressure and fire-protection standpoint, but as cost is a prime consideration, we may be compelled to adopt the cheaper system. However, I have discussed the matter with Mr. Mitchell (the partner in charge) and he has asked their Winnipeg office to forward to me an estimate specification of a heavily framed wood pumping plant with a 20,000 gal tank. This estimate is being held up, but I am told that it should arrive in a day or two, the delay being explained by their having to send away for quotations, besides which the office staff were preoccupied with preparing tenders on other work. There is no need for special hurry as there is an abundance of time to install the outside services before they will be needed.\n\nAs soon as I have received the necessary data, I will go fully into the matters of water service, sewage disposal, and the mechanical plant for pumping and lighting.\n\nThe erection of the steel I-beams and columns has been completed in the basement. Two of the beams have come too long, probably through lack of the steel people not having allowed for the rounding of the walls as called for in the amended specifications. The contractors intend bringing out a local man from Wardston, who will cut pieces off the beams by the oxy-acetylene process. Probably the I-beams in the floors above will be similarly too long, and can be cut shorter at the same time. In all other respects the steel work seems very satisfactory.\n\nAbout 30 men are being regularly employed, and I have questioned the time-keeper as to whether or not the schedule of wages mentioned in the specifications are being complied with. He states that the said schedule is being followed, excepting in the case of common labourers, who are being paid 40s per hour instead of the 45s mentioned in the schedule. Mr. Mitchell informed me that Mr. Orr agreed to this rate as it was the going rate in the locality for common labour. Only one commoner enjoys the distinction of being classed as a \"building labourer\", and, as he is in charge of the mortar mixing, he draws 5s per hour. I have had no complaints from any of the men regarding the rate of wages being paid, so I suppose they are all satisfied. All the men are working 10 hours per day, when weather permits, and it is the intention to work on Dominion Day too.\n\nThe Reverend Principal says that his wife is anxious for some pantry accommodation in the Principal's residence, and he wants to know if the space shown alongside of the stairs cannot be converted into a small pantry. I replied that I would bring his wishes to your attention, and, if you are agreeable to it, we might work in a small pantry in the space referred to, with an opening into same from the kitchen. Will you please give me your views on the subject.\n\nAfter about a month of cool wet weather, we have suddenly jumped into clear skies and summer temperatures. To-day the thermometer is standing at 82 degrees, but a light breeze from the mountains tempers the heat.\n\nThe Indian labourers and teamsters have all deserted us to attend a celebration at MacLeod, lasting most of this week. There is no shortage of help, and their places are readily filled.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nP.O.Box 54,\nCardston, Alta.

A twenty-four inch bell, weighing about 265 lbs., can be procured here at a cost of $48.75, and I would ask for the necessary authority to make the purchase.

Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWe submit the following suggestions in an effort to have\nthe ceiling boards in the most important parts of the building:\n\nCost of ceiling boards to cover ceilings listed\non attached memo ........................................ $1125.00\n\nRe Wood Lath throughout Residence\nand on attic ceilings in School.......Cr. $210.00\n\nChange in Floors as shown on attached\nmemo.................................Cr. 446.00\n\nFor two coat work in paint instead of\nthree coat specified on outside work.Cr. 200.00\n\nFor using Galvanized wire screening\nin place of copper specified...........Cr. 155.00\n\n$1013.00\n\nBalance still to be made up.............. 112.00\n\n$1125.00\n\nWe are very anxious to see the ceiling boards placed\nto the extent suggested, even if we run the risk of not being\npaid the $112.00. We trust some way may be found of paying\nus this difference in the final settlement, but in the meantime,\nwe are quite ready to order boards and be governed by circumstances\nwith respect to payment of the difference in cost.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nThe credit for the flooring is an exceptionally good one owing to us having found a way to offset some of the extra freight. We can get carload price on Birch flooring from Winnipeg and then ship it with the wood trim, and while this is a higher rate than direct carload from the East to Cardston, it is less than L.C.L shipments. We have also figured on a saving in freight rates with respect to the Fir flooring. If you order ceiling boards as suggested, they can come forward with the Fir flooring from a British Columbian mill which will give us carload freight rate.\n\nThe omission of a coat of paint could be very well made and the job would then be equal to the average run of work done at the present time.\n\nWe believe the change to galvanized wire would be an advantage. We have found that the copper wire is very tender and the screens need to be very carefully handled, and as a rule, the wear and tear of handling this soft copper wire seems to offset very often its non-perishing qualities. On the other hand, a galvanized wire does not suffer in this regard and further, the galvanized appears to resist the decay of time. I have seen galvanized wire after twenty years wear apparently in as good state of preservation as the day it was put on.\n\nMy absence from the City has hindered gathering this data and the progress of the work now demands as quick a decision as possible. If you agree to these suggestions and I hope very much you will, will you please wire us to this effect and shipment of ceiling boards and Fir flooring will take place immediately.\n\nRe water supply. We have gone very thoroughly into the question of suitable mechanical means of providing water supply and have come to the conclusion that a deep well pump driven from a special counter shaft will be the most economical way of solving the problem. This special counter shaft I suggest be placed in line with the Laundry counter shaft and connection made to Laundry counter shaft by clutch. The same engine can be used for the triple purpose of lighting, pumping and laundry machine drive. I have made these suggestions to Mr. Smith when quoting on water tank and tower.\n\nIn addition to any figures I have quoted Mr. Smith, we will be pleased to collect the various items under head of pumping, lighting and water supply, and cover the whole of the different items under one proposal should it be found desirable to do so.\nTo date, Mr. Smith has our quotations for different phases of the water supply and we enclose herewith copy of our letter to him. This correspondence, together with quotations given you re lighting sets covers I think, all phases of the situation, but if there is anything further we can do to assist in closing out the matter, would be glad to follow your suggestions.\n\nWe have not been able as yet to find a further saving which can be employed for the putting on of paint dado where burlap has been omitted.\n\nI expect to visit Cardston sometime in August and will make a recapitulation of all that is being done and try if possible, to provide for this item so suggest it be left an open question until that time.\n\nThe specification covering blackboards call for ninety linear feet of blackboard to be installed, whereas the actual measurement on the plan calls for one hundred and two feet. We propose ordering ninety feet according to specification as this is the amount we figured on, and distribute this quantity in a way that will give the best possible results. Kindly advise if this is satisfactory.\n\nIn answer to your letter of July 2nd regarding laundry machinery, kindly note that we placed order with the Beaver Laundry Machinery in June and in so doing, stipulated that placing the order with them was subject to your approval and they undertook to satisfy you on this point. As far as we can judge, their machines are all equal with those of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. All these firms indulge in the usual shop talk regarding the superiority of their products, but as both are being sold and used by the market in general, we do not think there is any fundamental difference between them.\n\nCould you tell anything as to what finally happened over the adjustment of the water service at Edmonton. You will remember when I wrote you after visiting Mr. Graham, he had sent a man to Edmonton who claimed he could easily make the system as it was, satisfactory with very little trouble. I was rather skeptical about this unless they were prepared to have a man spend practically half his time watching the water pressure.\n\nI was in Regina last week and went to Mr. Graham's office hoping to see him and find out just what had happened, but he was away. I saw Mr. Christianson (I think it was) who told me that a change had been made by putting in flush tanks instead of the flushometer valves and that they had altered a wrong connection in the bottom of the tanks, it being claimed that the outlet from the tank was some distance from the bottom.\nI did not think there was much to this argument for while it is true that the outlet is placed in the end of the tank, it is as near the bottom as it could be, so for all practical purposes it could be said to be at the bottom or at the side.\n\nIn view of the study we have given to getting proper mechanical features at Cardston, I would very much like to know if there was anything happened at Edmonton that has a bearing on what we are trying to do at Cardston.\n\nThe thought has occurred to me that owing to Mr. Graham's criticism with respect to the absence of drains on the basement floors as an aid to washing them down, would it not be as well to provide a small grating and drain connecting same to the weepers, and grade the floors to these openings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, July 28,\n1924.\n\nE.

I am not paying any attention to this letter, and am instructing Gardner Smith in accordance with your letter.

Mr. Smith in his letter states that the cost of this will be $45 extra. Whether a charge is to be made for this is between the Department and the contractor.\n\nI note that when the contractor was in Ottawa he promised to provide a chimney for the laundry with a 9 x 9 flue. Mr. Smith in writing me says that the cost for this will be $46. No doubt he got this price from the contractor.

As pointed out in my letter of yesterday, a joint policy is not in order. Also, I have asked for additional insurance of $29,500.00, thus bringing the total insurance on the school building up to $50,000.00.\n\nAs there has been some communication with Ottawa re-insurance, I think it probable that the payment of the last certificate (No.5.) will be withheld. I would therefore suggest that you take out the insurance asked for at once, and if there is any delay in getting the policy issued (which there should not be) you might send me the interim receipts, correctly made out, and immediately on receiving same I would wire Ottawa that the risk is sufficiently covered, and there would then be no reason for withholding payment of certificate.\n\nI have no other wish than to co-operate with you in the friendliest way, and I only ask that you observe the insurance clause of the specifications.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd) E.Gardner Smith.\nInspector of Construction.\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nWINNIPEG.\n\nAugust 6th, 1924.\n\nE.Gardner Smith Esq.,\nP.O.Box 54,\nCardston Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed herewith is insurance policy #394234 for $8000.00 covering the building under construction at Cardston, Alta.

Also, the first mentioned has been returned for correction, being a joint policy with loss payable to the D.S.Genl.

Towards the latter part of June I asked that an additional sum of $3000.00 insurance be placed to cover the value of the combustible material credited to you at that time, but, in spite of frequent reminders, the policy asked for has not been received. Mr. Mitchell showed me some sort of temporary receipt, showing that a policy for $8000.00 was in course of preparation, but it has not come to hand; and, moreover, according to the receipt, it is being issued in the joint names of the Deputy Sup't Genrl. and Claydon Co. Ltd. I could not accept the policy thus made out, for the specifications do not allow a joint policy. It must be made out in the name of, and loss payable to, the Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs. If the policy in question is not thus made out, you will be required to have it changed so as to comply with the specifications.\n\nI must now ask you to kindly take out additional fire insurance at once, to the total value of $50,000.00 on the school building. I feel that I should not issue any further certificate until the fire insurance is in good order; moreover, I do not think the Department will cash the 5th certificate, issued on the 5th inst., until advised that the matter of fire insurance has been fully attended to.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd) E. Gardner Smith.\nInspector of Construction.\nP.O.Box 54,\nCardston, Alta.

Cardston, Aug. 9.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRespectfully suggest withholding payment fifth certificate until advised insurance satisfactory.\n\n(Sgd) E.Gardner Smith.\n\nI enclose copies of letters that have passed between me and the contractors' Winnipeg office, from which you will see that there has been delinquency in the matter of carrying out the insurance clause of the specifications.\n\nUntil recently there has not been any serious fire risk, as the work was largely of concrete and brickwork, but the building is now reaching a stage when there is greater risk, and I feel that I cannot assume the responsibility of allowing any further neglect in the important matter of fire insurance. A disgruntled Indian, or a revengeful discharged employee, might put a match to the building some night,- and then what about the insurance?\n\nIf the contractors take prompt action in placing the insurance now required, as suggested to them in my letter of this date, I will promptly notify the Department to that effect, so that there need not be any serious inconvenience to them in consequence of the steps that their own neglect has caused me to take.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nCARDSTONALTA AUG 9\n\nTHE SEC DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA\n\nRESPECTFULLY SUGGEST WITHHOLDING PAYMENT FIFTH CERTIFICATE UNTIL ADVISED INSURANCE SATISFACTORY\n\nE GARNER SMITH\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nReport to W.M. Graham Esq., Sheet No. 2.\n\nThe steel I-beams, and C.I. columns were erected as needed, and were fully satisfactory. Several of the beams were sent in too long lengths, owing, no doubt, to the steel people overlooking the change in the thickness of the walls. These were cut to correct length by the laborious process of using a small hack saw. The steel stairs, and the fire escapes are due to arrive within the next few days, and will be set up as soon as possible.\n\nThe cast stone that is taking the place of the cut stone originally specified is turning out very well. The contractors were fortunate in having in their employ a man who had specialized in this work, and we are getting the benefit of his experience and skill in the good quality of the artificial stone. It looks well in its place in the walls, and will probably be as lasting as the natural stone, at about half the cost.\n\nThe heating sub-contractor (Snyder & Co., of Calgary) is carrying his work forward expeditiously. The heating boilers are set up on their prepared foundations, and the steam mains have been carried through the basement. The same contractor is performing the plumbing and drainage, and the basement drains are now being laid, in accordance with the drainage plans.\n\nThe electrician is expected to arrive with his helpers tomorrow to do the electric wiring, as called for in the specifications. He will soon be followed by the lathers and plasterers.\n\nThe sheet metal sub-contractor is said to be on the way from Winnipeg. The flat roofs are now ready for him, also the gutters. This contractor will erect the metal ceilings. The contractors state that they have been advised of the restoring of the shiplap to the under side of the joists, (to receive the metal ceilings) in most of the important rooms. This will greatly facilitate the nailing or the metal to the ceilings, and will make it possible to have some detail in the designs, and we should have some variety of patterns for the different rooms to avoid a deadly monotony all through the building which would be the case if all the metal ceilings were alike.\n\nThe contractors also informed me that the hard wood floors have been dispensed with in a number of the less important rooms, and E.G. flooring substituted. Also, that the outside painting has been reduced to two-coat work. These economies are to be applied against the cost of the shiplap surfaces that receive the metal ceilings. I consider that the change in the flooring is a justifiable saving for the purpose intended.\n\nOn the whole, I can say that the job is proceeding in a satisfactory manner. The contractors complain, frequently, that I ask them to do more than is called for; and there is sometimes ground for honest differences of opinion, but I try to be fair at all times, although, as would be expected, we do not always entirely agree.\n\nThe weather during the month has been almost continuously fine, and there has not been more than three hours of lost time. On some days the temperature went over the 90 mark, but the men worked right through it. The health of the camp has been good.\n\nA large force of men are at work, and the supply of labour seems abundant.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardiner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nAlthough it is only two and one half months since the first sod was turned on this job, the contractors are today completing the framing of the roof. I think a record is being made in the way of rapidity of construction for a country job.\n\nThe brickwork is almost completed, and a number of bricklayers, and helpers, have been let go. All the outside walls are completed, with the exception of covering the gable ends. The chimneys are not yet completed; and the brick partition walls in the recreation rooms are yet to be built.\n\nThe quality of the brickwork done is only fair. I have had many occasions to make objection to the workmanship of the bricklayers, and to ask for the taking down of work, and the rectifying of small mistakes. None of these things were serious in themselves, but it has only been by frequent and persistent reminders that we have been able to get even passably fair work done. If left alone to do their work in their own way, I am sure the workmanship would be very far from complying with the high quality called for in the specifications. I believe the bricklayers who have had superior training to the average, but it seems to be almost impossible for bricklayers to lay bricks as called for in a specification. However, the contractor states that we are getting an unusually good job of brickwork, much better than is usually performed, but my own opinion is that it is not so good but that it might have been much better! I do believe, though, that the brickwork is superior to what is usually done throughout the country. My principal trouble has been to get the bricklayers to fill all vertical joints with mortar, which practice, I have concluded, might be numbered among the lost arts! The wetting of the bricks, as called for in the specifications, is another feature that is bound to be neglected unless continually insisted on. The tendency of contractors, in their eagerness for speed, are apt to be less concerned with the quality of the workmanship, and this applies particularly to the brickwork. The brick mason of today is trained for speed first, and quality of work afterwards.\n\nThe carpentry thus far performed is fully satisfactory. The contractors have a very efficient carpenter-foreman in Mr. Jennings, who has a number of particularly good carpenters under him, and the result of this happy circumstance is evident all through the job. The joists have all been laid, the studs set up, and the rough floors laid diagonally, while the framing of the main roof, including the erection of the rafters, is now being completed. We are fortunate in getting unusually fine, long straight rafters, free from defects, and the roof framing might serve as a model in good material and high class construction. Pains have been taken to securely tie the roof and thoroughly brace it. Care has also been taken to secure the brick walls to the attic floor joists particularly, the outer walls of the dormitories, where we found it very necessary to take extra precautions in this vital respect. The joist timber is good well-seasoned stock. With the exception of the smaller dimension lumber being undersized, all the lumber is satisfactory.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I.A.\nMessrs Claydon Company, Ltd.\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th inst. with Fire Insurance Policy #59395 for $8000.00, making a total of policies on the school building of $26,500.00, and $3500.00 on the temporary buildings and contents.\n\nI also received the letter of August 11th, which you had omitted to enclose with the policies sent on that date.\n\nYou state that I have made a lot of unnecessary trouble about the insurance, and you undertake to lecture me for worrying you. I have no wish to engage in controversial correspondence, but I might just remind you that I have not received any advice from Ottawa that you are to receive preferential treatment in the matter of being exempted from observing the insurance clause of the specifications.\n\nYou seem to assume that you may deal with the matter of insurance entirely on your own volition, and as the spirit happens to move you. I can only again refer you to the insurance clause of the specifications, in which it is stated that the contractor is required to keep the building insured up to 80% of its value. If you observe this requirement I will have no cause to worry you.\n\nRegarding the issuing of the policies in the joint names of the Deputy Sup't Genl. and yourselves, to which I felt bound to take exception, I may say that, as a result of your representations, Ottawa has authorized the acceptance of the policies thus made out. I might say, however, there would have been no trouble in getting your refund of the unexpired insurance, for, on the completion of the contract, Ottawa would authorize me to accept the building, and I would then be able to assign the policies to you, as has been done in numerous similar cases. However, I now have authority to accept the joint policies.\n\nAs stated before, insurance to the extent of $50,000.00 should be taken out on the basis of the value credited to you in Progress Statement No.5. Instead of prolonged arguments, I would respectfully suggest that you attend to this promptly,- that is to the balance of insurance still required under the specifications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nCardston, Aug. 26th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose copy of my letter to Claydon Company, Limited, on the subject of fire insurance.\n\nI am very sorry indeed that I am having some difficulty in getting the contractors to live up to the insurance requirements of the specifications. Mr. E. Claydon, the president of the company, seems to resent my insisting on the compliance with the specifications, and writes long argumentative letters instead of promptly putting on the additional insurance asked for.\n\nThe plain truth is that the building is much underinsured at the present time, and that is why I felt that I could not assume the responsibility of allowing the matter to drift. It was for this reason that I felt it my duty to wire you suggesting that payment of the 5th certificate be withheld until the insurance clause of the specifications is more faithfully observed.\n\nYou will note, in my letter to Claydons, that I have received insurance policies on the school building totalling $26500.00. A further policy for $6000.00 is said to be in course of preparation, which, when received, will bring the insurance up to $32500.00. This amount is far short of the 80% required, and in a few days the contractors wish to make another draw! That is they wish me to issue the 6th certificate when, at the same time, they are far short of carrying the required 80% insurance on the value credited to them at the time of issuing the 5th certificate.\n\nNothing is further from my wish than to cause any trouble or inconvenience to the contractors, and it will certainly give me great pleasure when I am able to report that the required amount of insurance is in force.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nST PAUL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, BLOOD INDIAN RESERVE, CARDSTON & ALTA.\n\nPROGRESS STATEMENT NO. 5.\n\nFreight & Cartage on Plant, . . . . . 500.00\nSetting up Camp & Temporary Buildings, . . 1000.00\nMasonry,- brickwork, concrete & tile, . . . 38000.00\nCarpentry, and common lumber, . . . . . 9850.00\nMillwork, and setting, . . . . . . . . . 7800.00\nPlumbing & Heating, . . . . . . . . . 8040.00\nStructural Steel, firescapes, stairs, etc, 6600.00\nHardware & Nails, . . . . . . . . . . 380.00\nExtra for Enlarged Footings, . . . . . . 576.00\nElectric wiring supplies & conduit pipes, . . . 800.00\n\nTotal: 73546.00\nLess 10% retained . . . . . . . . . 7354.60\n\n66101.40\nLess Previous Certificates, . . . . . . 51073.20\n\n$15118.20\n\nCardston, Alberta.

The situation is just the same as was reported to you in my letter of the 20th inst. I hold policies on the school building of $25,500; and on camp buildings and contents of $3500. In progress statement No. 6, as you will observe, credit has been given for a value of $84,936.00 which, according to the specifications, calls for insurance of $67,948.80. I have asked for insurance to the value of $60,000.00 being placed at once, which means $30,000 additional insurance.\n\nAs previously stated, I felt that the contractors were not entitled to payment of the last (5th) certificate until they complied with the insurance clause of the specifications. In issuing the 6th certificate I am doing so because the labour and materials shown have been furnished, but you will please duly note that the required insurance is seriously in arrears; and while I do not wish to presume to advise the Department, I think a direct letter to the contractors' Winnipeg office would probably be effective in bringing an observance of the insurance clause. I will at once advise the Department as soon as the matter of\ninsurance has been attended to, as required.\n\nI will forward another progress report on the work of construction within the next few days.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nRA211 29 COLLECT\n\nWINNIPEG MAN 23 1201 P\n\nHON CHARLES STEWART\n\nSUPT GENL INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nCONTRACTORS ADVISE ME TODAY THAT CLOSETS SIMILAR TO THOSE USED AT EDMONTON ARE BEING INSTALLED AT BLOOD THIS IS A MISTAKE KINDLY WIRE ME AUTHORITY TO MAKE CHANGE\n\nW M GRAHAM.\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nTELEGRAPH\n\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOTTAWA,\nAugust 23, 1924.\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the jacket heater specified for this job, for the heating of the water during the season when the steam boilers will not be in operation, I would say that there appears to be good grounds for believing that the said jacket heater will be found inadequate for the purpose intended.\n\nI have questioned the heating sub-contractor on the subject, and he has reported as follows:\n\n\"With reference to your inquiry re- the efficiency of the jacket heater, we find that the heater specified has a capacity of 225 gals. per hour, rated on anthracite coal. We consider that in using the local coal, and with the corrosion that will result from the using of the water from the school well, in a short time the capacity of this heater will be less than 100 gals. per hour. This we consider entirely inadequate, and we would recommend one having a capacity of 600 gals. per hour (rated capacity) as being as small as is practical to use for this service. The larger heater, with a rated capacity of 600 gals. per hour would cost an additional sum of eighty two dollars and fifty cents ($82.50).\"\n\nThe heating contractor states that his quotation of $82.50 is additional is subject to the order being given in time to enable him to include the heater in a car of radiation that is being shipped from Toronto. The car is due to leave Toronto on short notice, and if it is desired to change the jacket heater to one of more ample capacity, a very prompt decision is asked for.\n\nAwaiting your valued instructions in the matter,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.)

I do not know that I would be prepared to recommend the installation in all the schools, but transfer Dr. Westgate's suggestion for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI attach hereto a form which might be utilized in recording the particulars of the pupils.

You also informed me that on the same date you communicated that information to the Inspector of Works.\n\nWhen in Winnipeg the other day, I saw the contractors who informed me that they were just about to ship the Sloan valves, and I therefore telegraphed to the Minister on the subject pointing out that this would be a mistake, and asking for authority to make the change.\n\nIt is unfortunate that in your letter of the 4th June you did not request me to pass on the Department's decision direct to the contractors, for it would appear to be quite evident that the Inspector of Works did not communicate this decision to them direct, although he may have advised the foreman in charge on the ground. If the Department would, particularly in connection with matters on which I have been in communication with the Department, communicate their decisions to the proper parties through me, much delay and confusion would be avoided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

In case the erection is taken care of by the purchaser, it is understood that such portions of these specifications as refer to the erection are not binding upon the Horton Steel Works, Limited.\n\nSTRENGTH AND STABILITY.\nThe structure will be proportioned to withstand safely the following loads and forces acting separately or in combination:\n1. Weight of the structure.\n2. Weight of the water in tank.\n3. Wind stresses incurred by a hurricane blowing at a rate of one hundred miles per hour from any direction.\n\nThe thickness of plates and sizes of all the principal members are shown on the accompanying plan. The details will be capable of transmitting safely the stresses for which said members are proportioned. Complete strain sheets and such detail drawings as will clearly show the dimensions of all parts, methods of construction, connections, etc., will be submitted, if desired.\n\nQUALITY OF MATERIAL.\nExcept as noted herein, all metal in the structure will be made in accordance with the specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials, serial number A7-16, and modifications as allowed in those specifications will be permitted.\n\nBOTTOM PLATES\u2014PRESSING STEEL QUALITY.\nBottom plates will be made of open-hearth steel to the following specifications:\nMaximum Phosphorus, .04 percent.\nTensile strength, 45,000 to 55,000 pounds per square inch.\nYield point not less than one-half the tensile strength.\nElongation in eight inches, minimum percent 1,500,000 divided by the tensile strength.\nCold bend test, 180 degrees flat on itself, without fracture on outside of bent portion.\n\nSTRUCTURAL STEEL AND PLATES.\nStructural steel and plates (except for the bottom and roof) will be made by the open hearth process, and will be of the grade known as \"Structural Steel.\"\nMaximum Phosphorus, .06 percent.\nTensile strength 55,000 to 65,000 pounds per square inch.\nYield point not less than one-half the tensile strength.\nElongation in eight inches, minimum percent 1,500,000 divided by the tensile strength.\nCold bend test, 180 degrees flat on itself without fracture on outside of bent portion for material under 3/4\" thick and 180 degrees around two thicknesses without fracture for material 3/4\" and over.\n\nROOF PLATES.\nRoof plates may be made by any process, but must be of a grade that will pass surface inspection.\n\nWORKMANSHIP.\nJOINTS IN COMPRESSION MEMBERS.\nJoints in compression members will be planed so that good contact will be secured between the abutting ends.\n\nPUNCHING.\nPunching will be accurately done. The necessary machinery will be in first-class condition.\n\nRIVET SPACING.\nIn general for work requiring caulking, holes will be spaced not more than ten times the thickness of the thinnest part connected.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nRIVETS.\n\nRivets will completely fill the holes, and will be either hand driven or power driven at the option of the Horton Steel Works, Limited.\n\nCAULKING.\n\nTanks made of plates over one-eighth inch in thickness will be made water tight by caulking only. No foreign substance of any description will be put in the laps between such plates.\n\nFORMING PLATES.\n\nTank plates, both sides and bottom, will be shaped cold. If necessary, small detail pieces may be bent hot without annealing.\n\nDETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nCOMPRESSION MEMBERS.\n\nCompression members will be of the open type, to allow for inspection and painting. Splices in main columns will be located as near as practicable to the horizontal struts so as to secure the greatest rigidity.\n\nCOLUMN BASES.\n\nColumn bases will be designed so that they can be easily cleaned and painted and will not collect water or dirt. They will be of such size and so constructed as to properly distribute and lead the foundations.\n\nCIRCULAR GIRDER AND BALCONY.\n\nA circular girder will be provided at the connection of the posts to the tank to resist the horizontal shear and bending moments due to the horizontal components of the stresses in the inclined tower columns. This girder will serve as the floor of the balcony and will be provided with a substantial steel railing around its outer edge. When the tower columns are verified and the capacity of the tank is not in excess of 12,500 gallons, the balcony will be omitted unless otherwise shown on the plan.\n\nPOST CONNECTIONS.\n\nPost connections to the tank, in order to avoid eccentric loading on the tower columns, will be so made that the center of gravity of the column section intersects the center of the connection between the bottom and side of the tank.\n\nRODS.\n\nRods used in tower bracing will be square or round in cross section, with enlarged screw ends and provision for adjustment.\n\nROOF.\n\nThe roof will be conical in form, made of steel or iron sheets cold riveted and securely fastened to the tank. An ornamental finial will be secured to the apex of the roof. A suitable hatch will be provided near the ladder to permit ready access to the inside of the tank.\n\nLADDER.\n\nUnless otherwise stated in the proposal, a ladder will extend from the apex of the steel rod of the circular girder of the tank. This ladder can be revolved entirely around the tank so that the roof and outside of the tank are easily accessible for inspection and painting. When the posts are inclined a short vertical ladder will extend from the circular girder to a tower column; unless otherwise specified in the proposal, the lattice column itself will serve as a ladder from this point to the ground.\n\nEXPANSION JOINT.\n\nWhen the tank bottom is elevated thirty feet or more above the ground or building roof an expansion joint will be furnished connecting the riser pipe to the bottom of the tank. In order to prevent contact between two iron surfaces and the consequent trouble from corrosion, this joint will be made with a cast-iron shell having a brass gland and a brass wearing surface. A short piece of pipe machined to proper size will be furnished with the expansion joint. This piece of pipe will not be put in place nor the expansion joint packed by the Horton Steel Works, Limited unless its contract includes the erection of the riser pipe.\n\nANCHOR BOLTS.\n\nAnchor bolts, if same are included in the proposal, will be furnished F. O. B. cars at delivery point via less carload freight and are to be set in the foundations by the foundation builder. The anchor bolts will be of sufficient size to resist the uplift due to the wind when the tank is empty. Anchor bolts will not be furnished for tanks that go on buildings unless so stated in the proposal.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nBefore leaving the shop all steel work, except the contiguous surfaces of tank plates, will receive one coat of graphite or equally good paint. After erection the entire tower and tank, both outside and inside, will be given a coat of graphite or equally good paint.\n\nIf the erection is completed with the exception of the painting and at such time the weather conditions are unsuitable for painting, the structure is to be accepted by the purchaser as complete without such painting, but it is expressly understood that a reasonable sum shall be reserved by the purchaser out of the contract price to cover the cost of the painting.\nACCESSORY ITEMS.\n\n(Not furnished unless so stated in the proposal.)\n\nINDICATOR.\n\nThe indicator will consist of a target sliding vertically on a channel over a graduated scale. The target will be connected by a brass chain which passes over two pulleys at the top of the tank, to a suitable float inside the tank. The indicator will not be furnished unless so stated in the proposal.\n\nINLET PIPE.\n\nStandard cast-iron pipe will be used for the riser pipe, unless wrought pipe is specified. At proper intervals this pipe will be stayed to the main posts by horizontal rods. The inlet pipe will not be furnished unless so stated in the proposal.\n\nFROST CASING.\n\nWhere the climate makes it necessary to protect the water in the riser from freezing a frost casing should be built around the riser pipe. This frost casing will generally be circular in form and built of one or more thicknesses of lumber as the climate demands. At the connection between the frost casing and the tank bottom a removable steel-covered section of the frost casing will be provided so constructed as to permit expansion of the frost casing and allow access to the tank riser expansion joint and other pipe connections. If the work furnished by others is not completed so that the Horton Steel Works, Limited can build the frost casing immediately upon completion of its own work, the purchaser shall compensate it for the expense of delays or of sending men back to construct the frost casing. To avoid danger of freezing in a cold climate, water in the riser pipe must be kept in circulation or some means of heating provided. This casing will not prevent freezing in the riser pipe, if the water is allowed to remain stationary for any length of time. The frost casing will not be furnished unless so stated in the proposal.\n\nERECTION CONDITIONS.\n\nThe purchaser is to provide a suitable unobstructed roadway to the tank site and a clear space immediately adjacent to the tank site for the storage of materials and tools. Prior to the starting of the erection of the tower, excavations for the pipe work or other construction between the foundations, or in the immediate vicinity thereof, shall be filled in and obstructions removed by the purchaser.\n\nAny overhead obstructions to the erection, such as telephone and electric wires or other overhead lines, shall be removed by the purchaser at his own expense before the erection is started.\n\nTANKS ON BUILDINGS.\n\nThe erection of a tank upon a building involves concentrated loads upon the walls, foundations and other parts thereof, which necessitates a most careful examination of the building structure, to make sure that the load of the contemplated tank can be safely carried in the manner proposed. If the structure covered by these specifications is erected on a building, the Horton Steel Works, Limited assumes no responsibility whatsoever for the stability of the building, or any part thereof.\n\nCLEANING UP.\n\nUpon completion of the erection the Horton Steel Works, Limited will remove or dispose of all rubbish and other unsightly material caused by its operations and will leave the premises in as good condition as it found them.\n\nTEST.\n\nUpon completion of the erection, the structure will be tested by filling the tank with water and any leakage or other defects which may appear will be repaired so as to leave the tank in absolutely first-class condition. The purchaser shall make connections, furnish and pump sufficient water for making all tests promptly. In case the purchaser is not prepared to test the tank upon completion of the erection he shall compensate the Horton Steel Works, Limited for expense of delays to the erection crew or for the expense of sending men back later to witness test and repair leaks if necessary.\n\nEXTENSION OF TIME.\n\nAny period of delay caused by the failure or default of the purchaser, or by the failure or default of any owner, sub-contractor, or third party, to furnish material, or to do work as agreed upon with the Horton Steel Works, Limited, or by the failure or default of any common carrier to transport material for said works, according to the prevailing schedule of transportation in effect at the time said work was commenced, by strikes or lockouts of workmen, or by accidents, or by the action of mobs or the public enemy, or by war, or by any other acts of lawlessness, interrupting the said work, or destroying or injuring the material therefor; or by the act of Providence, or by inclement weather, or by other unavoidable causes, shall be added to the time for the completion of the structure.\nPAYMENT AND TITLE.\n\nUpon default of the purchaser in making any payment when due, or in carrying out any of the conditions of the contract, the entire purchase price shall at once at the option of the Horton Steel Works, Limited become due and payable.\n\nThe title to all material furnished by the Horton Steel Works, Limited for this structure until fully paid for, shall be and remain in the Horton Steel Works, Limited and all such materials shall at all times be and remain, and shall be considered as personal property, notwithstanding the mode or manner in which such personal property shall be annexed or attached to the realty, and in the event of any default by the purchaser, the Horton Steel Works, Limited may at once and without process of law, take possession of any and all material used or intended for use in this structure, and remove same from the premises as and for its property.\n\nINDEMNITY.\n\nThe Horton Steel Works, Limited agrees to indemnify the purchaser from all claims and demands for damages or compensation from injuries to persons or property caused by the negligence of the Horton Steel Works, Limited in the erection of this structure.\n\nPERMITS.\n\nThe Horton Steel Works, Limited will furnish such stress sheets and plans of the water tower as may be necessary to secure building permits and licenses for the erection of the structure. Such building permits and licenses must be procured by the purchaser at his own expense, before erection is started.\n\nFOUNDATIONS.\n\nThe purchaser shall furnish the foundations including the reinforcing steel, unless otherwise stated in the proposal. The foundations shall be built and the anchor bolts set as shown on plans which the Horton Steel Works, Limited will furnish. The cost of any delay in starting erection, which may be caused by the foundations being improperly constructed or the anchor bolts being incorrectly set, shall be borne by the purchaser.\n\nIn furnishing the foundation plans it must be clearly understood that the Horton Steel Works, Limited acts only in a purchasing capacity and assumes no responsibility whatsoever for the load the soil will safely sustain. Unless notified by the purchaser of unusual soil conditions, the foundations will be designed for a maximum pressure on the soil of two tons per square foot. They will also be of sufficient weight to resist, with a proper factor of safety, the uplift due to wind forces.\n\nThe excavation must be carried to such a depth that the foundation footings will be both below the frost line and on firm soil, deeper than shown on the plan if necessary to accomplish these results.\n\nThe footings will consist of concrete piers with the necessary anchor bolts. In the lower part of the foundations the concrete must be made of one part Portland cement, three parts sand and five parts broken stone or gravel. The cement must be of the best quality and free from any foreign material. The sand must be fine, sharp and clean, free from any clay or loam. The broken stone or gravel must not be larger than 2\" in any dimension and must be entirely free from dirt or any foreign substances. The materials must be thoroughly mixed and immediately deposited in place. Any concrete which has been allowed to even partially set must not be put into the foundations. The concrete in the top 12\" of the foundations must be enriched by doubling the amount of Portland cement specified above.\n\nWhen the foundations are built by the Horton Steel Works, Limited and conditions are found such as to require extra excavation, wet excavation or more concrete, materials or labor than is called for on the foundation plans, the Horton Steel Works, Limited shall be compensated for the additional expenses involved.\n\nUpon completion of the foundations the foundation builder shall backfill the excavation and shall grade level the area between the piers and the immediate vicinity thereof to approximately one foot below the tops of the piers.\n\nGUARANTEE.\n\nThe Horton Steel Works, Limited guarantees for one year the structure it furnishes under these specifications to the extent that it will repair any defects due to faulty design, workmanship or material, which may appear in the structure during that period.\nReport on Sewage Disposal for St. Paul's Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a blueprint showing a plan of sewage disposal designed for this institution. It is along the lines recommended by Mr. R. B. Owens, F.A., R.S., the Provincial Sanitary Engineer, who is a noted authority on the subject. It is similar in principle to the one that was installed at the Indian Hospital at Gleichen.\n\nThis method of sewage disposal is known as the \"Aerobic Bed System\" and the special feature about it is that the solids of the sewage are held in suspension on the perforated shelves during the interval between the siphonic emptying of the tank and the rising again of the liquid to the high water mark. In this way the solids are exposed directly to the action of the aerobic bacteria most of the time; and through this agency, the oxidation and liquefying of the solids take place more readily than would otherwise be the case. When the rising liquid reaches the high water mark the siphonic action again takes place, resulting in the complete emptying of the tank of all liquid, and leaving the solids again exposed to the destroying aerobic bacteria. The resulting effluent is said to be very much better than that from the deep anaerobic tank. As the liquid rises in the large chamber it simultaneously rises in the siphon chamber, being admitted through openings at the floor level of the main tank, and, as stated before, when the liquid reaches the high water level (about 15\" from bottom of bell) the emptying of the tanks again takes place.\n\nIn the Plan, as you will observe, I show two chambers. The sewage enters in the centre, and falls on a baffle board controlled by floats. This feature I copied from the one in use at the Edmonton Indian School, but, since drawing the plan I have decided that it is not entirely reliable, and I would substitute it for an ordinary Y shaped tile, with one fork of the Y discharging into one chamber, and the other branch discharging into the opposite chamber. The Y could not get out of order, or fail to function; and in the event of it being necessary to shut...\noff one tank for any purpose (such as for repairing siphon, or cleaning out, etc.) all that would be necessary to do to control the intake would be to block one end of the Y, and thus throw all the sewage into the other chamber.\n\nThe perforations in the shelves should not be directly over one another, but should be \"staggered\".\n\nI propose to locate the tank within 100' of where the main sewer leaves the school building. The outlet will be in a depression, or small watercourse (dry most of the time), distant about 750' from the school. I have the exact survey figures for this sewer line, furnished by Mr. Fairchild, the Department's Surveyor. We have just barely sufficient fall in the line, but by exercising care, and laying the pipes with the help of an instrument, we can get by all right.\n\nAs the final effluent discharges at the outlet of the system, it will inevitably form a considerable pool there, owing to the slightness of the fall to the watercourse. For this reason, particularly, it is important to install a scheme of sewage disposal that will give the greatest purification to the sewage in order to avoid a most objectionable nuisance from bad odours. The aerobic bed system is said to be very superior in its action to the ordinary deep tanks, and there should be the minimum amount of smell from such a system.\n\nWith regard to cost, the Gladson Co. have quoted a price of $2100.00 for the entire sewer line and septic tank, built according to plan. This included 750' of trench, averaging about 5' in depth, laying of the 6\" vitrified tile supplied by them, and installing the aerobic tank, complete in every respect. They also offer to do it on the basis of proven cost, plus 10%. My own opinion is that a saving would be effected in having it done on the cost plus basis. At Gleichen we saved about $300.00 by having the Hospital sewage plant put in this way, as compared with the contractors' tender.\n\nAs the season is advancing, I am sure you will see the desirability of an early decision regarding this essential service.

Gardner Smith; the report is lengthy.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the pumping plant, water storage, generator plant, etc., and I agree with him that, as the season is advanced, something should be done at once. There is no necessity for Mr. Smith coming all the way to Regina to report to me personally, a letter will do and I have so informed him.\n\nI am also enclosing herewith specifications from the Horton Steel Works, Limited, quoting prices for an elevated water storage and pumping tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nSince my last report, written on the 31st of July, steady progress has been maintained by the contractors, and it now seems practically assured that the contract will be completed well within the time-limit (December 15th).\n\nThe brickwork is now completed, and all the brick masons have gone. It is the intention to bring back a local bricklayer from Cardston to do some remaining beam filling between the wall plates and the under side of the roof of the Chapel; and also to do some pointing up where other trades have found it necessary to make passages through the masonry walls.\n\nIn my last report I mentioned the ever-present difficulty in getting bricklayers to perform their work in accordance with a strict specification. As a class, they are the most independent men that come on a job, and, as they are difficult to replace, it becomes necessary to deal with them tactfully. By precept, and moral suasion, and innumerable reminders, I think I may say that the workmanship of the bricklayers has turned out much better than the average work done, and with the minimum of friction as between them and myself. I had very little confidence in the brick foreman, and found it necessary in several instances to request that work be taken down and done over again. My requests were always complied with promptly, and as the brickwork was very closely checked by me, the mistakes were rectified before any had gone far.\n\nThe cast-stone work is completed and in place on the building. It seems to be very satisfactory, and looks almost as well as the expensive cut stone which it replaced in the specifications, although it remains to be seen whether it will withstand the test of time as well as stone.\n\nThe concrete floors are now being put down in the base-\nment, as specified. A foundation of coarse gravel and broken bricks was first laid over the clay soil.\n\nThe installing of the heating system is well advanced. The two heating boilers were set up some time ago, but are yet to receive their specified covering. The steam mains, and return lines, have been carried throughout the basement below the ceilings, and the risers and returns carried up to the various rooms on the floors above. We have made a number of slight changes where the design or construction made changes necessary, but none were of sufficient importance to report. Mention was made of the desirability of a separate wet return from the Principal's residence, and this was duly authorized at a cost of $110.00. The coal bin shown on the plan was changed to one 2\u00bd times as large, built with its reinforced roof finishing at grade level. This large underground bin will be of tremendous advantage to the school during all the years that coal will have to be stored there. It has a capacity of two large car-loads. The additional cost of the larger coal storage was estimated at $550.00, and the Department authorized the outlay, provided a saving in something else could be made, and applied on the coal bin. This was accomplished by changing the concrete specification from 1 of cement & 4 of gravel, to a 1 to 5 mixture, to which the Department's Architect had consented. The saving in cement was credited to the coal bin.\n\nThe hot water storage tank has been referred to by me in a former letter. I drew attention to the need of an automatic temperature regulator, and I have not received any instructions regarding this very desirable attachment. The advantage of a temperature regulator was explained in my letter of July 17th, and its cost given in a letter dated July 21st.\n\nThe work of installing the rough plumbing is also well advanced, and I expect to subject the soil, waste and vent pipes to the water test within the next day or two. The concrete floors being now put down in the basement are not over drain pipes, and will not be until all joints are found to be tight. The roughing-in for night toilets in attic dormitories is being done, as instructed by you.\n\nThe sheet metal contractor is carrying his work forward in a satisfactory manner. The gutters have been lined with galvanized iron, and extending 30\" on roof as specified. The galvanized work on spire, roof valleys, and porches has been done, and flashing is being put in place, as needed. This contractor seems very efficient in his line of work. The metal ceilings will\nhave their nailing boards restored in most of the important rooms. The contractor informs me that the ceiling material has been shipped and is without variety in design. That means that we will have long plain sheets for the rooms where there are no ceiling boards, and throughout the other rooms, where a range of patterns might have been given, we will have a monotonous design for all these rooms. As it was possible to give a variety of ceiling designs for the various important rooms, without adding appreciably to the cost, if at all, I think it is unfortunate that some variation in ceilings was not provided for. However, perhaps my complaint is sentimental rather than practical.\n\nThe electrical contractor has his conduit pipes laid throughout most of the building, and in accordance with the wiring plan that was sent to the Department's Architect for approval. In this work, too, there were a few instances where slight changes from the plans were made to meet the exigencies of construction, or to meet a special need. On completion, this work will be tested by the authorized inspector of the Western Canada Fire Underwriters, and a certificate of inspection procured. The electric generating plant is not included in the general contract, and I intend dealing with this requirement in a separate report on the needed auxiliary services.\n\nThe work of lathing and plastering is now under way. The metal lath has been put on the walls where specified, and the wood lath used in the Principal's residence and the ceilings of the attic dormitories. The plastering just started yesterday. Three plasterers are at work, with the necessary labourers.\n\nThe shingling of the roof is partly completed, and is being well done. The cedar shingles are of good quality, entirely free from knots. The felt and gravel roofs, and the chapel roof, have not yet been started.\n\nThe painting of the spire was done yesterday and today, in a French grey colour. It is the intention to stain the shingles in a dark green color, using an oil stain instead of creosote; and to paint the outside trim in a light stone shade, just slightly off a cream. The painter is the same contractor that did the painting work on the Edmonton Indian School.\n\nThe steel stairs have been set up, and are being used in the work of construction. As the mastic floors have been dispensed with, we will be unable to procure that material for the treads of the stairs, so will have to make treads of cement, and\nmake use of a cement hardener. The fire-escapes have not yet been erected, but the parts are all here, and will be put up soon.\n\nThe combined kitchen & bakery chimney has been built to the reduced height called for in the amendments. I will be very agreeably surprised if the draft is good, on account of it finishing below the ridge of the main building. The main chimney has been completed to the enlarged flue size insisted on by the heating contractor. A brick chimney has been built in the laundry to accommodate the stove needed to heat the irons.\n\nThe carpentry work throughout has been satisfactory, and I have found the carpenter-foreman, Mr. Jennings, a very efficient and painstaking builder. He has a staff of first class carpenters assisting him, selected by himself, and up to the present time I have had no cause for complaint in connection with that branch of construction.\n\nThe general contractors (Claydon Co., Ltd) are represented on the job by Mr. W. Mitchell, who is a partner in the business. This gentleman was in charge of the construction of the Edmonton Indian School built last year, and has been applying himself here with energy to the carrying of the work forward with all possible rapidity. Supplies have been purchased and delivered well in advance of requirements, and costly delays, so common in country construction, have been avoided.\n\nRegarding the auxiliary services of pumping plant, water storage, electric generating plant, lighting fixtures throughout the building, sewage disposal, etc., it is my intention to make a special report to you on these essential requirements, either in person or by letter, as you may direct. As the season is advancing, it is important that consideration be given to these things as soon as conveniently possible.\n\nDuring the plastering of the building there will be a slackening in the carpentry work, and it would be easily possible for me to be absent for a few days without detriment to the building, in case you wish me to report to you personally.\n\nThe weather has been very favourable throughout the month, only two half-days being lost from rain. The supply of labour continues abundant, although when harvesting starts, the surplus labour may be absorbed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the auxiliary services that will be needed in connection with St. Paul's School, I beg to submit herewith proposals for installing same.\n\nWATER STORAGE\n\nI have given consideration to three methods of storing water, viz:\n1st, by means of a steel tower and steel tank; 2nd, by means of a framed wooden tower and wood tank; and 3rd, by means of pneumatic pressure tanks. I will review each of the three methods in the order in which I have mentioned them.\n\nSteel Tower & Tank. I enclose herewith a blue print of a 60' steel tower, and a 20,000 gallon steel tank, with specifications fully describing same, as submitted by Horton Steel Works, Ltd. of Bridgburg, Ontario. This is a modern and high class plant, and would provide an abundant reservoir, and give ample pressure for fire protection. The supply of water in the tank would be adequate for all the requirements of the institution, for fire protection, for lawns and gardens, and for outside purposes such as the watering of dairy cows, work horses and other live stock. Many industrial plants, and private institutions, even where city water pressure is present, are adopting this means of independent supply, largely as an extra precaution against fire losses. The Provincial Government of Alberta are using these steel towers and tanks in nearly all of their important institutions. The price quoted ($5190.00) plus say an additional $500.00 for foundations and frost protection, making a completed price of about $5700.00, is not excessively high for a plant of this kind erected at the school site here. Were it decided to adopt this method of water storage and pressure, competitive prices from two or three other firms might well be obtained.\n\nWooden Tower & Tank. I am also enclosing a blue print of what is known as a \"railway type\" of tower and tank, such as is largely\nused in Western Canada, with satisfactory results. The Claydon Co. have submitted a quotation of $4051 for the tower, tank and housing, as shown on the blue print. If the housing is omitted, and the tank heated in winter by a steam line from the heating boilers of the school, the price would be reduced by $1102.00, but we would have to add the cost of the steam line and protection covering, amounting to $500.00, which would bring the total price up to $3459.00. This price would include the 60' framed tower, and 20,000 gal. wood tank, with open tower but housed tank, connected to the pumping plant, and heated through protected steam pipes rendered frost proof, and provided with an overflow. This plant would also be very satisfactory, not as durable as the steel plant first quoted, but at quite a saving in first cost. Should this proposal be considered, it would not be necessary to house the wooden tower; the price last mentioned, ($3459.00) would apply. The necessary foundations are included.\n\nPneumatic Pressure Tanks. When pressure tanks are considered, we at once abandon the idea of a large reservoir of water for fire protection, and a reserve against breakdowns of pumping plant. Two 4'x 18' standard steel pressure tanks, installed complete, with the usual water and pressure gauges, each tank having a capacity of 1500 gallons, and a working capacity of about 1000 gals., and guaranteed suitable for a pressure of 60 lbs would cost $996.00, as quoted by Claydon Co.Ltd. The total working capacity of this plant would be scarcely 2000 gals. on one pumping. The pressure would vary between almost nothing to 50 lbs. Frequent pumpings would be necessary to keep up a reasonably fair pressure, especially for the higher floors, and for fire protection. Should an outbreak of fire occur at a time when the pressure happened to be low, the facilities for fighting the fire would be far from good. There would be no reserve of water in case of breakdown of plant; nor would there be water to spare for outside stock or gardening. The supply of water in the school well is very abundant, and this well will furnish more water than can possibly be used. I witnessed a test of 1000 gals. per hour. The work of construction, which made heavy and frequent demands on the water, did not noticeably affect the supply. But if the water has to be delivered through the pressure tanks, very frequent pumping will have to be resorted to.\n\nIn addition to the price quoted for the pressure tanks ($996.00) it will be necessary to add another $476.00, as quoted by the contractors, for preparing a suitable chamber to receive the tanks. Such a chamber would require to be 12'x 21', with 7\" wall, 3\" con. floor, 5\" re-inforced concrete roof. The best place to install the tanks would be in a separate chamber built at the West end of the boiler room on the outside of the building, with said chamber finishing on the level of the boiler floor, and with access to the tanks through a 4' opening in the boiler room wall. It will also be necessary to provide a 2\u00bd\" air compressor in order to get anything approaching\nthe full efficiency out of the tanks, and will cost $100.00, including piping having check and relief valves, belting and the necessary pulleys to connect to the transmission line. The prepared chamber at $476.00, and the compressor at $100.00, added to the cost of the tanks in place, would bring the total cost of the two pressure tanks installed complete and connected up with the water system, to $1572.00. This would be a very good plant, as pressure tank systems go, but would have the drawbacks referred to. There is no available space anywhere in the basement for pressure tanks. If placed in the prepared chamber they would always be accessible for inspection or repair; the re-inforced roof would be sufficiently below grade to avoid frost trouble.\n\nPUMPING PLANT.\n\nIn considering a pumping plant for St. Paul's school, we can rely on having an abundant supply of water to draw from. The well was drilled to a depth of 140', and the water rose in the casing to within 30' of the surface. I witnessed a thorough testing of this well, and found the capacity to be in excess of 1000 gals. per hour. In fact we were unable to lower the level of the water below a point 40' from the surface of the ground even when bailing at the rate of 1000 gals. per hour, which means that we still had 100' of water in the well. There is sufficient water in this well for all possible needs of the institution, including the barn and live stock.\n\nProposal No.1. Hoosier pattern working head #1601, having adjustable strokes 6-9-12\" at 30 strokes per minute.\n\nCylinder to be 24\" all brass working barrel 30\" long connected with pump with 3\" galv. plugged and reamed drop pipe and 1 5/8\" ash rods with forged couplings. Cylinder to be placed 50' below pump head.\n\nThe discharge pipe to pressure tanks, or elevated tank, shall be 3\" galv. piping, twinned to the two tanks with each tank having 2\" gate valves. There would also be placed on this line one 1\" relief valve, and one 2\" horizontal swing check valve having leather seat.\n\nThe necessary pulleys, belting, etc., is included, to connect up with the transmission line in the machinery room for the lighting and laundry plants.\n\nThe capacity of this unit is 550 gals. per hour. The cost of this unit would be $451.00 installed complete.\n\nProposal No.2. This unit to be the same as the 1st proposal excepting that the working barrel would be 35\", the drop pipe 4\" rods to be 1 7/8\", and the discharge pipe 3\". The capacity of this unit would be 1000 gals. per hour; and the cost would be $632.50.\nPumping Plant (cont'd)\n\nProposal No.3. This unit to be the same as the 1st proposal excepting that the working head will be Hoosier pattern #1701, having adjustable 25 strokes per minute. The capacity of this unit is 770 gals. per hour. This unit contains a heavier working head, and would last much longer than that quoted in proposals 1 & 2. The cost of this unit would be $687.50.\n\nProposal No.4. This unit to have Hoosier pattern #1701 working head, and the same piping, cylinder, etc., as described in the 2nd proposal. Its capacity is 1420 gals. per hour. The cost would be $841.50.\n\nThe last-described proposal consists of a heavy duty, large capacity pumping plant. It would perform its work without strain, and should last for many years without repairs. Should pressure tanks be adopted for water storage, this last-mentioned pumping plant would fill the tanks with the minimum of pumping, and a fair pressure could be more readily maintained than with the lighter plants of less capacity. This is an important point from the standpoint of fire protection.\n\nIn each of the 4 proposals the capacity mentioned is the maximum, and obtained on the longest strokes. The speeds are as determined best by hydraulic engineers. A high speed pump does not work satisfactorily in any case, and particularly when delivering water against pressure in a storage tank. The capacities mentioned are in American gallons, which is about 20% less than Imperial gallons.\n\nThe power required to operate the pumping plant will come direct from the engine that will drive the electric generator; and sufficient surplus power will be allowed for the pumping when considering the desired horse power of the engine. I will go fully into the matter of the engine and lighting plant in a separate report on that branch of the auxiliary services.\n\nWith the exception of the quotation on the steel tower and steel tank, which came direct, all the other quotations are from Claydon Co., the general contractors for the school. The prices they have quoted are based on the best quotations they have been able to obtain, added to the estimated cost of the required labour of installing, and including contractor's usual profit of 10%. If\nReport on Auxiliary Services. Sheet No.5.\n\npreferred by the Department, the contractors are prepared to install any of the auxiliary services at proven cost, plus 10%. This firm has its plant and men now on the job, and should be able to carry any additional work through expeditiously.\n\nThe various propositions contained in this report may be summarized as follows:\n\nWATER STORAGE.\n\n1. Steel Tower & Tank, capacity 20,000 gals. cost installed complete $5700.00.\n\n2. Framed Wood Tower & Tank. Capacity 20,000 gals. cost installed complete $3459.00.\n\n3. Pneumatic Pressure Tanks. Capacity 3000 gallons. Working Capacity 2000 gallons. cost installed complete in prepared concrete chamber & with air compressor $1572.00.\n\nPUMPING PLANT.\n\n1. Proposal No.1. Hoosier Head #1601 and in accordance with specifications on sheet No.3. cost $451.00.\n\n2. Same head as last proposal, but with capacity increased by larger cylinder, piping, etc., cost $632.50.\n\n3. Same as first proposal excepting with heavy Hoosier head #1701, cost $687.50.\n\n4. This scheme contains the large Hoosier head #1701, and with the large cylinder, piping, etc., mentioned in the 2nd proposal. Cost $841.50.\n\nI will make a separate report on the sewage disposal plant that will be required, and on the electric lighting plant & fixtures. I enclose cuts of the type of working heads mentioned in the pumping proposals.\n\nAwaiting your instructions on these various matters,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nSir:\n\nUnder cover of my letter of the 5th instant I forwarded a copy of one received from Messrs. Claydon Company Ltd., of Winnipeg, in connection with the water, sewage and lighting system on the new St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve. I have just received another letter from them of a later date referring to the quotations given in their former letter and stating that some change had been made by the firm's local representative and Mr. E. Gardner Smith with the result that the final figures may not coincide with those given in their first letter to me.\n\nThey add that any prices quoted from Cardston by their representative there are authoritative and have the endorsements of the Company. The changes to which they refer are no doubt the figures quoted by Mr. E. Gardner Smith in his report on the sewage disposal system dated the 23rd of August and his report on the Auxiliary Services dated the 28th of August, both of which I have forwarded to you under cover of another letter the 5th instant.\n\nIn regard to the sewage system the Company quoted a figure of $2112.00 in their first letter, while the figures submitted by Mr. E. Gardner Smith were $2100.00.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Companies figures for the water supply with pressure tank and pump were $1723.00. Mr. E. Gardner Smith's were $2023.00 if the pump priced at $451.00 is adopted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. A. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I had Messrs. Claydon Co., Ltd., write to me in connection with the water, sewage, and lighting systems at the new St. Paul's School. The letter speaks for itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nCLAYDON COMPANY, LIMITED\nGeneral Contractors and Builders\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nAugust Twenty Sixth,\nNineteen Twenty Four\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with our conversation this morning, we are pleased to submit the list of quotations given with respect to various items on the work at Cardston, Alta.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Lighting Plant                           | $2400.00 |\n| Sewage System                            | $2112.00 |\n| Water supply, with pressure tanks, pump etc. | $1729.00 |\n\nTotal: $6241.00\n\nIf an elevated tank should be used in place of the pressure tanks quoted above, the cost will be $2755. In addition to the figures quoted for pressure tanks, plus the cost of running water main from the building to the tank. This cost is based on a tank of 20,000 gal. capacity.\n\nOur figure as above was for a complete building round the tank. After submitting it to Mr. Smith it occurred to us that if the tank is placed fairly near the school it might be cheaper to provide winter heat in it by a steam line, rather than by stove. If this were done, the housing from about three or four feet below the tank could be omitted, and in its place put a box covering about two feet square, which would contain the steam, supply and overflow pipes. This and the omission of the eight inch screwed pipe passing through the tank for use as a smoke pipe, would reduce our price by $1102.00.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nAs an offset against this saving, you will need to figure on a steam line from the building to the tank. Our price of course includes the necessary boxing from grade line to tank, but between these points the boxing will need to be added.\n\nIn connection with either system of supply, there will be the necessary connections between it and the water main of the building as provided in our contract. This work and the valves which may be needed to make the connection, are not included in the prices quoted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n(Sgd.) E. Claydon\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable Charles Stewart.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department with reference to the water, sewerage and electric lighting systems required for the new Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nI concur in his recommendations and would ask for your approval.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the following details with reference to the installing of a water system, sewage disposal system and electric lighting plant, required for the new Indian Residential School now being built on the Blood Reserve in Alberta.\n\nWATER SYSTEM.\n\nWith reference to the water system there are three methods to consider with regard to the storing of water, first, by means of steel tower and steel tank; second, by means of a framed wooden tower and wooden tank; third, by pneumatic pressure tanks.\n\nThe amount of water required per day for this building will be approximately 3,600 gallons. This is based on allowing 20 gallons per day for each of the 180 inmates of the building. This is the minimum. In addition water will be required for the stock.\n\nSTEEL WATER TOWER.\n\nWith reference to the steel tower and tank this system would include a sixty foot steel tower with a 20,000 gallons steel tank. This would give a modern highclass plant and provide an abundant supply of water with ample pressure for fire protection and outbuildings. This type of tower would cost complete, $5,700.\n\nWOODEN TOWER AND TANK.\n\nIf this type of water storage was considered it would include a wooden tank with a capacity of 20,000 gallons, sixty feet high, supported on wooden frame construction. This tank is known as the railway type, and is largely used in Western Canada with satisfactory results. This plant would be satisfactory, is not as durable as the steel plant first quoted, but has a saving in first cost. The cost would be approximately $3,469.\n\nPNEUMATIC PRESSURE TANKS.\n\nWhen the pressure tanks are considered we at once abandon the idea of a large reservoir of water for fire protection and with a reserve against breakdown or pumping plant. Two 4 x 18 standard steel pressure tanks installed complete with the usual water and pressure meters would cost $1,572.\n\nThe total working capacity of these tanks would be approximately 2000 gallons, and the pressure would vary from almost nothing to 50 lbs. depending on the amount of water in the tanks. One of the main advantages of the elevated tanks before mentioned is that there would be a constant and even pressure at all times.\n\nTo all of the above prices it will be necessary to add the cost of installing a pumping plant complete. This will cost approximately $641, and will be practically the same for whatever style of water storage is used.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn connection with the sewerage system for the building it will be necessary to build a septic tank. Owing to the slight fall from the building for the installing of a septic tank it is important to provide a scheme of sewage disposal that will give the best purification to the sewage in order to avoid most objectionable nuisance from bad odours. It is therefore proposed to build a tank on the aerobic bed system. This tank is designed along the lines recommended by Mr. Owen, Provincial Sanitary Engineer for Alberta. The cost will be approximately $2,100.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING PLANT.\n\nWith reference to the lighting plant it will be necessary to install a plant consisting of a 5k. 240 volt generator, 10 H.P. gasoline engine with storage batteries, fuel tank, etc. This gasoline engine will also be utilized for the operating of the pumping plant, and the system installed will necessarily have to be a belt driven outfit. The cost of this plant complete will be approximately $2,400.\n\nThe various propositions contained in the above report may be summarized as follows:\n\nWATER STORAGE:\nSteel tower and tank, 30,000 gallon capacity, $6,700.00.\nFrame wooden tower and tank capacity 20,000 gallons, $2,550.00.\nPneumatic pressure tanks working capacity 2000 gallons, $1,672.00.\n\nTo all of the above projects will have to be added the cost of the pumping plant, which will be approximately $841.00.\n\nSEPTIC TANK: Septic tank complete, $2,100.00.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM: complete, $2,400.00.\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned works I beg to recommend that the Clayton Co. be authorized to proceed with the erection of a wooden tower and wooden tank, the installing of a pumping system and the building of a septic tank.\n\nWith reference to the electric lighting plant before this is authorized I would recommend that the Inspector of Construction be authorized to instruct the Clayton Co. to submit a price for the different types of lighting plants of the size required, and that they be instructed to install the plant which will give the best results at the least cost. A full report should be submitted to the Department by the Inspector before the work is authorized.\n\nI may say, with reference to the above mentioned work that there is an item of $4,700 stipulated in the specifications to partly defray the cost of the water and sewerage systems.\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from Gardner Smith, regarding the Power and Lighting Plant at the new St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nP.O. Box 54\nCardston, Alta., Sept. 4th, 1924\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe- POWER & LIGHTING PLANT, ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith three alternative proposals for a power and lighting plant for the school. These proposals have come from Brotherston Electric Co., Ltd., of Calgary, this firm being the electrical contractors, under Clayton Co., in connection with St. Paul's School building contract.\n\nThe department is already familiar with the Lister plants. They have proved highly efficient and dependable and are of sturdy construction. The price is higher than on the plant described in the proposal marked C.\n\nThe 15 H.P. Cushman engine and 7\u00bd K.W. generator is also a very efficient plant, and though not as compact as the direct connected Lister plant, it has the advantage of being of greater capacity and considerably lower in price.\n\nThe demands on the power and lighting plant will be very considerable, especially when outside buildings require lighting. In proposal C, we have the desired margin of power to meet probable future loads.\n\nIn the quotations which are given on the three proposals, the general contractors have not been considered. If it is required that the plant be installed through them the additional 10% would be expected by them.\n\nAwaiting your further valued commands, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nCalgary, August 30th, 1924\n\nMr. E. Gardner Smith,\nBuilding Inspector,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe submit the following proposals for a lighting and power plant for St. Paul's Indian School, near Cardston, Alta.\n\nA. Lister Bruston Full Automatic Plant, 6 K.W. 110 Volt D.C. equipped with 60 A.H. ABC 54 cell Battery, F.O.B. Cardston for the sum of........... $3125.00\n\nAbove plant installed complete by us,........... 3250.00\n\nB. Lister non Automatic Plant, 6 K.W. 110 Volt D.C. equipped with a 210 A.H. ABC 54 cell Battery, F.O.B. Cardston $3400.00\n\nAbove plant installed complete by us,........... 3525.00\n\nC. We propose a 15 H.P. Cushman special electric two cylinder Engine, belted to a 7\u00bd K.W. Canadian General Electric or Westinghouse Generator 110 Volt D.C. We will supply and install the necessary countershafting, belting and switchboard, and provide a 210 A.H. A.B.C. Battery, the same as we installed at Old Suns School.\n\nComplete Plant, as described, installed complete for the sum of........... $2760.00\n\nPlease note that in Proposition C. the engine is 15H.P., which gives quite a margin of power over the 10 H.P. engines that go with the Lister 6 K.W. plants. Also, the generator in Prop. C. is 1\u00bd K.W. larger capacity. With this plant there would be a margin of surplus power for pumping and laundry loads as well as for lighting.\n\nTrusting that one of these proposals may be acceptable.\n\nYours truly\nBrotherston Electric Co.

R.A.Brotherston\nManager.\nSir:-\n\nRe- St. Paul's School: Blood Reserve\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter dated July 29th, that I received from Gardner Smith regarding a hot water storage tank in the kitchen. You will decide whether you think this is necessary or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nP.O. Box 54\nCardston, Alta. July 29th, 1924\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School: Blood Reserve\n\nSir:\n\nIn the plumbing fixtures specified for this building not hot water tank is provided in the kitchen with connections to the cooking range. The only source of hot water supply will be from the large hot water storage tank in the boiler room, and I believe there will often be times when an independent source of hot water supply for the kitchen and scullery would be desirable, especially during the seasons when the steam boilers are not in operation.\n\nIn the heating specifications a jacket heater is provided for summer use, but this heater may not always be in operation full blast just when hot water is wanted in the kitchen, and it would appear to me to be an economy to make use of the kitchen range in heating the water for the kitchen and scullery requirements from the fuel consumption there taking place. It has been the practice in similar buildings to install a hot water cylinder in the kitchen, with connections from the range.\n\nA 50 gal. tank, suitably mounted on a stand, with connections to the range, provided with three taps would cost about $60 complete.\n\nI am merely drawing attention to this matter so that it may receive consideration, and I will be pleased to carry out whatever instructions you may see fit to give regarding same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\nYour obedient servant,\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI would be glad to know if it is the intention of the Department to have rain water tanks built at the St. Paul's Indian School, or if this is to remain over for the time being. Gardner Smith brought this matter to my attention.\n\nIf there are no funds it seems to me this matter could stand till next summer quite well as the rainy season is over now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nRe- St. Paul's Indian School\n\nGardner Smith has written to me with regard to an automatic temperature control for hot water storage tank, which is heated by live steam from the mains. A \"Power's Automatic Temperature Control Valve\", in 1\u00bd\" would cost, installed, $820.00. A safety valve attached to the same tank, as required by the Provincial regulations, would cost $17.00.\n\nWill the Department advise me what they wish to have done in this particular matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

O. Box 84\nCardston, Alta., Sept. 8th, 1924\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe:- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few days ago we had a visit from Rev. Mr. Middleton (Principal) and Miss McGary (Matron) and, after a tour of inspection through the building, they requested me to draw to your attention two or three small matters that have not yet been dealt with, as follows:\n\n1. Heat in Balcony (over corridor to Chapel). See 1st floor plan\n\nThe Matron says that this little room would prove much more serviceable, especially during the winter, if heat is provided. I have discussed the matter with the contractors, and they quote a price of $137.50 to carry steam and return lines from the pipes that pass through the kitchen to the balcony, and provide 66' of radiation, with the necessary valves, traps, etc.\n\n2. The several Principal wishes to know what is being done in the matter of linoleum for the corridors throughout the school (basement not included). I told him that I thought that linoleum would come under the head of furnishings, as has been the case in other schools. He wishes \"Battle-ship\" linoleum, of good quality, and with the brass binding necessary to protect the edges opposite doorways. I promised to mention his request to you, so that the covering for the floors of the corridors would not be overlooked.\n\n3. The Matron wishes curtain rods for many of the windows. I should think this, too, would come under furnishings.\n\n4. The Principal and Matron are desirous that a suitable range be ordered for the kitchen, and indicate that one suitable for the needs of the Institution should be a large one, with two fireboxes and at least two ovens; and should have a large cooking surface, and high warming closet. I might say that I have been giving attention to the range question and intend writing you a special letter on the subject within the next day or two.\n\n5. Another matter which the Principal has mentioned several times is the need of a protection porch to the rear entry of the Principal's residence. This doorway is at the West side, and subject to the full force of the prevailing strong winds. In the plan, the steps lead down directly from the rear door. A little framed porch, say 4'x1', with door to the North, and the wall would be broken by the wind on the main building would be very advantageous in the way of affording the desired protection from wind, and would help very materially in keeping the house warm during severe weather. The Contractors quote a price of $136.00.\nBakery Oven. It will soon be necessary to procure an oven for the bakery. I have data on this subject gathered some time ago, and have written asking for revised prices on suitable bakery ovens, with specifications of same. As soon as this information is received I will write you a special letter on the subject.\n\nThe items in the preceding list on which I would respectfully ask for prompt decisions are items 1 & 5, as the progress of construction requires that these things should be done soon, if at all.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. Gardner Smith\n\nInspector of Construction\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from Mr. Gardner Smith, regarding certain matters in connection with the new St. Paul's School.\n\nI have advised Mr. Smith that the matter of furnishings is in the hands of the Department, and for him not to bother about this.\n\nRegarding the heating of the balcony over the corridor leading to the chapel. You will decide whether you think this is necessary; I do not think it is.\n\nWith reference to the porch to be built over the door of the Principal's residence, one such as he describes to cost $135.00. This is absurd; $25.00 would be nearer the mark. However, this matter should not be dealt with now; we will have a carpenter on the ground next fall, and I am quite satisfied that we can save a lot of money here.\n\nA bakery oven no doubt will have to be supplied.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIt seems to me that the question of furnishings for this school should be taken up almost at once as the season is well advanced and the time for opening the school is not far distant.\n\nThe matter of supplying a range for the school is also one that should receive the immediate attention of the Department. The Department no doubt will know the kind of range which they intend to install in this institution and it seems to me that this is a matter that does not come under Mr. Gardner Smith's jurisdiction. He is employed as a building inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the following details with reference to the installing of a water system, sewage disposal system and electric lighting plant, required for the new Indian Residential School now being built on the Blood Reserve in Alberta.\n\nWATER SYSTEM.\n\nWith reference to the water system there are three methods to consider with regard to the storing of water, first, by means of steel tower and steel tank, second, by means of a framed wooden tower and wooden tank, third, by pneumatic pressure tanks.\n\nThe amount of water required per day for this building will be approximately 3,600 gallons. This is based on allowing 20 gallons per day for each of the 180 inmates of the building. This is the minimum. In addition water will be required for the stock.\n\nSTEEL WATER TOWER.\n\nWith reference to the steel tower and tank this system would include a sixty foot steel tower with a 20,000 gallon steel tank. This would give a modern highclass plant and provide an abundant supply of water with ample pressure for fire protection and outbuildings. This type of tower would cost complete, $5,700.\n\nWOODEN TOWER AND TANK.\n\nIf this type of water storage was considered it would include a wooden tank with a capacity of 20,000 gallons, sixty feet high, supported on wooden frame construction, known as the railway type, and is largely used in Western Canada with satisfactory results. This plant would be satisfactory, is not as durable as the steel plant first quoted, but has a saving in first cost. The cost would be approximately $3,459.\n\nPNEUMATIC PRESSURE TANKS.\n\nWhen the pressure tanks are considered we at once abandon the idea of a large reservoir of water for fire protection and with a reserve against breakdown of pumping plant. Two 4 x 18 standard steel pressure tanks installed complete with the usual water and pressure gauges would cost, $1,572.\n\nThe total working capacity of these tanks would be approximately 2000 gallons, and the pressure would vary from almost nothing to 50 lbs, depending on the amount of water in the tanks. One of the main advantages of the wooden tanks before mentioned is that water level can be constant and even pressure at all times.\n\nTo all of the above prices it will be necessary to add the cost of installing a pumping plant complete. This will cost approximately $841, and will be practically the same for whatever style of water storage is used.\nMEMORANDUM: MR. SCOTT.\n\nSEPTIC TANK.\n\nIn connection with the sewerage system for the building it will be necessary to build a septic tank. Owing to the slight fall from the building for the installing of a septic tank it is important to provide a scheme of sewage disposal that will give the greatest purification to the sewage in order to avoid a most objectionable condition from bad drainage. It is therefore proposed to build a tank on the aerobic bed system. This tank is designed along the lines recommended by Mr. Owens, Provincial Sanitary Engineer for Alberta. The cost will be approximately $2,100.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING PLANT.\n\nWith reference to the lighting plant it will be necessary to install a plant consisting of a six K.W., 110 volt generator, 10 H.P. gasoline engine with storage batteries, fuel tank, etc. This gasoline engine will also be utilized for the operating of the pumping plant, and the system installed will necessarily have to be a belt driven outfit. The cost of this plant complete will be approximately $2,400.\n\nThe various propositions contained in the above report may be summarized as follows:\n\nWATER STORAGE:\nSteel tower and tank, 20,000 gallon capacity, $5,700.00.\nFrame wooden tower and tank capacity 20,000 gallons, $2,468.00.\nPneumatic pressure tanks working capacity 2000 gallons, $1,572.00.\n\nTo all of the above projects will have to be added the cost of the pumping plant, which will be approximately $841.00.\n\nSEPTIC TANK: Septic tank complete, $2,100.00.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM, complete, $2,400.00.\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned works I beg to recommend that the Claydon Co. be authorized to proceed with the erection of a wooden tower and wooden tank, the installing of a pumping system and the building of a septic tank.\n\nWith reference to the electric lighting plant before this is authorized I would recommend that the Inspector of Construction be authorized to instruct the Claydon Co. to submit a price for the different types of lighting plants of the size required, and that they be instructed to install the plant which will give the best results at the least cost. A full report should be submitted to the Department by the Inspector before the work is authorized.\n\nI may say with reference to the above mentioned work that there is an item of $4,700, stipulated in the specifications to partly defray the cost of the water and sewerage systems.\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department with reference to the water, sewerage and electric lighting systems required for the new Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nI concur in his recommendations and would ask for your approval.\n\nConcord\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to confirm telegram sent to you today as follows, regarding the installation of septic tank for the Blood School:\n\n\"Department accepts Claydon Co.'s price for septic tank for School. Authorize them to proceed with work at once, in accordance with plans submitted by Inspector.\"\n\nWith reference to the electric lighting plant I would ask you to please instruct Mr. Gardner Smith to obtain from the Claydon Co. a written price for the different manufacturers' plants of the size required for the Blood School. I would particularly ask you to mention to him, for the Claydon Co., to obtain a price from the Bruce Robinson Distributors Ltd., of Calgary. As soon as this information is received immediate consideration will be given to the installation of this plant.\n\nWith reference to the water supply system for the building this matter is under consideration and instructions will be sent to you in the near future.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the work at the St. Paul's School, I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it is not necessary to heat the balcony over the corridor leading to the chapel, also that the building of a porch over the door of the principal's residence can be left over for the present.\n\nThe question of furnishings is now under consideration and will include the necessary bake oven and kitchen equipment. With reference to your letter of the 9th instant I would say that I do not think it necessary to install a hot water tank in the kitchen. The hot water storage tank provided for in the boiler room should supply all of the hot water required for the building.\n\nWith reference to the installing of rain water tanks I think that this matter can be left until next year, as recommended by you.\n\nWith regard to the installing of a safety valve on the hot water storage tank, I beg to say that this is provided for in the specifications for the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I have to inform you that this equipment has not been allowed in the past and there are no funds available at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, Alberta.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst. with reference to the Sloan valves originally specified for this school.\n\nYour instructions to change from the Sloan valves to the low down tanks were received by me about three months ago, and were promptly communicated by me to the plumbing sub-contractor, and to Mr. Mitchell, the local representative of Claydon Company. Since then there has been no thought of using Sloan valves, nor had any such valves been ordered to be shipped.\n\nThe explanation of the anomaly would seem to be that Mr. Mitchell had not thought it worth his while, or else had simply overlooked, telling the Winnipeg office of the change. When Mr. Graham called on the contractors in Winnipeg it is evident that he was, inadvertently, given wrong information on the subject.\n\nYour letter instructing me to make the change from valves to tanks came prior to a later letter from the Deputy Superintendent General in which I was instructed to refer all matters pertaining to the new building to Mr. Graham. Had the incident occurred since receiving the Deputy's letter, Mr. Graham would have been informed of the change as a matter of course.\n\nHoping that the foregoing explanations may clear the matter up,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the advisability of providing covering for the breeching in connection with the boilers at the Blood School, I beg to say that the Department approves of proposal no. 1 as outlined in your letter and you may authorize the contractors to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Oct.7th, 1924.\n\nR.Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St.Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr.Orr,-\n\nI have heard from the contractors that the 60' framed tower, and the 20,000 gallon wooden tank, have been authorized for the water system for this school. No doubt this will soon be confirmed in a letter of instructions to me.\n\nThe contractors have figured their tender on the basis of the tank being located close to the rear portion of the school, but I have been wondering if you would like to have it placed there. The tank, when full, will weigh about 100 tons, and I wondered if you might consider such a weight, placed on a 60' tower, as constituting a menace to the safety of the building. If in the course of time the foundations should settle unevenly, or the structure itself become unsound, there is just the suggestion of danger, is there not? Were the tower and tank placed say 20' from the building the hypothetical threat to the building would be removed. This district is subject to terrific winds, and this factor, also, must not be ignored.\n\nPlease do not misinterpret my remarks to mean that we are going to duplicate the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or neglect our foundations. I merely have a feeling that I would like your approval to this structure being placed so close to the school before I allow the contractors to put it there.\n\nShould you decide that the tower and tank are to be erected not nearer than 90' from the building, the contractors would expect to be paid for the additional cost of carrying the water and steam lines, with protected covering, the added distance, which would amount to about $125 extra.\n\nWill you kindly wire me your instructions in the matter?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Oct. 13, 1923.\n\nE.

I can furnish the \"ShinnFlat\" as used at Ottawa on the Parliament Building.\n\nI am Yours Truly,\n\nH.M. Jackson\n\"Tinner & Plumber\"\n\"Br\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nDuring the work of the electric wiring of this building, the Reverend Principal earnestly requested that some additional outlets be provided. While admitting that his requests were eminently reasonable, and would add to the efficiency of the institution, I told him I was short of all discretionary power regarding additional expenditure, and that I was unable to give a single order that would add a dollar to the cost of the building.\n\nMr. Graham (to whom I had been instructed to refer all such matters) was then absent from Regina on a tour, and as immediate action was necessary before the rough wiring was covered by the metal lath, Mr. Middleton undertook to be personally responsible for the payment of these electrical extras. This means that if the Department does not pay the electrical contractor, Mr. Middleton will do so out of his own pocket. On this clearly understood basis the additional wiring has been done.\n\nI am enclosing herewith full details of each item of lighting extras, and I will briefly explain them in the order in which I have numbered them:\n\n1. Extra circuits were run to the unfinished central attic dormitory, so that when the time comes that this room will be needed, provision will have been made for providing the light outlets and switches. This is a wise provision, and an ultimate economy.\n\n2. This charge is for a wall plug in baseboard so that a desk lamp may be used.\n\n3. This charge is for placing switches in the staff rooms adjoining the attic dormitories, instead of in the dormitories themselves, as was called for on the floor below.\n\n4. This charge is for providing facilities so that a moving picture machine may be used for purposes of education and entertainment in the assembly class room where the folding doors are.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nR. Guerney, Esq., H.M.\n\n5. The extra plugs in the chapel were asked for by the Reverend Principal.\n\n6. This charge was for placing a light outlet in ceiling of Principal's verandah, and a control switch for same.\n\n7. These extra plugs were for the following rooms: kitchen, library, drawing room, dining room, and two upstairs bedrooms. These additional outlets were for desk or table lamps, wall lights in bedrooms, and for kitchen conveniences.\n\n8. This item covers call and return bells between the Principal's office and his residence; call and return bells between the two offices; and call and return bells between the Nurse's room and the Principal's residence. Mr. Middleton says this arrangement of bells will save innumerable steps, and effect a great economy in time.\n\nThe total cost of these extras is $124.89, apart from the usual 10% for the general contractor.\n\nI feel that I should submit this account to the Department, and receive your ruling as to whether these items are in order as a regular charge to be added to the contractors' certificate, or whether the Reverend Principal must foot the bill himself.\n\nAssuming your instructions in the matter,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardiner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\n\nThis matter has not been referred to Regina.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nOctober Twentieth\nNineteen-Twenty-four.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nLast Friday evening, the 17th inst., thinking there was a current certificate before the Department in Ottawa, I wired asking you to kindly arrange that payment be forwarded to us in time to be received here today, the 20th inst.\n\nOn arriving here this morning, I find that what I thought was the current certificate, had not been forwarded being only received here from Gatineau this morning. It is enclosed herewith and we will be pleased if you will kindly arrange that proceeds be forwarded to us with the usual promptitude. The occasion for our request was that tomorrow we are putting up a deposit cheque on the Canadian National Subway at Edmonton.\n\nBlueprints are enclosed showing construction of water tower, method of bracing and joining posts. The anchors for the posts are not shown, but for your information kindly note that we are putting in a pair of anchors to each footing, being eight pairs in all. A list of the ironwork in the tower is enclosed.\n\nYou will notice the tub shown is of smaller diameter on the top than bottom. This happens to be C.P.R. Standard. When trying to buy same in Vancouver, I found the standard 20,000 gallon tank to be 18 x 14 with parallel sides, the material is three inch lumber throughout and held together with thirteen 5/8\" and one 3/4\" round bands.\n\nWill be glad to have your comment on the design at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE.

The sheet metal contractor has practically completed his work, and intends returning to Winnipeg almost at once. In his department are two instances in which I would like decisions before he leaves.\n\nI would have referred these matters to Mr. Graham, as instructed to do, but, according to the papers, he is at present absent from Regina, and is reported as being at Edmonton in connection with the formal opening of the new Indian School there. I have, therefore, deemed it advisable to send you a night letter dealing with the two items of sheet metal work, so as to have an official decision prior to the metal contractor leaving, and I have wired you as follows:\n\nLOUVRE IN SPIRE ADMITS RAIN & SNOW IN DRIVING STORMS.\nCONTRACTORS RECOMMEND LINING INSIDE LOUVRE WITH GALVANIZED IRON WITH BOTTOM TURNED OUT TO DISCHARGE ON ROOF COSTING FIFTY TWO DOLLARS. STOP. SHOULD BASEMENT LAVATORY VENTS BE EXTENDED TO VENT TOILET AREAS INSTEAD OF BATHS COSTING FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS.\n\nE. Gardner-Smith.\n\nI think the items mentioned in the telegram are self explanatory. Regarding the louvres, although there is a splendid slope to the shutters, yet the driving storms get through, causing a heavy dripping of water. At the Edmonton school the contractors boarded the louvre up solid, yet the driving rain, following the boarding down, came through on the ceilings, and something more will have to be done there. By using sheet metal all the way down the louvre, and with the lower edge turned out on the slope of the bottom shutter, like on a window sill, leakage should be effectually prevented. In addition to lining the louvres with sheet metal, as described, it is intended to carry down angle strips of gal. iron on the exterior angles.\nbetween the louvres, so as to make an absolutely watertight job where otherwise a slight shrinkage of the posts might leave slight vertical openings.\n\nRegarding the vents in basement toilets, the plan shows these leading to the bathrooms. Would it not be better to extend them to the rooms containing the toilets?\n\nAs stated in the telegram the estimated cost of the louvre protection is $52.00; and the extension to the basement vents is quoted at $47.00, both of which estimates include the contractors' 10%.\n\nThe work of the general contract is well advanced, and it is expected that steam heat will be available within ten days. The sewage disposal plant is now being installed.\n\nAre the bakery oven and kitchen range likely to arrive soon? I would like to get them set up, and see that they are in proper working order.\n\nThe weather continues fine and mild, following the rain and snowstorm of three weeks ago.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.Gardner-Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nWinnipeg, Oct 28th 24.\n\nDuncan C.

Some months ago the Department authorized Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham to erect barns at this school, and upon receipt of your message, I got into telegraphic communication with him. Mr. Graham reports that he has made arrangements to build a stable at St. Paul's School by day labour, that the material has been ordered and that the work will begin next week and will be completed in good time.

While not wishing to intrude myself in matters that I may not be expected to concern myself with, yet I might, without impropriety, mention that I would be pleased to assist in the procuring of these articles if the Department so wishes.\n\nThe foundations for the water tower are being put in today in accordance with the plan submitted by Claydon Co., and, presumably, checked and approved by the Department's Architect.

Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nOn the ground and first floors of the school are seven bedrooms, a parlour staff room, the matron's office, the boy's study, and the store room off the 1st floor passage (on the way to the rear balcony) which have doors with the top part glass. The glass measures 23\"x 33\". The glass for these doors have not yet been put in. The purpose of the glass is to admit borrowed light to the corridors. I wonder if it was your intention to have these doors glazed with muranese glass in order to prevent any visibility into these rooms from the corridors? I have asked the contractor to defer glazing these doors until I learn your wish in the matter.\n\nThe contractor states that it would cost $15 extra to put in figured glass as compared with the cost of plain glass.\n\nThe steel partitions provided for the lavatories and basement bathrooms have been erected, in accordance with the amended specifications. The large steel screen shown on the plan, and passing in front of the toilets, was cut out in the changes. In earlier correspondence you indicated that it was your intention to provide wooden screens to take their place. These could be made either in solid V.Joint 6' high, or in lattice work such as is often used in toilet room doors. My understanding was that this very necessary adjunct to the toilets would be provided at the time the lockers, tables, etc., are constructed, and, as I have already written to you regarding the auxiliary interior work required, I would ask that you kindly instruct me regarding the toilet screens too.\n\nIn the boiler room space was provided for ashes in a 4'x 4' concrete space located alongside the main chimney, as shown on the plan. No outside cover has yet been authorized for this ash chute. Should there not be sloping double doors provided?\n\nNo provision has yet been made for an ash hoist for elevating the ashes. During the heating season there will be a\nlarge quantity of ashes to remove, and, I presume, it is the Department's intention to provide a mechanical ash lift. The one installed at the Edmonton school cost, if I remember aright, about $400.00, and seemed very satisfactory. Remembering the Department's wish to keep down cost on this building, I have been looking about to see what I could find that would meet the needs without too much outlay, and I succeeded in locating a very suitable rig that was installed at the Municipal Hospital at Cardston a few years ago, and it has never been used. The Hospital is a small building, heated with a hot air furnace, and as the quantity of ashes is small, and only a few steps to carry them outside, the janitor has never felt the need of the ash hoist provided by the architect for the building.\n\nI examined the ash hoist in question; it is called the \"G & G Telescopic Hoist\", made by Gillis & Geoghegan, of Sherbrooke, Quebec, and has a guaranteed capacity of 500#. It is exactly what is needed at the school here. The Hospital Board, in response to my inquiry, stated that they would sell it for $75.00, including two very heavy iron ash buckets. Its cost was $278.00, plus transportation and installing. If so instructed, I will procure this very suitable hoist and iron ash buckets, and have it installed by the contractors. Mr. Snyder, the heating subcontractor, states that there is nothing better on the market for our purpose, and that the price asked is about 25% of its value.\n\nAbout a week ago Mr. Inspector Christianson, of the Regina office, and Mr. George, a carpenter sent by Commissioner Graham, arrived at Cardston to start barn building. I understand they propose building a horse and cattle barn here (two separate buildings) and a horse barn on the R.C. school site near the new Agency. Apparently they are acting under instructions from Regina rather than from Ottawa. I have not been shown the plans, or consulted in any way, so I assume that it is not the Department's wish that I should exercise any supervision over the construction, or concern myself with this work in any way. The weather is now very unfavourable, with snow and below zero temperatures, and it will be difficult to perform the work as satisfactorily, or as economically, as though it had been started two months ago.\n\nThe contractors are endeavouring to keep frost out of the building by burning wood cuttings until a car of coal arrives which, it is hoped, will be tomorrow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nCentral Secretary\nRev.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have this day visited the new St. Paul's School building which is being erected at the South end of this Reserve for our Society, and have much pleasure in informing you that the general plan of the building itself, and the care which has been maintained in the carrying out of that plan, stands in my opinion, much to the credit of those who have been associated with this work in these respects. The work of the contractors at the time of my visit was rapidly nearing completion and, so far as I could ascertain, after a careful examination of the whole building, they will have the satisfaction of feeling that their work was well done. A similar statement may also be made with regard to the duties discharged by your Inspector of Construction.\n\nAlthough the main school building was rapidly nearing completion, and presented an appearance which I felt must be both pleasing and creditable to those responsible for its erection, there were a few matters of importance on which I solicited information from those on the spot at the time of my visit and as this was not forthcoming, I have conceived it to be my duty to bring the same to your attention. These are as follows:\n\n1. Storm Windows. As no storm windows had been provided, and apparently no arrangement made for their provision, I fear that they may have been overlooked. Nor do I consider that any lengthy explanation is required on my part to convince you of their necessity.\n\n2. Night Toilets for the Attic Dormitories. As no night toilets were provided for the dormitories in the attic, even though such are certain to be required as soon as the School is opened, I was puzzled to know why they had not been installed as in the other\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 637L, file 764-5, part 2)\nD. Van C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\n\ndormitories, and especially so, when the \"roughing in\" had been done.\n\n3. Lockers in Dormitories and Recreation Rooms. As lockers are unquestionably a necessity in each of the six dormitories and in each of the two recreation rooms, and no arrangement had apparently been made for their provision, I was apprehensive that this necessity might have been overlooked also. As these will take some time to make, and their non-provision delay the opening of the School, immediate action in this respect is important.\n\n4. Ash Hoist. An ash hoist has not been provided and requires no comment to explain the great convenience it would be. I learned during my visit that a new telescopic ash hoist purchased for the Cardston Municipal Hospital at a cost of $400, but never used as it was too large for the shaft, might be purchased for much less\u2014possibly half of the original cost\u2014and as it would suit the School's purpose, would recommend that it be secured and installed.\n\n5. Porch over rear Entrance of Principal's Residence. As the prevailing winds are from the West, and at the time of my visit had piled a deep quantity of snow over the steps and against the rear entrance of the Principal's residence on the West side the erection of a porch, with steps leading from the platform down by the side of the wall instead of at right angles to it, would add greatly to the comfort of this part of the building.\n\n6. Porch over the outside Entrance to the Chapel. A porch over the outside entrance to the chapel would also add comfort to this part of the building.\n\n7. Soft Water Tank. As the water in School wells contains a considerable amount of soda, and soft water will be required from time to time for filling the boilers, washing etc., the conservation of soft water is necessary for these and other purposes, and a soft water tank should be provided.\n\n8. Poultry House. As no poultry house has been provided and one will be required as soon as the School is opened, I learned from the contractor that he would sell fifty feet of his cook house for $100, and as this could be used for a poultry house until Spring, I beg to recommend that that length of this building be purchased for this purpose.\n\n9. Stock Barn. During my visit to the new School building I met a contractor from Regina named Mr. George, who informed me that he had been awarded the contract for building two stables, namely, one for horses and one for cows. Upon request he kindly showed me the plans which had been given him for these buildings, and I feel it my duty to inform you that they furnished me with a rather uncomfortable surprise. The plans themselves were not the usual blue prints I had expected to see but pencil drawings, without scale, showing in rough outline the ground plan of each building and the\ncross section of an end. As one large stock barn with a silo attached, similar to the one built at the Old Sun School, would have met the needs of the new St. Paul's School better than the two smaller buildings about to be erected, I cannot but express to you my very keen regret that some reference was not made to me, or to some other representative of our Society, before the plans were finally adopted and the contract awarded. The almost invariable method of procedure adopted by your Department in the past, whereby copies of plans and specifications of important buildings about to be erected for our Society were submitted to one or more of its representatives for suggestions before the work of construction was actually begun, possessed so many decided advantages that I am quite at a loss to understand the reason why, in this particular instance, it has not been followed, and I can only hope in the highest and best interests of the cooperative system of administration which our Society and your Department have so successfully pursued during the past few years that the usual method of procedure may be fully restored and maintained.\n\nAs the contract for the erection of the stables has already been awarded to the above-mentioned contractor, and the materials already ordered by him, it is now, I fear, too late to ask for a reconsideration of this important matter, but I am strongly of the opinion that the stables for the cows should have a silo, owing to the large quantity of milk which will be required to meet the needs of the School, and that the stable for the horses should be enlarged so as to provide what is termed a \"maternity ward\" for a brood mare, and an additional double or box stall.\n\nIf you will kindly give the above matters your early and sympathetic consideration, and issue instructions accordingly, you will do much to relieve our Society of the anxiety which is now felt in connexion therewith, and help to bring the whole plant up to that state of efficiency and completion which is necessary before it can be considered ready for occupation.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\nNov. 19, 1924.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant and am pleased to hear that you have found the work at the new Blood School satisfactory, and I would answer your several inquiries in the order in which you placed them in your letter.\n\nStorm Windows:\nIt was found necessary to reduce the cost of the building and this is one of the items that was omitted in order to keep down the cost. If it is found necessary we will make arrangements to have them installed.\n\nNight toilets:\nWith reference to the night toilets in the attic dormitories the roughing in is all provided, and we will make arrangements next year for the installation of fixtures.\n\nLockers in Dormitories and Recreation Rooms:\nCommissioner Graham has been authorized to have the lockers and all cupboards required in the building erected.\n\nAsh Hoists:\nThis has been authorized.\n\nPorch over rear entrance of Principal's residence, etc.\nWith reference to the porch over rear entrance to Principal's residence, porch over the outside entrance to chapel, and soft water tank, I will take these matters into consideration and see if funds can be found to have them carried out.\n\nStock Barn and Poultry House:\nWith reference to the stock barns I entrusted this work to Commissioner Graham, and I will direct him to arrange for the providing of a poultry house.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.B.F. Westgate, DD.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nNov. 19, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have received a letter from Rev. Dr. Postgate with reference to the new St. Paul's School, and he has brought to my attention a few items which he would like to have attended to, and which are as follows:\n\n\"Porch over rear entrance to Principal's residence. As the prevailing winds are from the west, and at the time of my visit had piled a deep quantity of snow over the steps and against the rear entrance of the Principal's residence on the west side, the erection of a porch with steps leading from the platform down by the side of the wall instead of at right angles to it, would greatly add to the comfort of this part of the building.\"\n\n\"Soft water tank. As the water in the school wells contains a considerable amount of soda, and soft water will be required from time to time for filling the boilers, washing, etc., the conservation of soft water is necessary for these and other purposes, and a soft water tank should be provided.\"\n\n\"Poultry House. As no poultry house has been provided and one will be required as soon as the school is opened, I learned from the contractor that he would sell fifty feet of his stock house for \u00a3100, and as this could be used for a poultry house until spring, I beg to recommend that that length of this building be purchased for this purpose.\"\n\nWith reference to these items I would ask you to please investigate and if you think they are necessary and can be economically carried out you may arrange to have the necessary work done.\n\nWhen we were endeavouring to reduce the cost of the building last spring, the storm sash specified were omitted, and it was proposed to see if the building could be suitably heated without them. As I understand that they have had considerable bad weather recently, I would ask you to please investigate and advise me if you think the storm sash should be provided and if so what the cost of same would be.\n\nAs the new school is rapidly nearing completion, and there will probably be a period between the time the contractors are finished with their contract and the Principal and his staff enter into occupation, I would ask you to make arrangements for the proper heating of the building and care of the mechanical plant during this interval. It will also be necessary to arrange for supplying fuel during this period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nWith regard to the occupation of the building, I doubt very much if the Principal and staff will be in before the first of January. I presume the Department have arranged for all furnishings to be there before that time, including the range for the kitchen. I have placed orders for articles concerning which you have given instructions including bathroom fixtures and a certain amount of table equipment.\n\nWith regard to the heating of this school during the interval of completing the work and the occupation by the school staff, I should say that there ought not to be an interval. However, I am taking the responsibility of having instructed that two cars of steam coal be ordered, and that the Principal put his engineer on the heating job before the contractor leaves.\n\nDr. Christiansen did not see the man that Mr. Middleton had selected, as he was not in the district at the time of the Inspector's visit. However, the Inspector made enquiries at Cordaton and other places, and received a good account of him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Craney,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. November 29, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant informing me that you had received a letter from the Reverend Doctor Westgate, with reference to the new St. Paul's School, drawing your attention to a few items which he would like to have attended to.\n\nThe first matter touched upon is the porch for the Principal's residence. Inspector Christensen was on the reserve and took this matter up while there. He is of the opinion that a storm door is all that is required. I will have this put on. As for the steps, they should remain as first provided - at right angles.\n\nIn regard to the soft water tank, this matter must remain until Spring.\n\nIn reference to a poultry house the contractors have offered to sell 50 feet of their barn house which can be used as a poultry house and pig pen until Spring. As there is at least $150.00 worth of lumber in the building, the material can be used when erecting permanent buildings.\n\nAs for the storm sash I would not like to take the responsibility of saying they would be needed all over the building, especially in view of the fact that there are steam pipes under each window and this might cause trouble. I would suggest that we put storm sash on the west end of the building this year, as the prevailing winds are from the west, and the windows would cost approximately $2.75 to $3.00 each.\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sect. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nPROGRESS REPORT; ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL, CARDSTON.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my last monthly report I indicated that the general contract was likely to be completed during the month of November, but there still remains some interior work yet to be done before the building is completed. The contractors have been largely occupied in the work of the outside services which were additional to the main contract, and, for that reason, the completion of the inside work has been delayed.\n\nThe weather during November has been generally broken. There have been two snow storms, and a number of very windy days. The snow drifted badly, and, for several days, the roads were almost impassable. We also experienced very low temperatures for so early in the winter, reaching a minimum temperature of 17 degrees below zero on the 11th inst. During the latter half of the month the weather has been mild again, but frequent high winds have been a source of annoyance and delay to the contractors, especially as they have been engaged in erecting the 60' framed water tower and 20,000 gal. tank, with housing. It so happened that the last two Sundays were free from wind, and the contractors and their crew have worked on Sundays too.\n\nThe sewage disposal system has been satisfactorily completed, with the exception of putting more earth covering over the sewer line where it crosses a depression, and protecting the outlet.\n\nAll the cement floors in the basement have been laid, with the exception of that for the machinery room, and it will be done within the next few days. The concrete hardener has been used, as specified, and the surface of the floors so treated is quite satisfactory, and should wear well, and be practically dust-proof.\n\nThe flat roof drainage, and the waste from the laundry and kitchen sink, have been conducted through a separate drain, and joins the main sewer beyond the septic tank. I would like to have carried the laundry and chapel roof water to a soft water tank in the laundry, so that there would have been a supply of soda-free water not only for laundry purposes but for the cooling system of the power plant, but this was not authorized.\n\nThe heating plant is now in operation. The two #12 Firebox Tubular Boilers seem very satisfactory in operation and efficiency and, excepting during penetrating winds, are easily able to heat the entire building. The boiler covering has been done, as specified, and the boiler breechings have been covered in accordance with the Architect's directions. I am expecting a visit from Dunham's engineer, who will check up the system to see that the Dunham specialties are all correctly installed. The Provincial Boiler Inspector will also make an inspection soon, and I will procure from that official the usual certificate of inspection, as required.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nThe laundry boiler, jacket heater and hot water storage tank have also been installed in the boiler room.\n\nThe plumbing fixtures throughout the building are now set up in place, with the exception of the galvanized iron sinks (which are being made to order) and bath and kitchen sink for residence which arrived damaged, and are being replaced. I have not yet been able to test the water lines against leakage for the reason that we have not yet got our water in the building, but I will do so later.\n\nThe laundry machinery arrived from Toronto recently, and have been set up in the laundry room. These will be driven from a countershaft which passes through the brick wall from the machinery room. The countershaft will be driven by direct belt drive from a pulley attached to the main shaft of the engine. The laundry machines consist of a large washer with inside partition, an extractor and a drying tumbler, and they all seem good serviceable machines. We will test out the running of these machines as soon as the power is available. We are also installing a suction fan with discharge through a vent in the laundry roof.\n\nWe received the Lister engine, generator, batteries, etc., from the Crowfoot School, Cluny, and this plant is now being set up. It arrived in good condition, and will fit nicely in the enlarged machinery room. I expect that by the end of this week electric light will be available. The electrical sub-contractor is carrying out this work. The large powerful pumping plant authorized by the Department has arrived, and will probably be set up within the next few days. We will make a thorough test of all these services before turning them over to the local help.\n\nThe lighting fixtures are now being hung. We are following the list authorized by the Department, and are aiming at keeping within the prices mentioned in the list.\n\nThere still remains a little carpentry work to do inside the building, which will be quickly completed as soon as carpenters finish the outside work. I have not received any instructions regarding such work as building in the lockers, making the tables and benches for the dining rooms, and such work. The contractors have frequently asked if they are to do these things, and, if authorized, could be done at times when the weather interferes with outside work.\n\nThe painting work is not yet completed, and will occupy another week or ten days. Some of the exterior painting of trim was damaged by a dust storm, and is being scraped and re-painted, much to the disgust of the painting sub-contractor, who complains that I am making him responsible for \"an act of God\".\n\nThe erection of the water tower and 20,000-gallon tank has been been the absorbing work during the past fortnight. This work has been interfered with a good deal by adverse weather conditions,- first by snow storms, then by drifting snow which buried the materials under several feet of snow, and latterly by high winds. Fortunately this critical work has been carried by accident, and is now nearing completion. The tower is completed, and the tank house should be finished within the next few days, after which the tank, which came \"knocked down\" from Calgary, will be put together. The water main and wet steam line have been laid in a trench 6' deep, and carried 90' to the tower, and the back-filling of this trench has just been done. The steam line will be an aerial one, carried on poles from the heating plant, and will be suitably covered. This line will be about 10' above grade. The risers to the elevated tank will be suitably covered, and boxed in. This work will all be done in a manner to insure immunity from frost trouble in the winter months.\nThere has been some disfigurement of plaster in a number of rooms caused by leakage from the gutters previous to the soldering of the joints, as mentioned in my last report. The contractors will be required to restore this damage before the building is accepted.\n\nOn the night of the 15th inst. we experienced a wind of almost cyclonic intensity, and it was found next morning that the brick gable over the Principal's entrance suffered the loosening of the brickwork. This gable seemed to receive the force of the wind deflected by the main building. The construction of this gable was fairly good, but not very strong, and is only a small gable. We have rebuilt this gable in solid brick and have put in a number of iron rods carried back and secured to the rafters, in addition to the ordinary brick ties, so it should be proof against a recurrence of such trouble. I am very glad it happened while the contractors were still here. The main gables suffered no damage from the gale, nor has there been any other damage of any kind.\n\nI am hoping that the kitchen range and bakery oven will arrive while the contractors are here, for openings will have to be made in the bakery chimney. We have a few glazed tile left, which we will use in making good where the range smoke pipe will enter the chimney.\n\nThe erection of the horse barn and dairy barn is now being carried out by the foreman sent from Regina, and local men he has picked up. Through the courtesy of the Claydon Company, he has been able to use Claydon's facilities. As I received no instructions in the matter I assumed that it was not the Department's intention that I exercise any supervision over the barn work, or concern myself with it in any way.\n\nFrom present indications I think the contractors will be through by about the middle of December. The Reverend Principal has engaged an engineer, who is coming to the school tomorrow, and will have the advantage of becoming acquainted with the mechanical plant under the supervision of the contractors. The engineer appears to be experienced and intelligent. The contractors will have a chance to satisfy themselves as to his competency before turning the plant over to his charge.\n\nWill you please instruct me regarding accepting the building from the contractors on completion. I am holding the fire insurance policies, aggregating $90,000.00, and no doubt the Claydon Co. will be desirous for having the building accepted promptly on the satisfactory completion of their contract and subsidiary work, so that they may receive a refund of the unexpired insurance.\n\nAwaiting your further valued instructions,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner-Smith\n\nInspector of Construction.\nP.O. Box 54,\nCardston, Alta. Dec. 1st, 1924.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe-St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nTo-day we had a visit from the Reverend Principal and Mrs. Middleton. They are anxious to have the intended cupboard built in the Principal's kitchen previous to their moving in. I told him that I had not yet received any definite authority to have this work done.\n\nCanon Middleton stated that the Indian Commissioner was leaving Regina for Ottawa to-day. As the contractors will soon be completing their authorized work, and leaving the job, it was thought advisable to write to the Department direct, to ask if it is the intention to have the cupboard asked for built by the contractors before they leave. If such is the intention I would ask that you kindly wire me to that effect, in order to save time.\n\nYou will remember that, in order to provide for the folding doors in the boys' class rooms, we had to move the door leading into the Principal's residence a little to one side. This change made a jog in the wall of the kitchen, leaving a recess of 5'-6\"x 22\", between where the jog came and the kitchen chimney, and it is in this space that the cupboard would go.\n\nThe type of cupboard most suitable would consist of a two-door cupboard and tilting bin below, table top with drawers under, and shelves above, with glass doors. This would cost, complete, in the neighbourhood of $65.00.\n\nI promised to convey the Principal's request to the Department, and would await instructions before doing anything in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner-Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Dec. 5, 1924.\n\nE.

Box 54,\nCardston, Alta. Dec. 21st, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nRe- St. Paul's School: Blood Reserve.\n\nIn earlier reports I mentioned that I was afraid there would not be a good draught from the kitchen and bakery chimney. These flues are about 8\"x 8\" each in area. In the amendments to the specifications the height of this chimney was reduced by 17' in height. It is now much below the height of the main building adjacent to it.\n\nRecently a stove was set up in the Bakery for temporary purposes, and it was found that the draught was so bad that at times the smoke came the other way,- that is instead of going up the chimney, it blew back into the room, and drove the occupants out. This condition is not a freak occurrence, but will be the case very frequently. The same conditions apply to the kitchen flue. It will be extremely difficult- if not impossible- to bake bread, or perform the cooking with the kitchen range.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that an iron pipe extension be built on this chimney, about 16\" in diameter, and about 20' in height. This could be anchored to the chapel roof, main building roof and to a post to be set in the ground to one side of the coal bin. This arrangement would brace the metal chimney safely.\n\nI am leaving for Calgary tomorrow to spend Christmas with my family, and will return here for a few days afterwards, and I would ask the Department to please wire me regarding the extension to the chimney. I have not yet been able to get out an estimate of the cost of this work, but, if entrusted to me, I will have it done as economically as possible by the local sheet metal contractor, under my direction, at cost plus 10%.\n\nI do not think the new range and bakery oven will arrive before the end of the year, and, if so instructed, I would endeavour to have this chimney ready by the time these fixtures are set up. Please wire me at Cardston by the 27th, if possible, and I will be guided by your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Gardner Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith and recommend for payment Regina voucher No. 2771 in favour of Alberta Dairy Supplies, Limited, of Edmonton, Alberta, for $145.90, representing the purchase of cow stalls and ventilators for the new barn at the Anglican Residential School, Blood Agency, and undertaken under Department authority dated May 12th, 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nCardston, Alta. Dec. 28th, 1924\n\nRe- St. Paul's School; Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the final certificate (No. 12) which I issued today to Claydon Company, Limited, the general contractors for the above-mentioned work, in full payment of their contract, including extras, and excess over the lump sum allowance for outside services, it will be noticed that I mentioned on the face of the certificate that details of extras allowed would be found on a separate sheet. I now enclose said sheet, showing that extras of $5,964.76, and excess over the allowance of $5,000.00 amounting to $3957.05, have been added to the certificate, bringing the complete total of contract and extras to $133,153.00. These figures will be better understood by reference to the statement enclosed.\n\nBefore issuing the final certificate I received from the contractors the signed guarantee of all materials and workmanship against defects for a period of 12 months, as called for in the specifications.\n\nI have today accepted the building from Claydon Co., and have returned to them their fire insurance policies. I wired the Department today of the completion and acceptance of the building; and I have also notified the Indian Agent, Mr. Faunt, and the Rev. Principal, Canon Middleton. The building is now in the charge of a competent caretaker and engineer, who had the advantage of being thoroughly instructed by the contractors in the care of the heating plant and mechanical services, and I believe everything of that kind will be well looked after. The contractors, and all their men, have left for their respective homes.\n\nCanon Middleton informed me that it will be impossible for the staff and pupils to move into the new building until the various furnishings and equipment arrive. Some articles are now at the Cardston station, but the bulk of the equipment and supplies have not yet arrived. The Principal hopes the moving in may be accomplished during the month of January.\n\nThe weather during December could scarcely have been worse, and gave considerable trouble to the contractors in connection with the work of building the tower and elevated water tank. Intense cold (45 below) with piercing winds, caused the freezing and bursting of pipes, and a lot of tearing down, and subsequent making good after, a considerable cost. By keeping the heating boilers going full blast day and night, it was possible to keep the building comfortably warm in most of the rooms, but in those rooms exposed to the wind there was some freezing trouble, owing principally\u2014if not entirely\u2014to the absence of storm windows.\n\nI will write a separate report reviewing the recent work accomplished, but I will now devote myself to explanations of the various items which are additional to the contract, of which I am segregating under Schedules A & B. The items coming under A are those sundry items classed as ordinary extras; while the remaining items, classed under B, are those included under a lump sum allowance made in the contract, of $5000.00, and it is the excess over this sum that is being credited to the contractors. The explanations follow on separate sheets.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jan. 7th, 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nFinal Report on Construction; St. Paul's School.\n\nSir,\n\nOn December 22nd I notified the Department by telegram that the contractors were then turning over to me, as the representative of the Department, the new school building. Since that date the building has been under the charge of the Reverend Principal, Canon Middleton, or more particularly, under the care of his newly appointed engineer Mr. Rhines. This engineer has shown himself to be unusually competent, and the school is to be commended in having procured such a reliable and experienced man, along mechanical lines.\n\nOn New Year's Day Canon Middleton and family, and the matron (Nurse Megarry) accompanied by three or four of the older pupils, moved into their new quarters. They are now busy in checking material deliveries and putting things in order. So far but very few of the shipments have arrived, but it is expected that heavy shipments will arrive very soon.\n\nOn December 11th and 12th the Provincial Boiler Inspector, Mr. Marshall visited the school, and made a thorough test of the heating and laundry boilers. He issued the certificates of inspection, and left orders of two or three slight alterations considered by him to be desirable, and which have been attended to by the heating contractor.\n\nOn the 19th ultimo the electrical inspector of the Western Canada Fire Underwriters made an official visit and tested out the lighting apparatus. He found everything satisfactory, and the only change he ordered was to change the ground wiring from entering the soil below the switchboard in the engine room, and instead, to ground it to the water in the cooling tank, which has been done. While here he also inspected the electric wiring of the partly-built barns, which had been performed by the same electrical contractor, and which was found satisfactory.\n\nThe Dunham Heating Co.'s Inspector made a start to come here and check up the Dunham installations, but was caught by snow storms and could not get through. He intends coming when weather permits. This inspection is entirely gratuitous, but is a feature of the Dunham service.\n\nWhen the contractors left (on Dec. 22nd) the water tower and tank was just completed, and there was not then time to give it a real test before Christmas. Since then we have been pumping at intervals, and have gradually reached about 12,000 gals. in the tank. It still leaks more freely than I care to see, but I am hoping that the cracks will soon disappear as the wood swells. The tank is made of fir, which is not nearly so good as redwood. The tank is now almost full of water, but leaks at the rate of 1000 gals. per hour as we try to raise the water higher. However, as the tank is a very large one, a reasonable time must be allowed for the leaking to stop, but in the meantime I would respectfully suggest that an adequate sum be retained from the contractors as a contingency measure against a possible expense that may yet arise.\n\nThe heating service carried to the tank is functioning very satisfactorily, and there has been no trouble in keeping the\nfruit out since the heating boilers were supplied with river water. As previously mentioned the well water, though very good for all ordinary purposes and apparently inexhaustible in quantity, contains some substance in the nature of soda, which renders it unfit for the heating boilers, or laundry boiler. It was when trying to use the well water, at 45 below zero, that the water foamed and the boilers filling the steam lines, consequently making the sealing of these lines and the freezing of same where exposed. However, as previously reported, we were obliged to haul river water from Cardston, and refill the boilers after which there was no more trouble from the foaming previously experienced.\n\nThere still remains a little touching in the way of outside painting,\u2014mostly where dust damage was caused on window sills and trim,\u2014and it was impossible to get this done satisfactorily while the contractors were here owing to the cold weather and the presence of snow and ice on the sills. This work is not extensive, and the painter has left sufficient paint to complete the work, which will be done by the school staff in the spring, as arranged with the Principal.\n\nI duly received the Department's instructions regarding the extension to the kitchen and bakery chimney. At the same time it would be well to extend the laundry chimney high enough to clear the chapel roof alongside in order to get proper draught; and I am assuming the Department's consent to this and will have it done at the same time. The kitchen range and bakery oven have not yet arrived at Cardston, and we will endeavour to have the chimneys in readiness for these services.\n\nThe Claydon Company informed me that the department had adopted their recommendation that the water tower be braced by anchor rope as a precaution against the extreme winds for which this district is famous. The wire rope which they sent for the guys was, in my opinion, too light, so I wired them to send heavier rope. As the contractors are absent, I have instructed their local workman on how this work should be done to get the results intended, and it is being done under my direction.\n\nYesterday I received a message from Indian Agent Faunt, asking me to measure up all the window openings on the west side of the school, and to let him have the list, with specifications, and he has authority to procure store sash for these windows. I am preparing the list, as requested, and will hand him the list tomorrow. This protection for the west windows will prove very helpful in those rooms exposed to the prevailing winds, and will undoubtedly effect a noticeable saving in fuel.\n\nAs mentioned previously, we are having trouble from water leaking through from the eavestroughs and disfiguring the interior plaster. This seems to be caused by the eavestroughs filling up solid with ice, the expansion of which appears to break open the soldered joints. When other permits all the gutters should be gone over, and the joints re-soldered where necessary.\n\nAs my work here is now practically finished I expect to return to Calgary on the 10th inst., and may return for a day or two later in the month to look things over again and accept the work that was recently authorized, but not yet performed.\n\nIn conclusion, I will take this opportunity of thanking the department for the courteous treatment and loyal support I have received throughout in the work here, to which I have devoted all my time and have given the best that is in me.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nIndian Affairs.

The contractors overlooked charging for the added excavating before, but in checking up their figures, the omission was detected, and is now included in their invoice.\n\nItem No. 2. \"Increased size of main chimney, $184.00.\"\n\nThis change was duly authorized by the Architect conditional on our finding some deduction to offset it. We have been unable to find means of offsetting this cost. As the heating contractor insisted on the larger flue area, we had no alternative in the matter.\n\nItem No. 3. \"Cement supplied to strengthen mortar,\" $71.50.\n\nI felt that owing to the reduction in the thickness of our walls and the elimination of the cement in the mortar, we were not going to have sufficient strength in our basement walls and piers. The contractor was of the same opinion. We used one shovelful of cement to each wheelbarrow of lime carried up to the ground floor. In the brick piers we used cement mortar. I told the contractor that I could not promise that this extra cost would be paid for, but that I would refer it to the Department. This matter was referred to in my Report of June 20th.\n\nItem No. 4. \"Putting wooden floor in janitor's room, $27.50.\"\n\nThis was duly authorized, and the cost is rendered in detail. Credit is shown for the cement finish thus eliminated.\n\nItem No. 5. \"Additional outside entrance to chapel, with trim, $117.08.\"\n\nThis addition was the result of the Rev. Principal's request for an outside entrance, so that the older Indians might be able to attend church services without tramping through the School. This was accomplished by the Department. The windows which this entrance displaced were put in the boiler room so as to give more light in front of the boilers.\n\nItem No. 6. \"Door between Machinery Room & Laundry, $82.13.\"\n\nIn the plan a solid brick wall was shown separating the laundry from the machinery. It was suggested by the Architect that a movable partition be placed there so that the large machines might be passed through into the laundry when necessary. It was deemed important to put a door over the movable partition, so that the resident in charge might pass quickly between the rooms when carrying the machines instead of having to go a long way round by way of the basement passage and boiler room. In the event of an accident this change might prove very advantageous. The contractors were unable to give credit for the bricks displaced on account of the reinforced concrete lintel over the opening costing more than the bricks left out.\n\nItem No. 7. \"Work on hanging bell, $51.55.\"\n\nThis is the school bell shipped from Regina. The contractors quoted $15 for the setting of it on brackets on the roof, which has been done. The additional cost for bell ropes and pulleys, as per voucher from the Cardston Implement Co.\n\nItem No. 8. \"Building Rail in chapel, $13.78.\"\n\nOn the plan only a step was shown. The Rev. Principal said a communion rail was indispensable. This has been\nbeen installed, made from stair railing, with hinged drop-leaf in centre, and with balustrades between posts. It has been stained and varnished.\n\nItem No. 9. \"Door between fuel room and boiler room, $12.21\".\n\nWithout a door it was impossible to prevent a layer of black dust from spreading through that part of the building. When the fine steam coal was being unloaded a cloud of black dust spread over everything nearby, even reaching other basement rooms when the doors were opened.\n\nItem No. 10. \"Bal. due for boards under metal ceilings, $112.00\".\n\nThis balance was still due the contractors after commissions were placed as an offset against the cost of the ceiling boards which have been restored. It was hoped that other economies might be effected to absorb the $12.00, but the previous pruning had been too severe, the details of the exchanges are in the records of the Department.\n\nItem No. 10\u00bd. \"Balance on account of larger hot water storage tank, less credit of difference in smaller high pressure laundry boiler, $35.00.\n\nItem No. 11. \"Decorating living room in principal's residence, $13.80.\n\nThe reverend principal and Mrs. Middleton were very desirous of having their living room slightly different to the rest of the Institution, and the walls and ceilings have been tinted by the painter. I stated that this work was not authorized, and since Middleton wanted it done anyhow, and if it is to be charged a proper charge against the Department, he has offered to pay for it himself. If this item is out of order, please delete it from the amount of the final certificate, and the Rev. Principal will pay for it direct.\n\nItem No. 12. \"Additional cost of white Muranese Glass,\" $35.75.\n\nThis glass was used to provide obscurity in the staff room doors bordering on the corridors. In addition, it was found necessary to put heavy wired glass in the double doors at the main entries, and in the outside door to boiler room. It was found that ordinary glass would not stand the high winds which frequently blew the doors shut violently in spite of the door checks provided. Several sheets of the ordinary glass had been thus smashed before it was decided to procure the wired glass. Authority has received from Ottawa for the muranese glass.\n\nItem No. 13. \"Extending ventilation pipes to Levatories,\" $7.52.\n\nThis was duly authorized at the price quoted.\n\nItem No. 14. Sheeting inside of tower with gal. iron, $62.00.\n\nThis was necessary to prevent snow and rain from being blown through the louvres. The work was duly authorized at the price shown. It has accomplished the object intended.\n\nItem No. 10\u00bd. The details of this transaction were arranged between the Winnipeg office of the Grand Trunk Co., and the Superintendent, Thompson, to whom we have correspondence on the subject, to satisfy them as to the correctness of our statement. I have therefore included this item, subject to the confirmation of the Architect. The hot water storage tank measures 3' by 10'.\nItem No. 15. \"Additional hangers on line shaft, $46.13.\"\n\nIt was found necessary to place three more hangers on the line shaft that was shown on plan. One of these was placed opposite the wall where the belt from the engine drives the pulley that turns the line shaft to laundry. The other additional hangers were placed in the laundry, one alongside the pulley that drives the extractor, and the other in a gap where there was too much vibration to the shaft when the machines were in operation. Everything in that connection is now working satisfactorily.\n\nItem No. 16. \"Sundry items of additional electrical work, $148.09\"\n\nThis work was performed at the request of the Rev. Principal for additional outlets and call bells, and was duly sanctioned by the Department in their letter of Oct. 15th. The cost of the work to the contractors was $132.62, to which they have added 10% commission.\n\nItem No. 17. \"Net return from principal's residence, $110.00.\"\n\nThis was regularly authorized at the price shown.\n\nItem No. 18. \"Roughing-in for W.C.'s in Attic dormitories, $127.50.\"\n\nItem No. 19. \"Hot Water circulating pipe, $116.87.\"\n\nThis item was authorized by Commissioner Graham, and cost at the rate of $5.50 per foot. The effect of this will be a greatly improved hot water system, and a conservation of hot water. The hot water line is also covered under this item.\n\nItem No. 20. \"Larger sized jacket heater, $82.50.\"\n\nIt was decided that the change to a heater of larger capacity was advisable, and was duly authorized at the price shown.\n\nItem No. 21. \"Covering of boiler breechings, $272.25.\"\n\nThis was duly authorized and was performed by the heating sub-contractor at a cost of $247.50, to which the Clayton Co. have added their usual 10% commission.\n\nItem No. 22 & 23. \"Additional fire hose in boiler room, $49.50 and on ground floor, $38.50.\"\n\nThis was authorized by Commissioner Graham at $45. and $35. which, with the contractor's 10% worked out as shown.\n\nItem No. 24. \"Surplus coal taken over, $108.60.\"\n\nThe contractors brought in a large ear of coal for temporary heat during the last stage of construction. On completion the coal left over was measured and charged at cost price.\n\nItem No. 25. \"Hauling water from Cardston for heating boilers, $80.00.\"\n\nIn earlier reports it was mentioned that the local well water contained soda. This was found to be unsuitable for the boilers, and during the cold weather when the boilers were most needed, the water foamed and left the boilers. Five tanks of water have been hauled, and the boilers are now giving no trouble in this respect, and should carry through the remainder of the heating season. Next year the school teams can haul the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nnecessary river water for filling the boilers, and this expense avoided.\n\nItem No. 26. \"Installing burlap as originally called for, $500.00.\"\n\nIn the amendments the burlap was struck out, and the contractors state that $500.00 allowance was made in their revised contract price in consequence. They claim that the burlap which they have wettered should be paid for at the rate that was allowed by the Department, and was omitted under the revision. As the Department will no doubt keep a record of the original and revised figures, including the burlap, I have added the amount claimed by the contractors in this regard, subject to the Department's confirmation. The restoration of the burlap was authorized in a telegram from Commissioner Graham.\n\nItem No. 27. \"Supplying belt lacer for machinery belting, $5.00.\"\n\nThis was left by the contractors for the use of the engineer, and was charged for at cost price, with lacing thrown in. This is a metallic system of lacing hooks, for which the lacer is indispensable, and as the belts are sure to stretch, and require shortening, the machine could not be dispensed with.\n\nItem No. 28. \"Teeming account, as per deduction from original costs, $2,900.00.\"\n\nThis one item makes up approximately one half of the total costs shown under Schedule \"A.\" This sum was deducted from Claydon Co.'s final tender when it was expected that the school was to be built close to the railway yard siding provided. When finally it was decided to build the school on its present site the contractors claimed that this large deduction be written back into their contract price, which has been done under authority received from Ottawa.\nDETAILS AND EXPLANATIONS OF PRIME COST ITEMS FOR WHICH A LUMP SUM OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT PRICE. SCHEDULE \"B\".\n\nItem No. 1. \"Septic tank & Sewer system, as quoted, $2,100.00.\"\n\nThe work under this heading was duly authorized, and performed according to an approved plan, at the price quoted.\n\nItem No. 2. \"Additional length of main sewer, $65.00.\"\n\nThe plan showed the sewer leaving the building at the rear of the boiler room, but it was afterwards changed to another point of departure from building, which lengthened the sewer by 100'. This extension, including trench, cost $135.00. In order to lessen the cost as much as possible, the size of the sewer pipe between the septic tank and the outlet was reduced from 6\" to 4\", and a saving of $70.00 was effected and applied in reducing the cost under this heading, to $65.00.\n\nItem No. 3. \"Rainwater disposal pipe, $175.25.\"\n\nIn the specifications it stated that the laundry and flat roof water were to be taken to the outside of the building and the Department would continue it. This was carried in a separate 6\" drain for 165' where it was joined to the main sewer just beyond the septic tank. This work cost $95.00 and $80.00 for iron pipe supplied by Snyder & Co.\n\nItem No. 4. \"Water tower, as quoted, including allowance for steam heating, $3459.00.\"\n\nThis system of water storage and pressure was decided on by the Department at the price quoted, and has been installed in accordance with the approved plan.\n\nItem No. 5. \"Revision as per wire to Mr. Orr for additional bracing at top of tower, $150.00.\"\n\nI have not received any direct authority to include this item, but Claydon Co. state that this addition was arranged for by direct negotiation from the Winnipeg office. I am, therefore, including it, subject to ratification by the Department.\n\nItem No. 6. \"Cross bracing installed at base of centre posts, $20.90.\"\n\nThis was decided to be necessary as otherwise the outward thrust of the centre posts might have a tendency to break the vertical concrete piers supporting them, under great weight.\n\nItem No. 7. \"Supplying and installing water main, $322.30.\"\n\nIt was originally intended to install the water tower and tank alongside of the school building, but it was subsequently decided to place them 90' distant, and it is for this 90' that the added cost applies, and for an additional 85' of riser pipe in 3\" size, from the bottom of the trench to the point of delivery into the tank. This figure $322.30, also includes the covering of the riser pipe with asbestos cell covering, followed by a covering of heavy hairfelt. Item No. 7 deals with the water main only. The contractors did not include the water riser in their quotation on the tower and tank.\nItem No. 8. \"Increase in cost of heating services for extra 90 feet, $489.17.\"\n\nThis charge is for the cost of carrying the steam main from the heating boilers to the base of the tower, a distance of 115', and for protection covering over the steam main and wet return. This item includes the cost of a six foot trench, 100 feet in length; and a pole line to carry the steam line. When authority was given for placing the tower and tank 90 feet from the school, it was then estimated that the cost of carrying and protecting the steam lines would be between $450. and $500. The heating of the tank itself, and the risers and returns from the grade to the tank, are not charged for in this item, being part of the contract price, under Item No. 4.\n\nItem No. 9. \"Supply and erect pump, as per quotation, $841.00.\"\n\nThis was regularly authorized, and installed satisfactorily.\n\nItem No. 10. \"Additional drop line to well, $24.20.\"\n\nOn account of having the large capacity pump authorized (1420 gals per hour) it was deemed advisable to draw water from a somewhat lower level in the casing than was included in the contract for the pump. We therefore added 20 feet to the intake pipe, at the cost shown. We are now drawing water from a point below grade, and there is still 30' of water in the casing below the pump cylinder. The well has thus far withstood the heavy strain on its capacity by the large pump, and I do not expect any trouble in that respect, which is a remarkable showing in the way of an abundance of water.\n\nItem No. 11. \"Supply and installing ash hoist and cars, $197.34.\"\n\nThis outfit was obtained from the Cardston Hospital board, as mentioned by me in a letter to the Department. The Hospital board seem to be somewhat confused in the matter, and it became necessary for us to pay $100.00 for it, and $97.34 extra for the heavy iron ash buckets. The Board discovered that the buckets were being used for garbage purposes, and they are having to get other buckets made in the place of the heavy iron ones we got with the hoist. However, we are getting a bargain as it is, as we got the one for the Edmonton school, and is costing the Department just half. It is now installed and working satisfactorily.\n\nItem No. 12. \"Install electric lighting plant supplied by Dept., $447.03.\"\n\nThis item includes the freight on the List plant shipped from the Crowfoot school, Cluny; the handling to site; cost of making base and shelves; and the electrician's time setting up and testing and the purchase of sundries for same; and a charge of $20.00 for inspection made by the official inspector of the Western Canada Fire Underwriters Assoc.\n\nItem No. 13. \"Supplying and installing electric light fixtures, $520.56.\"\n\nThis item is scarcely correctly worded. The installing of the lighting fixtures was provided for in the general electric specifications, and no charge is made by the contractor's for this work. The fixtures were purchased according to the list, and at the prices authorized by the Department. The contractors have added -----\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nhave added their usual 10% to the purchase price. You will observe that there have been included a number of spare lamps, of various strength of lights, which the school will be able to make use of for replacement as other lights become broken or burnt out. These have been supplied by the electrical sub-contractor at a special price.\n\nItem No. 14. Wash tables in boys' and girls' lavatories, $142.80.*\n\nThese wash tables were made to the detail supplied by the Architect and have been installed in the place of the washbasins originally specified. The tables are covered with zinc; each side slopes to the centre, and the centre of the table contains a depression, or trough, which slopes to an outlet connected with the drain through a sealed trap. Hot and cold water pipe available at either end of the tables delivered through faucets. A slop sink is fitted at one end of each table. A slatted shelf below each table provides for wash basins when not in use. Under proper supervision the scheme should work out very well.\n\nNOTE: Under item 11, it will be observed that the hospital board at Cardston sold the Ash hoist direct to Mr. Snyder, so that the Department are purchasing the outfit from him, and not from the Board. I did not deem it necessary to ask for a copy of the invoice from the Board to Snyder. We have obtained the hoist at half its market value, although the cost has come a little higher than I was given to expect.\n\nUnder item 12, I have no voucher for the teaming of the lighting plant from the Cardston station to the site, as it was part of the general teaming arrangement, but I consider the charge of $300 reasonable, as it included batteries and cooling & oil tanks as well as the engine and generator. I am also looking for voucher for the freight of the furnishing to Cardston of $72.94. I asked the contractors for this voucher, but they stated that the receipt had been sent to their Winnipeg office, and there was not a duplicate. However, they showed me the corresponding entry in the stub of their cheque book, which satisfied me that the amount of freight charged the Department had been paid by them.\n\nIn the Brotherston Co's s/o under this heading, is included an item of $20. for the Underwriters' Inspection fee. I have also asked for a voucher for this charge, but I know the electrical inspectors would cut the generator, and accessories, when making his general inspection throughout the building. I have asked for a separate voucher for this charge of $20, and it will be obtained in a few days.\n\nI think all other items appearing under Schedule \"B\" are sufficiently vouchered.\nCERTIFICATE.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nCardston, Alta., Dec. 22, 1924.\n\nCertificate No. 18.\n\nI hereby certify that Oleydon Co., Limited, have supplied material and performed labour on St. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, Cardston, Alta., Contract for A L L. work entitling them to a twelfth payment of seventeen thousand, three hundred and eighty four dollars.\n\nCertificate No. 1\n\n| Item | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1    | $18,359.00 |\n| 2    | $8,467.20 |\n| 3    | $12,542.60 |\n| 4    | $15,291.20 |\n| 5    | $15,118.20 |\n| 6    | $10,251.00 |\n| 7    | $8,386.74 |\n| 8    | $4,745.00 |\n| 9    | $12,475.00 |\n| 10   | $5,491.00 |\n| 11   | $5,740.07 |\n| Total| $123,231.60 |\n\n$123,153.41\n\nLabour and material required to complete contract, $141.\n\nSignature \u2014 E.

It was strongly recommended that a range boiler be set up in the residence, and connected with the Principal's kitchen range, which system gives the residence its own independent hot water supply.\n\nI did not include this item in the contractor's final certificate because I had no authority for doing so. The Rev. Principal hopes that the Department will assume this charge as being part of the plumbing service. I promised him I would submit the bill to the Department, with explanations, and if it is decided that the bill is out of order the Principal understands that he will have to pay for the range boiler out of his own pocket; in fact I had his undertaking in this respect before allowing the fixture to be procured.\n\nWill you kindly give your ruling in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #107-1-5 of the 12th instant regarding accountable cheque #7777 for $500.00, sent to me at Cardston, Alberta, in connection with St. Paul's school barns.

The thousand dollars, (1,000) is held back on the recommendation of our Inspector of Construction, who states that the water tower is at present leaking very badly and that an amount should be withheld until the tower is working satisfactorily.\n\nThe deposit security held in connection with your contract is being returned to you today. It was necessary to hold this for thirty days from the date of the issuing of the final certificate.\n\nWith reference to the balance due on the Edmonton contract this matter is receiving immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nE.

We have not noticed anything in the contract or specification calling for a hold back and insomuch as the same amount was retained from the Edmonton final which, by the way, is still outstanding, would you kindly inform us as to why this revision has been made.\n\nThe cheque that was paid us must have been very close to Winnipeg at the time you received our telegram and we conclude this is the reason why we received no reply.\n\nI would be very glad, however, if you could indicate to us how soon the deposit of $12,500.00 will be realized.\n\nOur year, as a rule, ends on the last day of February, but, owing to our having secured a large contract in Fort William, we are trying to close our year's business at the end of this month, so as to organize in good time for the work that is before us.\n\nIn addition to this, we wish to use the bonds and cash that will make up the deposit on Cardston, to complete our security deposit for the new contract we have at Fort William.\nWe appreciate very much the promptness with which payments have been made when we have previously had occasion to ask for quick action. We trust this further request can be readily acceded without inconveniencing your staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE. Claydon\n\nEO/Y\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa, Canada.

This tank, like all other wooden tanks, will leak for quite a while. When the water was first pumped into it, as was expected, it leaked very much, but this to anyone with the least experience with wooden tank work is not regarded as a fault.\n\nI have had similar experiences around railway tanks and have not yet seen one which has absolutely no leakage and it cannot be guaranteed that a 2000 gallon wooden tank will be absolutely without leakage.\n\nIn confirmation of the above, I would suggest you or Mr. Orr, at your convenience, examine a few of the railway water tanks around Ottawa, and then discuss the matter with any of the railway engineers who have charge of them.\n\nI think by this time the tank at Cardston, or at any rate the lower portion of it, is about swelled to normal. Before leaving Cardston, our Mr. Mitchell explained to the caretaker there that he would have to swell the tank by degrees and, that as the swelling arose along the staves of the tank, so it could be filled, with a minimum of leakage, and then being thoroughly swelled it could be kept full without undue leakage.\n\nI offer the above explanation, not as a protest against the retention of $1000, but to affirm that the condition of the tank is quite satisfactory and would be deemed so by any authority experienced in the use of wooden tanks.\n\nI thank you for your telegram yesterday advising of bonds being returned to us and again express appreciation.\nof the Department handling payments to us all through our work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident,\nCLAYTON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nDuncan E.

This is really a trifling matter, as Mr. Middleton could very well have moved in and arranged to have the extra clothing and supplies stored in one of the spare rooms and on temporary boxes or shelves until such time as he could get the lockers and cupboards installed.\n\nDr. Westgate informs me that Mr. Middleton also complains that the barns are not completed. I may say that the horse barn is fully completed, and I understand that this barn is sufficiently large to accommodate all the stock which the school owns at the present time, but in addition to this the cow barn is all finished with the exception of one row of stalls, i.e., Mr. Middleton has not sufficient stock to fill all the space which is now ready. I cannot understand why he complains about the barns. If this is an obstacle in carrying on the Indian work then I fear we may expect many complaints. Mr. Scott is here today and tells me that everything is in good shape, and there is no good reason why they could not have moved in and opened the school.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sect.

(RG 10, Volume 6371, file 764-5, part 2)\nI thought that in case Dr. Westgate complained to you, you might as well have this information before you.\n\nThe barns at this school have cost us a great deal less money than if we had had them built in any other way, and the lockers and cupboards will be put up under our own direction and will be installed in the most economical way possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

The cow barn is also complete with the exception of pouring the concrete floor on one side & the erection of the stalls.\n\nThere is accommodation now for fourteen head of stock & the other side of the barn will be completed as soon as the weather will permit of the pouring of the concrete.\n\nWe have had an exceptionally cold & stormy winter which has delayed operations considerably, but there is no reason why the barn could not now be occupied, in fact it would be better if it were occupied as the heat from the animals would allow of the concrete being poured.\n\nAt present I understand the school has only six head of cows & these could be put in & there would still be room for eight more on the one side of the barn.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the building of the barns was not commenced sooner & before winter set in.\n\nDuncan C.

A case in point is the new school on the Blood Reserve, in which instance the date given the Society for the completion of the buildings by the contractor was Dec. 1st, 1933, and in connection with which the Society is still prevented from entering into occupation through the exhausting and needless delays of Mr. Commissioner Graham in completing the barns and installing lockers, etc. The Society's estimates for this school were drawn up last May and were based on the legitimate assumption that the buildings would be completed and available for occupation on a date not later than Jan. 1st, 1934. The delays noted have resulted in a serious loss to the Society in its estimated receipts under the heading of per capita grants. The Society's existing overdraft at its Bankers on its Indian Residential School accounts as on Dec. 31st, 1933, in the neighbourhood of $40,000.00 (forty thousand dollars), a failure to earn the full amount of the per capita grants estimated for the current year is, therefore, a matter of very grave concern to us. This fact illustrates, forcibly, the vital necessity that, for the future, we should be able to proceed with confidence upon the essential business principle of working up to, or from, agreed and known fixed dates.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask. March 11th, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Stewart -\n\nYou will remember speaking to me on the train of Canon Gould's complaint to you that the Principal of the school was unable to move into the new building owing to the fact that the stables were not completed and that certain clothes closets were not finished.\n\nYou understand that the building of the stables was carried on by day labor and that the clothes closets referred to were not included in the original contract. I told you that I did not think the report that you had received was well founded, but that I would be going to the Blood Reserve in a few days and I would report to you exactly how matters stood.\n\nThe stables I may say were fit for occupancy fully a month prior to the time Canon Gould complained to you. The clothes closets were about completed when I got there, and as I said to you at the time there was no reason why the moving could not be done before these clothes closets were finished, as there was all kinds of vacant space in the rooms that were not occupied next to the dormitories that could be used for storing the clothes on temporary shelves.\n\nIn pointing this out to Mr. Middleton the Principal he told me positively that he did not complain to Canon Westgate as it was not a good reason; he said he did tell him something about beds that had not arrived, and on enquiring into this I found that it was only a few beds that were required for the staff, and that there were dozens of perfectly good iron beds, white enamel, such as are used in hospitals or any other institution which could have been used temporarily, but this did not do.\n\nI am...........\n\nHon. Chas. Stewart,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI am taking the trouble of writing you in full regarding this matter as I do not think it is fair for Canon Gould to make statements of this kind when they are not well founded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) W.M.

The church authorities have pressed for the erection of a farmer's residence, and this building was in mind when the Department arranged for a vote of $2500. Please correspond with Dr. Westgate, of the M. S. C.

Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has recommended that a henhouse, hogpen and implement shed, which will cost approximately $1300, should be erected. I am asking him to correspond with you, with a view to determining what outbuildings are most urgent and then to inform the Department as to the decision. The $2500 which is being voted was for the purpose of erecting a farmer's residence but, if other outbuildings are more urgent, there is no reason why a change cannot be made. After you have communicated with Mr. Graham, you might let the Department know the result of your correspondence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Paul's School: Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Messrs Brotherston Electric Company Limited, with an account for $22.35, for repairing the bell system which he installed at St. Paul's School.\n\nSome time previous to moving the children to the new school, the Rev. Principal advised me that the bell system throughout the new building was not working, and that he felt some hesitancy about bringing the children until the bells were working again, having specially the fire alarm system in mind.\n\nI at once called on the electrical contractors, and saw Mr. Brotherston. He said that he could not imagine the cause of the trouble, as he had left everything in perfect order, and it had also been checked up by the Underwriters' Inspector. I suggested that he first write a letter to the local engineer, mentioning possible causes of the trouble, and wait until he heard further before going to the expense of the trip. He did this, and after a time further word came that the system was still out of order. As Canon Middleton seemed nervous about bringing in the children with the fire gong not working, I told Brotherston that he had better go down and remedy whatever was causing the trouble; and that if the trouble was not the result of any defects for which he was responsible, I thought it likely that he would be reimbursed for the cost of his trip.\n\nHe found that the cause of the trouble was simply a burnt out fuse, which he remedied by replacement in half a minute. The bell system was in perfect order, and as the fault was not his, he has submitted a bill for his expenses, making no charge for the three days he lost. I have certified the bills as being correct in the matter of the charges shown, and I am writing this covering letter that the circumstances will be understood.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCanon Middleton called on me on the 23rd, and reported the bell system all working well.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith  \n807.11th Ave. West.  \nCalgary Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago at your request we made a trip to Cardston, as the Principal of St. Paul's School had reported that the Bell System was not working. When I got there the only trouble I could find was a burned out fuse; on renewing the fuse I found the bells all to work perfectly. Unfortunately when I was there both the Principal and the Engineer were away.\n\nI wrote Canon Middelton and asked him to write us direct if he had any further trouble, but to date have had no reply.\n\nAs I found no defect in the material or workmanship, I am enclosing a bill for the expenses of the trip; you will notice that we are not making any charge for the three days I lost on the trip.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to put this bill through for us, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBrotherston Electric Co Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager\nOttawa, April 3, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing accounts from Bretheren Electric Co. for work on the electric bell system at the St. Paul's School. I do not think that the Department should be called upon to pay these accounts. If the Reverend Principal does not know enough to replace burnt out fuses, he cannot expect the Department to pay the accounts for an electrician to come from Calgary to the School to attend to these minor items. I am, therefore, sending the accounts to Mr. Middleton, advising him that the Department will expect him to make payment of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Sir,\n\nI have today received from Mr. Gardner Smith accounts from the Brotherston Electric Co. of Calgary, in connection with a trip to the St. Paul's School, with regard to the electric bell system.\n\nFrom Mr. Brotherston's letter it appears that when they left the job the system was in perfect condition, and the trouble was due to a burnt out fuse, which is a matter which could have been very easily attended to, and should have been looked after by your Engineer in charge. The Department cannot, therefore, give favourable consideration to the payment of these accounts, and I am forwarding them to you, so that you may settle with the Brotherston Electric Co.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

The proportion for the R.C. barns is $58.90.\n\nDepartment authority was given on May 13th 1924. There are two hardware stores in Cardston. The above amounts were quoted by the Cardston Implement Company and after a week's delay waiting for prices from the opposition - with no result - the work could not be delayed at their convenience, so the above firm were given the tender.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Please wire reply.\n\nClayden Company Limited.\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nWe confirm herewith night lettergram sent you on the evening of the 6th instant.\n\nWe received a reply over the signature of Mr. J. D. McLean suggesting that new top may be provided of plank covered with 3 ply roofing. We have wired our man at Cardston to send us a report of conditions concerning tank. After we receive this we will be glad to give you any information that will aid in deciding about the best thing to do regarding the top.\n\nWe have no drawing here of the tank. Our records show that the tank was at first designed by Mr. Smith with a 6\" concrete slab. Afterwards the tank was reduced in width and made longer, with the result that our final proposition provided for a 5\" top. We have no information here as to how deep tank is placed below the surface. We understood, however, it was difficult to secure sufficient fall. This would mean that perhaps tank is not far below the surface, and until we find out more about it cannot judge as to the wisdom of putting only a wood top on it.\n\nSuppose for instance tank is buried under 8 ft. of earth which at 100 lbs. to the foot would give 800 lbs. weight on each square foot of the roof. This, of course, would be more than even a 5\" slab would be expected to carry. We think it would be best to report to you depth tank is below surface as soon as we find this out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nE. Claydon\n\nR.

For instance, owing to the high winds with which we seem to be favoured in this part of the country, it is very difficult to keep the doors from banging, despite their being hinged on automatic springs, with the result that two glass panels were broken last week during the high winds. I took up the matter with the Indian Agent but he, like myself, desires to know who will pay for these repairs. I am therefore writing asking if it is permissible to have these incidentals repaired and ask for the endorsement of the Indian Agent before forwarding them to the Department for acceptance. Having discussed the matter with Mr. Indian Agent Faunt we thought that by writing direct a definite ruling could be obtained.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Rev.

Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, April 29, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to general repairs, etc., at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that broken windows and minor repairs to the building generally should be attended to by the school management, without cost to the Department. However, if an expenditure of any appreciable amount is necessary in connection with the buildings, you should feel free to report the matter to the Indian agent and ask him to correspond with the Department and attach his recommendation if he sees fit. In the event of catastrophe, as fire, hail, etc., the Department will always give favourable consideration to replacing windows and other physical equipment.\n\nA copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Fount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

April 16th 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWe thank you for your kind letters of the 9th and 14th instant.\n\nWe will be pleased to follow them and place bids on each building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Plans were duly received.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nSince writing you on the 9th instant regarding septic tank at Cardston, we have been advised that the tank is 4'6\" below ground level. At the time we wrote you our Mr. Mitchell, who was in charge of the work at Cardston, was in Fort William, and we had no opportunity to discuss matters with him. He was in Winnipeg for the last weekend, however, and we got some additional light on the matter from him.\n\nWe find the tank is 16 ft. wide by 25 ft. long, having a longitudinal divisional wall, making the tank into two sections 6x25 ft. This divisional wall, however, does not extend up to carry roof, so that ceiling slab, which is 5\" thick, carries right across the full width of 16 feet.\n\nOur estimate for this work was made up from a pencilled drawing sent to us by Mr. Smith. The first estimate, as previously mentioned to you, showed a ceiling slab 6\" thick, but that was when tank was 20 ft. wide. When the tank was reduced to 16 ft. wide the thickness of the slab was reduced to five inches. We did not question Mr. Smith's design - the slab thickness of 5\" to what we thought a span of 6 ft. appeared a good proportion, as we generally figure that if a slab thickness equals 1/2\" for every foot of span, it is correct. We took it as a matter of course that divisional wall was carried up the same height as the sides. This seemed so obvious that we did not even tell Mr. Smith, or even Mr. Mitchell, the way it had been figured. It appears, however, that Mr. Smith's interpretation of the drawing to Mr. Mitchell was that he had no intention of building divisional wall the same height at the sides.\n\nMr. Mitchell informs us that when building the tank it occurred to him the slab was too thin and he suggested to Mr. Smith that some means should be taken to strengthen it, and although he could receive no order for so doing he put in two piers from the centre wall to support the slab and put in extra steel across these piers. As this work was done without an order, we could get no payment for it. It is evident now that what Mr. Mitchell voluntarily did, and a good deal more,\nwas necessary.\n\nMr. Mitchell states that he did not do any figuring as to the load imposed on the slab, but from his general experience in handling concrete work he thought a 5\" slab was too thin for such a span, and as it was not his responsibility, and not being trained for the design of slab, he was not called on or in a position to pass on the sufficiency of the design.\n\nNow that the failure of the slab has proved its weakness, we suggest that in addition to the piers put up by Mr. Mitchell that a longitudinal beam be put over them to support slab, or instead of this continue the centre wall to the under side of slab, making one or more openings in it, so that tank can be entered from the side that manhole is in.\n\nFiguring that the earth cover will weigh 100 lbs. to cubic feet, a depth of 4'6\" from the surface will give a load of 450 lbs. to square ft. over the tank. Suppose we figure a load of 600 lbs. to the square foot on the slab to include weight of slab; this, we suggest, would require a 7\" slab and about one percent of steel for a span of 6 ft.\n\nIf there is to be no centre support, and the slab run from side to side of the tank, I suggest it will require for the 16 ft. span to carry load of 600 lbs. to the ft. a 12\" slab and proportionate amount of steel.\n\nInasmuch as Mr. McLean's letter proposes 2\" plank top, we feel these facts should be placed before you, and we would therefore like to have your instructions now that you know tank is below surface.\n\nIn the meantime we are preparing the tank for a new top of some kind and as soon as we hear from you will proceed with finishing it off.\n\nAs we are billing the Department with some other work as set forth in previous correspondence, we will leave the question of responsibility for payment for consideration with other items we have to bring up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYTON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nR.G.\n\nR.

I am also in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant #103-1-5 giving me the same information, but informing me that the church authorities were pressing for the erection of a Farmer's residence, and that this building was in mind when the Department arranged for a vote of $2500.00.\n\nYou asked me to correspond with Dr. Westgate of the M.S.O.C., with a view to determining which outbuildings are the most important and how the $2500.00 allowed for buildings at this school should be expended, and when a decision was reached to inform the Department. I beg to say that before writing to Dr. Westgate I received a letter from him, saying that he had heard from you that I had been authorized to spend $2500.00 this year on outbuildings, but he makes no comment about a Farmer's residence.\n\nI propose using the $2500 on a henhouse, pigsty, implement shed, and garage, as the school cannot go on without these buildings; there is no question about this.\n\nDuncan C.

We are not going to spend $3500 on outbuildings at the Old Sun's School, for which you have authorized this amount. I would suggest that you allow me to put up a cottage similar to the one we have built at Sandy Bay, and are going to build at Dog Creek and Fairford this year.\n\nThis model is a bungalow with a living room, two bedrooms, and a kitchen. This is all that we should provide at any of the schools, and if you authorize this I would only use between $2500 and $2600 of the $3500 which was authorized to be spent at Old Sun's and which is not necessary. In this way we would complete the buildings required at the St. Paul's School and they would then be in shape to carry out their work.\n\nI would like to have your authority by wire to do this, as I am arranging a building programme at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

March 31st, 1925.\n\nJ.T.Faunt Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\nCARDSTON, Alta.\n\nRe- St.Paul's School; Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr.Faunt:\n\nI duly received your letter of the 23rd inst. with a raft of bills enclosed regarding some of which you ask for information.\n\nI have numbered the bills referred to me, and will take them up briefly in the order in which I have numbered them.\n\n(1) Roof Flanges for Bell Rope. This was not in Claydon's contract and the charge seems all right.\n\n(2) Connecting Range Boiler to Stove in Principal's Residence. I did not assume this expense on behalf of the Dept'. I conveyed a message to Mr.Flett from the Principal, giving Flett the name of the range and the measurement of the fire-box. I am not in a position to say whether this bill should be paid by the Dept' or by Canon Middleton himself; it would seem to depend on what the Dept's policy is in such cases. It seems reasonable that the Dept' would finish the job when providing hot and cold water to the Principal's residence.\n\n(3) Smoke Pipe for School Kitchen Range. This work was imperative as the range was obviously useless until provided with connections to the chimney.\n\n(4) The Metal Extensions to Brick Chimneys. This was authorized in telegram to me of Jan.2nd, signed by J.D.McLean.\n\n(5) Setting up Bake Oven & Smoke Pipe for Same. This work was necessary, and the charge does not seem excessive.\n\n(6) Metal Extension to Laundry Chimney. See answer to No.4.\n\n(7) This work was done after I left. The Dept' paid for setting up a range boiler in the Principal's residence, but as he was using a stove in the basement instead of the kitchen range, he was without hot water most of the time; hence he asked for connection to be made with the school hot water supply, and this charge of $16.35 was thus incurred. He now has two sources of hot water supply, which will be a great advantage to him when the heating boilers are not in use.\n\n(8) Threading N.P.Pipe, 25\u00a2. I don't know what this item is.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI trust the explanations I have briefly given will enable you to understand the nature of the various items referred to me. I do not feel in a position to certify them in the usual way for the reason that the work was done after I left, and I have not had an opportunity of looking it over. Presumably you have done so, and if the bills are clerically correct, and the charges fair and reasonable, you will know better than I how to deal with them. Only items 1, 4 and 6 were authorized by me, on authority as stated.\n\nIt has certainly been a long steady winter, very different to the previous winter when we were building the Agency houses all through the winter months.\n\nHoping you are all well, and with kind regards,\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
