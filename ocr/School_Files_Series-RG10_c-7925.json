Same to be completely rewired using proper type materials.\n\nAll branch circuit lighting to be fused at not more than 15 amperes capacity.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe defects listed do not necessarily include any further dangers which may be discovered upon further examination but are a general guide to enable any competent wireman to estimate upon the work involved in placing the installation in good order.\n\nAs the above mentioned defects constitute a serious hazard to life and property it will be necessary for you to have them remedied by securing the services of a competent electrician and arrangements made with this office for another inspection.\n\nIn regards to the two existing 200 ampere lighting services, one being located in the laundry and the other located in the shoe storage room in the basement of the main building, we would recommend that some thought be taken into consideration for the necessity of installing a weatherproof enclosure on the new proposed transformer pole which will be erected near the rear of the building just off the garage driveway and in line with the new existing Rural line on the Rabbit Lake Road. This enclosure will house the main service switch and metering equipment for all buildings, also an additional weatherproof enclosure should be installed on an adjacent pole which will house the 240 volt, 3 phase service and metering equipment.\n\nShould you require further information in regards to this matter kindly advise us at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

It would be a pity if, because of an opinion voiced by me, a change were made in the electrical service for this school, this change proving later not to be beneficial. I feel sure that there must be men of your Department much better qualified than I to decide upon the relative merits of Hydro and other sources of power supply.\n\nThe copy of certain correspondence received by your Department from the Municipality of Jeffrey and Melick, forwarded to me by yourself, puts forward no suggestions as to possible advantages for this school which might result from this change. Reasons given refer only to probable advantages to the Municipality concerned.\n\nThe only possible considerations which might influence me in voicing an opinion would be the probable comparative cost, and the relative efficiency of service to be expected. Whatever expenditure might be involved in the actual change to be made would hardly be a relative consideration, when thinking of a long-term viewpoint.\n\nI feel able to make no further comments.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nAll branch circuits lighting to be fused at not more than 15 ampere capacity.\nFebruary 11th, 1950.\n\nMr. N.

For several days water to a depth of from eight to ten inches has been in evidence above the ground in the disposal field. It is without doubt seepage from the bed.\n\nWhile there is no immediate cause for alarm, I thought it advisable to bring this to your attention. There is little doubt that the new toilets have relieved the system of a considerable portion of the volume of fluid which it used previously be obliged to carry. We have as a result had no difficulty at all with the sewage system this winter.

Ross, Principal of this school has been received relative to the condition of water piping at the school.\n\nThe repair and replacement of the piping at this school was included in the 1950-51 Estimates with the estimated cost being $3000.00.\n\nI believe you submitted a report dealing with this matter on November 23rd, 1949, and we were later advised that this had been brought to the attention of the Lands and Development Services Branch, along with report covering the Fire Escapes, for a complete report.\n\nA copy of Mr. Ross' letter is attached for your information and it is recommended that his request be given consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nKenora Indian Agency,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration.\n\ncg/\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKemora, Ontario,\nMay 6, 1950.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nIn our estimates for the present year, allowance was made for the necessity of replacing existing water piping in this building.\n\nPresent water pipes throughout this building are almost all the original iron pipes put in when the school was built. During the years which have elapsed since then, a great deal of corrosion has taken place. Also, a great deal of scale has built up on the inside of the pipes. In several places this has developed to such an extent that there is a serious threat that the water will soon cease to flow altogether. It can be understood quite readily how easily an emergency could be created if this happened in one of several places while school was in session.\n\nMay I request authority, please, to arrange for having all water piping which needs to be replaced removed and replaced during the coming holidays.\n\nI believe that it is now considered economical to have copper pipe put in wherever possible. However, your Engineering Department will be much better informed than I, and will be able best to advise the proper procedure for putting our water system in first-class shape.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, May 9th, 1950\n\nF. Matters, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCamp Chippewa, North Bay, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Matters,\n\nRe: Fire Escapes,\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R.S. School\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. T.C. Ross, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School covering the necessity of replacing the present antiquated fire escapes at the School.\n\nIn the 1950-51 Estimates this item was listed with a proposed expenditure of $4000.00.\n\nIt has not been possible to have the Fire Marshall's representative to visit the school and submit his recommendations.\n\nA copy of Mr. Ross' letter is hereto attached for your information and it is recommended that consideration be given to his request for a new modern fire escape.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nKenora Indian Agency,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ontario,\nMay 6, 1950.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe FIRE ESCAPES:\n\nDuring my first term as Principal of this school I drew your attention to the hazards of fire in this school, with its present poorly-planned fire escapes. On the occasion of the first visit of the Regional Supervisor to this school, this topic was discussed quite fully.\n\nIt was pointed out that, since there is no direct exit from any one of the four large dormitories to a fire escape, the possibility of the occupants of one or all of these dormitories being able to reach safety in the event of fire is a slight one indeed. The fact was also stressed that, because there is only one exit from each of these dormitories, it is necessary to leave the one exit unlocked while the dormitories are occupied. This means that there is free passage between dormitories containing young people of opposite sexes, many of whom are physically capable of reproduction. That this fact is a constant threat to the morals of the pupils of this school should not need to be emphasized.\n\nI am bringing this matter again to your attention with the sincere hope that your Department will not allow another school year to pass without having proper up-to-date escape equipment installed in this school. I do not feel that I can accept responsibility for the safety of children who are not supplied with a reasonable chance of safety in the event of fire.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, May 9th, 1950.\n\nF. Matters, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCamp Chipewa, North Bay, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Matters,\n\nRe: Additional School Building,\nCecilia Jeffrey Res. School.\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. T.C. Ross, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School outlining the need for a new school building at this school to take care of the proposed extension of physical education, and for the inclusion of an additional classroom and library.\n\nA copy of Mr. Ross' letter is hereto attached for your information and consideration.\n\nAn item of $25,000.00 in the 1950-51 Estimates covers this proposed expenditure.\n\nMr. Ian Risenhardt, Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation, discussed this matter with Mr. Ross this morning and will no doubt be reporting later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nKenora Indian Agency,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration.\n\nN/P/g\nGeetina Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ontario,\nMay 5, 1950.\n\nMr. Herman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe ADDITIONAL SCHOOL BUILDING:\n\nIn our letter dated July 30, 1949, we mentioned the need for an additional building for this school, this building to contain a gymnasium, a classroom, a library and two reading rooms.\n\nAt present there is no part of this building (our present school) which is suitable for use as a gymnasium. Because of this there is inadequate program of physical education. Also, the lack of space for indoor sports results in disciplinary problems which could largely be avoided if there were proper facilities for recreation. The need for a proper gymnasium is great indeed.\n\nWe are sadly in need of an additional class-room, and there is no space available. We have no library, and because of this are losing a valuable chance to educate our Indian young pupils. There are no rooms in our present building where a pupil may retire to read or write. This is a tragic fact. Separate reading rooms for boys and girls are very, very necessary.\n\nIt is believed that these needs could all be met in one building. It is proposed that this building should contain a gymnasium (and possibly a swimming pool) on the lower floor. The second floor should contain the class-room, library and two reading rooms. It is expected that the cost of such a building would be $25,000.00.\n\nMay I request permission to have plans prepared for such a building, please?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nP.

With regard to this matter, I attach for your information a copy of a memorandum received from Mr. Webb dated May 16th.\n\nThe Grand Jury's report also complains that the pressure tanks for the water system need replacing.\n\nWith regard to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School the report reads:\n\n\"Members of the jury strongly recommend that spiral fire escapes be installed at each end of the building; to make easy access from boys' and girls' dormitories. Present fire escapes are of the open grating and prove a hazard during the winter conditions. At the present time pupils have to cross stair-wells to gain access to the present fire escapes.\n\nThe jury also noticed plaster throughout the entire building in a deplorable state of repair. Classroom lighting was found to be very poor. It was also noted that seepage from the sewage system was appearing on the surface.\"\nIt would be appreciated if you could arrange to have one of your engineers visit the above two schools at an early date and submit a report regarding what he considers can be done to improve the conditions about which the Grand Jury have reported adversely.\n\nP.S.\n\nBernard F.

We recommended that repairs be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\nAccommodation for outdoor playgrounds very limited but could be extended with very little expense.\n\nPressure tanks for the water system need replacing. The washer in the laundry was also found in very poor condition.\"\n\n\"Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nMembers of the Jury strongly recommend that spiral fire escapes be installed at each end of the building to make easy access from boys' and girls' dormitories. Present fire escapes are of the open grating and prove a hazard during winter conditions. At the present time pupils have to cross stair-wells to gain access to the present fire escapes.\"\nHon. W.E. Harris\n\nJune 6th, 1950.\n\nAccommodation for indoor recreation very limited. Approximately 140 pupils are residing in the school originally built to accommodate 135 pupils. The Jury also noticed water throughout the entire building in a deplorable state of repair. Classroom lighting was found to be very poor. It was also noted seepage from sewage system appearing on surface. We strongly recommend that the above conditions be attended to at an early date.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you could present this report to the appropriate officials of your Department and I would be grateful, in due course, to receive an indication of what remedial measures can be taken to remove the defects outlined.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[signature] W.M.

The official announcement is being written regarding the restoration of the building.\n\nWith reference to the recommendation of the Grand Jury that the present fire escape be replaced by a steel ladder escape, I may say that our engineers do not agree with this recommendation. However, an engineer from this Department will visit this school in the near future and assess the present fire escape, and will also take the necessary action in regard to providing better access to the building.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Ross of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora, was here recently discussing some of the work at the school. He mentioned to us some of the improvements which he thought should be made this summer.\n\nOne matter which gives us much concern is the lack of suitable fire escapes from the dormitories. You, of course, are familiar with the plan of the building and know that if a fire occurred in either stair well the children in the dormitory nearest the stair would have no means of exit.\n\nThere were other matters which Mr. Ross discussed with us but I am hoping to go to Ottawa to see you before many months. Some of the things he mentioned were milk pasteurization equipment and an inter communication system.\n\nMr. Ross feels very definitely that a secretary should be hired to take care of the office work but we feel that the present grant does not warrant hiring another member of staff.\n\nWe have been fortunate in securing a qualified Primary teacher for the primary room and also a teacher for the Intermediate classroom. I am sure you will be pleased to have this information. These teachers will replace Mrs. Highfield and Mrs. Coulter, who have been on our staff as teachers but who are not qualified.\n\nI hope that the matter of the fire escapes will be given careful consideration.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nFrieda E.

Previously we received a report published in the newspaper by the Grand Jury, in which they suggested that the present fire escapes be replaced by spiral type escapes. I may say that our engineers do not agree with this recommendation.

Boulter of the Engineering Staff called at the School and discussed this matter with the Principal.\n\nA copy of Mr. Ross' letter is hereto attached for your information and consideration.\n\nNorman Peterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ontario,\nAug 12, 1950.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRE: DISPOSAL BED\n\nFluid continues to lie above ground in this area.\n\nThere is no doubt that the installation of the new toilets has reduced the flow of water through this system; and seepage above ground in the disposal bed has consequently been reduced. But the situation referred to above is far from satisfactory, and suggests that we are apt to be faced with sewage backing up during the winter, when frost is apt to prevent seepage from getting away. Also, this condition presents a constant threat to the sanitation of the school.\n\nI should not bring this matter again to your attention if I did not believe that it required immediate action. Not being an engineer, I do not know what the real difficulty is. It would seem to warrant prompt action on the part of those in charge of such matters within your Department.\n\nI feel confident that I can count on your cooperation in remedying this most unpleasant condition.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nT. G. Ross,\nPrincipal.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ontario,\nAug 12, 1950.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe HOT WATER TANK:\n\nInspection of this tank while making a recent repair has shown that the metal has become very thin in a number of places. This suggests the necessity for early replacement of this tank.\n\nA leak which appeared necessitated immediate repair. The metal in the vicinity of the leak proved to be so thin that it is a question whether or not the repair may be expected to hold for long. Further leaks may occur at any time, and it is quite possible that we may be without the use of this tank altogether. If this happens, we shall be in a precarious condition indeed. We depend on this hot water tank for all hot water throughout the building: laundry, kitchen, washing and bathing for both staff and children. Should this tank be out of commission, we would be without hot water in any and every part of the school. We have no reserve or auxiliary hot water jacket.\n\nI could not feel justified in facing the possibility of being without hot water while school is in session. May I suggest therefore that either an engineer from your Department inspect the condition of this tank and advise concerning its replacement, or that I be authorized to get tenders from local firms at once for the cost of replacing it.\n\nIt seems important to consider the advisability of installing a tank of considerably greater proportions. The one at present in use does not hold sufficient hot water to provide a decent bath for half the children at any one time.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/37\nOttawa, August 16, 1950.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ont.\n\nThe above named school was visited on Friday, July 31st, 1950, for the purpose of inspecting and reporting on the following:\n\n1. Fire escapes.\n2. Condition of plaster in entire building.\n3. Lighting in classrooms.\n4. Sewage from sewage system appearing on surface of ground.\n\n1. Fire escapes.\n\nThe existing fire escapes are located on the outside of the building as marked on the attached plan and are of steel construction with landings at each floor level. Exits are through windows in each staircase well with a small window ladder placed at each window from floor level to sill. In winter the escapes are covered with ice and snow and would provide a very hazardous means of exit from the building in case of fire, particularly when used by small children. If fire occurred in either of the staircase wells the escapes would not be accessible.\n\nThe dormitories in this school are situated on the top floor of the building, one at each end, are the full width of the structure and accommodate approximately 75 pupils each. It would, therefore, appear logical, that the fire exits should be located in such a position that they can be easily reached from the dormitories in case of fire in the centre portion of the building.\n\nIt is recommended that, for maximum safety, two fire-proof stair case wells with fire-proof stairs should be constructed one at each end of the structure, in positions marked on the attached drawing. The stair walls should be provided with landings at each floor level and with fire-proof doors having automatic escape mechanism hardware, to give access to the stairs on each floor. The existing outside steel fire escapes could remain as they are to provide exit from the centre portion of the building.\n\n2. Plaster.\n\nAn inspection of the condition of the plaster in the entire building revealed that, in general, it does not require attention. On the walls of the stair wells three or four places were noted on which a small repair job should be done.\n\n3. Classroom Lighting.\n\nThe lighting in the three classrooms and sewing room is provided by fixtures of an obsolete type and they are too few in number. It is recommended that fluorescent lighting fixtures should be installed to provide sufficient foot candles for school room lighting in accordance with modern standards.\n4. Sewage from Sewage System.\n\nThe original septic tank, constructed when the school was built, was remodelled and extended in October 1937 by the Winnipeg office of the Dept. of Mines and Resources in accordance with the attached drawing. No drawing of the layout of the distribution tile bed was available and whether or not the bed was extended at this time is not known.\n\nThe tile bed is laid in a field adjacent to the building and extensive seepage is visible. The Principal reported that, about a year ago, the tile was uncovered, examined and replaced or repaired in certain sections, but the trouble was not overcome.\n\nIn this case, it is recommended that advice should be obtained from some person experienced in sewage disposal systems.\n\nAttached is a drawing showing the existing septic tank and, also, a drawing of Septic Tank Disposal System prepared by the Sanitary Engineering Division of the Dept. of Health of Ontario.\n\nJ. H. Boulter.\nAugust 31st, 1950.\n\nMr. M. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKanora, Ontario.\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nOn reporting on his recent inspection of the above school, Mr. J.H. Roulter states that on the walls of the stairwells there are 3 or 4 places where the plaster should be repaired. You may arrange for this.\n\nWe are enclosing forms which you should complete for the lighting of the classrooms and return to us. We will then submit the information which you supply to the Hydro Electric Power Commission for their consideration, so that they can make certain the proper fixtures are secured.\n\nWe are communicating with the Department of National Health and Welfare regarding the sewage from the sewage system.\n\nBernard F.

G. J. SCHOOL!\n\nFurther to your letter, file 129/6-1-46:\n\nI am grateful indeed to receive the comments of your Engineering Branch, who are well qualified to decide upon such matters as this.\n\nParagraphs 1 to 3 refer of course to previous improvements made, and to the unfortunate situation in which we found ourselves while unable to obtain the services of a young man for this work. (I need not remind you that operating as we do on a very restricted budget, we are seldom able to offer wages which will attract first-class men.) I am at present trying out a younger man for the important job of firing the boiler referred to.\n\nThank you for drawing to my attention the fact that the ashes would still have to be removed, and that, with a hopper-fed stoker, it would require filling with coal about three times a day.\n\nThank you too for emphasising the fact that the combustion efficiency would certainly increase. Since receiving your letter, I have been told by others concerned with heating problems that the cost of installing a stoker is soon paid for by the reduction in fuel consumption due to increased combustion efficiency. If that is true, it would be well to have a stoker installed as soon as possible, would it not?\n\nIs it possible that someone from your Engineering Branch could give me some idea of the probable saving which might be effected by the installation of a stoker in this school? There is about 400 feet of radiation, and, during cold days in the winter, our consumption of coal is often as much as two tons per day.\nI am glad to have had expert opinion expressed on this subject. All too often we are prone to consider such installations only as they affect the comfort and well-being of the school, as we see it. The comments of your Engineering Branch have emphasized to me the one important practical consideration involved in this case; increase in combustion efficiency. If the cost of maintaining this school can be reduced by installing this piece of equipment, that is of course of even more interest to your Department than it is to me, is it not?\n\nCould your Engineering Branch, please, give me expert advice as to the advisability of having a bin-fed or hopper-fed type of stoker installed. I should very much appreciate authoritative information on this question.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nT. O. Ross,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. If it is the wish of your Department that, in order to affect this saving as soon as possible, IF POSSIBLE, a stoker be installed with as little delay as possible, I should be prepared to put up with whatever discomfort was involved during the installation, even if it was necessary to have this done during the first few weeks of term.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Harrisons and Crosfield (Canada) Ltd.,\nAddress 1377 Winnipeg Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n(To be typed or in Block Letters)\n\n| SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|---------|--------|\n| August 29 To supplying two drums of Chlorine for the Hypochlorinator at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School on July 25th, 1950. | 4.80 |\n\nTotal 4.80\n\nFOR USE BY INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT\n\nVoucher No. 397 Date 29-8-50\n\nI hereby certify that the material has been supplied, the work performed, that the charges are fair and just and the expenditure has been incurred on Government business.\n\nRecommended for payment:\n\nFOR USE BY HEAD OFFICE\n\nVote\nAllot\nAmount Approved for Payment\nDate\nKenora, August 31st, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Painting Barn,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res.

I am informed that suitable farm land can be secured west of Laughlin. A site on the mainland as close to Lake Nipigon as possible would place the institution in close touch with its Indian constituency in the summer months and would give it all year round contact with markets, mails, medical services, etc.\n\nIf you will arrange to submit a recommendation relative to a suitable farm, I will have the Department Architect select a proper building site.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Addison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n454 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, April 23, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, and I note your recommendation that the new buildings be placed in the general locality of Kenora. Mr. Indian Agent Edwards also recommends a site near the main line of railroad, and the advantages of such a situation will not be overlooked. The Department Architect will proceed to Kenora in a few weeks, with a view to selecting a site for buildings. In the meantime, I should be grateful if you would have one of your officers call on Mr. Indian Agent Edwards and, in conjunction with him, endeavour to locate a suitable property. I am writing to Mr. Edwards, asking him to cooperate with your representative in this connection. If you will let me know who will act for you, I will send more definite instructions to Mr. Edwards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nFollowing the recent negotiations of the Secretary, Mr. James Edwards, the Indians have been asked to meet at a special meeting to discuss the possibility of building a new school in the neighborhood of Roosman having three requirements in mind: (1) to be connected with the railway and Roosman; (2) to be located near the town of Roosman; (3) to be situated on a piece of suitable land. The two days before the meeting, representatives from Ottawa came with us. Altogether I visited four days exploring various sections. All our inquiries were made of the people in view of the fact that many of the Indians who live in the school will be drawn from homes in the south in the case of the Indians who would come to go north would make representations on their behalf.\n\nThe Proposed Location - Nothing could be gained by a partiality of the different localities we investigated except to give assurance that we had pretty well covered the area. We visited some of the possible locations west side of the Roosman River both from east and west. We traveled on the Roosman Reserve Road to see what was along the river. We looked at some land at the top of Field Indian Road. Our investigations on this part also were not very extensive because we thought it best not to go too close to the Roman Catholic School if a site could be secured elsewhere. However, we knew that that side offers in the way of possibilities. Finally, after elimination of impossible areas, we settled on three possible ones. The best suitable on abandoned golf course about five miles from Roosman. It has road and water connection and some cleared land, but is deficient in good supply, very old, very close to other villages, and terribly muddy. There is no way such a place can be used. The second site is located at the top of Field Indian Road. This site seems to have road and water connection although the road runs up to about nine miles. The land here is very heavy clay, a sample of which I have shown to the Department of Agriculture. The third site is not much land to be had in any continuous piece although there could be several acres of it available. The first choice covers lots 68 and 70 P just north of the north boundary of Reserve No. 4. These lots are owned by Mr. Cardinal of Roosman. Our judgment and also the judgment of Mr. James Edwards is that the Cardinal property is by all odds the best location. Field Indian Road is a poor second, and the Golf Links a very bad third.\n\nThe Cardinal Property - Each lot has in it about 150 acres. The best land is a long strip extending in a westerly direction on either side of the boundary between Lots 68 and 70 P. The vegetation on it is not noticeably different from other parts of the country except that certain portions it is not so dense. There is Rogers, birch, a scattering of maple and in some places jack pine. There is some scrub growth also and grassy patches are scattered all over its surface. There is also a portion that would be a strip on the north side towards the boundary between Lots 68 and 70 P. This would be a strip of land which would be a little rocky strip, but between these two rocky formations and extending just far enough out to be a level piece of country. The soil is a light sand loam. I have had it analyzed and it is not the heavy clay soil and this sample of sandy soil was free from acidity and tests out almost neutral. Both are very distinctly deficient in organic matter and the sand more so than the clay. However, the opinion of the Professor at McGill and also of his field worker is that the sandy soil would be much better for the purposes of the school. It would need to be built up before it could yield the most satisfactory crops, but so would the soil. The sandy soil is much easier to work and much less expensive. It would grow potatoes very well nicely. It was a very good clump and would increase yearly under proper rotation for other crops and also. It is admirably adapted for hay culture.\nThe question of raising three year old cattle follows a little more closely or not.\n\nThere is no question about the road leading right into the property. A settler on the old gold line could easily get there by going just out of the town on the west side of the town road. By running about a quarter mile off the road across the top of the hill to connect with the trail, however, this will be avoided. On the other hand, there is a road leading down from Ford's creek. It is just over half a mile from the town back to the top and down into the Indian Reserve where it joins the old main passage and the old logging road.\n\nThe water connection is good. If connecting the creek to the railway station and there would be no drainage of freight and supplies from train to boat. There is no reason in this country that would lead themselves to the building of any other settlement. Water must be the main means of transportation for young, and the road will need at certain seasons for emergency work.\n\nConsidering this site from the point of view of the building, there are at least two very fair building sites on the lake.\n\nThis is the location of the former educational objective suitable for these Indians. The Indians have been known to demand it. It is central to good fishing grounds.\n\nThere will be good setting for years and so far as the school is concerned an opportunity is assured because of its proximity to the reserve as well as by the wood on the lake itself. It would enable the school to grow a good deal of its own food supply. To provide the possibility of a large poultry industry with an easy shipping point, and probably strawberries could be cultivated too. The possibilities of a berry industry in connection with the school should be investigated. Poveshell will never be a basic industry for these Indians. The country they live in will not permit it. Another possibility that ought to be thoroughly investigated is fur farming. If in the future, it is thought wise to establish a colony for the protection of the school, between berries, furs, fishing, timber and garden plots, they ought to be able to establish themselves either on the reserve property or on the reserve land have a fine chance to develop under supervision these and other occupations suited to the character of the country in a section that is suitable for every climate.\n\nSome of the lands in this location is cleared, but clearing would be easy, and thin that ought to be greatly encouraged in clearing in the burning of brush in order that the fire would be destroyed by the fires and be as small as possible. Every bush of wood on top of this hill is of very great value.\n\nIf certain Indians, or the Indian Department settle through some representative, or even to this particular location, we feel that it will be the best possible.\nToronto, June 12th, 1925.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.C.S., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed please find a memo re the new location for Cecilid Jeffrey Indian School that has been sent here by Mr. Freeman, Convener of our Indian Committee for Winnipeg Presbytery. The Sub-executive and our W.M.B. Board approve of the site as recommended by Mr. Freeman's Committee.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJIR/TNS\nWHO IS NEW LOCATION FOR GEORGE JEFFREY INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nS.G.D. Freeman, Convener Indian Committee for Winnipeg Presbytery\n\n1. General - Following the recommendations of the Presbytery, Captain Edwards, the Indian Agent at Kenora and myself, have been trying to find a suitable location for the new school in the neighborhood of Kenora keeping these requirements in mind - (1) Road connection with the railway and Kenora; (2) A water lot giving us access to the lake of the woods; (3) A considerable amount of arable land. For two days, Mr. Orr, government architect from Ottawa was with us. Altogether I spent four days exploring various sections. All our inquiries were south of the O.P.M.'s view of the fact that most of the Indians for the school will be drawn from bands to the south in the lake of the woods and because to go north would make impossible any boat connection with the Indian constituency.\n\n2. The Proposed Location - Nothing would be gained by a recital of the different localities we investigated except to give assurance that we had pretty well covered the area. We worked down the whole east side of Rat Portage Bay both from water and by land. We went out on the Indian Reserve 26 A. We went out along the new Winnipeg-Kenora highway as far as it is completed. We made one trip to the east of Kenora - rather to a little east of south and looked at some land at the top of said Indian bay. Our investigations on this east side were not more numerous because we thought it best not to go too close to the Roman Catholic School if a site could be secured elsewhere. However, we know what that side offers in the way of possibilities. Finally, after elimination of impossible areas, we settled on three possible ones. The least suitable an abandoned gold course about 15 miles from Kenora. It has road and water connection and some cleared land, but is deficient in water supply, very close to summer cottages, and terribly rocky. There is not very much good land to be had near it. The second choice is a piece at the top of said Indian bay. Again there is road and water connection although the road trip would be about nine miles. The land here is a very heavy clay a sample of which I have shown to the Department of Soils at Manitoba Agricultural College. There is not much land to be had in one continuous piece although there would be several pockets of it available. The first choice comprises lots 6 K and 126 P just north of the north boundary of Reserve 26 A. These lots are owned by Mr. Carmichael of Kenora. Our judgment and also the judgment of Captain Edwards is that the Carmichael property is by all odds the best location. Bald Indian Bay is a poor second, and the Wolf Links a very bad third.\n\n3. The Carmichael Property - Each lot has in it about 180 acres. The best land is a wide strip extending in a westerly direction on either side of the boundary between 6 K and 126 P. The vegetation on it is not noticeably different from other parts of the country except that certain portions of it is not so dense. There is a peculiar thin, smattering of spruce and in some parts jack pine. There is some shrub growth also and gravel patches are scattered all over it. Taking these lots together there would be a strip on the north side towards the boundary between 6 K and 6 K which is owned by Mr. Wagon which would be rocky, and on the south boundary between 126 P and the Indian Reserve 26 A, there would be a high rocky strip, but between these two rocky formations and extending west for at least two miles is a level piece of country. The soil is a\nlight sand loam. I have had it analysed at M.A.C. Both the heavy clay sample and this sample of sandy soil are free from acidity and test out about neutrality. Both are very definitely deficient in organic matter and the sand more so than the clay. However, the opinion of the Professor at M.A.C. and also of his field worker is that the sandy soil would be much better for the purposes of the school. It would need to be built up before it would yield the most satisfactory crops but so could the clay, and the sand would be much easier to work and much less expensive. It would grow potatoes and vegetables nicely. It would grow sweet clover and would increase the regular proper rotation for other clovers and oats. It is admirably adapted for berry culture. They suggested a regular three year rotation as follows - oat, sweet clover or red clover, vegetables, and as much as possible each year in the way of fertilizer.\n\nThere is at present a rough road leading right into the property. A settler on J.C. 69 has used it this year. It is not a good road and will not be for some time, but portions of it are good. It leaves Keewatin and follows the shore of Keewatin through the old golf links. There is a very bad hill just out of Keewatin and this is the worst obstacle in the whole road. By turning about a quarter mile of new road across the top of Slider Lake to connect with the Winnipeg highway, this hill could be avoided. On the property itself there is a good road good enough for a Ford although it is just a bush road. It runs from the lake back to J.C. 69 and down into the Indian Reserve where it joins the McKenzie portage and an old logging road.\n\nThe water connection is good. At Keewatin the dock is at the railway station and there would be no draying of freight and supplies from train to boat. There are no roads in this country that would lend themselves to the hauling of supplies or freight. Water must be the main means of transportation for years, and the road will be used at certain seasons for emergency work.\n\nConsidering this site from the point of view of the building, there are at least two very fair building sites on the Lake.\n\nFrom the point of view of the larger educational objective suitable for these Lake Indians the location has much to commend it. It is central to good fishing grounds. There will be wood cutting for years and as far as the school is concerned an ample supply is assured because of its proximity to the Reserve as well as by the wood on the lot itself. It would enable the school to grow a good deal of its own food supply. It provides the possibility of a large raspberry industry with an easy shipping point and probably strawberries could be cultivated too. The possibilities of a dairy industry in connection with the school should be investigated. Farming will never be a basic industry for these Indians. The country they live in will not permit it. Another possibility that ought to be thoroughly investigated is fur farming. If in the future, it is thought wise to establish a colony for the graduates of the schools between berries, furs, fishing, timber and garden plots, they should be able to establish themselves either on the school property or on the Reserve and have a fine chance to develop under supervision these and other occupations suited to the character of the country in a section that affords an easy market.\nNone of the land on this location is cleared, but clearing would be easy. One thing that ought to be carefully safeguarded is the burning of brush in order that the extent of mould damaged by the fires may be as small as possible. Every inch of mould on top of this soil is of very great value.\n\nIf Captain Edwards, or the Indian Department acting through some representatives, can secure this particular location, we feel that it will be the best possible.\nEnclosed you will find a map re the location for the Cecilia Jeffrey School. I think we have a very good thing in view. Now it remains to be seen whether or not we can actually obtain it.\n\nIf there is anything more in the way of information that I can supply, please let me know. If we had gone about a mile further south than we did go the day we were at the old golf links we could have been in the heart of this place we are recommending.\n\nI presume that you have a map of the Lake of the Woods with you or that you have easy access to one, so I am not sending one herewith.\n\nMy supply is limited.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nConvenor of Indian Committee\nPresbytery of Winnipeg.\n\nP.S. - There are some suggestions growing out of a study of the plans for the new building which the Committee here is working on. Just now and I will forward them to you at the end of the week. There is nothing radical, but some small things that we think might be considered as possibly designed to add to the effectiveness of the plant.\n\n[Signature]\nA. McMEEKIN, M.E.\nOntario Land Surveyor\nKENORA, ONTARIO\n\nKenora, Sept. 25th, 1925.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Kenora, Ont., Dear Sir,\n\nAccording to your instructions, I have laid out a road from the north limit of Indian Reserve 38A and do not hesitate to recommend it as a feasible road which can be built at a reasonable cost. The land is not difficult piece of country to make a road. The grades are not so steep as those from Kenora to Kenwatin and not so much rock except on the last quarter of a mile where the rock enters but is not difficult to make into a good road. The cost will be less than the average road for this country. I shall be pleased to go over it with anyone if you wish any other opinion.\n\nIn order to connect with the Kenwatin road I ran a preliminary line from the north-west corner of 126P where the Kenwatin road ends to the point where I started just east of the small lake. I thought it would be no use having a road on the Reserve if it would not easily connect up with the Kenwatin road. This is a hard mile and can be constructed at one-quarter of the ordinary cost. Rev. Mr. Freeman started at the same point but he followed an old tote road to the south-east across a muskeg and then to get back to the west he had to cross a steep hill. Then the distance also would have been much longer. So I tried a road south-east from the Kenwatin road and found an easy level course as I have already stated. I have worked on Rev. Mr. Freeman's plan the course I followed. The saving in distance is evident and will provide a better road.\n\nI am enclosing the field notes for the road. I have also completed the survey of the farm and will forward them in due time. Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcMeekin,\nOntario Land Surveyor,\n1925-09-25\nMap of the Northern Part of the Lake of the Woods and Shell Lakes, 1977.\n\nSketch Showing General Location Proposed for the New Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nThe school site is approximately 4 miles from Reo Point. For details re site see other sketch. The good land lies on both sides of the protege between Rat Portage Bay and White Porridge Bay.\n\nThe dotted line shows how road would be required.\nAugust 6, 1958\n\n(3) Land - The land lies on both sides of the portage from Red Portage Bay to White Cartridge Bay. The portage is short if all goes well. It is crossed by a road that runs east from the town of the road about ten minutes' walk east, and west of this road there is good land. We have three or four suitable sites for the school, one lying east of the road and north of the portage. There is probably good land extending for a long distance south of the portage. We will, however, have taken the area so that there is at least two acres of usable land available. The only thing I know we will want towards the west. The soil is clay with a very light overlay that the crops I had from Red Indian Bay, and there is a good depth of water on top of it. The timber is much heavier than on the Caribou property, and there would be no fuel problem facing the school.\n\n(4) The building site - The site on which we thought the building might be placed is about perhaps one eighth of a mile long, and it rises as it approaches the main shore by gentle slopes. It also breaks down to lower than the shore line at the base of the two bays, but is well above the water. It gives a very fair view looking north and east. There are a few number of trees around it that would make a park around the school. The two islands sticking out east from the point are small, but together with the passage between them did make another fifth of a mile. Our idea was to fill in the passages between them and the area a point about five miles long. All told so that there would be plenty of room for expansion. The passage between the point and islands is wide enough to allow for boats when the water level is high. At all times the bridge would be drawn up by a little. The passage between island A and island B is practically filled in and would be perhaps another five yards. Between island B and the south shore there is a heavy reed bed. This means that the inner bay is practically land locked. Our plans are carried out except for the passage between islands A and B. This passage will give ten feet of water and the boat house could be set back on the inner bay where there is always good protection. There is good deep water in the outer bay, and with a slight tide there should be no trouble with intake or outlet. The two islands in front would very easily be fitted up as a special section for the staff and would provide excellent, easy access to the main school grounds, and the very finest view of the lake.\n\nI would suggest the following:\n\n(1) That we urge the securing of this location. The government might send in a surveyor who would be able to block out the best size and shape of lot to provide for the needs of the school. This would involve the buying of about fifteen acres of new land. The surveyor could find it. (2) There should be at least five or six acres chosen where the school opens to provide for the school and additional purposes. This house may sitting area.\n\nI believe that the cost of clearing the land and building the required road will be much less than the cost of buying from Caribou and that we will have a very satisfactory property when it is completed. Captain Edwards and Mr. Hamill agree in this.\n\nPlease do all you can to secure action at the earliest possible moment, and I will be ready to cooperate from this end.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E.O.D. Freeman\nChairman Indian Committee\n\"United Presbyterian.\"\nSee Map of the Northern Part of the Echo of the Woods and Shoal Lake, 1917.\n\nSketch Showing General Location Proposed for the New Cecilia Jeffreys School.\n\nThe school site is approximately 4 miles from Kenora.\n\nFor details re site see other sketch.\n\nThe land lies on both sides of the prairie between Rat Portage Bay and Fort Frances Bay.\n\nThis line shows new road that would be built.\nKing Memorial Presbyterian Church\nConcord Ave. Emerson Winnipeg\n\nAugust 4, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nFollowing up the recommendations of our Proprietary Committee for a new location for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Captain Murray, the Indian Agent at Kempen, has been making enquiry, and I have a letter from him dated July 26th in which he states that on Caribouhead property, our Trustee, Mr. H. H. Murray, and the Old Salt Lake property at $4,000 per acre. Captain Murray has also said he will look into the matter, but both these prices are extremely high and Captain Murray suggested that another effort should be made to find a site by his own opinion is that there is quite something for the government or for anyone else to buy anything near the amounts mentioned for either property.\n\nAfter receiving Captain Murray's letter, I made arrangements to see the new site on the Indian Reserve No. 8 which is just to the south of the Caribouhead property. Mr. Vanasse went with me. I knew there was good land there for it was first place we had investigated, but we did not report on it at all because it was in the Reserve. I think we can now recommend a site which is really on the Caribouhead property and which we ought to be able to secure without any difficulties.\n\n(1) General Location - It is about 6 miles from Kempen, 1 mile from the school. It is about half a mile further than the Caribouhead property. This will give us the advantage of the easy drainage of Kempen, and yet be far enough away to avoid difficulties.\n\n(2) Road - I have walked over the route several times and found that the boundary of the Reserve goes to the north boundary of the property. Through the road is in very fair condition and could easily be improved, and part of the way through the Reserve. Through the Reserve, the road from Kempen to the property could be traveled with a team right now if one were received. In other words, the road from Kempen to the property could be made passable with very little expense under the urge of necessity.\n\nWe spent two hours walking over the site we propose for the new school, today. We found a road would be put through without much difficulty, perhaps two miles, so that it is quite possible to get there, and it could not be at all an expensive road in a short time.\n\nPoor Copy\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nWomen's Missionary Society\n(W.M.S.)\nPresbyterian Church in Canada\n\nToronto, Aug. 10, 1925.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHave had a letter from our Committee in Winnipeg, who are working in conjunction with Agent Edwards of Kenora, re the securing of a site for the new Indian School at Kawatin. Owing to the owner of the Carnichael site asking an exorbitant price, making it prohibitive, the Committee and Agent Edwards have again gone fully over the situation and have found a location, which they consider an equally good site, on the Indian Reserve, 38.A., only a half mile farther from Kawatin.\n\nFrom the drawing submitted it appears to have been carefully selected, having in view a building site, good water supply, a sheltered bay for wharf, easy drainage, with a fair amount of good land convenient for cultivation.\n\nWe regret that the purchase has been delayed owing to this hold up and hope that work will be begun without further loss of time. The W.M.S. heartily concur with the work done by Captain Edwards and our Committee in Winni-\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSec. Ind. Dept.

Clark of Toronto re proposed site for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School.\n\nI agree with Mr. Freeman, the only doubt in my mind is as regards the disposal of the sewage and the water intake but Dr. A. D. Ferguson, our Medical Officer is also official officer here and I am arranging with him to visit the site with me and give me a report on same, which I think will be favorable.\n\nThe site is on the Indian reserve and before anything was done the land would have to be surrendered by the Indians. I do not think there would be any difficulty about this, but presume we should have to pay them something, until the Department decides to do this I would urge that we provide an indication that the money will be paid them as a cash distribution instead of keeping same in their trust funds.\n\nShould the Department decide to go ahead with the matter I shall be glad to receive instructions so that the tenders be called to enable the Contractors to do a certain amount of work before the cold weather which would hamper the work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 14, 1955.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSurvey Branch,\n\nA site for the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School has been selected by Church and Department representatives and is entirely in Reserve No. A near Kenatin.

Before surveying said parcel he should take road survey from south boundary nearest to proposed site in order to ensure suitable roadway could be constructed without excessive cost.\"\n\nThe surveyor is expected to survey and post a road from the proposed school site to the north boundary of the reserve, connecting at that point with the present road to Keewatin. This work should be undertaken before the actual survey of the parcel is made in order to ensure that the road will not cost an excessive amount for construction.\n\nThe surveyor will be paid at the current rates for surveyors in that locality, together with all reasonable expenses. His accounts should be submitted to the Department immediately, together with duplicateouchers covering all expenses. His return will consist of field notes only, report of first patrol surveyed and report on the roadway location together with recommendations regarding probable cost of construction of roadway. His survey will also require compilation of a plat or corner on the boundaries of the reserve and will be properly described and plotted on the departmental plans.

MacKenzie)\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs instructed by your telegram and letter No.129-3-9 of the 31st ultimo, I have instructed Mr. McMeakin, O.L.S., to make the necessary survey and post the road as per instructed.\n\nI visited the site with Mr. McMeakin yesterday afternoon and have asked him to expedite the matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter #129-3-9 of last ultimo, Mr. A. MacKeekin was instructed as ordered, and has reported as follows:\n\nAccording to your instructions I have carefully examined the land on Indian Reserve 30A and find that a road can be made at nearly cost. I have visited other roads in the district and I find that this road will be easier to make than the usual ones in the District. I also had to find a new road to connect with this one that is one running North from Indian Reserve to connect with Keewatin Road. Do they wish this surveyed? This half mile can be made at nearly one third of the usual cost Mr. Freeman's proposed route would entail one mile extra at least, and a great part of it would run through muskeg. If you wish, I am willing to go over your road and you can readily see that this location is preferable by far. Shall submit notes in a few days. I think the site is fine and accessible by land and water.\n\nA. MacKeekin\n\nFrom the above everything appears to be very advantageous, and I have instructed Mr. MacKeekin to survey the two hundred or so acres required.\n\nIn connection with the road from Indian Reserve to Keewatin Road, I would suggest that it would be possible to have the Northern Development Branch do the necessary survey and lay out the road so that we should have no trouble with the owners of adjoining land through which we have to pass. There are several settlers on the route and Mr. Evans, the Ontario Government Representative has informed me that his Government might do the work for us providing we got the consent of Mr. Lyons, Minister of Lands and Forests. I believe they would put the road through without cost to us.\n\nAs soon as MacKeekin sends in his notes I will forward them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, 1st September 1925\n\nThe Department is about to erect a new Indian residential school on Indian reserve No.35-A, which is situated on Lake of the Woods, approximately four miles South of Keewatin.\n\nIt is reported to the Department that it would be necessary to have a roadway established in order to connect with the Keewatin road from the North boundary of the Indian reserve. As this roadway would also serve several settlements along the route, would you be kind enough to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Northern Development Board to survey and establish this roadway? It has also been reported to the Department that the cost of construction of the road would be about one-third of the usual cost of road construction in that district.\n\nThe Department wishes to go on with construction during the present season and while transportation is simple during the period of open water, it is of course essential that land transportation should also be available. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you could give me an early expression of your views in connection with the establishment of the necessary road.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Lands and Forests, For Assistant Deputy,\nToronto, Ont., Secretary.\nToronto, Ont., Sept. 21, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. A.

Toronto, they might even build part of the road from Eswatin or at least improve the present road without cost to us as there are settlers on this road.\n\nMr. McReekin also informs us that he has completed the survey for the land for the School and will forward the notes in due time, I have asked him to run this.\n\nI shall be glad to hear whether the Indians would have to surrender the land for school purposes or what arrangements should be made by me with them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 2nd October 1926\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to departmental letter of the 1st ultimo and also to your reply of the 5th of the same month, I have to inform you that while it is not imperative to the Department that the road be constructed during the present season, it is essential that the Department be assured that there is nothing in the nature of the holdings between the Indian Reserve and the proposed road so located as would prevent the opening up of a roadway through such property as it would be necessary to cross. It is presumed the patent to these holdings, if issued, contains the usual reservation for roads and that there would be no danger or inconvenience to school children out of school on the occasion.

It is the intention of the Department to obtain a surrender from the Indians of the land required and it is hoped that the band will see the advantages of having the school erected on their reserve and will grant the surrender.\n\nIt is noted in your letter of the 5th August that you state you consider the Indians would require a certain amount of compensation. If this is necessary, it is hoped that the demand of the Indians will be within what might be considered very reasonable limits. It would be impossible to distribute to them more than fifty per cent of the amount which it was agreed upon to pay for the plot.\n\nYou are requested to forward to the Department a valuation per acre of the land involved; should you not have sufficient accurate information to make this valuation, you may consult with Mr. Nockskin. As soon as Mr. Nockskin's returns of survey are received, a description will be made of the property and surrender papers forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F.

When my reading on base line was 134\u00b0 07' and should be as I now report 114\u00b0 57', also my sighted distance 1580 was 208\u00b0 00' and should be 183\u00b0 00'. I placed a ticket ahead of 12.83 claims at 12.97 on east limit to sight back to as I made it possible so I would not mistake it.\nA. McMEEKIN, M.E.\nOntario Land Surveyor\nKensington, Ontario\n\nI found that some work had been made so I went out again and made the readings as on my report but did not expect an error at 12.97 as it had fallen but registered at a picket back post.\n\nNow enclosing the field note of the first for they are I believe more accurate than the second for the picket had moved some. I hope you will understand my explanation.\n\nFrom this,\n\nA.M. McMeekin\n\nBox 876\nA. R.

Your notes are returned for correction.\n\nYour survey of the farm lot, page 3, bearing of course 1-2 has been omitted. The course 3-4 given as N.80 degrees E appears to be nearly N.10 degrees West. The angle off the base line on the point where the school is to be located, given as 90 degrees 45 minutes in your first note, and 131 degrees 17 minutes in your second note should appear, at 110 degrees 23 minutes, making the other angle 70 degrees 43 minutes. Your station 10, page 9, appears to use a point at 1.04 on station 9 to 0 but that is not clearly shown in your notes. Your North line of the school lot should show definite chaining connections to your road survey, the distance, station and angle should be given. This will enable the Department to check your work by closing the two parcels by latitudes and departures.\n\nI am unable to make your road survey check with the crossing given on page 2; perhaps there is a clerical error in some bearing on the road course between the S. limit of 126 P and the N. limit of the school lot. Your notes do not show that a post was planted at each angle of the road as called for in your instructions. Kindly note another the 47 chains distance given on page 1 of road notes is from the N.E. corner of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(T.B.L.

Would you be good enough to get in touch with him and impress upon him the importance of returning the notice to the Department with the information requested at the earliest possible date.\n\nEnclosed you will please find departmental cheque for $500.00 made out in favour of Mr. A. McKeen being advance on account of his survey. The balance of this amount will be paid when his corrected returns are received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J. D.

Now, I am at your mercy, I must run the instinct over all fit again and allow my ability to make a satisfactory survey. I have already been into these times, but I really must do it all over again.\nnot close with the Road Survey. They appear to be some distance off on my trail in their survey. I took an observation but do not know where it went, from memory in getting results, anyway. I sent the field notes. I did not run the instrument over the Reserve line, my west for 25 chain. It came in conformity with the few blazed trees that I thought it would be correct seeing you wished the results seeing you wished my first journey being my first attempt to do work for you, it was certainly rather an awful blame. There is nothing to the survey at all.\nThey do not fit in. I went over and checked over the Road survey and find distance and angles correct. I extended it on the ice to meet the east limit of farm northwest. I measured again the same distance and find them fairly correct. I checked over the course running over the ice and find that the corner is N18\u00b027'W instead of N18\u00b0W. I also double checked the line from the N.E. angle running S45\u00b0E in to the ice and stick into my post at N.E. corner of farm. Then I plotted but still is loose.\nDear Sir,\n\nSince receiving your last message through Capt. Edwards, I have endeavoured to straighten out my survey. I must apologise for not replying immediately when you returned my rolls for correction, but just about that time I had a great deal of work which I could not afford to pass by as survey work is very lucrative and has been disappointing for 1938 especially the earlier part of the year.\n\nWhen making the farm survey I did not check up with the Road Survey.\nJanuary 4, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nA very serious situation will arise if the proposed new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School is not ready for occupation next fall. As soon as a proper description is made possible, the surrender should be taken immediately and clearing commenced.

These lines are 86.32 Chs & 11.00 respectively.\n\nI re-measured the Reserve line again and find that the distance is 45.87. I found a post marked Indian Reserve at rather 1.0 P.

Before I measured with a 1.50 chain length and must have got mixed in the new length.\n\nI took the measurement for the Road course and checked all the angles and measured them and found them all correct.\nI also measured around the farm with a chain at feet and had placed in the note the chainages.\n\nI also have instrumentation for the first corner of the farm and find the direction correct.

The object of the meeting was fully explained to the Bands and they were recommended to surrender which they were satisfied to do, but they wanted to get $10 per acre for the land, instead of $5 as suggested which in my opinion is a very fair price.\n\nI had seen the Chief and some of the Indians previously and they seemed agreeable to let the land go at the price offered, but some advised them to hold for a high price, thinking the Department was compelled to buy at their price.\n\nRev. Mr. Sanderson was at the meeting and also Chief Redsky of the Shoal Lake Band (near where the present Cecilia Jeffrey School is situated, and these two also advised the Indians to sell.\n\nWe informed them that they had over 21,000 acres of land on their Reserves and that all we wanted was about 230 acres, of land that they did not occupy, and which was of no value to them, but an agreement was not reached.\n\nThere are about 44 male Indians entitled to vote, but we could only get 22 at the meeting as so many are away trapping.\n\nIf necessary another meeting could be called at a later date when more could be present, and the matter reconsidered, but I do not think we could get them together until Treaty time about 1st June.\n\nI would therefore suggest that the Department take the land, which they have the power to do under Section #11A of the Indian Act, paying them at the rate of $5.00 per acre, which is the valuation as placed on the property by Mr. McKeen, the only surveyor we have in the Town.\n\nIf we wish to call for tenders right away the above will be the quickest way to get action.\n\nBefore the meeting broke up, the Indians were informed that the Department had power to take the land, without surrender, under Section #11, and that in all probability probably this was what the Department would do.\n\nI am holding the surrender papers here and shall be glad to receive further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n129-3-9\n\nOttawa, March 5, 1926.\n\nThe Schools\n\nMr. Gordon Hudson and Mr. H.

I note that 28 of the 44 Indians entitled to vote on the matter refused to surrender. The Department is prepared to take the land in question under Section II A of the Indian Act, if such action is found necessary. At Treaty time, you should make another effort to follow instructions of my letter of January 8th last. You should explain to the Indians that the property has been valued at $6 per acre by Mr. Maclean, and as it is intended to use it solely for the benefit of the Indian people, the Department is not prepared to pay a larger price.\n\nIn the meantime, I wish to arrange for an immediate clearing of some 15 or 20 acres of the point on which the school is to be situated. You should ask Mr. Gordon Hudson and Mr. H. Westin, both of Kenora, to quote on this work. It should be remembered, moreover, that the successful tenderers will engage Indian labour as far as possible. Have the work proceeded with at once, and when you are submitting an account, you should attach the written offers of the two contractors mentioned.

It is also noted that although his account shows that two men were employed for half a day on the 9th September and although his total receipt shows men paid at $4.00 for 30 days, none of these receipts show any men receiving a half day's pay.

Hudson and Westin of Kenora for clearing the site of the new school on the Clearwater Bay reserve, the award to be made from Ottawa.\n\nWe inspected the school site on Saturday the 29th inst., in company with Mr. A. McMeekin, O.L.S., who is satisfied that the site chosen is most suitable for the building.\n\nNo action has yet been taken regarding the clearing, since nothing can be built until the ice goes out.\n\nI would therefore suggest that the matter of clearing be deferred somewhat, especially since the Rev. E.D.O. Freeman, convener of the school committee in Winnipeg, has promised to come and choose what he considers the best land for the garden, stable, etc.\n\nThe site for the actual school building is rocky and very lightly timbered, so that the clearing for it can be done in a short time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nR/A\nSir,\n\nOn the first inst., the Rev. E.D.G. Freeman came to Kenora and accompanied me to see the new Cecilia Jeffery School site. We decided it was inadequate to clear more than five or six acres, that being enough for the school building, the barn and a small playground, the remainder (to make up about 15 or 20 acres) to be cleared when the snow is gone and the most desirable arable soil can be seen.\n\nMr. J.H. Simons, who intends tendering for the building, was with Mr. Freeman.\n\nMr. Simons thinks the site is all right, although there may be some rock excavation and rather more concrete than usual owing to the character of the surface.\n\nThe site is not the extreme best, but a better could not be acquired in the circumstances.\n\nRegarding the clearing, the actual place for the building is not heavily timbered, and I would suggest the employment of Indians for this, on the basis of day labour, since the property is not far from this office, and the work could be superintended from here. Failing your approval of this suggestion, which I think is a good one, I shall ask Messrs. Westin and Hudson for their respective tenders.\n\nIf you decide in favour of the day labour plan, I should be glad to get a cheque (accountable) for $250.00 for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A\nOttawa, April 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-15 of the 6th instant, with reference to the site of the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

He tells them that the Department will take it anyway, and that they will get no compensation. The land is fairly well timbered and valuable even for cordwood.

Westin's price for clearing is $35 per acre and $45.00 for stumping and grabbing.\n\nFrom the above you will observe that Mr. Westin's price is the lower, and if the contract be awarded to him I would suggest the employment of Indian labour as part of the contract.\n\nWe could get the work done by Indians, involving constant supervision, and I would therefore suggest the awarding of the contract to Mr. Westin with the above condition embodied.\n\nI should be glad to know your decision in this matter, so that the successful tenderer may be notified from this office.\n\nProviding the estimates have been passed, it would seem to be in order to request tenders for building as soon as possible.\n\nDuncan C.

E.D.G. Freeman was here yesterday after making a trip to introduce the Presbyterian Missionary to the Indians on Lake of the Woods.\n\nIn discussing the new Cecilia Jeffery Residential School he asked me what had been done about letting the tenders for clearing and construction, and was surprised that no action had so far been taken.\n\nHe is writing the Ontario Government Agricultural Representative for this district for advice regarding the best part to clear for gardening purposes.\n\nHe considers the exact site for the building should be cleared at once, and tenders called for at an early date for erection of the building to let this be done in summer and not left until fall, when building is more expensive and the concrete liable to damage by frost.\n\nI expected Mr. Orr would have been down during May, but Mr. Bury says he does not think he will be down until July.\n\nKindly let me know what arrangements have been made so that I can inform the parties concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 24, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 20th instant, with reference to clearing the site of the new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. I have to inform you that the new building will not be proceeded with this year, as there will be no funds for the purpose.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Personally I think they have got a good price.\n\nTo enable me to get the surrender I had to premise a cash distribution this summer, which can be done from the Interest Funds without interfering with the Capital Account. I would recommend, accordingly, that the Rat Portage and Dalles Band receive a distribution of $20.00 per head, which can be paid them about July 15th, when I return from paying the bands up north. I should be glad, therefore, if you would send me a cheque for $3,100.00 to arrive here not later than July 12th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A Kno.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nI am returning the duplicate to file at the office.

R.D.G. Freeman, convenor of the Winnipeg Committee in charge of home missions, by Dr. Orr our district, by Rev. A.D. McKenzie of C.J. School, by Mr. Simmons who built the Sioux Lookout school, and myself. The Ontario Land Surveyor, Mr. Lukekin, also approved of it, and Dr. Ferguson approved of the facilities for obtaining water and disposing of sewage. The site was surveyed, and the Indians signed surrender forms.\n\nHowever, since seeing the new school at Sioux Lookout, and in view of the fact that the Ontario Government are building new roads in this district, and considering that the new school will be built for the Presbyterians and not for the United Church, I feel that the question of the site should be looked into again, as I am not wholly satisfied that the site chosen is now the best available.\n\nThe site chosen for the building is a narrow point which would practically be covered by the buildings. This site is mostly rock, and as the playgrounds, kitchens, etc., are semi-basement, the cost of excavation would be very heavy, so much so indeed that I believe its abolition would reimburse us for the cost of surveying.\n\nI have lately discussed the matter with Mr. Macdonald of Cecilia Jeffrey School, Mr. Robertson and Robertson of the Board of Education respectively, and Mr. Ordinarily, that since the Presbyterian Church will be the school, and has had no chance to give an opinion on the matter, its committee in Winnipeg be asked to inspect this site, and, if they think it unsuitable, to suggest another. For your information I may say that there is no church in Temora or Leamington representing the Presbyterians, these churches having been acquired by the United Church.\n\nThe matter might also be referred for an opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy\nDept. of Indians\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MRS.

In one or two letters that I have had from the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School she has commented that it might be better if the site were somewhere in the vicinity of Kenora or Keewatin, and preferably on the lake. I do not know whether the location is such that it satisfies the Department, but when the new school is being erected it should be placed in the most suitable place to meet the needs of the children, and also where there could be sufficient land suitable for cultivation, to raise the necessary food for both the children and the animals. I just mention this to you because it is now a new Board under which the direction of this school lies, and we would like to hear if the Department and the Agent on the Reserve are fully satisfied as to the location.\nOttawa, February 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 106-13 of the 8th instant, with reference to the site for the proposed new Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

I do not know if you intend visiting the McIntosh and Sioux Lookout Schools, but if so I would advise we go there first, as we can get there even if there is ice on the lakes.\n\nIt is very difficult to get a good site that covers all the points the school want, and I would suggest you ask the representative of the Church to get in touch with their local men, and be in a position to suggest a suitable site when they come and meet you here.\n\nI believe we can get anywhere by about the 13th May and would suggest this date for you to be here, but the weather is so uncertain it is hard to be sure.\n\nThe boats started navigation up the Lakes on the 8th May last year but they had to break ice.\n\nMake your own date and let me know where you would like me to meet you and I will arrange it. I have not yet absolutely decided on my dates of Treaty payments, but when I start, it takes 6 weeks, as we go about 1500 miles, and if left too late, we have such a short summer in Kenora.\n\nKindest regards, and looking forward to seeing you.\n\nYours very faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.

Lee\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, May 21, 1920.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI beg to report that on May 16th, in company with Mr. Edwards and the Reverend Mr. Patterson, representative of the Presbyterian Church, we made an inspection of the sites suggested for the proposed new Emma Jeffrey School.\n\nWe first visited the site selected two years ago by the Reverend Mr. Freeman of the Presbyterian Church located on Reserve 30A, a distance of approximately four miles by boat from Kenora. I examined the proposed location for the new building and found it would be impossible to erect a building on this site, owing to the lack of sufficient space, and also that the entire property was a rock formation.\n\nWe then visited the site on Poplar Bay, a further distance of about 1\u00bd miles by water and also located on Reserve 30A. On this property there is a good building site; the land appears to be suitable for cultivation, but at the present time the entire property is heavily timbered and a portion would have to be cleared, also it would require the construction of a road to connect it with the road leading to Kenora.\n\nWe then visited several farms on the main land in the vicinity of Kenora in order to ascertain if a suitable property could be purchased as a site for the proposed new school. The most satisfactory property was one owned by Mr. Smith and located approximately two miles east of Kenora on a small lake known as Kenora Lake, which is connected to the Lake of the Woods by Lawrence Creek. This site consists of approximately 150 acres, 80 of which are clear and under cultivation. There is on the property a farm house, barn and several out buildings, and the farm consists of two cows, three horses, three poultry, together with the usual amount of farm machinery. Electric power is available on the property from Kenora. There are good springs available for a water supply system and a very desirable location could be selected on which to place the building.\nOf the two sites above mentioned, the Gould property has many advantages. The cost of clearing 50 acres of land on the Poplar Bay site, and the building of a road would cost approximately $14,000.00, or $28,000.00 for clearing and $6,000.00 for the road, while on the Gould property 50 acres are already cleared and under cultivation, and there is a good road from the property to Kenora, and Mr. Gould offered this farm, including all buildings, stock, implements, etc., for $9,000.00.\n\nIf the buildings were erected on the Poplar Bay site, it would be necessary to install our own electric lighting plant, whilst on the Gould property, electric power is available. It is a great advantage to have electric delivery to the school, which eliminates the expense of installing electric plant and the high operating costs when the school is in operation. The Reverend Mr. Paterson and Indian Agent Edwards agreed with me that the Gould property was the best site available for the proposed new Cecilia Jeffrey School, and I beg to recommend for your consideration that this property be purchased. Dr. Ferguson of Kenora who is well acquainted with the Kenora district considered that the price for the Gould property was fair and reasonable.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nTORONTO July 10th, 1946.\n\nDr. L. C. Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am wondering what is being done about the new Cecilia Jeffrey School. I had a letter from our Mr. Paterson after his visit to look over sites with the government architect, in which he said they favored a site near Kenora. I have not heard anything further.\n\nI also wished to say that I have been elected President of our Women's Missionary Society and so will be giving up the secretariatship of the Indian work. Mrs. D. F. L. McKerroll, 19 Inns Street, Toronto, will be in charge of the department.\n\nIf you will let me know about the site, and then future communications can go to Mrs. McKerroll.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Helen M. Stinson)\nPresident.\nJuly 12, 1928.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in reference to the site for the new St. Cecilia Jeffrey School. Nothing definite has yet been decided upon, but I may inform you that Dr. Scott left for the west on Tuesday and that it was his purpose to stay off in Kamere for a day to look personally into this matter. I hope to hear from him before long, and I may be that I can then give you some definite information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H.M. Strachan,\nPresident,\nWomen's Missionary Society\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nKenora, Ont., July 13, 1928.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, M.P.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs instructed by you yesterday, I visited the Long property this afternoon with Mr. Ferguson, who kindly drove me out, and we went over the property together.\n\nThis property has a good clear-water lake from which water can be had for drinking and utility purposes. The owner informs me that he has about 10 acres, of which about 5 acres is cleared and a considerable quantity is under cultivation. There is a good barn on the property, but the residence and other buildings would not be of much use to us. It appears to us that the best site for the main school building would be on the side of the hill facing the rail-road and south behind the barn. There would be a certain amount of rock excavation, but I do not think this would be an expensive proposition. The land is good and fertile and we both think this would be a suitable property for the requirements of a school. The owner has some post-sets on the land but I think it would be more than the school requires. There is also a good gravel hill which the owner is willing to help himself, and he is willing to supply, free of charge, all the gravel which would be required in the construction of the school.\n\nAs regards the J.

The Indian Agent himself being away and a new clerk being in the office, I obtained the description from Mr. Long.\n\nUnless he has inadvertently omitted one parcel the acres which the Department would obtain is considerably less than 160 acres. Mr. Long advises me that his proposed way to sell the north part at Location 1722 and Location 338. The south part of Location 1261 is Parcel 4518 containing 72 acres more or less covering the right of way of the C.P.R., across this north part which contains 611 acres more or less. This property is subject to a Charge No. 18081 dated the 12th of June 1927 registered June 27th, 1927 in favour of the Agricultural Development Board for $2800.00 at six percent interest and also subject to a Charge No. 18082 dated the 27th of June 1927, registered 27th of June 1927 in favour of the Imperial Bank of Canada for $2700.00 interest at eight percent, which was to become payable on June 29th, 1929. Neither of the above charges have been discharged.\n\nLocation 266P is Parcel 5927 on Round Lake in the Township of Jeffray containing fifty acres more or less and is subject to a Charge No. 13066 dated June 4th 1915, registered June 7th, 1915 in favour of Alexander A. Hall for $450.00 with interest at eight percent payable in equal annual instalments in the years 1916, 1917 and 1918. This mortgage has not been discharged.\n\nI also searched in the Land Titles Office as to executions and found that none were registered as against Mr. Long. From information I have received, there is no possibility of a Mechanics' or Lien being filed as against the property.\nI therefore beg to report that so far as these parcels are concerned, upon the release of the mortgages above described, which would be done before handing over the compensation money, that the state of the title is satisfactory and that there are no tenants to be settled with. I also beg to certify that apart from the current farm taxes, there are no arrears of municipal, school or other taxes against the property.\n\nOn the return of the Indian Agent which should be before the end of this week, I will endeavour to secure further information as to what other property is included in the transaction, and will report on that in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHPC/OP\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lands for Indian Department, Zanora.\n\nFor your information I enclose herewith copy of a report received from the agent of the Minister of Justice in connection with the title of the property in question.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

E. Long property comprising Locations 258 P., North part of 128 P., and South part 128 P., all in the Township of Jaffray adjacent to Kenora, and of the buildings, stock and equipment.\n\n(a) We would place a value of $28,420.00 for the whole farm and buildings, including gravel pit on the property and stock and equipment.\n\n(b) And for the farm and buildings, stock and equipment, exclusive of the gravel pit, $19,420.00.\n\nWe consider these values very conservative. The gravel pit is estimated by Mr. Long to be worth $3,000.00; which figure we have placed on it as he is prepared to deduct this amount from price he has given you for the whole farm. The gravel pit is, in our opinion, not necessary for farm purposes as there is gravel elsewhere on the farm.\n\nThis property is in our opinion nicely located for your proposed industrial school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSeptember 10th, 1928.\n\nDear Captain Edwards,\n\nI have received a valuation from Mr. George A.

I have an interim report from Mr. H. F. Cooke, Esq., who made an examination of the title. In his letter he states\u2014\n\n\"Mr. Long advises me that his proposal was to sell the northern part of Location 123 P., and Location 256 P.\"\n\nHe also says, \"On the return of the Indian agent, which should be before the end of this week, I will endeavour to secure further information as to what other property is land used in the transaction and will report on that in due course.\"\n\nIt was our intention to purchase the property originally offered, which included the S. part of 123 P. Kindly interview Mr. Cooke and clear up this matter; also ask him to bring his report up to date.\n\nIt is our intention to purchase the property without the gravel pit and not to acquire the stock or implements.\n\nKindly let me know whether the services of a surveyor will be required for a proper description of the property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCapt.

On the return of the Indian Agent, I again got in touch with him with Mr. Long and find that the sale proposal comprised land of which Mr. Long had failed to properly advise me included another portion of land.\n\nMr. Long's sale proposal includes in addition to the two already reported on, the south part of homestead lot 13 in the Township of Jeffrey, which is parcel 1100 containing 67 acres more or less, generally the south portion of the location lying south of Parcel 6068 and north of the old right-of-way of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company containing 67 acres more or less.\n\nThe title is in the name of Mr. Wilbert E. Long and is subject to charges 19021 reported on previously in connection with parcel 6068 and 19022 reported on in connection with the same parcel.\n\nI might state that in conversation with the owner of the Imperial Bank, the bank's mortgage has been fully paid off. I have no information at present in connection with that of the Agricultural Development Board.\n\nI also searched as to executions in my former letter and found none. I therefore urge to report that so far as parcel 1100 is concerned, the release of the mortgage above described that the status of the title is satisfactory, and that there are no tenants to be settled with.\n\nI also beg to certify that apart from the current year's taxes, there are no amounts of municipal, school or other taxes against the said property. The addition of the parcel referred to in the latter will make approximately 100 acres of the land proposed to be sold to the Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa September 11th, 1928.\n\nB-5449.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lands for Indian Department, Kenora.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a report received from our agent in the above matter.

Peter Heenan,\nMinister of Labour,\nKenora, Ont.\nReplying to your letter \"129-3-9\" of 10th inst re new Scotia Jeffrey School.\n\nI have seen Mr. Cooke who informs me that he has now sent in completed report on the property which includes the S. part of 1227.\n\nMr. Cooke informs me that he does not think a Surveyor is necessary for a proper description of the property unless the Department is not going to take the gravel pit, as the full description will be in the transfer. Well in case of our not purchasing the gravel pit it might be advisable to have this surveyed so that it could be excluded from the transfer, as we do not know exactly what area is meant to be excluded as being gravel pit, as this pit covers a fairly large area.\n\nI have obtained a copy of Lessors Seagmiller and Toole's report and they give the area of the gravel pit as three acres.\n\nOur surveyor Mr. Fairchild expects to be in Kenora next month and he could survey the property if you wish providing this is not too late. Find out if you desire it there is a local surveyor Mr. Heskin who could do the necessary work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 18th September 1923\n\nSir,\n\nA survey is required of a farm in the vicinity of Kenora, known as the Long property, in the Township of Jaffray, consisting of Location 269 P., 50 acres more or less, the N. part of Location 132 P., 63.82 acres more or less, and the S. part of Lot 41 in 27 P., 67 acres more or less, making a total of 181.69 acres, more or less. The Department contemplate purchasing the whole farm with the exception of a gravel pit said to contain about 3 acres, the limits of which are to be posted.\n\nYour plan should show the limits of the property, with reference to the parcel to be excluded. Further details in connection with the property may be obtained from the Indian Agent, Mr. W. F. Cooke, K.C., Harbottle, Kenora. You will please commence at once on the basis of the limits area determined could be properly claimed. Your return should consist of a plan on tracing linen, accompanied by a list of all duplicates for all expenditures. For this service you will be paid at the rate of $15.00 per day.\n\nIt is necessary that the work should be undertaken almost immediately and if you are not in a position to undertake it at once, kindly inform the Department by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.P. MacKenzie)\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nAgriculture Branch, O.L.S.,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ont.\n16th September, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nWhilst visiting the Long property (proposed site of the new Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School) today, the owner Mr Long informed me he had heard nothing definite as to whether the Department intended buying or not, and he would be glad to hear as soon as possible, and also what if any the Department was purchasing as if we did not purchase the stock and gravel pit, he would like to make arrangements for the disposal &c of same.\n\nIn the event of the Department not purchasing the gravel pit and stock, could he use the barn and buildings until the new school was ready to be taken over by the Church? This would mean a great deal to him, as he has winter feed and supplies put up, and he would also like to continue living in the house until needed.\n\nHis sunflower crop is not yet cut and this will be on the exact site of the buildings, and if Mr Long could be given definite information as to what we are purchasing, and when we would take possession, he would make arrangements accordingly.\n\nMr Long says should an Inspector be required on the building he would be willing to act, as he is living on the property, and belongs to the United Church. I do not know if Mr Long knows enough to be appointed Inspector, but I would like the Department to appoint someone as we are very busy in the office, and would prefer not to take on the position myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.

It seems that this site is a very good one and in a place where it will be well seen from all directions. There is only one objection which has arisen, and to which I was asked to draw your attention, and that is that the barns are at a distance of half a mile from the projected site. This means that in winter the boys for carrying milk would have to go a distance of half a mile and back, and in the cold winters of that region this would mean real hardship. Could I ask if it had been the intention of the Department to build further barns nearer the School, or could the present barn buildings be moved should this site be the final site? I have been informed that the barns would be moved with difficulty to make such an idea feasible.

(The long site) or as it will be known here (The round lakes site) is a beautiful place and the site chosen will show up the buildings to advantage from the railroad tracks.\n\nIf you could get the contract let soon so that the building could be advanced enough to enable us to do the interior during the winter months it would help out the unoccupied situation some during the winter. If you want someone to value the land farm for purchase, I can recommend two gentlemen who will I am sure undertake\nNovember 8th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Keenan,\n\nI have given consideration to the accounts presented by Mr. Beagmiller and Mr. Taylor amounting to $34.50 each, making a total of $69.00, for the valuation of Mr. Dong's property.\n\nThe charge for this valuation was pointed out to me as being excessive and I took occasion to look up the fees paid in connection with other valuations made where the Department has purchased property for school purposes. Using these as a basis I consider that the most that should be allowed in the case of the Kamara property would be something like $100.00 each. Then this would be considerably higher than we have paid in the other cases above referred to.\n\nBefore tendering this payment to these gentlemen I thought it well to advise you and I shall await word from you before forwarding the cheques.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHon.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe covering Sand & Building Walks.\n\nI wish to state that I have tried out different methods for covering the sand and I have a plan which is working out satisfactorily and the most economically.\n\nI hauled loam from the bush near by and after levelling the sand I gave it a light coat of loam. We have had a heavy rain on it and it is holding up well. I purpose seeding this with oats and grass and clover.\n\nI am levelling the Lawn at the front for a distance of 50 ft. from the building and am making a gravel drive around the school. At the present time cars are getting stuck almost every day.\n\nMr. Paget inspected the work I was doing and he was well pleased with it. He considered I was working along the best line and he said he appreciated the great necessity for the work being done right away.\n\nMr. Paget advised me to ask the Department for a grant of $500 towards finishing the work. I can engage teams more easily now before the haying sets in.\n\nI would greatly appreciate this grant as I would like to complete the work as soon as possible.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your 108-15 of the 25th instant and relative to preparing the site around the new building, I have to enclose, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The sight lines approaching from the south are fairly satisfactory. Approaching from the north the view line to the east at 150 feet from the track is obscured by small trees and brush on the top of high land. The view to the west, while not so short, is somewhat obscured by a house and some trees.\n\nAn improvement in the view can be made on both sides of the highway in these angles and advance warning signs placed on the highway 300 feet from the track in either direction would be a help and we would recommend that this be done.\n\nThe Ry. Company installed a second Whistle Post as per Order 42169 and the Whistle Sign is given a second time which is a further help.\n\n(SGD) Geo.

Carruthers, clerk of the Municipality of Jeffrey, Ontario. In this letter it states, \"Mr. Henry Weiss, Chairman of the Roads, informs me that the school are obstructing the road to the north of the school property and wishes to have the obstruction removed.\" He states the road was laid out by the municipality some few years ago and some $300 has been spent. The properties in the district carry a clause in the titles reserving 5% for roads, and this road was agreed on by the original owner. He would be obliged if you would not obstruct it in future.\n\nI got in touch with Crown Attorney Cooke, who acted for us in connection with the transfer of this property and whilst I was in the office he called up the previous owner, Mr. Long, who informed us the road was built about four years ago. The Council asked permission to put the road through as far as Adam Weiss' place and Mr. Long consented but the road was only carried through part of the way to Henry Weiss' and then stopped. The agreement was not carried out. There was no agreement made in writing which the Crown Attorney informs me is absolutely necessary and apparently not even a verbal agreement was fully carried out. Already more than 5% of this property has been taken up by roads, and there is a gate on this road which is not a public thoroughfare. Crown Attorney informs me that the road could be closed by us at any time as a road could easily be made on the property adjoining. I do not think, therefore, we should do anything further in this matter, but I shall be glad to get your views. I do not think the Principal has any objection to people using the road providing they keep the gate closed but the objection seems to be that we have built a pigsty close to the road. In my opinion this does not do any harm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 22nd October 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant regarding the road on the school lands at Cecilia Jeffrey School and in reply I beg to say that no mention of this road appears to have been made in the title; therefore, the Department is not aware that such a road exists, and cannot consider it to be a public road. I may state further that the Department would be forced to object to the road being placed in the location mentioned as it might become a menace to the school property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

Price asked $16000.\n\n\"B\" Land adjoining on the North, Owned by Henry Wise. 60 acres well improved. Approximately 300 cords of wood. 1/4 mile frontage on Rabbit Lake. Beautiful lake, clear water, sandy beach. Price asked $12000.\n\n\"C\" Land adjoining on the West. Containing 48 acres. 20 acres improved. About 1000 cords of wood. Land very suitable for pasture. Never failing spring in the centre of the property. Very fertile soil. Price asked $4000 but will accept now $3000. Owner forced to sell.\n2\n\nis well cleared of both stumps and stones. There is a part of this land adjoining the school property and cut off by the road and this would make a very suitable Hog Run.\n\nProperty \"C\" is a cheap property and admirably adapted for pasture. Our stock can have access to it by just crossing over the road. It is very fertile soil and has approximately 1000 cords of wood. The owner asked $4000 but finally agreed to accept $3000. He is obliged to sell.\n\nWe should have all the three properties to make a complete unit. We would then have sufficient land for pastures, hay, feed and vegetables. We would also have sufficient land to make it worth while to engage a competent Farmer.\n\nI have numbered the properties according to the desirability of owning but \"C\" is the cheapest.\n\nI hope the Dept. will see its way to purchase the three as the present school property has very little value as farming land.\n\nI am enclosing a description of the properties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEw. [Name] Principal.\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont., Nov. 17, 1919.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe the purchasing of more land for school purposes.\n\nI wish to state that there are three properties available and owing to the fact that so much land in this district has ridges of rock creeping out making a lot of the land unfit for cultivation it would require the three pieces to make a farm large enough so as to make it worthwhile to engage a farmer to run it.\n\nThe three properties which I will describe later are very desirable and are very conveniently located to the school. Property No. \"A\" is located on the East and has on it a Pine Woods which serves as a beautiful background to our property. It would be tragic should the owner ever cut it down. Also the owner has a private road running through our farm-yard which is very objectionable. It is very desirable that the school own this property.\n\nProperty \"B\" is owned by a brother of A's and I believe a better price could be arranged through a joint offer for the two properties. I believe $25000 would buy the two.\n\nThis property has a lot of good land and has a very valuable lake frontage all sandy beach. This frontage will be valuable for summer cottages. There is also a good gravel pit on this property within a quarter mile from the school. The land\nNovember 16th, 1929\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in connection with acquiring more land. Both Mr. Orr and Mr. Ferrier have seen the property and know the necessity for getting more land. Also, it will be too bad if the trees at the back of the school are cut down as it would destroy the beauty of the place. I do not know if the Department will approve of the purchase of any or all of these properties, but it would be a great thing if they could be got. The Principal has taken the matter up now so that if the Department were willing they could include it in the estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 22, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 16th instant, with enclosure from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, relative to the advisability of securing more land. I doubt if the Department could give serious consideration next year to the acquisition of the land purchased last year which was valued at approximately $15,000 and $12,000, respectively. It may be possible, however, to include an item of $3,000 in our Estimates for parcel No. C which, I note, may be thrown on the market immediately. This is the parcel adjoining the school on the west, containing 40 acres, 20 of which are improved. The Principal reports the land is very suitable for pasture, that there is a never-failing spring on it and approximately 1000 cords of wood. Mr. Byers states the soil is very fertile.\n\nYou might discuss this with the Principal and let me have your opinion about the advisability of securing this last mentioned parcel next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Government, Capt. Edwards and myself.\n\nMr. Lyons thought the Provincial Govt. would do something towards the road and he was also going to ask the Dist. Govt. to assist. It was proposed to secure the Town Compressor and put on about 15 men from the Town and carry the work on for about 6 weeks.\n\nBy way of encouragement to the interested parties it was the opinion of the meeting that if the Dept. of Indian Affairs made some contribution towards it it would strengthen their hands.

Jan. 29th, 1929.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe three pieces of land adjoining School Site.\n\nI wish to state that I received some inside information which if it materializes will greatly enhance the value of the property # B\", the land on the north owned by Henry Wise.\n\nThe Marcus Brooks, I am informed, have secret plans to erect a factory on Rabbit Lake so as to utilize this lake for a reservoir. The farm above has a half mile frontage on this lake and should a factory be built the land around the lake will be taken up as building sites.\n\nMr. Wise does not know of this scheme and I approached him yesterday for his lowest price. He quoted me $1800 but I feel an offer of $1000 would buy the land. At the rate land is selling around here this is a reasonable price.\n\nI would like to state that there is a small piece of land on the south boundary of the school property which is isolated from the rest of the farm by a very high ridge of rocks. In order to reach this piece we have to go a distance of 2 1/2 miles and it does not pay to farm it. There is only 3/4 acre clear. John Gould made an offer of $100 an acre for it and is anxious to get it. I think probably the Dept. could realize $500 for the strip beyond the ridge. If so it would be well sold.\n\nI hope the Dept. will favorably consider the purchasing of the Wise farm. We require it for feed and vegetables and it is very favorably situated for us. Should the above plans re factory materialize the property could not be bought.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJanuary 29th, 1930\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter #129-3-9 of the 22nd November last relative to the advisability of securing more land for the Cecelia Jeffrey School. The Principal of the school is particularly anxious to secure parcel B, referred to in your letter. He thinks this could now be purchased for $1000 but has heard confidentially that there is a possibility of the Backus Brooks Company building a sawmill factory at Rabbit Lake in the neighborhood of this parcel. If so the property would be worth a very great deal more than is asked and if the owner heard of this there would be no possibility of purchasing at the present time. He therefore asked me to again inquire if this parcel could not be purchased for the school. He says if this is done it might be possible to get the school authorities to purchase parcel \"C\" and he also might be able to sell three or four acres of the present site which is not required for the school owing to it being mostly rock, for about $500. This could be applied, of course, to the purchase of any further property the Department would purchase for him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nI have as yet no copy of the C.J. School Report. Kindly send one for myself the Principal.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. FRANK EDWARDS,\nINDIAN AGENT, KENORA, DATED JANUARY\n27th, 1930.\n\nMr. Byers has also written you in connection\nwith the highway between the school and the town\nof Kenora. The road is in very bad shape and I\nunderstand was originally built by the Provincial\nGovernment as the Municipality of Jeffrey and Melick\nhad no funds. They are in the same state now, and\nthe only way to get the road done is through either\nthe Provincial or Dominion Government. Mr. Byers\ninformed me this morning that Mr. Lyons, District\nEngineer for the Northern Development Company,\ninformed him that the Province would pay 50% of the\nwork if the Department or the Dominion Government\nwould pay the other 50%. I understand the total\ncost would amount to $6,700. I do not like to\nrecommend this matter myself as it might look as\nthough I were working politics in connection with\nit, but there is no question that something should\nbe done as to make the road better. The\nMunicipality promised to surface the road and\nmaintain it. I shall be glad to hear further from\nyou in this connection.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nJanuary 29th, 1930\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of yesterday's date re expenditure on the road to the Cecelia Jeffrey School, a letter has been received from the District Engineer of the Northern Development Branch advising us that the Hon. Wm. Finlayson, Minister of Lands and Forests of the Department of Northern Development is quite agreeable to go ahead with the construction of the Round Lake road if the Indian Department will undertake half the cost.\n\nIn your letter #129-3-9 of the 25th instant to the Principal of the school you say there may be a possibility of doing something on this work later on. Before wishing to know if an amount could not be put in the estimates so that something could be done in the Spring as the road is in bad shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 27th and 28th ultimo, with reference to the highway between the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School and Kenora. I note that it will cost approximately $1,000 to put this road in good condition and that the Provincial Government will pay one-half the cost. I regret there are no funds available for this purpose this year. Our estimates, of course, have been closed for some weeks.\n\nI have also your letter of the 29th ultimo, with enclosure, concerning Mr. Byers' wish to secure land to the north of the school owned by Mr. H. Wise and described in earlier correspondence as Parcel B. I note that this could be purchased for approximately $10,000 and that it would be advisable to secure it at an early date. In reply I regret to state that the Department has no funds for the purpose at the present time. Parliament, at this coming session, is being requested to vote $5,000 for the purchase of Parcel C. In connection with this last named lot, it might be advisable to have Mr. Byers secure an option on it without delay. If a better price than $5,000 can be secured, he should do so.\n\nConcerning Parcel B., valued at $10,000, I believe that the Principal should ask the church authorities if they would finance the purchase.\n\nI note that there is 5 acres in the southern part of the present school site, which is isolated from the rest of the farm. A very good range, that could be sold for approximately $100 an acre. Unfortunately, if this were sold, unless in a trade for other land desired by the school, the purchase price would go to casual revenue and be lost to Indian Education. In other words, it could not be applied on the purchase price of another parcel.\n\nI am enclosing, for your office and for the Principal of the School, blue prints showing the property of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, tinted in pink.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have to request that you will state the name of the owner of this property and give a description of it.

I have now to recommend the purchase of Mining Location 270 L., Township of Jeffreys, District of Kenora, comprising 47 acres. This parcel adjoins the school site on the west. Twenty acres of it is improved and the whole is very suitable for pasture. There is about 1000 cords of wood on the property and a never failing spring. The soil is very fertile. The original price was $4,000; but, as it is necessary for the owners to sell, they will now accept $3,000. An option has been secured by the Principal. The property is owned by Amelia Brinkman and her son-in-law, Herbert Wolfe.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 22nd instant, enclosing certificate of ownership and option in connection with property owned by Amelia Brinkman and Herbert Wolfe.

Arrangements could be made with the Indians to take out a number of cedar posts from the Rat Portage Reserve, #6B this Spring, at a price of about 18\u00a2 or 20\u00a2 if the Department will give the necessary authority and pay for the posts for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nMemo. Mr. Varner:\n\nThere would be no objection to authorizing Agent Edwards to issue a band permit for 2500 posts to be cut by the Rat Portage Indians from their reserve No.36B.\n\nAs the posts are for the use of the school, the Department would waive collection of the usual dues.\n\nPerhaps you would prefer that the agent supervise the cutting of these posts under contract and deliver them at the school\u2014the Department bearing the expense of cutting and hauling.\n\nThis in my opinion would be a better plan than merely approving of a contract made between the school principal and the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervisor Indian Timber Lands.\n\nIt is not likely that the Indians will be inclined to get these posts out until next fall or winter.\nOttawa, April 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School to be supplied with 2,500 cedar posts to complete the fencing around the school property.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may issue a band permit for the cutting of the above number of cedar posts from the Red Portage Reserve No. 35B and, as the posts will be used by the school, the department would waive collection of the usual dues. You should arrange to supervise the cutting of the posts under contract, and have them delivered at the school where required. This Department will bear the expense of the cutting and hauling. The total cost of the posts, delivered, should be kept within the estimate as mentioned in your letter.\n\nIf these posts are really required to have the fencing done this Spring, you may arrange to have them cut and delivered as soon as possible.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department as to the quantity of fencing that it is intended to carry out, also the type of same, and the labour that can be performed by the school management in putting up the fencing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have surveyed the property and find that there is good title in fact, free of encumbrances to the property, as shown on certificate of ownership sent with the plan, even with the title however, as shown on the certificate, the original parcel contained 47 acres. Some small portion of this has been, as you will have noted, reserved for a road and in the opinion of the Master of Titles has now become vested in the Municipalities of Jeffrey and Hollick. For your information, I have made a sketch of the plan in the Land Titles Office which I enclose herewith. On the small sketch on the left of the sheet you will find the whole parcel shown. The roadway shown on the other sketch of the land only affects the south portion of the property. In view of the exception however, I deemed it wise to obtain your instructions before proceeding further with the matter.

Much of the labour should be done by the school staff and the older boys, without cost to the department. Further, I consider that one tennis court would be sufficient.

This was a statutory condition in making surveys of mining and farm locations at that date, and the patent to the location does not include this one (1) chain strip of land, although in the description in the patent, it calls for a reservation of one (1) chain along the shore, which in my opinion, was quite unnecessary, insomuch as the location itself did not include the same.\n\nIn organized municipalities this is dedicated as a road allowance, and is dealt with by the municipality in the same manner as other roads within their limits. The Municipal Act gives the municipal authorities authority to close up and dispose of any road or road allowance, but where the same border on a lake or river, the by-law is not in force until it has received the consent of the Lieutenant\n\n(A.

No. 106-18\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing notification from the Clerk of the Band, Jeffrey and Valliott that the Council have passed a resolution agreeing to the granting of a lease to the Department of the gift road reservation on the shores of Lake Erie adjoining the property of the Cecilia Jeffrey school, it would appear that a copy of the Bylaw stopping up this road, for the purpose of leasing it to this Department should be forwarded by the Municipality to the provincial authorities with the request that it be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council as required by Sub-Sec. 3 of Sec. 485, Chap. 253, Revised Statutes of Ontario. When this approval has been received, it would then be in order for the Municipality to issue leases. Under Section 485 1C, the Municipality has the power to make this law and Sub-Sec. 3 sets forth that this action could take effect until it has been approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\n\nYour letter does not state what terms the Company proposes to insert in the lease. Kindly forward this information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRenor., Ont.\n\n(A.Y. Wootenzie)\nSecretary\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont. Sept. 30th,\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe the purchase of additional land for the school.\n\nIn a previous letter to the Dept. I referred to two parcels of land\u2014one adjoining the school property on the North and the other on the East.\n\nThe parcel of land on the North was referred to as \"B\".\nThe parcel of land on the East as \"A\".\n\nThese two were valued at $12000 and $16000 respectively. I believe at the present time these could be bought at a much lower figure particularly parcel \"B\" as the owner's wife will not live on the farm. I would suggest an offer of $9000 for \"B\" and $14000 for \"A\".\n\nThese two parcels are owned by two brothers and probably an offer for both pieces could be reduced.\n\nIt would be a great advantage to the school to own these pieces as owing to so much land being covered with rock we have very little for cultivation. We have been compelled to go 7 miles to rent a piece. It is also a great advantage for the run of stock. Then too the owner of parcel \"A\" has been crossing our land and is very sore because I put up a gate. Every time I close the gate he comes along and opens it. There is also a beautiful setting of Pines on \"A\" just to the rear of the school property thus forming a beautiful back-ground. It would be a great loss to the school if this should be cut down.\n\nFrom present indications these lands will increase in value.\n\nI shall greatly appreciate the purchase of these two pieces.\n\nI remain,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School. He wishes the Department to purchase more land. This matter has been taken up before but I am forwarding the letter to you for your consideration.\n\nI also enclose letter from the Principal re Fordson Tractor for your consideration.\n\nAlso letter asking authority to exchange the old team of horses for a new team, at a cost of about $400.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 15th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in which he requests that the Department obtain two additional parcels of land, one adjoining the school property on the north and the other on the east.\n\nIn this connection, I have to say that we have no funds available at the present time to expend in the purchase of this land. This requirement will be noted in our estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding the request for a Fordson tractor and the exchange of the old team of horses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The last action which appears to have been taken in this matter is set forth in my letter of the 7th October last to which the Agent has apparently not replied. Possibly the school authorities have not been receiving the same allowance and have allowed the matter to drop.

In letter above referred to the procedure to be taken in this matter was stated, and I should be pleased if you could inform the Department at an early date as to the action taken. It may be that the school authorities have not been having the same annoyance and there is not the necessity to obtain the lease of this road allowance.

Owing to the financial conditions I would like to secure at least three hundred and fifty dollars $350.00 for this year which will allow us to protect the work already done to enable carry out all he had planned for this year with this amount, but we will make it go as far as possible owing to present conditions.\n\nI shall greatly appreciate the receipt of a check for this amount in order to pay for labor and teaming in connection with the lawn.\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards is away on treaty and will be away for some considerable time, and I am taking the liberty of writing you direct in connection with the above matter.

It is also unsafe both as regards fire protection and the safety of our stock. When this road was without gates cars were frequently parked behind our farm buildings and were there until late hours of the night. We had a large number of hens stolen and had a hog killed with a car.\n\nThis road runs right through our farm-yard and we are unable to keep our stock within bounds.\n\nMr. Lyons went over the situation here and he agrees with me that the road is impractical so far as farming operations are concerned.\n\nFurthermore Mr. Lyons went over the ground with me and he finds that a road could easily be built to the rear of our property with a comparatively small outlay.\n\nI hope you will deal with this matter as early as possible as it is a very bad situation.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nKemora, Ont.

It is true that there is about 4\u00bd acres at the south east part of our land, which is isolated from the rest of the farm by a rocky ridge. As it is not really required for school purposes, the Department will consider Mr. Gould's offer. I shall get in touch with Mr. Indian Agent Edwards, who is being instructed in the matter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 106-13 of December 18, 1920, concerning the 14 acres, more or less, of the Cecilia Jeffrey school farm, which is isolated from the rest of the property.

This made a distance of almost 4 miles.\n\nAfter receiving the Department's reply I cleared out a road through the bush and by so doing were able to reach this piece of land from our own property. I had intended clearing more of this road this summer so we could have easy access to the land. I have this piece all cultivated and had purposed sowing it with alfalfa this spring.\n\nIn view of the above I would like to have this piece retained as part of the school property. With clearing it would give us approximately 5 acres additional tillable land and thus be an added asset.\n\nAs we now are able to reach this piece of land by going through our own property I shall appreciate it if the Dept. will retain it for the school.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMay 12, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

We had a big house built near the river. Now it is more than double the size of about 300. We had land of 10 acres and 30 acres sold for $200 each. He told me that we should be able to sell as much as $5000 worth. He has helped me to find a new source in thirty days. Now we have made arrangements for a big piece of land and we will be able to get it started and move our things to move there soon. We will be able to pay for the summer as I have our share of 9 and on credit and we will be able to pay. Let me know what you think and if there is a place to find. \n\nI am sure you will be able to help us out. We would put up here for our summer wood and also use for the winter. \n\nI love how we are not going to be able to stay here anymore. \n\nYours Truly,\n\nM.J.\nDepartment of Indians\n\nDear Sir:\n\nJust a few lines to let you know that I have been living in the house on the Indian School property for nearly two years and when I took the place over there was cedar post stumps all over the house and about half of them had to be dug up before I could get started. I have got the house all fixed up and the land around it is in good shape. I have also planted a garden and have a lot of food stock to eat during the winter. I would like to sell all my stock in order to stay on this place so I told Mr. Smith I would sell if he would take it at $250.00 for my three cows and $300.00 going to keep. One cow is worth $150.00 and she is only 8 weeks old. I am also a partner in a trading post.\nMr. and the school plowed up the land for their own use, and I believe it is now seeded.\n\nThe cedar posts on the property were placed there by the School when they purchased them for the fence and were removed and used as required by the school, they were not moved by Ryan.\n\nThe thrashing was done at the old barn near Ryans house, and a small amount of feed and sheaves were left there, but mostly later used for feed.\n\nThen Mr. Byers allowed Ryan to use the house, he informed him he could not use the house if he kept stock, so Ryan said he would like to sell what he had. Byers did not wish to purchase, but as Ryan was up against it and also needed the money to defend himself in the hay case Byers paid him $200 for the stock, which Ryan first asked $500 for. The stock was in very poor shape, as they had run outside all winter and had practically no care, also Byers did not wish Ryans stock to run with the school stock as our herd was registered tested stock, and Ryans had not been tested for T.B.\n\nMr. Byers later told Ryans boy that if his father wanted to get the stock back, he could have it for what was paid.\n\nMr. Byers also informed me that he allowed Ryan to keep hogs as he said he wanted them for killing, but he still has them, and it was Ryans pigs that destroyed the sheaves in the barn and spoiled the feed and bedding.\n\nRyan has a small amount of wood about 10 cords piled near the house, but this could easily be moved if Ryan is removed.\n\nThere is no building in which ice could be stored unless he has put it in the barn or outside under some old sawdust, and in any case it could only be a small amount.\n\nRyan and his boy got permission to cut wood on a farm last winter and have been hauling this to town and selling it during the winter, this has been done in the boys name, as Ryan has been receiving relief and fuel during the winter.\n\nMost of the above information has been got from Mr. Byers but I believe it to be correct, and I would suggest you write Ryan confirming Mr. Byers lettering and asking him to vacate, if you think another letter is necessary, and if he does not remove from the premises by the date mentioned, I should be glad to receive definite instructions to take what action may be necessary to get possession.\n\nMr. Byers informs me he is afraid of what Ryan may do if he is forcibly removed, and we would have to give the police instructions to see he did not set fire to the buildings or do other damage, and if we do not remove him now, it will perhaps be more difficult later on.\n\nI will be away on treaty payments until the 16th June, but mail will be kept here for my return.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Provincial Constable Wright informs me Ryan is an old C.P. Railway man, but that he owes so many people round Kenora, if he went back to work he would be garnished, so finds it better to stay on relief.\n\nRyan is chairman of the Kenora unemployed association.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter 129-3-9 of 20th inst., I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter received from Mr. W. J. Ryan of Kenora, which is returned herewith.\n\nProvincial Police T. Wright of Kenora, informs me it is well known that Ryan is a Communist, but they wish to keep this information confidential for their own purposes, although everyone knows it.\n\nMr. Dan McLeod Manager of the Essentia Lumber Company informed me a short time ago that his Company had great difficulty in removing this man from their premises at Herman, a Village near Kenora.\n\nSome time ago Ryan asked Mr. Byers the Principal of the School to purchase three cars of hay, he had shipped down. Mr. Byers did not want it and refused, however later, out of sympathy after a hard luck story, Mr. Byers bought the hay and paid for same by cheque, later he received a sharp letter from people who claimed they owned the hay, that the hay was not paid for. Mr. Byers refused to pay again and does not know how the matter was settled, but does not believe Ryan paid anything.\n\nLast fall Ryan borrowed Mr. Byers hay bailer took it out to another person's property, bailed the hay, took it to town and sold the hay, he was eventually brought up, and tried by Judge Dowler and given two years but the sentence was suspended, owing to his large family and hard luck story. Mr. Byers had a great deal of trouble in getting his bailer back.\n\nMr. Byers has been using the old house on the school property for Indians when visiting the school, and also for some workmen on the farm, but a year ago last fall allowed Ryan to use the house for the winter, and did not turn him out in the spring, and also allowed him to use a small plot of ground under a tree adjoining the house to plant vegetables, and also allowed him to use the house last winter.\n\nDuring the winter Mr. Byers complained to me that Ryan was taking wood from the property, and that he was afraid to say anything to him, and asked me to see Ryan, he said he had no wish to remove him in the winter. I went and saw Ryan, he said he had only picked up a few fallen timbers and promised not to repeat the offence so at Mr. Byers request nothing further was done.\n\nA short time ago at a meeting of the Board of Trade Ryan came up with a delegation of unemployed men and informed us they had just come from a Council meeting of the Town Council where they had requested land and land for the unemployed to plant gardens, and Board of Trade appointed a man to look into the matter make collections and see what could be done, and a number of the unemployed were helped in this way. Mr. Byers informed me at this meeting he had about four acres of land he could plant. The next day I saw Mr. Byers and informed him of this and he said Ryan had no land unless he figured on the school property, which the school needed for themselves, I advised him to give him a month's notice and tell Ryan he could not use the school land, Mr. Byers informed me he did\nOttawa, May 30th, 1933.\n\nRef. 208-13.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, reporting on the letter received from Mr. Mr. J. Ryan of Kenora.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Ryan has notified Ryan to vacate, on the 15th proxime, the old house which he has been occupying and, in addition, the Department wrote Mr. Ryan on the 24th instant advising him that it is not our policy to allow other than members of the staff to reside on school property. In view of the letters just mentioned, it is not considered necessary to again write Ryan at the present time.\n\nMr. Ryan exceeded his authority in the first place when he granted permission to Ryan to use the house on the school property and the Department expects that no such permission will be granted in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

In this connection I have to say the Department desires that this man vacate this property at the earliest possible date; and if he does not do so willingly, you may apply to a Judge for a writ of Ejection and have him removed from the school premises by process of law.

No authority has been given for engaging the services of a lawyer. As pointed out in official letter of May 30th, last, Mr. Byers exceeded his authority when he granted permission to Ryan to use the house on the school property. Under these circumstances, the Department considers that Mr. Byers should settle Mr. Cooke's account and it is, therefore, being returned for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc.\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRenora, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. MacMillan,\n\nThe attention of the Minister has been called to the case of Mike Ryan, who, with his wife and seven children, has been occupying, without permission from the Department or from any other source, a farm house on Indian property near the Presbyterian Indian Residential School, just east of Kenora.\n\nThe house is reported to be in a somewhat dilapidated condition, and has been occupied for at least two years by the Ryan family. Ryan does not have a very good reputation, and while the Principal of the Indian School is understood to be adverse to him continuing in the house, he is somewhat indifferent in the matter of moving to secure Ryan's eviction. The house is understood to be wanted for the use of an Indian couple.\n\nThe matter, it appears, was taken before Judge Dowler, and September 16th was set as the time limit for Ryan's removal. The Crown Attorney submitted an account for $25.00, which, according to the Minister's informant, the Department is not disposed to pay.\n\nThe Minister would appreciate a report from you, and any recommendation you may see fit to make as to the removal from the house of Ryan and his dependents.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOctober 5, 1933.\n\nMr. DICKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 2nd instant, with reference to Mike Ryan and family, who have been occupying a house on property belonging to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThis matter was first brought to the attention of the Department in May last, by Mr. J. Ryan, who wrote stating that he had been requested to vacate the house on the school property. The Indian Agent, Mr. Frank Edwards, Kenora, Ont., was requested to report. His reply showed that permission to live in the house had been granted to Ryan by Mr. Myers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. Mr. Edwards further stated that Mr. Myers had notified Ryan to vacate the house on June 15th.\n\nThe Department then advised Mr. Agent Edwards that Mr. Myers had exceeded his authority in granting permission to Ryan to use the house on the school property and he was further informed that it was expected no such permission would be granted in future.\n\nLater, Mr. Edwards again wrote the Department, stating that Ryan had not yet vacated the house, and Mr. Edwards was instructed to apply to a Judge for a writ of ejectment and have him removed from the school premises by process of law. A final report had been sent to the Deputy Superintendent regarding the matter, but, early in August, Mr. H. P. Cook, K.C., forwarded an account for legal services. This account was returned to Mr. Agent Edwards and he was informed that, as Mr. Myers exceeded his authority in the first place, in allowing Ryan to use the house, it was considered that Mr. Myers should settle Mr. Cook's account.\n\nThe information received by the Department from Mr. Edwards indicates that Ryan is a troublesome character and he should be removed from the property as soon as possible.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, October 7, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of June 20th, also official letters of June 23rd and August 5th, last, in connection with the eviction of Mr. Ryan from the house on the property belonging to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease state who engaged the services of Mr. H.

Ryan, who wrote stating that he had been requested to vacate the house on the school property. The Indian Agent, Mr. Frank Edwards, Kenora, Ont., was requested to report. His reply showed that permission to live in the house had been granted to Ryan by Mr. Byers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. Mr. Edwards further stated that Mr. Byers had notified Ryan to vacate the house on June 15th.\n\nThe Department then advised Mr. Agent Edwards that Mr. Byers had exceeded his authority in granting permission to Ryan to use the house on the school property and he was further informed that it was expected no such permission would be granted in future.\n\nLater, Mr. Edwards again wrote the Department, stating that Ryan had not yet vacated the house, and Mr. Edwards was instructed to apply to a Judge for a writ of ejectment and have him removed from the school premises by process of law.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Capt. Edwards:\n\nRe Col. Cooke's Account.\n\nI wish to state that I all along moved into the vacant house on the farm at the time was without a family of small children, and at that time was a respectable citizen. I also assumed that it would be possible to have someone occupying this house, as both the house and barn were situated very close to the railway and had been frequently used at night by transients, and I feared that this might result eventually in a fire.\n\nSome time after Ryan had been in possession of the house, the Mayor of Kenora, Mr. Carruthers, learned that I was going to have Ryan removed from the property and he prevailed upon me to leave him in peaceful possession. Subsequent to this I thought that I could be doing an act of kindness to permit Ryan to remain, and while there was difficulty in removing him I feel that he has rendered some service in keeping transients away from the place. Furthermore, Ryan has left sufficient windows in the house to almost cover the amount of the bill for eviction.\n\nAs it was merely an attempt to keep the buildings of the Department from being used as property, I feel that I should not be held responsible for payment of the above account, and I shall appreciate it if the Department will settle the claim, as all court transactions were instituted and carried out by the Department.\n\nAwaiting the decision of the Department,\n\nI remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours sincerely,\nOttawa, November 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, regarding payment of the account of M.

Ryan from the house on the school property.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 9th instant, which contained a copy of a communication addressed to the Principal.

Byers, Esq.,\nPrincipal Cecilia & Jeffrey Indian School,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Byers,\n\nRe: School Property\n\nI understand from information reaching me that in carrying on your school in an efficient manner you have found it necessary from time to time to rent additional property largely for the purpose of providing forage crops for the livestock used at the school. As you are aware John George who owns that part of Location 256 P lying to the south of the road through the location and has been carrying on there what is probably the most efficiently operated dairy business around Kenora. For personal reasons, however, he finds that he will have to give up his business and has instructed me to place his property and herd on the market. As you are aware George has bought this land to a very high set of fertility and I feel sure the land would probably be of more value to you than to any one else. I say this particularly in view of his exceptionally favourable results with alfalfa which should provide you with your necessary forage crops. This property also has the additional advantage of lying between the Town of Kenora and the new airport and the highway to be constructed to the airport together with the power lines etc., will pass the door. As to the property itself Mr. George made an application to the Agricultural Development Board of Ontario and was granted a loan of $4500.00 on the security of this property. As to the herd itself it is an exceptionally high grade herd for this District and if you have any contemplation of adding to your live stock might I suggest your consideration of these animals.\n\nMr. George has placed a price of $9000.00 on the property itself and a price of $10,000 for the whole plant including the herd as a going concern. This however, would appear to be more than justified by the valuation apparently placed on the property by the Agr. Development Board for loan purposes. Looking at the matter from your point of view this amount would appear justified as I am given to understand you are at the present time paying approximately $120.00 in cash rental of properties and a further property rented on shares which would\nEARLE C. POPHAM\nBARRISTER & SOLICITOR\nKENORA, ONTARIO\n\nRepresent about another $100.00. This expenditure capitalized at 5% would mean $13000.00 and as I feel satisfied that the George farm with its greater fertility would probably provide you with more forage than you are obtaining from all these other properties, the purchase of the property should I believe effect a direct saving. As Mr. George must know very quickly as to the prospects of sale of his property in order to make his arrangements for the winter months I would appreciate it if you would advise me as soon as possible whether you would be interested in acquiring the place.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School and one from Mr. E. C. Pepham, regarding the purchase of farm land owned by Mr. John George, and stating the price at which same can be obtained.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds for the purchase of further land for farm purposes in connection with the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. There is at present a fairly large acreage, which should meet requirements at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLenora, Ont.\nFebruary 9, 1924.\n\nMr. BICKARD,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 6th instant, with reference to acquiring a farm of 130 acres owned by Mr. John George, for the use of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, I have to say that the Department received a previous request for the purchase of this property.\n\nWhen the school was erected, in 1922, the Department purchased 176 acres, at a price of $15,000. Subsequently, in May, 1930, a further area of 47 acres was purchased for the sum of $2,000. Besides this, the school authorities rent other land for which, it is understood, they pay an annual rental of $500.\n\nThe farm which Mr. John George wishes to sell is composed of part of Location 286 P., lying north of the Canadian Pacific railway. Mr. George has placed a price of $9,000 on the land and an additional $1,000 for the plant and herd. He has been engaged in a dairy business. He obtained a loan of $1,000 on this property from the Agricultural Development Board of Ontario.\n\nNo funds to purchase this land are available in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year and no provision has been made in the Estimates for the ensuing fiscal year. The school has now a fairly large acreage, purchased by the Department, besides the rented land, and there should be a sufficient area for the use of the institution, until such time, at least, as it is possible to provide funds for the purchase of an additional amount.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 26, 1954.\n\nThe Minister has received additional correspondence urging the purchase of what is known as the George farm, for the use of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will find the previous correspondence and also your memorandum of February 9th last, on your File No. 129-54. According to the latest information obtained by the Minister, only 80 acres of the property owned at present, is tillable, and this is said to be insufficient to provide the milk required for 150 children. It is also stated that the Department has been obliged to rent each year, three different farms with scattered areas of tillable land; that the rental amounts to $750., which sum if placed towards purchasing the George farm would nearly pay for the same in ten years.\n\nThe George farm is said to comprise over one hundred acres which can be cultivated, and that owing to its close proximity to the school, it would be a valuable asset.\n\nThe Minister asks that you furnish him with a further report on this matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nthemselves, purchase any more land that the school may require to provide forage crops for the large stock kept. They now pay rental to the amount of $750 per year, and it would appear to be a good investment for the Church if, instead of paying rental, they themselves purchase the George farm.\n\nMr. Frank Edwards, the local Indian Agent, reports he cannot see the necessity of the Department purchasing more land, as, if the desired property means so much to the school, they should purchase it themselves.\n\nThere are no funds available in our current year's Appropriation for the purchase of additional land. However, should the Minister direct that the purchase be made and paid by the Department, it will be necessary to include the amount in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI shall be pleased to have the Minister's direction regarding the action he wishes taken in this matter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 3, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Ruskard:\n\nI have your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, regarding additional correspondence received by the Honourable the Minister, urging the purchase of a farm of 150 acres, owned by Mr. John George, for use of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nAs stated in my memorandum dated February 9th, last, the Department purchased a total of 250 acres for use of this school. In addition, the school authorities rent other land, for which they, themselves, pay the rental.\n\nThis school is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, who are responsible for all expenses of management over and above the per capita grant paid by this Department. The Department is also responsible for the upkeep of buildings and equipment - a considerable amount being paid for these purposes each year.\n\nThe Principal has gone extensively into the raising of cattle. He has heard of 40 cattle - a number in excess of the needs. Besides, there are 6 horses. I would suggest that the church authorities\n\n- themselves\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OF CANADA\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School\n\nKENORA, ONT. March 25th, 1935.\n\nCapt.

Northern Development.\n\nI wish to state for your information that the piece of land asked for is the best piece of arable land that the School owns. It is very fine, level and fertile. Further the field from which it is taken is small - approximately 5 acres, and a strip of this size is very important.\n\nI do not wish to put any difficulty in the way of this purchase but I do feel that it should command a pretty good price.\n\nIf the proceeds of this sale could be used to acquire another piece of arable land we would not feel the loss so much but we have such a small amount of tillable land that an acre and 1/4 acre quite different.\n\nI seek your assistance in his opinion of the valuation and he stated that in view of the location of this particular piece and the loss it meant to the field that it should be worth $800 per acre. You will probably recall that about a year ago Mr. Gould offered $500 for an acre situated over 1 mile farther out.\n\nIf this price could be realized and the proceeds used to purchase some land adjoining us on the east boundary which I am informed can be purchased I would from our interest in the transaction be in favor of this sale.\n\nProviding a sale is effected I am anxious to secure from the Northern Development an undertaking to give us free use of the siding for loading purposes and also provision for an entrance of at least 25 ft. in width on the North side of the strip, this entrance being to the part of the field left after the strip has been taken off.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.W.

W. Byers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. This letter, I may state, was sent forward to me by Mr. Hugh McKinnon, M.P., Federal member for the district.\n\nIn view of the prevailing economic conditions, I am not at all sure that the Government will be prepared to seriously consider the purchase of these additional holdings at the moment, nor am I convinced that this additional acreage is necessary. I am anxious, however, to secure all the information I possibly can, in respect to the matter. I do not know that it will be necessary for you to make an inspection of the property, but I do want you to feel free to comment upon the subject matter of this communication very frankly. You might state definitely what your opinions are in respect to the need for this land; the price suggested and any other information you may consider helpful. You will note that Mr. George is anxious to obtain a decision from the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nEnc.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nthough additional land were secured.\n\n\"The children attending the school are mostly from the bush country where farming, as we know it, is impossible. If these children can be taught to grow good gardens they will be a big step towards supplying their daily food. Some will learn to care for poultry and cattle, but I doubt if a home represented by the children have stock of any kind. The Indians are trappers and hunters. I am doubtful if a further investment of $10,000 can be justified and I am more and more convinced that the Department should not only limit the size of the farm, but also the number of stock. The interest of the pupils is often lost sight of by the desire of the Principal to operate a large farm with show stock. He aims to show a revenue, but unfortunately it is often on the wrong side of the ledger.\n\nI have already discussed this proposal with the Deputy Minister, but, in view of the limited funds at our disposal this year and in view of what Inspector Hamilton states in his report, it is not at all likely that the Government will consider the purchase of this land. If, however, you require additional information, I shall be glad to discuss the matter with you more fully any time at your convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Reay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\"\nOttawa, February 1, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI have before me, for consideration, a report submitted to the Department by Inspector Hamilton, in respect to the purchase of property adjoining the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School at Kenora. Mr. Hamilton's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I note the price is $2,000, and that Mr. George has obtained a loan of $4500. If this loan was taken some years ago during the high prices, it is perhaps now nearer the value of the land than the sum asked. The number of acres is not given, but personally I did not see a quarter or half section of land in the vicinity of Kenora I would consider purchasing for farming at such a price.\n\n\"I do not know what has been done in connection with the dairy herd at the school, the condition of which I reported on this past fall. However, I am of the opinion a small herd of from 10 to 15 good cows would supply sufficient milk for the school. I would suggest, rather than to increase the school's operation, there might be better to raise only the whole beef herd in this way keep the herd reduced to a minimum.

McKinnon, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\ngood gardens, it will be a big step towards supplying their daily food. Some could perhaps learn to care for poultry and cattle, but I doubt if a home represented by the children have stock of any kind. The Indians are trappers and hunters. I am doubtful if a further investment of $10,000 can be justified and I am more and more convinced that the Department should not only limit the size of the farm, but also the number of stock. The interest of the pupils is often lost sight of by the desire of the Principal to operate a large farm with show stock. He aims to show a revenue, but unfortunately it is often on the wrong side of the ledger.\n\nI hope I have supplied the information you need, but if such is not the case, I will visit Kenora and thoroughly investigate the matter in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nWINNIPEG, MAN. January 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter dated January 22nd, and to state that without inspecting the land and stock in question, it is difficult to decide what action should be taken.\n\nI note the price is $9,000, and that Mr. George has obtained a loan of $450. If this loan was taken some years ago during the high prices, it is perhaps now nearer the value of the land than the sum asked. The number of acres is not given, but personally I did not see a quarter or half section of land in the vicinity of Kenora; I would consider purchasing for farming at such a price.\n\nI do not know what has been done in connection with the dairy herd at the school; the condition of which I reported last fall. However, I am of the opinion a small herd of from 10 to 12 good cows would supply sufficient milk for the school. I would suggest, rather than to increase the school property, that it might be better to raise only the choice heifers and in this way keep the herd reduced to a minimum. If this is done, the land now belonging to the school could perhaps produce most of the rough feed required. The beef necessary can, I am sure, be purchased for less than it could be produced, even though additional land were secured.\n\nThe children attending the school are mostly from the bush country where farming, as we know it, is impossible. If these children can be taught to grow good gardens\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir,\n\nA short time ago Councillor Albert Kent of the Irlington Band informed me that he was going to start and build a house on the property of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School; I asked him if he had seen the Principal, and he said the Principal had given him permission.\n\nI interposed the Principal and informed him it was not advisable to allow any buildings to be erected on the school property without permission from the Department, and called to his attention the trouble we had before in evicting a man he had allowed to live in one of their houses.\n\nI have now received a letter from the Principal in which he states: \"Number of Indians have approached me with a view of obtaining permission to erect a log house on the school property in which they might stay when they visit their children. There is a location well removed from the school, and not in view from the building, which would be very suitable for their building. It is a level slope and cannot be used for farming purposes. A building would be a great convenience to the Indians and is needed to prevent the nuisance of being compelled at night to send them to the school overnight, which is not advisable from a sanitary standpoint. There is an Indian house situated near the Catholic school but it is four miles from here and is often filled when the Indians reach it. It also means the expense of a taxi to go back and forth. They are willing to do the labour among themselves and are anxious to commence work on it. I hope you will succeed in obtaining authority from your Department for the erection of the aforesaid buildings.\"\n\nI discussed the matter with Inspector Hamilton today, and he agrees with me it would not be advisable to erect an Indian house on the school property. I may state we have not allowed one to be erected at McIntosh or Sioux Lookout. Most Principals do not wish the Indians to stay so close to the school, it would probably be hard to keep them away.\n\nThe R.C.S. School at Kenora has permitted some Indians to erect houses on their property (school) but I think they should be instructed to gradually get them away. Dr. McMillan saw these houses when he was at Kenora adjoining the property leased to the Town of Kenora.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the suggested erection of a house on the property of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, in order to enable Indian parents to have some place to stay when they come to visit their children. Experience of Principals of Indian Residential Schools all over Canada show that erection of such houses encourages the Indians to come to the schools more frequently and stay for longer periods when they do make a visit. Such procedure, of course, is nearly always a considerable trouble to the school staff.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Byers that the Department does not approve the erection of the house mentioned in your letter.\n\nYou should also inform the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School that the houses now being used near that school should be gradually torn down.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. W.M. Lounsbury of the Department of Highways (Ontario) Toronto in which he informs me that the proposed Rabbit Lake Road will run through the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School Property, and it will be necessary for his Department to reach some agreement with us.\n\nHe wished to know what we considered reasonable compensation for the proposed revision, he would then prepare an option and have same forwarded to me for execution.\n\nI have obtained a tracing of the road through the school property from the Department of Highways, Lenora and have seen the Principal of the School.\n\nHe informs me that part of the road was constructed in 1937 and the other part is likely to be constructed at an early date but that it will not affect the school property nor will it be a detriment to them and no compensation is really required.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. Caldwell\n\nWould you please let us know whether we should be sworn to the oath? 1/1/38\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 31, 1932.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 14 together with plan, both having reference to the proposed relocation of the road through the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School property.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is the view of the principal of the school that no compensation is required from the Department of Highways, we do not propose making any demand in that regard. However, it should be definitely understood that following the relocation of this road, the lands comprising the old roads will become a part of the school property.\n\nFurther, in due course, it would be advisable for the Department of Highways to supply this Department with a proper plan of the relocated road.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nT.

I shall be glad to give your assurance that it will not be necessary for this Department to take any action with regard to the abandoned portions, because it appears the old road was never transferred to the Province, therefore, the province did not have title, in other words, I believe the old road was Dominion Crown Lands and they never actually transferred to the Province.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive a new Order in Council covering our Plan P.2317-7.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Chief Property Valuator\n\nH.

R. L.

MacGowan, who desires to lease or purchase a small parcel of land, indicated on plan appended hereto as P.1866, for the purpose of establishing a mink farm. It is stated that the land in question is of little value and is not used or likely to be used for school purposes. It appears that Mr. MacGowan is a young man of good education, a University graduate, who had intended following a professional career, but has been prevented from doing so by health conditions.\n\nI should be obliged if you would be good enough to let me have your views on the subject at your early convenience. Kindly return the enclosed plans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nDouglas S. Pitts, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nCecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\nDear Mr. McKinnon,\n\nI am writing you concerning a piece of land which lies alongside our property and which is a part of the property belonging to the Cecelia Jaffray Indian School. As you know, our property lies in a narrow strip between a large mass of rock on the north and the old C.P.R. right-of-way on the south. Most of this is stony and does not even make good pasture land.\n\nThe piece of land which I would like to procure lies in a strip between our property and the mass of rock and varies in depth from about 20 ft. to about 300 ft. It is mostly bush but there is one field of approximately 5/4 acre. This land is not being used, and has not been used, by the Indian School as it is so far from the Residence. As I mentioned above, most of the land is in bush and it is really in this portion that I am most interested.\n\nAs you may know Mr. McKinnon, I had to drop my plans to go through Manitoba Medical College, due to a permanent though somewhat erratic illness. My physician advised me to take up mink raising or some such occupation for a livelihood. I have chosen the mink ranching, but there is no suitable place on my father's land to raise them, due to complete lack of the shelter which they require. The bush west of the Indian School property would form an ideal location for the mink enclosure. If I do not obtain this property, I shall have to move further out beyond the reach of electricity, thus preventing me from enjoying the convenience of electricity in my future home, or on the ranch.\n\nI understand our neighbour, Mr. John Gould, is negotiating with Mr. Pitts, the Principal of the Indian School, for the purchase or lease of this land. As investigation will show, Mr. Gould already owns over 200 acres of the finest farm land in this district. We have less than 3 acres of arable land.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Edwards, the Indian Agent about this property. He stated that he was perfectly familiar with the piece in question, and realized how little value it was to the School, but that it was entirely up to Ottawa.\n\nI trust, Mr. McKinnon that you will find time to attend to this matter in the near future as I should like to get settled somewhere before fall.\n\nVery truly yours,\nsigned - Ernest L. McCammon, B.Sc.\nAugust 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should be much obliged if you would let me have a reply to my letter to you of August 5 last with respect to representations on behalf of Mr. Ernest L. McCammon, who is desirous of leasing or purchasing a small parcel of land for the purpose of establishing a mink farm.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nDouglas S. Pitts, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian school property which I would like to obtain as marked in green chalk, and consists of approx. 5 acres. This land is not being used by the Indian School and is approx. 5 miles from the school by the road they have to use to get there.\n\nE.M.C.\n\nRock Mesa\nIndian School Property\n\nField\nApprox. 1/4 acre\n\nIndian School Property\n\nRough land suitable for pasture only.\n\nOld Canadian Pacific Railway Line\nEnough for Errors.\n\nThis particular piece of land is at a distance from the School and so is awkward to get at. It would be of considerable more value to either Mr. Johnson or Mr. Smith.\n\nBut we are in great need of farming land. Of our 250 acres, only 150 acres can be used to rent land every year. At present of a farm of 150 acres which we rent, only 45 acres are arable. (About 30 acres are used for crops.)\n\nThis past week I have approached neighbors to see if they have any small pieces of land to sell. Unless we can get extra land elsewhere and nearer to the School we will not be able to use our 150 acres (pasture, woods, etc.) in selling this land.\n\nOne neighbor who is willing to sell, has a parcel of 60 acres including pasture. He is prepared to sell part of south part of property but does not know what price he wants, because it is the balance of an estate with several heirs.\n\nYou see my views, Sir. We need land. Therefore if we sell any (even if awkward to get at,) we should purchase more nearer to the School.\n\nAn alternative suggestion would be that we rent a small piece of land to Mr. Johnson keeping the school and part of the pasture. As basis for this suggestion may I submit the following information:\n\nThe Municipal Assessor thinks that the land would be assessed by him for $250 and $350 depending on what it is to be used for. It might be worth about $500. Therefore if rented should bring us the rent of $250 (or $350) and the land would be worth $500. This would somewhat offset our present rental of $125. (One hundred and twenty-five dollars) for the above mentioned 45 acres which we rent.\n\nHoping that this information may be of some assistance to you in reaching your decision,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret that my delay in answering your letter of Aug. 25th necessitated your letter of Aug. 30th. The latter was received by me while I was away on a visit to the Reserve but mainly on my desire to investigate carefully every angle of this request.\n\nHere follows my report and views:\n\nFirst of all, I should like to clear up some mistakes which were too flagrant to overlook, in the representations to your office.\n\n1. The part he seems to put in question (in the section upon which the School and all our buildings are built), but the South part of S.pt. 12PP consists of 46 acres.\n\n2. The small field shown in his diagram (hand-drawn) is not the same as the field I have more than 15 acres of good soil (comparatively).\n\n3. We have used it every year since I have been here and find that it was used every year before. Any cleared land is used for firewood here.\n\n4. No-called land in diagram is fertile soil (not cleared and not used). It is a good pasture line and will be used which may be cut in future years. At present it serves as pasture. It is also productive.\n\n5. North Base. Useless for farming but does grow some pine and no far for fire wood.\n\n6. South Base. Useless for farming but does grow some pine and no far for fire wood.\n\n7. Small field adjoining our S.pt. 12PP with S. pt. 12PP.\n\nI also think that you would be interested in his opinion. This opinion is: Should we have just acres from the small field tried and planted this place for pasture or for farm and for garden. I enquired and found that your department had already decided that this place was useless and of the same mind. (Department letter 129-3-3 of March 27th.)\n\nMcKennon is a brother-in-law of J. Boyd and knew his strong desire for a school and was willing to give anything toward it. (McKennon did attend University but was not a graduate.)\n\nSupt'd Pg. 8.\nMr. Pitts mentioned that Mr. MacCannan is a brother-in-law of Mr. J. Gould, the other applicant for the same property. It is noted that Mr. Gould applied in 1905, but the application was refused as the school management was unwilling to part with any land.\n\nMr. Pitts advises an alternative suggestion that a parcel of land might be purchased by the school and that the revenue might go to the benefit of the school. This, however, would not be feasible as under Government Finance regulations the school cannot purchase land and the school would not benefit by it. The same rule, of course, would apply to the proceeds of any sale.\n\nIn the circumstances I fear that any action on our part to assist Mr. MacCannan would give rise to strong suspicions from the Presbyterian Church authorities who oppose the sale of land to non-Church members. Therefore, perhaps you will agree that it would hardly be opportune to pursue the matter further at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. H. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nHugh D. MacKinnon, Esq., M.P.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nSeptember 5, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon:\n\nI am in receipt of a reply from Mr. Pitts, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, regarding land he agreed to sell to the school board to purchase a parcel of land mentioned in his letter to you of July 31, which is returned herewith.\n\nHis report covers the various points involved by numerous paragraphs which I quote for your information as follows:\n\n1. The part he seeks is not acreage. This is the section upon which the school and all our buildings are built, but the south part of LTP.\n\n2. Site of LTP consists of 68 acres.\n\n3. The small field shown in his diagram (hard-drawn) is not cleared, but is slightly more than 3\u00bd acres of good soil (comparatively).\n\n4. His statement that we never use this field is wrong. We have used it every year since we have been here. It has always been very good before. Any cleared land is scarce and therefore valuable here.\n\n5. So-called buck in diagram is fertile soil (not cleared and not yet building). But it contains good crops and will be used in future years. At present it serves as pasture. It may be improved.\n\n6. Pine Mass. Useless for farming but does grow some pine and poplar for firewood.\n\n7. Road, 8 miles. There is a seldom-used but passable buck road joining our S. plot with S. plot LTP.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI am very much obliged to you for your kindness in writing me such a long letter.

We therefore urge Mr. Macomber to proceed to London at the earliest possible date and, in company with Mr. E.H. Macomber and Mr. Pyle, visit the Cecilia Jeffrey School land which the former wishes to obtain. I feel certain that he will be able to reach an agreement with Mr. Macomber and Mr. Pyle. When reporting your visit to London, please inform me regarding the extent of the land which Mr. Macomber will use and the terms upon which he proposes to pay.

He thought that he was obliged to rent other land for school purposes, and the $15.00 yearly would enable him in selling the land. Mr. Plante thought that there was a case shown to the Department and perhaps they could be given consideration.\n\nIn closing I would say that in my opinion $15.00 per year is reasonable rent, and all concerned would be pleased to know as soon as possible if the lease is approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnds.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 129-5-9 dated October 1, I would report as follows.\n\nMr. E. L. McConnon wished to purchase the parcel of land outlined on the attached sketch. With him is the owner of the adjoining land who will take further action if necessary.\n\nThe area marked \"fresh\" has good soil but the balance is solid rock formation. The height of the rock is from 6 to 8 feet high in places, varying from 10 to 30 feet in height and extending back hundreds of feet.\n\nMr. McConnon will, however, be pleased to receive a lease for a period of ten years or twenty-five years with the option to release or purchase. The amount of land desired is clearly noted on the sketch and probably amounts to about 4 acres. The land is about 5 acres of bush and the balance rock. The land is located a distance of at least 1 mile from the nearest school and is fairly accessible by road in a direct line about 1 mile. The corner of bush has yielded little to the soil and the trees have been cut down. In my opinion the leasing of this parcel of land will not materially affect the school, nor will it inconvenience the school in any way.\n\nThe Department will name what Mr. McConnon marked as \"Mink Run\" as his property, which property at this point is rock formation. The run is perhaps 50 x 100 feet.\n\nMr. McConnon is prepared to pay a yearly rental of $15.00 for the parcel he claimed.

McGowan to use a parcel of land near Carville Jeffrey School property in connection with his milk farm.\n\nI am now in receipt of Inspector Hamilton's report on his recent investigation of this matter. According to the Inspector's report, the proposed location, comprising some four and a half acres is of very little benefit to the school. However, the loss of revenue would be experienced by granting Mr. McGowan's request. On the other hand, certain revenue would be obtained from other sources.\n\nIn the circumstances, therefore, you are hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with the said Mr. R.L. McGowan to grant him a permit of occupation for a period of ten years commencing January 1st, 1943, on an area not exceeding five acres, as indicated in red on a rough sketch map attached herewith. The area is enclosed herewith, being part of that parcel of land designated as the south park of Pike. In consideration of the payment annually of $50.00, payable in advance.\n\nKindly, therefore, communicate with Mr. McGowan and if he is prepared to accept the terms above mentioned, please complete the necessary forms and forward a copy to the department when it is signed by yourself and Mr. McGowan and properly witnessed.\n\nThe question of an extension, beyond the period of ten years, might be explained to Mr. McGowan, in so much as it is not the policy of the department to enter into such agreements, but there may be exceptional cases that is the ordinary course of events, and provided the present arrangement works out satisfactorily, a renewal for a further period of ten years would be granted.\nOTTAWA, October 11, 1941.\n\nHugh B.

McCammon has married, and now is desirous of extending his Mink Farm and building a house. He wishes me to enquire of the department whether they would consider the sale of this property to him.\n\n(I would refer you to agreement of that date with Diagram attached.)\n\nMr. McCammon would also like to purchase the additional part (other than that leased) of the Cultivated Field of Approx. 10 acres to the East, (i.e., to boundary of property) and all the south portion of this designated lot, south of the centre of the River. He states that this was surveyed and recorded in 1926 at full time. Mr. McCammon has considered purchasing this part from a previous owner of our property and the surveying was done. He states that there are approximately 40 acres in the whole parcel.\n\nMr. McCammon would offer $400.00 for this part of land. This figure was arrived at by an interview with the Municipal Assessor.\n\nOUR RECOMMENDATION: As this portion of land is rather distant from the school, and partly rock, we might be in favour, but only if there would be a possibility of the school constructing a new land nearer to our buildings, at some future date. We find it necessary to rent two other farms, in order to make our farm pay. (This land which Mr. McCammon desires is much more valuable to his because of its close proximity and accessibility.)\n\nWould you please forward the enclosed copy, with your observations and recommendations to the Department for their consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\n2 Copies.\nOttawa, July 17, 1945.\n\nMr. H.

Peterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 1st and my reply of July 17th with reference to the request of Ernest McCammon to purchase approximately two acres of property forming part of the farm at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nMr. McCammon's father visited this office recently and discussed the matter again at that time. I promised him I would review the whole situation with the Director and I did so this afternoon. Mr. McCammon has a ten-year lease on this property effective from October 17, 1941 and while I cannot make any definite promise to that effect, it is quite likely when this lease expires it will be renewed if Mr. McCammon so desires. Consequently I feel that he would be reasonably safe in erecting what buildings he would require on this property.\n\nI enclose a sketch which Mr. McCammon Sr. left with me. Please advise Mr. McCammon regarding the contents of this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(R310, Volume 6190)\n\nFile A61-9, part 1\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nSchool Lands, 1916 - 1925\n\nFile A61-9, part 2\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nSchool Lands, 1925 - 1930\n\nFile A61-9, part 3\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nSchool Lands, 1930 - 1938\n\nFile A61-10, part 1\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges, 1938 - 1945\n\nFile A61-10, part 2\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges, 1945 - 1949\n\nFile A61-10, part 3\nKenora Agency - Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges, 1949 - 1953\nOttawa, December 11, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. D.

Please let me have your advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

She contracted Chicken Pox at the school and naturally had to be kept for a certain time, but on discussing the matter with Dr. Ferguson the Chicken Pox subsided some time ago and the girl could have been home within the last two weeks.\n\nWe think she should be in some school, but it is a question which school she should be admitted to.\n\nAn early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 4, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the request for the admission of Julia Singleton to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of September 26, 1935, the Department considers that this girl should be returned to her father. Please inform the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School accordingly.\n\nAbout the first of April, you should again interview the father and advise the Department what his wishes are regarding the religious auspices under which he desires his daughter educated.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.

I was discussing school matters with Mrs. McKerroll and mentioned the case of this pupil. Mrs. McKerroll said she had business in Ottawa and would take the matter up with the Dept. Following up her interview with the Dept., she wrote me stating she had had a very favourable interview with the Minister and with the Dept., and she was advised that Julia was to remain in the school for the present.\n\nShortly after this the Agent sent me instructions that Julia was to be sent home. I notified Mrs. McKerroll I was going to send the child home and again she notified me that she had just returned from Ottawa and that the Dept. was allowing the girl to remain in the school.\n\nAll this time I was under the impression that the Dept. approved of her remaining in the school for the present. This was what I assumed from Mrs. McKerroll's instructions.\n\nI am sending the girl home this week or rather to her grandmother who has raised the girl. The grandmother informs me that the father takes no interest whatever in the child and that she is unable to keep her unless she receives help from the Dept. She was certainly in a run down condition when she came to school. I regret for the child's interests to see her sent back to the conditions under which she will be obliged to exist. I expect she will be leaving the school tomorrow.\n\nHoping I have made my position clear to you,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJan. 16th, 1926\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe Cecilia Jeffery Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name William\nAge Born July 19th, 1926\nName of Band Shoal Lake #40\nNo. of tickets under which child's annuity is paid 65\nFather's full name and No. Hector Martin 65\nMother's full name and No. Irene Redsky 65\nParents living or dead Living\nState of child's health\nReligion Presbyterian\nDoes applicant speak English?

Smith, Indian Agent at Birtle, which we inclose herewith.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with the Principal, we would suggest the boy be kept at the school till the summer holidays and then the matter of his discharge could be discussed, as you will note from the letter Benn's father is living with a half breed and has no home for his son to go to.\n\nThe Principal has promised to write us what he thinks should be done when the pupils go on vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nS/18\n\nBirtle Manitoba\n14th March 1936\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThomas Dunn of the Bird Tail Reserve was in here today, and informed me that his son Stanley is getting into a lot of trouble at the Cecilia Jefferies School, and he wants to get him home.\n\nAs a matter of fact Thomas is living on the road allowance with a half breed woman and has no home for the boy to come to, and it would be very poor policy to let the boy out simply because he is unruly, unless he is a general nuisance in the school, and shows the other children a bad example. In some cases a really bad boy is a menace to the school, and it is a good thing to let them out.\n\nI understand that you investigated this case and would be glad to know what you think about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCaptain Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKenora Unit.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1926.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves of Stanley Dunn - No. 165 - remaining in the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School until the end of June.

In this connection I would draw attention to the following:\n\nNo. 084 - Mary Begg, age 21 years,\n0111 - Maud Sandy, age 18\n0128 - Margaret Sinclair, age 20\n0141 - Marie Adams, age 18\n103 - Alfred Lindsay, age 17\n108 - Fraser Kesik, age 18\n135 - Alex. Sinclair, age 17\n\nIn the case of pupil No. 108 - Fraser Kesik, it is noted that he is attending high school at Kenora. The Department would like to be informed of the further period it will take him to complete his course.\n\nRegarding the other pupils mentioned above, it is considered that the Principal should apply for their discharge, to take effect at the end of the current quarter.\n\nBesides the above, there are a number of pupils who have reached the age of 16 years. The Principal should apply for their discharge, also, or forward a report in each case, stating the reasons for recommending that they be permitted to remain at the school for a further period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, April 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence, regarding the application forwarded under cover of your letter of September 18, 1935, for the admission of Julia Kavanagh (or Singleton), No. 78, Eagle Lake Band, to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, I would request that you again consider the matter with the girl's father, Mr. Kavanagh definitely from him whether he desires that this girl remain at the school or be returned to her home. It is understood that the father is Roman Catholic and the mother, Pagan.\n\nThe Department has had certain pressure brought, through the authorities of the Presbyterian Church, for permission to admit this girl to the Cecilia Jeffrey School as a regular non-attending pupil. If the admission of the girl to the Cecilia Jeffrey School was approved there would, no doubt, be objections raised, on the part of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, in view of the fact that her father is stated to be Catholic. Therefore, the Department requires to receive the definite wishes of the father and also your recommendation, regarding the application for the admission of this girl to the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nI should be pleased if you would give this matter your early attention and report fully, as soon as it is possible for you to interview the girl's father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

She has completed a commercial course in Art and is taking special lessons now. She shows ability in art and we are anxious to give her as much instruction as possible here and then the Missionary Society will undertake further training for her. If we must discharge her, her studies will be lost.\n\nNo. 023 Maud Sandy was brought back to school during the winter as she was in a badly run down condition and with the treatment received in the school she has almost recovered her normal health. Home conditions are not very good and she does not want to return home.\n\nNo. 025 Margaret Sinclair. This girl has been working in the residence and is the most reliable and clean girl in the school. She is accustomed to the duties in the residence and would be a great help there.\n\nNo. 103 Alfred Lindsey has exceptional ability in Art and we have been giving him private lessons. He is anxious to make Art his profession.\n\nNo. 115 Alex Sinclair. He is in High School and is doing well in his work. He is an intelligent boy and is well in school. His both parents are dead.\n\nI think his discharge might be granted.\n\nIf I may be permitted to do so I would like to make a few observations from my study of the pupils. I find the results of the school work very much more worth while when the pupil is retained in school until he or she is 13 years of age or older. When they are discharged at 16 much of the school work is lost. From 16 to 13 there is such a marked development and they become so much more set in the proper outlook on life. They are more stable and more dependent upon themselves.\n\nThe Indian child does not mature as early as the average\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ult #129-3-10, re children over 16 at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosed herewith letter received from the Principal.

Enquiries were immediately conducted in the vicinity of Kanora and it was learned from an Indian, Sam GARDINER, that these Indian boys were seen around the Indian House, about 2 miles from Kanora. In the late evening of the 12th inst., at 10:00 p.m., on the 13th, I left Kanora with Police Boat, Johnson Outboard motor Code No.7365, accompanied by S/Cst.

From Charlie Williams, father of the missing Morris WILLIAMS, at Porcupine Bay, it was learned that the boy, Morris, had not arrived home. Charlie WILLIAMS promised to notify this detachment should he return to his home.\n\n3. The patrol then returned to Kanora, arriving at 5:00 p.m., to learn that Mr. BURS had reported further that the missing boy William HEN had returned to the school on the 13th, inst., and advised that he had not been in the company of the other missing boys.\n\n4.

Residential School. Her admission to that school is, therefore, being approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerrell,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lans St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nKenora Public Schools,\nKenora, Ontario.\nJune 15, 1935.\n\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Capt. Edwards:\n\nWe have had for the past year, in our Class, in the Kenora Public School, two Indian boys, Fraser Kesick and Jimmy Comican. In your communication of May 24th re Fraser Kesick, whether I think it advisable for the boy to continue or not school.\n\nI have been discussing Fraser's case with Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones, the Indians of the Indian School, and with my own staff. Fraser has not been doing very well in his studies. He is very close to passing, but I believe it might be a good idea to give him another chance. He has two or three former instructors at the Indian School apparently desire to see this boy himself for further work. This has been done with the young Indians on the reserves of Manitota and Southern Ontario.\n\nThis year has been a new experience for me. I have known for the first time about students of Anglo-Saxon parentage. He has enjoyed the year, but could have applied himself rather more diligently in studies. Another year would further the acid.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nT. C. Keenan\nSupervising Principal\nPublic Schools, Kenora.\nOttawa, June 27th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to two pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nJimmy Comigan is shown on the return as sixteen years of age and, while the letter from the Principal does not state so definitely, the Department understands that he has been successful in his fifth class work. He may, therefore, remain for another year.\n\nFraser Kesiek is now eighteen years of age and it is noted from the Principal's report that he has been unsuccessful during the past year. Our policy has been that, when an Indian pupil is unsuccessful, no further educational advantage can be given to him. The Department does not see that anything would be gained by him repeating the work next year. It is considered that he should be discharged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

D.

I was abroad when the applications were sent in, but now find that these children are half-breeds. They do not live on a reserve and the \"Red Lake\" they come from originally is not in Canada, but in Minnesota, U.S.A.\n\nThe family are up against it, but I think we refused admission to these children to one of our schools some years ago. I therefore do not see how the department can approve their admission, although I feel sorry for them. I should be glad to receive a reply so that I can notify the principal as their present residence is at the school and are included in the September quarterly returns. I have signed the returns enclosed herewith, but do not know whether a grant will be allowed for these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 8, 1936.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find quarterly returns for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. Pupils No. 227, 228, and 229 are half-breeds and I doubt if their admission will be approved. The others are new children and their applications will go forward later. Pupil C210, Mary and pupil C213, Emma, are not yet of school age, but I would recommend their admission be approved as Mary has no mother and Emma, No. C213 has come to school with her sister and will shortly be of school age.\n\nI have certified the returns, but the figures and the amount of capital grant will have to be changed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the September quarter return of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information given in your letter, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of Donald, Sandford and Alan MacDonald to this school. If they are in the school at the present time, they should be returned to their home.\n\nYou may, also, inform the Principal that the discharge of Sherry Esplinnesse - No. 162, is approved.\n\nApplication forms and certificates of health should be forwarded as soon as possible for the following:\n\nNo. 0808 - J. Martin\nNo. 250 - G. Paych\nNo. 255 - A. Redsky\nNo. 351 - H. Paych\nNo. 356 - J. Redsky\nNo. 4111 - M. Patock\n\nI would point out that a number of these pupils have been in the school for several months. The Department cannot understand the delay in forwarding the application forms.\n\nPlease inform the Principal that the admission of Mary Veginesse, Irene Cameron and Emma Cameron is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Dept. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRenfrew, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nPupil #0109 Mary Green at Cecilia Jeffrey School (#51 Shoal Lake Band#39) is now attending High School in Kenora.\n\nA short time ago her father came in and wanted her discharged as she will be 17 on November 10th. Next we phoned the Principal who informed us that the girl had written him a letter saying she wished to stay at the school and attend the High School. We asked the Principal to bring the girl down to the Office which he did about a week ago, when we asked her what she wanted to do and she told us she had promised Mr. Byers the Principal to go to High School.\n\nOn Thursday the 22nd. last, we told her father what she had said but he still maintained she wanted to get out and told us he would see her himself.\n\nHe came into the Office on Saturday with Mary who now says she wants to be discharged as she has a job to go to and wished us to wire Ottawa for her discharge.\n\nThe Principal does not wish her discharge and will not apply for it. As we do not think the High School will do her any good, but if she would stay, till the summer vacation she could be discharged then if she still wished it.\n\nAwaiting your decision in this matter,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of Mary Green No. 6109, to remain at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School until June 30th, next, at which time she should be discharged.\n\nPlease inform her father and the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Winnipeg, under date of the 21st inst., in this connection I have to report the following:\n\nSub-Division:\nFollowing the submission of report as marginally noted the writer interviewed Capt. J. Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora and discussed with him the matter of the return of the 20 Indians children who were absent from the above mentioned schools by this Detachment. Capt. Edwards suggested that the matter be let stand for some time as he anticipated a visit to most Indian Reserves on the Lake of the Woods for the purpose of distribution of land funds and at such time would take the matter of absentee children up with parents and so perhaps have parents return such children to respective schools without the incurring of considerable expense to the Department.\n\nDetachment:\nOn the 22nd inst., the writer communicated by telephone with Mr. W. Myers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School here, to ascertain the number of Indian children at present absent from his School. Mr. Myers advised that most of the children reported absent had already returned, that some of the children now absent were old enough that he did not desire that they be returned and that he now desired the return of three children only, Irene CRAW, Henrie OHLE and Arnold PHILPOT. Mr. MYERS further advised that Charlie LEE was still absent but that this boy's father had promised to return this boy to the school in the near future.\n\nPCR Kenora.\n25-9-36.\n\nOn the 22nd inst., the writer communicated with the Principal of the St. Mary's (R.C.) Indian School here to ascertain the number of children absent at present from such school, and was advised that eight children were still absent and that their return was desired. These eight children reside in different parts of detachment area and the matter will be taken up with Capt. Edwards for his instructions with regard to their return, as soon as Capt. Edwards, who is at present absent from Kenora, returns.\n\nIn compliance with a request of the 21st inst., by Capt. Edwards, a patrol was scheduled to start to N.West Angle this date, to locate and return Henrie OHLE & Arnold PHILPOT to C.J. School, but due to the intervention of another patrol such patrol to N.West Angle had to be postponed until tomorrow. Further report will be submitted following such patrol.\n\nTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\n(Signed)\n(S. Stanley) Reg. No. 20475\n1/C Kenora Detachment.\n\nThe U.C.

Indian School, but was then in Hospital, and on her discharge was handed over to her mother, who is now married to John Redsky of Shoal Lake Band No. 40. This apparently did not take her away, however she was placed in the Cecilia Jeffrey Presbyterian School on March 20th, without my knowledge, and today the Principal has handed me the enclosed application for her admission.\n\nThe mother Mrs John Redsky, late Mrs Albert Ochis, (nee Greta Michaud) has three children by the late Albert Ochis, and since she has married John Redsky apparently wishes to get rid of her children. One of the children she has left with a woman from Big Island Band, and the two older ones Eliza and Elvin are now at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, although no approval has been given for their admission.\n\nThe following are the children, Eliza born 23rd May 1931, Elvin born 9th Jan., 1933, and Louise born 20th March 1935.\n\nI hesitate to make any recommendation in view of your letter of 31st Dec last, and would like to get your instructions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the application which you have received for the admission of Elisa Oshie to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. In view of her age, the Department is not prepared to approve her admission to any Indian residential school at the present time and you should arrange to have the mother take charge of her.\n\nWith reference to the March quarter return of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, you may inform the Principal that the admission of Dolly Cameron is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDivision File No. 37 F 1274-4 E4\n\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision Sub Division Detachment\nProvince Province\n\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDate April 5th, 1937\n\nFile References\n\nRes Alex McGEALD et al - Truant Indian Children - Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora, Ont.\n\nHeadquarters\n\n1.

This service can be rendered at Indian day or residential schools or in social service work under the direction of the churches. Our experience has taught us that the Indians need more perhaps than they need anything else, leadership, guidance and direction in their local enterprises.\n\nThe amount of money at our disposal for assistance to ex-pupils is very small. I shall be glad, however, to have the names of the two graduates to whom you refer in your communication. You might, in addition to this, let me have a brief summary of the course you have in mind and the time required to complete it. If you do this I shall be glad to recommend a grant to assist these girls to proceed with the course.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

May I suggest that you consider the advisability of giving this girl a 2 year practical course, with emphasis on home-making. In view of her age and the fact that she has been for years in an educational institution, I do not think it would be at all wise to ask this girl to proceed with a 4 year course.\n\nMary Green was born on November 10, 1919, and I can see no serious objection to this girl proceeding with the 4 year course you have outlined, provided she is interested in her studies and makes a good showing the first year.\n\nI regret to state that the appropriation at our disposal for assistance of this kind is very limited. The Department, however, will allow $165.00 per annum for each girl, on the understanding, of course, that we shall receive a report of their progress from year to year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe Hugh McDonald Family.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to call your attention to what I consider a very special case and I shall very much appreciate your worthy consideration of same.\n\nIn 1936 three children of the above family were sent to our school and the necessary application forms were forwarded to the Department for approval. Their admission was refused on the grounds that the father was not a treaty Indian.\n\nBeing late in the Fall and owing to the condition of the lake I was unable to have these children returned to their home until the following Spring. We did not receive any assistance from the Dept. for the support of these and when I sent them home I told them they were not to return after the Summer holidays.\n\nWhen school opened the children returned and I did not get in touch with the parents as the children came on a boat enroute from Barrow, Minn.\n\nMrs. McDonald is an Indian but the father is White. They have no school available and are very anxious to have their children learn to read and write. They live as Indians on Biggy Island which is situated approximately 70 miles from Kenora and most of their associations are with the Indians.\n\nWe have the accommodation for these children and it seems a pity that they have no opportunity for receiving any education. The oldest boy has been sent to a Reformatory and will be a government charge for at least two years and if we could have these children for a few years it should be a great help to them.\n\nA few years ago a circular letter was issued by the Dept. stating that Half-breed children living as Indians would be admitted to Residential schools if there were sufficient accommodation.\n\nWe have the accommodation and I would like to see these children have this privilege afforded them.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your worthy consideration of the above,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa\nOctober 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Oseilina Jeffrey Residential School, in which he states that the McDonald children have returned to the school after the summer holidays.\n\nIn connection with these children, I would refer you to your letter of October 14, 1936, and official letter of October 14, 1936, filed in my office. We are therefore not prepared to admit these children as grant earning pupils to the Oseilina Jeffrey School.\n\nIf the McDonald family is residing in Canada, the attention of the Provincial authorities should be directed to these children as their education is a Provincial responsibility.\n\nIf, however, the family is residing in the United States, action by this Department is not required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hony,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSeptember 1st, 1937.\n\nSir,\u2014I hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Cecilia Jeffery Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child (0220)\nEnglish name Barbara\nAge 6 years Born 1st May 1929.\nName of Band Shoal Lake $39\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid $54\nFather's full name and No. David Kesick $54\nMother's full name and No. Mary Kesick $54\nParents living or dead Living\nState of child's health Good\nReligion No.\nDoes applicant speak English?

This boy was 16 in April 20th last but informed the Principal a short time ago that he would be returning to school, but it now looks as if he had changed his mind and does not wish to return. He is still about.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference the Superintendent of Welfare and Training's letter #129-3-10 of 6th instant re returning half breed children to their homes from the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe children referred to (McDonald) were brought to this office by the Principal of the school whilst I was on vacation in England, and taken by him to the school. The application forms were later sent in but admission to the school as grant earning pupils was not approved, rightly so, as they were not Treaty Indians.\n\nThey had been refused admission by me some years ago; however the Principal admitted them.\n\nHe was informed on several occasions their admission was noted, and the Principal asked to return them to their homes, as instructed by the Department, but he kept them at the school, as could easily have found out where they lived, and in fact knew the place, but did not return them.\n\nI enclose copy of letter written the Principal on the 13th instant, and his reply thereto, which appears rather unsatisfactory, as I consider my letter was quite polite and in good taste. I asked him to communicate his requests to the Department so that we could keep informed and clear up small matters that often can be done without referring them to Ottawa.\n\nThe Principal is very touchy, and does not like to receive instructions from me, but expects to get them direct from Ottawa; in fact he appears to think this office should not give him any instructions whatever.\n\nThe Principal admitted the children without authority, did not return them to their parents when officially requested, and now thinks the department should pay for returning them. The cost would not be very much, but in any case is, I think, a school responsibility.\n\nI shall be glad to receive further instructions,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find September quarterly returns for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will notice a large number of children did not return to school after the holidays. However most of them are now back, only three or four still absent, but these are being traced up, and will be returned as located.\n\nWe always have difficulty in getting children back to this school, and have suggested on several occasions to the Principal that if he would keep the children who do not return on time, at the school, and give them no holidays the following summer, the matter would soon be cleared up and I do not think we would have the same trouble again, but he apparently does not want to do this.\n\nAnother thing he went for his holidays immediately after the school re-opened, and of course was not at the school to see the children returned.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of October 15th with reference to the MacDonald children.\n\nPlease inform the Principal that the Department is not prepared to pay the transportation of these children to their home. I might point out that as these children are not wards of this Department, we would not be justified in providing their transportation from funds voted for Indian educational purposes.\n\nIt is hoped that these children will be sent home from the Cecilia Jeffrey School immediately on receipt of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant enclosing the September quarter returns of the Cecelia Jeffrey Residential School, I am writing the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church of Canada, pointing out to her the importance of having the Principal and all members of the staff of the Cecelia Jeffrey Residential School on duty at the time the pupils return from holidays each year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Hogy,\n\nTo children of Hugh McDonald.\n\nI have to advise you that Mr. MacKinnon called at the department today about the children in the memorandum under. I explained the position to him, namely, that as these children did not possess any Indian status, they were not eligible for education in our schools. He desired me to confirm this by letter, and I shall be glad if you will advise me if there is any further point to be added.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.H. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 17, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacKINNON,\n\nRe: Children of Hugh McDonald,\n\nI note that you have already intimated to Mr. MacKinnon that the children of Hugh McDonald do not possess any Indian status and, consequently, are not eligible for enrolment at Mrs. Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nThe case of these children has been very fully discussed in letters on this file, and I do not know of anything you can add to the explanation already made by you to Mr. MacKinnon.\n\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 17, 1937.\n\nV.

Hugh Macdonald, the father of these children, is a white man. The children there are have no Indian status and are not wards of this Department.\n\nOn October 14, 1936 the Department advised the Agent that, for the above mentioned reason, the admission of these people to the school could not be approved, and that if they were in the school at the time they should be returned to their home.\n\nThe circumstances are regrettable but it is clear that the care of these children is not the responsibility of this Department and would not be a proper charge against our appropriation for Indian education.\n\nI am returning your memorandum herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

In regard to them not having holidays, I previously informed the Principal at Elkhorn not to allow these children to go home as they had no place to go at Fort Alexander that was suitable.\n\nI therefore enclose application for the admission of Joe to the Cecilia Jeffrey School as a transfer from Elkhorn school, and would suggest the oldest boy Charley be discharged, as he is now 16, according to his father, and is old enough to be with his father and assist him in trapping.\n\nIf you approve, please inform me, and let the Principal of the Elkhorn school know.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.*\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Mary Kelly and Winnie Sandy admit this.\n\nUpon enquiring why, Mary Kelly said the girls of the school were always bothering her. This she said was her only reason. She is one of the biggest girls in the school.\n\nWinnie Sandy stated she went because she did not want Mary Kelly to go alone. She said she had no other reason.\n\nWinnie Autakejick stated she did not want to stay in school in school all Winter. She said her teacher told her she never knew her memorizing which she admitted was the truth. She also stated the teacher did not punish her.\n\nElizabeth Martin stated she went because the others were going and she wanted to go too. She also stated that she had received no punishment within at least two weeks previous.\n\nThese are the first girls we have had run away from the school within three years, a record which few schools have. We have had very few pupils who have run away during the past year and I have talked with a number of Principals and I am convinced that we have as few as any of the schools.\n\nThe Staff is interested in the children's welfare and are kind to the children and I cannot see any valid excuse for their running away\u2014a wild impulse to be free.\n\nHoping this is the information you require,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter 129-2-10\nof January 17th 1938.\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from\nthe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential\nSchool, re truancy of the four girls.\n\nThe case does not seem to be a serious one,\nand it would appear that no further action is\nnecessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a letter from the Principal Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School making for the discharge of pupil Doris Kandamin, #36 Shoal Lake Band #39, as she is pregnant, and now married to Fred Green #45 Shoal Lake Band #39.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received the enclosed accounts from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. J. W. Stone Company $30.00\nHarry Foster $25.00\n\nThese accounts are for collecting and returning pupils to school after the summer vacation.\n\nThe Department often authorizes an amount for this purpose, but did not do so for this school last summer.\n\nSome years ago we turned over to the School, without cost, the launch they had whilst the school was at Shoal Lake, for the purpose of taking the children out on the Lake and for other purposes.\n\nThis launch, whilst still owned by the School is now being used by Harry Foster for the purpose of taking passengers out on the Lake, and for freighting, and I am unofficially informed, he pays the Principal of the School some amount for the use of the launch. The Principal once informed me that Foster had to give him the use of the boat when he required it for any purpose.\n\nOn account of complaints I had received from the other livery outfits in town, which were reported to Ottawa, the boat was transferred to the school, and I admit that if Foster did not have the boat he would have probably been on relief, but that does not appear to me to be any reason why he should be allowed to continue using it for returning children to the school from points on the Lake, when the school have a launch, given them for this purpose.\n\nI do not wish this letter to be taken as a complaint on my part, but is only written to ascertain the wishes of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa\nMarch 6, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in connection with the account submitted to you by the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School for returning children to the school after the summer vacation of 1937.\n\nAs the Department supplied a launch to this school for the transportation of pupils, and it is presumed that this launch is in good condition, there appears no reason why we should pay outsiders for transporting the children to and from the school.

Otherwise, the Indians are almost certain to view the school with disfavour and, as a result, recruiting difficulties will be increased.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that we do not recommend allowing children home simply when some member of the family is ill but it is always possible to make reports regarding the seriousness of the illness and in the event of death or likelihood of it I believe that the Principal should, as pointed out above, make a real effort to allow the child to go home for a short time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

J. Edwards, Ind. Agent).\n\n23-10-38.\n\n1. In the A.M. above date, Capt. J. Edwards, Ind. Agent,\nKenora, Ont. called this Detachment and advised that\nCharlie WILLIAMS, age 15; Louis COPELAND, age 15; and Donald\nJAYNE, age 14 had run away from the mentioned\nSchool on 6-10-38. Agent Edwards had received information\nthat these boys had gone to Eagle River, Ont. and were on\nthe Reservation there. Agent Edwards further stated that he\nwould like these boys returned to the School.\nAccordingly, acting under instructions from R.C.O. I/O\nKenora Detachment, I left at 11.00 A.M. by Private Auto\nand patrolled to the Eagle River Reservation, Eagle River,\nOnt.\n\n2. The boys were picked up at 6.30 P.M. and patrol\nleft Eagle River with the boys and proceeded towards\nKenora.\n\nP. C. R.\n\nKenora.\n\n3. When at a point about eight miles East of Kenora\nI noticed three boys in the bush alongside the road. When\nI stopped these three boys ran into the bush but were\nfinally apprehended. I discovered they were Tom BIG GEORGE,\nage 13; George BLUEBIRD, age 13 and Napoleon KANAY, age 12\npupils from the St. Mary's Indian School, Kenora, Ont. who\nhad run away this afternoon and were attempting to get\nto Hanson, Ont. These boys, as well as the other three were\narrested to Kenora and turned over to the proper Authorities.\n\n4.

Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of Sept. 30th re transportation of pupils by boat I wish to state that we do considerable recruiting with the school boat but under the regulations of the Marine Dept. we must have a licensed captain when we carry any passengers. This means an outlay of $25 per hr.\n\nWe also have to provide gas and oil and these raise other expenses as well.\n\nThere are also many cases where the children can not return by boat, e.g., those who live where you suggested I pay the taxi for Jim Major returning from Crow Dick Lake at a cost of $14.00. Such cases can not be taken care of by boat.\n\nWhen I make a charge for the boat I charge only the actual outlay.\n\nI do not understand that though all other schools in your agency have been provided with a boat and expenses for the upkeep and in our case we were not asked for any allowance for upkeep during the past four years, other schools are allowed a grant for returning children to the school while our request is questioned. Last year's request was refused. Last year I brought in around expense 11 children for St. Mary's school a distance of 150 miles for the round trip. This year we have brought in a number of children for the same school at our expense.\n\nI therefore feel our making a request to cover all our returning expenses but I feel it is reasonable to expect some return for our expenses.\n\nIf the Dept. would allow us $100 each year for returning children to school we could finance more economically as we could arrange in advance to have them come in larger groups and not two or three coming by taxi and other means of transportation.\n\nThanking you for your attention to the above,\n\nI remain very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReference your letter #129-6-10 of 27th September re transportation of pupils to Indian Schools.\n\nWith particular reference to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, I took up the last part of your letter with the Principal and he has written a reply copy of which is enclosed as he made out the letter in duplicate.\n\nIn my opinion very little recruiting is done with the boat, but sometimes it is used in September to bring children from the lake back to school, but under the present regulations a licensed Captain should be got for the boat when used for this purpose, and the Principal has not been using the boat for this purpose lately.\n\nThe boat is still in operation and is used daily; I understand it is rented out to Mr. Harry Foster, and he takes tourists out and transports freight to mining properties, and I think he must have a Captains licence, or it is not likely he would be allowed to operate the way he does.\n\nI believe he pays the school some consideration for the use of the boat, and this matter was reported to the Department some time ago, when we owned the boat, but on account of complaints that the boat was being used for other than school purposes the Department turned it over to the school.\n\nWe have paid nothing for upkeep of boats belonging to other schools, except that we did purchase a new engine for the Sioux Lookout School a few years ago.\n\nI question if the school pays anything like $10.00 a year for returning children to this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to transportation of pupils to and from the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to allow an amount not exceeding $100.00 a year for transportation of children to and from the school other than by the school boat. Payment of this amount will be made on receipt from you of properly certified accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF.

Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding Applications for Admission for two children, viz., Donald Allan Churchill and Harvey Frank Churchill.\n\nThese children are both under the usual age for admission but it is a very special case and I feel deserving of consideration.\n\nThe father was sent to a Sanitorium and the mother has three other children to take care of, the youngest being a baby of about six months.\n\nThe mother has never lived on a reserve being brought to school as a neglected child when quite young. She cannot possibly provide for her family. The school has been taking care of them since the father was sent away.\n\nBy being relieved of the care of the two older ones she would have a better chance to take care of the younger ones but she will also require assistance from some other source.\n\nHoping these applications will receive favourable consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 8th instant you may inform the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School that the admission of James Williams, Harvey Churchill and Donald Churchill is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF.

He was shortly caught by the game warden; however, they sold some fur in Kenora and the boy with the money bought some of the skins, and sold them to another fur buyer. He eventually confessed and was brought up before the police magistrate yesterday, and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, but the sentence was suspended providing the boy returned to the school, in the care of the principal.\n\nBoth the Mounted Police and the Principal think this is the best solution, and have great faith in the boy and believe he will turn out a good man after this, and as the boy is anxious to continue his studies, and the Principal says he was a very good student, I would recommend that he be accepted as a grant earning pupil for another twelve months, providing he behaves himself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 10th instant the Department approves the re-admission of Norbert Kelly, No. 115, to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school.

Please inform the Principal that her admission is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School saying Kathleen Gardner pupil 10155 has successfully completed her first year in High School and is anxious to continue for another year. He says she is a very bright pupil, and has returned, and her father would like her to continue her studies. She has been under consideration by the Women's Missionary Society for special training and he would like to keep her on at the school for at least another year.\n\nShe was born in 1922, and is therefore 17 years old.\n\nHer father is an Ex-Chief of the Wabigoon Band and a good type of Indian.\n\nI would recommend the request be approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\n27th September, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School informs me that Mavis Copeman (or Marie Nawakajjak) pupil f0121, and Arnold Thomas, pupil 106, are 16 years of age and both have passed the entrance examination to High School, and are anxious to take additional education and wish to be allowed to continue in school for another year. The parents of both children are dead and they have no permanent home.\n\nI wish the Department to authorize their readmission for another year as grant earning pupils.\n\nDuring the investigation for immorality at this school a short time ago, Davis admitted intercourse with boys, but not at the school. Arnold admitted intercourse at the school.\n\nI have looked up the ages of these pupils and find Mavis was born sometime in 1922 and Arnold on 16th July, 1922.\n\nUnder the circumstances it might probably be advisable to agree to the request, and allow them to stay providing they will give an undertaking to behave themselves and providing the Principal will give strict supervision to them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Robert Kent, #179 Islington Band,\npupil #361 Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School.\n\nThe father of the above named pupil has asked for his discharge from school, as he is now 16 years old.\n\nThe boy with his father was transferred from #191 Fort Alexander Band to the Islington Band under authority of Department letter 62-129 of 27th April, 1925, and the date of birth then given me being the 9th August, 1925, (1924)\n\nHowever I have a note from Canon Sanderson that the boy was born the 17th August, 1923, and baptized Anglican on the 26th August, 1923; the latter also informs me he was paid annuity by the Indian Agent for Fort Alexander Band in 1924 for this boy therefore does not seem to be any reason to doubt the fact that he is 18.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would therefore recommend the boy be discharged to assist his father, although Mr Byers the Principal of the school does not think he should be discharged and seemed quite annoyed when I suggested the matter to him, as he thought he should be the one to say who should be discharged and not the parents of the boy or the Department.\n\nMr Byers claimed he assisted the father last winter with relief, but no request was received from the father to us, and I cannot see why the father of the boy cannot make a living as he is only 41 and has a young wife, and no no children at home with him. I shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 22nd and 29th ultimo with reference to certain pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school. In view of the evidence received at the investigation held at the Cecilia Jeffrey school about two months ago the Department considers that it is undesirable at the present time to retain in the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school pupils who are over 16 years of age. Under these circumstances you may inform the Principal that the following pupils should be discharged at once:\n\nRobert Kent No. 179\nMavis Copenace No. 0181\nArnold Penace No. 105\nKathleen Gardner No. 0155\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

Opposite this entry it is stated that she entered the school on October 12, 1939 even though she did enter the school on October 12 the school would not be entitled to any grant for her for the quarter ended September 30, 1939.\n\nIn view of the fact that no grant was requested for this girl for over a year it is presumed that she was absent from the school either on account of illness or truancy.

The only thing for me to do was to take the child in charge, and to await the decision of the Department as to whether or not he would be admitted as a pupil. The application forms were completed from your office, and I thought that I was only following the usual custom of keeping the boy in School until definite arrangements were made.\n\nI got in touch with the boy's father, and he very emphatically informed me that he was not a Catholic, that he was just of the Indian belief, and that he did not wish his boy educated in the Roman Catholic School. Further the father made an affidavit to the effect that he wanted his boy educated in the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nIt has been the custom of the Department, as a rule, to authorize the admission of pupils to any School when the application was accompanied by an affidavit. This has been done in this case, and as the father is very desirous of having his boy educated in this school, it seems reasonable to expect that his application should be approved.\n\nAs our quarterly returns had already been completed and forwarded to your office, I was not in a position to make the alterations in them.

It was understood that the girl be taken in charge, and none of her people had accompanied her, and it has been the usual custom when new pupils arrive at the School, that we take them in charge until such time as their admission to the School has been dealt with by the Department.\n\nI later got in touch with the father of this child, and he informed me that he had attended the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and that he was Protestant, that his child had been brought up under the care of his grandmother who was also Protestant, and he insisted that his child be brought up in the Protestant School. I might further add that the father sent instructions through me to Canon Henderson of the Anglican Church to baptize his child.\n\nI have been informed that the mother had been Catholic, but that the mother died when the child was born, and all subsequent training of the child has been in the Protestant faith. It seemed to me a very reasonable request on the part of the father that his child should be educated in a Protestant Institution.\n\nThe father has also made an affidavit to the effect that he wishes his child educated in the Cecilia Jeffrey School. In view of all this information I hope the Department will authorize her admission to the School.\nAs our quarterly returns had already been completed and forwarded to your office, I was not in a position to make the alterations in them. Hoping this meets with the approval of the Department, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 19th, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find Quarterly Returns,\nfor the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, I\nwould refer you to Departmental letter 129-3-10\nof 15th inst., with particular reference to\nVictoria Pitchener.\n\nI enclose letter received from the Principal\nand saw the girl's father at Eagle River yesterday\n17th, and he informed me he did not mind what school\nVictoria went to.\n\nI would also refer you to my letter of 6th.\ninst re this case and don't think it matters which\nschool the child goes to, but as she has a half brother\nat the Kenora R.C. School, there might be difficulties.\n\nThe Father informs me he is not a Protestant,\nbut of aboriginal belief.\n\nIn view of the Principal's letter I would be glad to\nreceive further instructions as I feel confident the child\nwas never brought up in the Protestant faith.\n\nRe. Birdie Cantin, I saw the Chief and Councilor\nof the Wahigoch Band yesterday afternoon 17th, but the Father\nof this child was not there.\n\nHowever the Indians informed me that Cantin\nwas never baptized although he did previously report to me\nthat he was Catholic.\n\nI do not think it makes much difference which school\nthe child goes to, but I enclose letter from the Principal.\n\nI requested the Principal to omit the names of the\nchildren from his Quarterly Returns, but you will note he\nsays the returns were complete and he was not in a position\nto make any alteration in them. I have therefore made the\nnecessary alterations in red ink.\nWhen discussing the matter with the Principal he intimated that the Catholic Schools were getting much better treatment from the Department than the Protestant.\n\nI assured him this was not so but that they were all getting equal treatment.\n\nMr. Byers seems to think that anything he does as Principal, should be approved and is very sensitive to any instructions I pass on to him.\n\nI enclose Voucher in favour of Miss Alice Bell for Nursing services at the Cecilia Jeffrey School from September 30th to October 8th, 9 days at $5.00 making a total of $45.00\n\nI took this matter up with the Principal and he informed me that Dr. Ferguson authorized this expenditure, and when I asked why he informed me that the nurses duties had been very heavy as a lot of the children had returned from vacation with itch and scabies and then she contracted the flu and had had to go to bed. I told him I considered it should have been the School's duty to provide a nurse when the regular one could not carry on but promised him I would forward the account for your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. I have made no alterations in the quarterly returns preferring these corrections to be made in Ottawa. Several applications have been received but returned to the principal as not signed by the parents. You will notice several applications are dated after the child was admitted to the school.\nDear sir,\n\nCapt. F. Edwards, he asks me again, that my boy, to go school, and I am not willing to go, that boy four more months he'll be 14 years old, and he work for us, and we are getting old, both of us. I am 57 years old, my wife 62, near same age, that's why I don't let that boy go. Capt. Edwards, he said to me, if you don't let that boy go, I'll send Policeman to get you and put you in jail. I wish you wrote to him not to do it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCouncillor Mark Shalagway\nDinowrie Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\n31st October, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Departmental letter # 128-3-10 of 25th instant enclosing letter from Mark Shabaquay, #65 Wabigoon Band, returned herewith.\n\nThis Indian is a Councillor of the Wabigoon Band. He has three sons living one 19 last June, one 16 last September and one Jack 13 last March.\n\nMark has continuously refused to send his boys to school, and we consider it absolutely essential that he should be forced to send the youngest for at least a short time until he is 16, as the Indians refuse to send their children when their Councillor will not send him.\n\nMark has promised on numerous occasions to send this boy, and when I saw him on the 17th instant, he promised me he would send the boy to the White Bay school at Dinorwic and if they would not take him there he would send him to the Kenora School.\n\nIt would have been almost impossible for the boy to attend the white day school daily owing to the distance from the reserve, and the Secretary Treasurer of that school informs me they will not take Treaty Indians as we have schools for them unless the Indians are living in the Village and paying rent.\n\nUnder the circumstances I recommend that we send the Police for this boy unless Mark sends the boy himself otherwise we shall have trouble in making the other Indians send their children to school when of age.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 24th ultimo regarding Martha Fine has been brought to my attention.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department approves her returning to the Cecilia Jeffrey school. You should point out to the Principal, of course, that the girl should continue her afternoon rest of at least one to two hours daily throughout the coming winter.\n\nProvided her physical condition remains satisfactory and that she is not a menace to the health of the other pupils in the school the Department has no objection to her remaining at Cecilia Jeffrey until June 30 next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKENORA, ONT.\u2014October 30th, 1937\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nRe: Pupil 0206, Una Wawance,\nIslington Band, #127.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our conversation over the telephone I wish to state for your information that I have re-checked the quarterly returns, and I find that the teacher of the Primary room placed this girl's name on her quarterly return, and also the teacher in the Intermediate room had the same pupil on her return.\n\nThe above pupil went home in June, 1936, and because of ill health, and being under Doctor's instructions, she did not return to School until September 11th, 1939. The record as shown on Sheet 1 of the quarterly return for September showing 19 days is correct, and the record on Sheet 2 of the quarterly return should not appear at all.\n\nI am sorry that this was overlooked, but the above pupil before leaving the school had been promoted to the Intermediate room, and was entered on the register of that room, but upon her return to the school, having lost one whole year, she was placed in the Beginners' room, which accounts for her name appearing in both rooms. I have asked the teachers to rectify this, and to see that her name appears only on the one register in future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKanora, Ontario,\nNovember 6th, 1939\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Departmental letter 129-3-10 of 17th ultimo re Una Kawance pupil #0206 Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal which explains that the pupil went home on June 15th in ill health and did not return till September 11th, 1939.\n\nThe record of 19 days as shown on Sheet 1 of the Quarterly Returns is correct and the record on sheet 2 should not appear at all.\n\nI regret this was overlooked when the Quarterly Returns were checked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo forwarding the September quarter return and a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey residential school I would refer you to official letter of October 13 last in which you were definitely informed that the under-mentioned children should be returned to their parents:\n\nVictoria Pitchener Alex Morriseau\nBirdie Cantin William Morriseau\n\nThe Department wishes its instructions in the above regard carried out immediately and no grant is being allowed for them. On several occasions in the past very definite instructions have been sent to all principals of residential schools that children whose eligibility for admission is doubtful on any grounds must not be admitted until all the facts are placed before the Department and our decision has been given.\n\nThe admission of Baptiste Big Blood, Ella Green and Joyce Green is approved. The application forms for Marie Louise Oshie and Mabel Redsky are being returned in order that you may state the religion of these children. This information is not given on the forms.

I would suggest that he be allowed to follow the normal routine of the school, including a certain amount of outdoor exercise, with the exception that he continue an afternoon rest hour of at least two hours daily and long hours of rest at night. We frequently find that after the lesion quietens down substantially, the change from the hospital to regular life and increased freedom of school or home is definitely beneficial.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\naboriginal belief. The agent, in his letter of October 4, stated that this man had been married to two women, both of whom belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, and that the mother of Victoria had attended the Kenora R. C. school. He stated, further, that the mother died in 1934 and that the father married (Indian fashion) another woman, who had also attended the McIntosh R. C. Indian residential school. It is noted that Bernard Napish, half brother to Victoria Pitchenese, son of the same mother but different father, is at present a pupil at the Cecilia Jeffrey school at Kenora.\n\nWe had nothing on file to indicate nor have we yet, that Harry Pitchenese was legally married to his first wife, the late mother of Victoria. If he was not legally married, the girl, under a ruling given by the law officers of the Crown, would be a Roman Catholic - the same religion as her mother - and would consequently be eligible for enrolment at the Kenora R. C. residential school.\n\nA great deal of the difficulty we have experienced here and a great deal of the annoyance created locally might have been avoided if this girl's claims for admission to the school had been carefully reviewed before she entered the institution. We are today communicating with the Indian agent, asking him to secure information, if he can, with respect to the marriage of Harry Pitchenese. If this Indian was legally married prior to the birth of Victoria, the girl is eligible for admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey school, and the principal of the school will be notified to this effect.\n\nI feel that I should, in fairness to myself, refer to the affidavit attached to the application form signed by Pitchenese, with respect to the admission of his daughter. We have learned from experience that these affidavit forms mean practically nothing. Affidavit forms have reached us on more than one occasion, signed by the same Indian parents anxious to secure admission for their children to either a Roman Catholic or a Protestant school. On such cases affidavits are frequently signed by half-breeds, whose children cannot, under any circumstances be enrolled at our residential schools. As a matter of fact, when an application form is accompanied by an affidavit, the officials become peculiarly diligent in their search for irregularities. This attitude on their part has developed as a result of experience from year to year.\n\nShould you require additional information, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 3, 1940.\n\nRe - Victoria Pitcheneese\n\nDear Dr. Johnston:\n\nIn response to your request, I am submitting herewith information secured from the departmental files in respect to the eligibility of the above noted student for enrolment at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school.\n\nThe regular admission form, signed by the father of Victoria Pitcheneese, is dated September 9, 1939. This admission form is signed by James Gardner as witness and by the medical officer, Dr. A. D. Ferguson. It is not signed, however, by the Indian agent, who invariably signs such forms before sending them forward to the Department, unless there is some dispute in respect to the religious status of the child or some dispute in respect to its racial status. On the admission form the religion of the father is given as \"None,\" father was Indian belief; mother Roman Catholic, father attended Cecilia Jeffrey school.\n\nAttached to this particular application form is an affidavit signed by Harry Pitcheneese, declaring that his religion is Protestant and expressing a desire to have his child educated at the Cecilia Jeffrey school. You will note, however, that this affidavit was not made out until September 25, whereas the admission form was dated September 2, 1939. This application form, along with a number of other somewhat similar application forms and all were carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the departmental officials. The admission of eight pupils, whose application forms for admission had been sent forward, was approved by the Department in a letter to the Indian agent dated October 13, 1939. It was pointed out, however, that certain pupils should not have been enrolled by the principal of the school until additional facts in respect to their parents and general history had been submitted to the Department for consideration. Two of these were declared ineligible under the new ruling, which renders half-breed children ineligible for enrolment at Indian residential schools. In the case of Victoria Pitcheneese, it was noted that her application form had not been signed by the Indian agent and was to that extent irregular and that this pupil should not have been enrolled until her case had been more fully investigated by the Department. You can readily appreciate how difficult it would be for the Department to administer residential schools if pupils were enrolled indiscriminately and the approval of the Department sought after the pupils were established in the school.\n\nIt would appear that when the Indian agent sought information from the father of Victoria Pitcheneese, the father declared that he was not a Protestant but was of aboriginal -\n\nReverend Robert Johnston, D.D.,\nKnox Presbyterian Church,\nElgin Street, Ottawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 4 and subsequent correspondence with reference to the application for the admission of Victoria Pitchener to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nYou did not state definitely in your letter whether or not this girl is legitimate or illegitimate. Please give me definite information in this regard.\n\nIn your letter of October 4 you stated that the mother died in 1934 but in Mr. Dyers' letter of October 17 which you forwarded with your letter of October 19 he stated that he had been informed that the mother died when the child was born.\n\nPlease make further inquiries and advise me which of the above statements is correct.\n\nIn either case please let me know who cared for the child from the time of the mother's death to the date on which she was sent to Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nIn your letter of October 19 there is the following sentence: \"In view of the Principal's letter I would be glad to receive further instructions as I feel confident the child was never brought up in the Protestant faith\".

I have no record of any application for admission handed me by Mr. Burns, Assistant Chief, who carried this woman according to the Indian Custom on the 15th September 1927. Therefore there is no question as to legitimacy.\n\nA letter of the 4th October states the mother died in 1934, to be exact she died the 3rd day of July, 1934 at the Reserve of Tuberculosis, and Victoria was the last child she had. The Principal is not correct when he says she died at childbirth, and in any case this child was six years old when the mother died.\n\nAfter the death of the mother the child was taken care of by the Grandmother Mrs. George Habish of Eagle Lake Band. This woman is of Aboriginal belief, and she brought her up until she was taken to school.\n\nMy reason for stating \"I feel confident the child was never brought into the school\" is that her father although attending the Cecilia Jeffrey School, always claims he is of Indian belief, his wife the child's mother went to the Roman Catholic School and is a Catholic as well as also her son, brother of Victoria but illegitimate, at present a pupil in the Kenora R.C. School. In addition to this Harry Pitchenese is married again to a girl who is a Catholic and attended the McIntosh R.C. School.\n\nIf approval is given for the girl to attend the Cecilia Jeffrey School, I don't think there will be any objection now by any of the Indians, although her eligibility is doubtfull.\n\nI have today seen the Chiefs of the Eagle Lake Band and he informs me the Grandmother who brought up the child belongs to the Indian Religion, according to my records this is\nDear Sir,\n\nReference Department letter 129-3-10 of 4th inst.\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School was refused permission to admit Victoria Pitchensese as a grant earning pupil to his school and there has been considerable correspondence in the case.\n\nThe girl's father Harry Pitchensese now writes that he is now a Protestant as is also his Mother Mrs Mary English of Eagle Lake Band and although his step-son Bernard is a pupil at the Kenora R.C. Residential School, it might be better to allow Victoria to be admitted to the Cecilia Jeffrey School, as this is now their wish and it will satisfy all concerned.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 5th and 16th instant with reference to Victoria Pitahanasee. Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letters and it has been decided to approve her admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. With reference to the 5th paragraph of your letter of the 5th instant I would point out that the Department would appreciate it if in future you would ascertain all facts in a case before making a statement to the effect that an applicant is a member of any church.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nYou can readily understand, in view of a statement of this character from our senior official in Manitoba, how impossible it is for the officers here to reach a decision quickly if at all in respect to these particular pupils. I can only promise you that as soon as the time at my disposal will enable me to do so I shall be glad to review again all the information we have on file in respect to the daughter of Alex Macdonald. I cannot help but express regret that so-called religious rivalry has reached such a stage on this Reserve that it has become somewhat puzzling and perplexing to the Indian residents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1840.\n\nDear Doctor Johnston:\n\nThe records here indicate that the Department authorized the admission of Victoria Pitchemese to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in a letter to the Agent dated January 24, 1840. This is the pupil whose religious status was in dispute and about whom you spoke to me a few weeks ago.\n\nIn the case of the daughter of Alex Mecous of the Waynayassappo Reserve, Manitoba, I may state that the Department is in receipt of a letter dated January 5, 1840, from Inspector Hamilton which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"This child was admitted to the Pine Creek R.C. Residential School in 1839 and apparently at that time Alex Mecous, the father, was a Catholic. In October of the past year, however, I was advised by the Rev. Mr. Lockhart that Alex was baptised by him and became a member of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Crump, the missionary on the Waynayassappo Reserve, is not a fully ordained minister. Therefore, the Rev. K.H. Lockhart supervises Mr. Crump's work and administers certain rites of the Church. The statement was prepared at the Rirtle Residential School and signed in the presence of Mr. Crump and Mary Bagg after which Alex was baptised by Mr. Lockhart.\n\nUnfortunately there is great rivalry on this Reserve between the Presbyterian minister and Father Crump with the result that many of the Indians do not know from day to day to which Church they belong.\"\n\nRev.

The father of the child is a patient in the Fort William Sanatorium and the mother is with him, and staying somewhere in Fort William.\n\nOther members of the family are in this school and although the child is not yet of school age, I would recommend that her admission as a grant earning pupil be approved as the Principal is willing to accept her, and it would relieve the family of part of their financial burden. They have been receiving relief from the school, and the Department had authorized us to give relief to the family whilst the man was in the Sanatorium to the value of $8.00 a month.\n\nVouchers to the value of $8.00 for the month of July and $8.00 for the month of August will be sent you in a few days; the school had supplied them with considerably more than this allowance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n129-3-10\n\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 18th instant it has been decided to approve the admission of Emily Shirley Agnes Churchill to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

In his case there was considerable correspondence, however I would now suggest that the application be approved as the father sent the boy back and wishes him in this school.\n\nThe following have no applications in this office:\n\n- Edgar Sinclair\n- Herbert Major\n- Jim Williams\n- William Cameron\n- Birdie Cantin\n\nSome of the children were admitted by the last Principal without informing us, and some of the children's application forms are completed but the new Principal is waiting for the result of the X-ray. In my opinion all the children with the possible exception of Cantin are eligible for admission to this Protestant School, and I think the grant should be paid for them all.\n\nI have certified the returns to enable the Principal to get the grant, if they were held up until all the application\nJune Return Shows\n317 - Jas.

Part of this return appears to have been entered by one person, part by another and a third section has been typewritten. It is felt that you should direct the attention of the new Principal to the fact that the preparation of the quarterly return is most important and consequently one person should handle it. In entering the return only one name should be shown on each line of the form. The names of the boys and girls should be entered in separate sections and in each case the names should be shown consecutively according to number.\n\nThe June quarter return showed James Highblood as No. 817 and Adam Highblood as No. 818. On the September quarter return these numbers were reversed. You should point out to the Principal that the numbers shown on the June return should be retained on future returns.\n\nThe name of Mabel Redsky, No. 0345, was shown on the June quarter return but does not appear on the September return although no application has been received for her discharge. Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nNo reply appears to have been received to my letter of April 17 regarding Jack Cheene, No. 856.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve the admission of Birdie Cantin, No. 273. It is considered that the instructions given some months ago to have this boy returned to his parents should have been carried out.\n\nMr. J.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nNenora, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Mr. Edwards,\n\nI have received your letter of the 15th written by Mr. Alfred, the father of the boy named [name].\n\nI do not think I can make an exception under such special circumstances. The boy is doing well in this school and we are very pleased.\n\nHowever, if the admission is not approved, and the Department still wishes, I am prepared (regretfully) to return the boy to his father. Could you, sir, give me further information? I understand that he lives in other places.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature] J. O. Pitts,\nPrincipal.\nI therefore think the Department should now approve his admission to the Swilkin Jeffrey Residential School as the father informs me that none of the family were baptized by either of the religious faiths.\n\nIndie Cuntin's father has left for Gold Rock, which is a considerable distance away from the railway and post office and it will be difficult to get in touch with him at the present time.\n\nApplications for admission for all children at present in the school will be forwarded as soon as completed.\n\nThe pupils listed\u2014Chilly, James, 269a, 271a, and 274a\u2014were apparently in the school in 1889.\n\nI believe the children were not shown on the register, but letters are being completed and will be forwarded, and I do not think there will be any objection to their admission.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Departmental Letter 149-3-10 of the 24th ultimo re September returns of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. We had already taken up with the Principal the matter of having the returns made out in the proper way, and he has assured us this will be done in the future.\n\nWe also called his attention to the fact that James Bigblood was shown as No. 217, and Adam Bigblood as No. 219. This has now been corrected.\n\nTo Michel Rudzky, No. 0243. Apparently your letter is incorrect. She was shown on the March quarter. She was omitted from the June quarter, but was again shown on the September quarter. She attended school in every quarter, but there was an error in making up the returns; her name was omitted in the June return. An application was not made for grant for her for that quarter. I do not know whether the Department would now allow them the amount.\n\nNo. No. 256 Jack Ohenea. This boy died on the 25th March 1940.\n\nNo. No. 275a, Birdie Cantin. Enclosed please find copy of letter received from the Principal of the school. The late Principal, Mr. Hyers, was instructed on numerous occasions to return this boy to his parents, but was omitted to do so, and after the holidays this boy was sent back to school by his father as he wished him to be educated at the school. On the 2nd of October 1940, I met the father at Wabigoon and he informed me then that the boy was back at school, and that he wanted him to be educated at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. He did not want him sent home or sent to the Roman Catholic Residential School.\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the September quarter return of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. With regard to Birdie Cantin, No. 375, he has remained in the Cecilia Jeffrey School but if there is any protest regarding his admission it should be distinctly understood that the whole matter will be reviewed.\n\nConsiderable trouble would have been saved if the Principal had carried out Departmental instructions. You should point out to the new Principal that when definite instructions are received from the Department regarding the discharge of a pupil he will be expected to comply at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

I hereby make special application to the Department to ask that Leonard be admitted to our school, and enclose the proper forms.\n\nThe mother and father had tried to make arrangements for the keep of their boy. The friends who have cared for him have now run out of relief and the Relief officer is hesitant about caring for a ward of the Government. Also, the Relief Department is planning to send this family to a distant town.\n\nI am aware of the difficulties involved, but would ask that you would request of Ottawa that special consideration be given to this family in their present trouble.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincoval.\nKenora, Ontario\nApril 25th 1934\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School together with an Application for Admission of Leonard Howard Churchill, No. 90 Lac des Mille Lacs Band.\n\nThis boy was born on the 19th April 1931, and therefore, is only three years of age. I pointed out to the Principal that the Department's ruling is that children under school age cannot now be admitted as grant earning pupils. However, he asked me to send the application in which I do now although I have not signed it.\n\nThe Lac des Mille Lacs Band is now in the Fort Arthur Agency. The father of the children is in the Port William Sanatorium and I am given to understand that the mother is working in the institution.\n\nAll the children in the possession of this boy are now pupils at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. As the parents cannot keep him he has been left with some half-breeds in Kenora who are on Town relief and I know of nobody who can take the child, as neither the father nor the mother has lived on the reserve for very many years.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions in this case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.\nOttawa,\nApril 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant it has been decided to approve the admission of Leonard Churchill to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThis is a special concession and should not be taken as a precedent for the future. I feel that there is a tendency to place in residential schools children of tender years. This should be discouraged as our residential schools are not primarily intended for pupils under 7 years of age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\n26th August, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principals of both the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School and the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School have been in to see me in regard to receiving a small grant to enable them to bring the pupils back to their schools after the holidays.\n\nThere is no doubt they are put to considerable expense and a grant is usually allowed them, by doing this we have very little expense by the Mounted Police in getting truants, and I would recommend that an amount not exceeding $50.00 be authorized for each school, when Bands have a cash distribution this fall, part could be obtained as a refund from some of the Indians.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated, as the children should return in a few days and we have received a number of letters from different points, some distance from here, in which the Indians say they have no money to return their children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant the Department will allow an amount of $50.00 for transportation of pupils returning to the Kenora Indian Residential School after the summer holidays and a similar amount for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It is understood, of course, that if possible the total amount should not be spent. Every effort should be made to have the parents return the children without cost either to the Department or the school authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant the Department will allow an amount of $50.00 for transportation of pupils returning to the Kenora Indian Residential School after the summer holidays and a similar amount for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Ex-Chief William Gardner of the Wabigoon Band, he requests permission to allow his son Frank, born 3rd March 1930 to attend the White Day School at Dinorwic, where other Indian and half-breeds are attending. To do this he would have to have Frank discharged from the Cecilia Jeffrey School where he is pupil #259.\n\nThe Ex-Chief has rented a house in Dinorwic, and made arrangements with the school, where he will pay for the boy's education himself, and will also send his youngest daughter to the same school.\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School himself thinks we should make an exception in this case and allow the boy Frank to go to the white day school at Dinorwic, providing we get assurance the child attends regularly.\n\nFor your information I may say that William Gardner has made a little money by the sale of mining claims to an American Company, and receives payment in installments that will take care of his expenses for a while.\n\nI suggest that we approve the discharge of Frank Gardner, on the above conditions and that we ask the teacher at the Dinorwic School to notify us monthly as to the attendance, and if the child does not attend regularly he is to be brought back to the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo you may inform the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School that the Department approves the discharge of Frank Gardner on the conditions mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nMyself and my wife and all my family except Thomas are Presbyterians and my wife and the other children all went to the Cecilia Jeffrey Presbyterian School.\n\nI know that the Kenora Indian Residential School is a Catholic school and the reason I want my boy educated at this school is because it is nearer to where I live where I am caretaker of the Indian Camp property and I have no money to pay for hire of taxi to the Cecilia Jeffrey School in order to see my boy which is about five miles or more from where I live.\n\nMy other children have been discharged from the school. Another reason is the Principal of the Presbyterian School does not help myself or my children now they have left the school and the Principal of the R. C. helps the Indians.\n\nAnother reason is there is too much T. B. at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nSworn before me at the Indian Office this 23rd day of October 1941.\n\nTown of Kenora, District of Kenora, Province of Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\nVol. 19, File 6290, Pt. 1-10, part 2\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe above named Indian is the caretaker of the Indian Camp property here, and I am writing to him about his boy Thomas aged 7 years and 6 months. He at first refused to send the boy to school although of school age, when I informed him we could not keep him on as caretaker of the Indian property, and that if he did not send his boy to school, action would have to be taken under section 10 of the Indian Act, he agreed to let the boy go, but wished him to go to the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School and signed the enclosed affidavit, giving reasons such as they are.\n\nTom Williamson did not go to school, but his wife, and all the other children went to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School (Presbyterian) and it is reported to me the whole family belong to the Presbyterian Church although they do not attend services.\n\nThere is another case of Chief Allan Payton #9 Rat Postage Bank, who has a girl aged 12 last December, and a boy aged 9 last May. The Chief himself and his wife, both went to the Cecilia Jeffrey Presbyterian School, he has three children Girl born 29th December 1928, boy born 9th May, 1932, and an infant boy born 23rd August 1941. The two oldest children both are of school age and he has been instructed on several occasions to take these children to school, but has not done so. The Chief was married legally at the Court House, Kenora, by the Reverend R. Bairn, (now deceased) he being either a Presbyterian or a Methodist Minister. It is reported that the Chief if he sends his children, wishes them to go to the Catholic School.\n\nI hold no brief for any school, but feel that if these children are made to attend, which they should do, that they should go to the Cecilia Presbyterian School, and not the Catholic School, but I shall be glad to get your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nDistrict of Kenora,\nProvince of Ontario\nDominion of Canada.\n\nI, Allan Paypom, #93 Rat Portage Band make oath\nand say, the reason I wish to have my children\neducated in the Kenora R. C. Indian Residential\nSchool is, that at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian\nResidential School there is too much tuberculosis.\nIt is too far from Kenora, therefore too expensive\nto go to see them. They do not get fed well\nenough at the Cecilia Jeffrey and the water in\nthe lake is dirty. My wife and I both went\nto the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\nbut neither are baptized and are of Indian belief.\nI know that the Kenora R. C. School is a Catholic\ninstitution and that the children are brought up\nin the Catholic faith.\n\nSworn before me at the\nTown of Kenora, District\nof Kenora, this 4th day of\nNovember, 1941.\n\n[Signature]\nChief Allan Paypom\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nChief Allan Paypam of the Rat Portage Band has two children of school age, a girl, Verma Allan born 29th December, 1928 and a boy, Russell, born 9th May, 1930. We have for some time been endeavouring to get him to put his children to school, but he would not do so until now when we threatened him with a fine or imprisonment unless he did.\n\nBoth the Chief and his wife are ex-pupils of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, but inform me they have not been baptised Presbyterians, although I believe the woman was but have no record here.\n\nHowever the Chief informs me he has taken the younger girl to the Kenora Roman Catholic School, and will send the boy next year.\n\nI informed him it was against the regulations to put the children in a different school from the parents, unless he could give good reasons, and he then made the enclosed affidavit giving his reasons. None of the reasons are of any value, as far as they go, and it is immaterial to me which school they attend, but under the circumstances I am very glad to receive your instructions as the Roman Catholic School has enough pupils for the grant, whereas the Cecilia Jeffrey School is very short of pupils.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the N.C.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Discharge of Children at AGE 16\n\nDear Captain Edwards:\n\nLast year, sixteen of our children left school because they were, or shortly would be 16 years of age. Of that number, I can only find record of three of their wives. None went could be called \"productive labour\" for our Economic system. The remainder merely went home to the reserves and put in time.\n\nMay I submit for consideration the following plan: That unless the parents can show need at home for the child, or unless the child has a home to go to, which can supply gainful employment, good moral surroundings, and that amount of supervision and discipline needed for developing children, or unless there is a position open for employment of the child, (over which the principal, Indian agent or church representative could keep supervision to attend to the interests of the child),\n\nThe child should be allowed to stay in the school, at least until he or she reaches the age of seventeen. (i.e., That the age be extended to 17, and the child only be discharged if the parent can supply a better environment or a need, and not be automatically discharged at sixteen.)\n\nThis past year we have barely kept up to our quota, and for one month were below it.\n\nThe children at 16 are hardly up to the moral standard of white children of the same age. The boys have not reached their full strength and are, therefore, not able to stand right into manual labour. When they are ready and able, they have forgotten part of their training in the schools; the likewise are used to, and prefer, the lazy life on the reserve. The girls are just at the weak age of adolescence, and that the inhibitions and training of a mother which most of the white children have, are liable to, (and often do) become wrongly associated with men.\n\nIf the children could remain for one year after the legal discharge age, they might be allowed to leave the school at\nMarch 25, 1947.\n\nCaptain F. Edwards - Cont'd.\n\nany time that a position opened up for them. This year, I have had six requests for boys or girls, all good homes, but was forced to refuse them because, (a) children were under 16, and (b) our quota was already low. If we could let children go to these homes, and have authority to keep a watch on their interests for say, one year, I feel that this would be a good step in the \"follow up\" plan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nToronto.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received your letter dated [date] regarding the principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in reference to [specific issue].\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\n[Signature]\n\nOffice of the Minister\nOttawa\nMarch 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. With regard to the question raised in his letter, please refer him to Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act. The Department is always prepared to consider representations from Principals or Indian Agents with regard to keeping children in Residential schools after the age of 18. However, very valid reasons must be presented before we can approve such action.\n\nIn view of the shortage of labour at the present time, I feel that no undue restrictions should be placed on boys and girls of 18 years of age obtaining employment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa\nApril 14, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking the March quarter return of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School it is noted that the pupils numbered 0239, 197 and 256 are stated to be 16 years of age or over. At the end of June you should either apply for the discharge of these pupils or request that they be retained for a further period. In the latter event full particulars should be given regarding the reasons for wishing to retain them.\n\nThe names of pupils numbered as follows are shown on the December quarter return but do not appear on the March quarter return, although no application has been received for their discharge:\n\nNo. 0196\n- 0196\n- 0243\n- 200\n- 231\n\nPlease advise regarding these pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffery Residential School re discharge of pupils etc.\n\nIf the Department approves I would recommend that Mr. Pitts suggestions regarding the pupils mentioned be followed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrom: Edwards,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont\n\nApril 10, 1942 (as on the March 31 Return)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nApril 20th, 1942.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKEWORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of April 17\n\nI hereby make application to the department for the discharge of pupils #197, Frank Sinclair,\n#0186 Janet Mandamin,\n#0239 Jessie Peters.\n\nThere are positions available in good homes for these three children and in accordance with the wish of the department that we should help during the present period of shortage of labour, and in the best interests of the children themselves, I would recommend their discharge.\n\nWith regard to pupil #26, Arthur Gardiner, I hereby make application to the department to consider his remaining in the school for the next term. He has expressed a wish to remain. His father is in the army, and both his father and mother live with another \"partner\". If we should be successful in getting a good home and position for this boy, I shall apply for his discharge later.\n\nP.S.\n\nRe: Discharge of pupils at Sun.\n\nIn accordance with previous instructions from you, we carried these children for the balance of the quarter in which they went to the Sanatorium, with remarks that they had gone and the date, and then automatically dropped them. I was under the impression that this was the usual and correct procedure. However if it is necessary to apply for their discharge, I hereby make application to the department for the discharge of these children. (This will mean their re-admission with a new number if they return from the Sun. Is that correct?)\n\n#0196, Donna Keslok,\n#0198, Maxene Pinesse,\n#0225, Mary Major,\n#200, Jim Macdonald,\n#231, Horace Paikin,\n\nand also, #0197, Janet Groves, who went to Dynesvor Hospital March 10, 1942 (as on the March 31 Return).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 25, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, you may inform the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 107 Frank Sinclair\nNo. 0186 Janet Mandamin\nNo. 0285 Jesse Peters\nNo. 0196 Donna Kosiek\nNo. 0199 Marlene Pinson\n\nNo. 0035 Mary Major\nNo. 000 Jim Macdonald\nNo. 031 Horace Paish\nNo. 0197 Janet Greene\n\nIf, at any time in the future, it is desired to re-admit any of the above children, a request for such permission should be forwarded and, if approved, such pupil should be given the same register number as they formerly had.\n\nIn view of the request of the Principal, Arthur Gardiner, No. 286, may remain in the school for a further period. It is noted that if the Principal is able to secure a position for him he will apply for the boy's discharge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

He proposes changing his permanent residence from North West Angle Reserve No. 37 to North West Angle Reserve No. 34A which is just across a narrow body of water from the Whitefish Bay Reserve No. 32A - where the Whitefish Bay Day School is situated.\n\nCharley Oshie's reason for wishing to make this change is that he spends too much money making periodic trips with his wife from North West Angle to Kenora during the school term to visit his children in the residential school. His present plan is to build a home on Reserve 34A so that the children may live at home and attend the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nMay I be advised - prior to the opening of the Cecelia Jeffry school term on September 5th, if possible - whether this transfer would be in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nC.

May 26, 1943.\n\n- 3 -\n\nTrusting that something can be done for this boy as soon as possible, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. H. Wolfe,\nMagistrate.\nKENORA, ONT. May 26, 1943.\n\nFor the reason which I have just stated I telephoned to your agent, Mr. Swartman, at Sioux Lookout, in the hope that arrangements could be made to have this boy placed in an Indian School. Mr. Swartman informed me that although the mother was a Treaty Indian, the boy had not been entered in Treaty and therefore could not be placed in an Indian School without first having his case dealt with by the proper authorities. This I think was confirmed by you in our telephone conversation.\n\nRather than place this boy in the Gaol on his arrival I arranged with the Salvation Army here to take care of him for a few days until something could be done. This was on May 20th and the boy is still with the Salvation Army. As it would be unfair to ask them to keep him very long unless some way could be found to pay for his keep I would appreciate it very much if arrangements could be made within a reasonably short time to have him admitted to one of the Indian Schools. I realize that at the best this may take a little time and it has occurred to me that possibly he might be taken care of in the meantime by one of your Schools near Kenora. The boy's mother I understand is an Anglican.\n\nFrom what I have seen of this boy I am of the opinion that he has no natural criminal tendencies but got himself into these difficulties as a result of being at a loose end with no supervision of any kind. He is a bright, likeable little fellow and I am convinced that with proper supervision and training he would give a very good account of himself. He is nine years old and should be attending school.\nKENORA, ONT. May 26, 1943.\n\nInspector Hamilton,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs suggested in our telephone conversation yesterday I give you herewith particulars in connection with the situation of this boy.\n\nI am informed by Provincial Constable A. Gaudry of Red Lake, that this boy lived there with his mother, grandmother and an aunt, all of whom are Treaty Indians. The boy has had no supervision and has been running more or less at large, frequently in pool rooms and generally getting himself into trouble. A few months ago the boy admitted stealing cigarettes from a small store but no charge was laid. Later on May 4th the boy admitted entering a pool room and barber shop by means of a skeleton key and stealing around $5.00 from the cash register. A charge under Section 460 of the Criminal Code of Canada was laid and upon instructions from the Crown Attorney, L. A. McLenan, he was brought to Kenora and appeared in Court on May 20th.\n\nOrdinarily a white boy under such circumstances would be sent to a Training School, but I have considered it unwise to send the boy who appears to be a full blooded Indian to a Training School where all the other boys are white. I am afraid that it would be impossible for those in charge at the School to prevent the white boys from making it rather miserable for an Indian boy. To return the boy to Red Lake where he would continue to live under the worst possible conditions it seems to me as out of the question.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from Magistrate Wolfe of Kenora. Mr. Smartman is away on treaty so I am unable to supply any further information. Apparently the boy has not been voted into treaty but has lived the Indian mode of life along with his mother and relatives who apparently are treaty.\n\nYou will note magistrate Wolfe is anxious to dispose of the case and I would be pleased to have the Department's decision at the earliest possible date.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1843.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man., has forwarded to me your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to John Redman. From the information before us we are not entirely certain that this boy is recognized as a Treaty Indian. However, our Agents who have the information are at present absent on Treaty payments and it has been decided to have the boy placed temporarily in the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. As you are aware, this school is just outside of Kenora. I am writing to the principal directing him to call for the boy and take him to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. T.H. Wolfe,\nRegistrarate,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. T.H. Wolfe, Police Magistrate of Kenora, has brought to our attention the case of a boy named John Pemian from Red Lake. Apparently this boy has committed some infractions of the criminal code but the Police Magistrate considers he should be placed in an Indian residential school. At the present time he is in the Salvation Army Home in Kenora. Please interview Police Magistrate Wolfe immediately and arrange to take the boy to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.S.

He is a boy with a hunch-back, his mentality is approximately 10 years of age. He is an epileptic, often having as many as four attacks within 24 hours. This boy should be in a home if there were one available. He is often more like the small boys. However, as he would receive no proper treatment at home, and there does not appear to be any institution for this type of Indian, we hereby request that he be allowed to remain in Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nWe hereby request admission for the following pupils:\n\n| No. | Name                          |\n|-----|-------------------------------|\n|     | Harold Hunter                |\n|     | Allen Carpenter              |\n|     | Walter Prince                |\n|     | William George Isaac Abraham |\n|     | William Morrison             |\n|     | Louis Morrison               |\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 20th 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\n\nEnclosed please find Applications for Admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School; also the request for discharge of pupils as per attached letter.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1943.\n\nMr. N.

From the information that we have been able to secure it appears that the mother of these children is recognized as an Indian, but, as the children are non-Treaty, it is presumed that the father is a white man. If this information is correct, these children are not eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to an Indian residential school and consequently should be discharged immediately. If you so desire, you can forward another communication to the Department giving full particulars regarding this family, as present indications are that they are not even eligible to reside on the reserve.\nI also desire to refer you to a letter received from Acting Indian Agent Roberts on February 4, 1943, with regard to an application form for Mary Gardner, No. 0877 of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.

S. Ferguson\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-3-10\nof March 23rd last with reference to the Application for\nAdmission of Jennie McDonald, 194 Iallington Band to the\nOceilla Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI have checked further into the family history of the\ngirl by pursuing some old records. It appears that the\nfather of Jennie - Louis John McDonald and the mother - Elsie\nReid - were married Indian fashion on March 10th 1936., and\nthen on March 20th 1937 were married legally to Thomas\nSanderson of the Church of England. The first born of\nthis family was Jennie born January 12th, 1937. Elsie\nReid, the mother died on April 2nd 1939. The step-mother,\nElsie Beattie, is a Roman Catholic but is now married to\nJoseph Cameron, No. 162 Iallington Band, who is shown on the\nrecords as belonging to the Church of England.\n\nThe foregoing is submitted for your information.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa\nApril 31, 1944.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in further reference to the application for admission of Jennie McDonald to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. In your letter of the 30th ultimo you stated that both the child's parents followed the Catholic religion. The information contained in your letter of April 17 indicates that they were members of the Church of England. The Department is at a loss to understand the divergence between these two statements and consequently I should appreciate hearing further from you in regard to the matter.\n\nI should also like to know what relationship Mrs. Bella McDonald bears to Jennie McDonald, on whose authority was the latter placed in charge of Mrs. Bella McDonald?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKenora, Ontario.\nApril 24th 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe Jennie McDonald - 194 Islington Band\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-3-10\nof the 21st instant in connection with the Application\nfor Admission of the above noted to the Cecilia Jeffrey\nIndian Residential School.\n\nIn my letter of the 20th ultimo, it was stated that,\n\"The child's parents, who are both deceased, followed the\nRoman Catholic Faith.\" This information was taken from\nthe Census book of the Band where it was clearly entered\nas, Religion = R.C.\n\nUpon receipt of your second communication dated\nMarch 23rd, I rechecked as requested, and in my reply\nof the 17th instant I stated that old records were found\nwhich listed the religion as the Church of England, and\nthe discrepancy in the census book was corrected. In\nthis letter, the family history as outlined as correct\nas the records here will allow. The error in showing\nthe parents of this child as being of the R.C. Faith has,\nI admit, caused some confusion. However, this is an clear\na history as it is possible to give.\n\nLouis John McDonald, 194 Islington, Jennie's father,\nwas a nephew of Jacob McDonald, 126 Islington, husband\nof Mrs Bella McDonald, who was Jennie's Guardian, which would\nmake her an aunt by marriage. Mrs Bella McDonald has kept\nJennie since she was one year old under family agreement.\n\nAt Treaty time she was definitely given the child to\nkeep, as the grandmother of Jennie, Mrs Eliza Chisel, who\nis a bad character, wanted to take her to Sioux Lookout.\nThis arrangement was agreed to by the Chief and\nCouncillors of the band and approved by myself.\n\nNorma Watson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1944.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, in further reference to the application for the admission of Jennie McDonald to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. You may inform the Principal that her admission is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from Principal's Report regarding the Cecilia Jeffrey School.

Mr. Pitt was advised that the children came to the Walker Indian Reserve north west of Kenora on the Rainy River and that it would involve considerable expense to return them to the school. It also meant the hiring of a guide and a motor boat. Mr. Pitt commented on the expenditure and suggested that it might possibly be an example to others who did not return to the school of their own accord.\n\nThe officer hired a guide and motor boat and had the letter freighted from Kenora to the Rainy River, a total mileage of 30 miles by boat was necessary to apprehend the delinquents and return them to the Oceola Indian School.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nThis letter will confirm our conversation of Friday March 9th.\n\nAs you will remember, this man wrote to both yourself and to us asking to be allowed to send his children to our school. Since we are still considerably below quota, and since by all rights and precedents, his children should go to this school, we were in favour of accepting them.\n\nHowever, in order to cooperate with your wishes, we agreed to try to discourage Moses in his attempt to put his two children into the Cecilia Jeffrey School until after the present term. He evidently blames us and thinks that we do not want his children. This is not so. We would be very glad to have them.\n\nIt appears now that he has taken the two boys to the St. Mary's Indian School. In view of the above, and also the fact that the mother of the boys (the first wife to Moses), the present wife, and Moses himself are Protestant, it seems that they should not only be not admitted to St. Mary's but that further action should be taken. We believe that the boys should be forbidden to stay even as boarders, but should be admitted to the school to which they belong and to which he first intended to send them.\n\nThis case is even more outstanding than that of the Dan Kopineese children, for which there has been no action taken. We still have no reply to our letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa.\n\nKenora, Ontario  \nApril 6th, 1944\n\nRe: Children of Moses Bird - #79 Whitefish Bay.\n\nHerewith attached, please find letter from Mr. D.S. Pitts, Principal, Cecilia Jeffrey R.C. School, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nOn December 14th, 1944, Moses Bird advised me by letter, he intended to place his two boys, Raymond and James in a Residential School in Kenora, and asked me to advise him what to do. I answered, that his boy Raymond could not be admitted to a residential school as he was already 11 years old at a day school, and that James, who is only 5 years old was under age for admission.\n\nBird was asked to call at the office when he was in town, to discuss this case with me. When he finally came to see me, he was advised that I would not sanction his boys' admittance to any Residential school as he had work on the reserve and the boy was doing very well there at the day school. He later moved to Kenora with his family and unknown to me, had his two boys placed in the Kenora R.C.I.R. School and not in the Cecilia Jeffrey School as he first had intended. This was done so that he could force the issue.\n\nMr. Pitts' letter will explain further his action in this matter. These two boys are now at the Kenora R.C. School and I am told that he now wishes to become a Catholic with his children.\n\nIt is my humble opinion, that if this man is allowed to change his spots simply to defy the regulations and to defy authority, then the Department's regulations concerning the admission of children to the different schools will mean nothing whatever to either the parents of the children involved or to the School principals. My attitude in such cases is a neutral one, but I do believe the Principals of the schools here should be given some concrete and definite instructions concerning such cases.\n\nAttached applications have not been signed by me, and your decision in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 11, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn reviewing the March quarter return of the Kenora Residential School, it is noted that the names of James and Raymond Bird are shown as numbers 246 and 260, respectively. The attached application forms were also forwarded, but these were not approved by the Indian Agent and are consequently returned. No grant is being allowed for these children for the period they were in the school during the March quarter.\n\nI may say further that I have a letter from the Indian Agent, in which he states that Moses Bird and both his first wife and second wife have always been recognised as Protestants. Bird applied to the Agent for permission to place the children in a residential school. As Bird was a Protestant, Mr. Paterson presumed that he wished to place his children in the Cecilia Jeffrey School. The Agent refused to approve of such action, as one of the boys is under school age, and besides, Bird is in a position to provide for his children. I regret very much that the children were accepted at the Kenora School, under the above circumstances and without consulting the Indian Agent, as such action undermines the agent's authority.\n\nIn government-owned Indian residential schools children do not be maintained without the approval of the Department; both of these boys should be returned to their fathers immediately, and I feel certain that you will carry out these instructions at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Pielen,\nChief, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nGATANA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Pielen:\n\nI am very sorry that there appears to be some misunderstanding over my telegram requesting your authority for an earlier closing date for our school. The conditions under which the request was made seem much more important to us here than they evidently do to the Department in Ottawa.\n\nThrough experience of several years, it has been found advisable to allow the children to leave for the holidays from both schools on the same day. To that end, therefore, Father Gomau and I, in complete agreement, co-operate in arranging some time ahead that our day will coincide. This year that practice had been carried out.\n\nThe reason for working together is that several families or relatives or friends are intermingled in both schools. The parents sometimes send one family or hire a boat or truck to pick up the children from both schools at once. It is very unfortunate if another trip is necessary from a distance of 50 to 70 miles because one school is not ready. At the same time, we have found that if a few children are let out ahead, the others become restless and think they should be allowed to go. Considerable ill-feeling may be aroused among parents or bands.\n\nOur policy has also been to set as \"closing dates\" the earliest possible day when children may leave. They may leave any day after the set date but not before. We set that day as Graduation Day with a Service and Prize Day.\n\nOur reasons had nothing whatever to do with the Religious significance but were only realistic. If we had known some time ahead we might have written and Mr. Paterson could have explained the matter at treaty.\n\nAs it was, the early closing was a problem for the school staff, not any particular advantage. We had to revise our plans, rush Graduation, and engage extra help to take care of the period before July. However we felt it was worth-while in keeping peace among our Indians.\n\nWe hope that this explanation may clear up the situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 9, 1945.\n\nMr. H.

I am informed that the father phoned the Principal of the Reserve School and requested that he be placed in that institution. Until this boy's religious status is definitely settled, we are not prepared to approve his admission.\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School should be aware that when there is any doubt regarding a child's eligibility, such child should not be accepted until final decision has been made by this Department. I trust it will not be again necessary to direct Mr. Pitts' attention to this regulation which has been in effect for many years at all Residential Schools.\n\nIt is not necessary for Mr. Pitts to consult other Indians. All the facts should be sent to us through your office. Please show Mr. Pitts this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 10th October, 1963.\n\nDear Father Comeau:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to Archie Queweymane. It has been stated that the Mother agrees to the boy being enrolled at Cecilia Jeffrey School, although from information contained in your letter regarding this matter, I would presume that she prefers Kenora Residential School.\n\nI feel that you should discuss this case with Indian Agent Paterson whom I feel wishes to be fair.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C.F. Comeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your 129-3-10 dated the 10th instant in connection with the above noted.\n\nI have been informed by Chief Horace Spence of the Selkirk Band, that the parents of Archie, have moved into their trapping grounds, north of One Man Lake, and that they cannot be contacted at present. They will be coming to Kenora at Christmas time and the matter of Archie's religious status will be taken up with them at that time.\n\nThis boy is still at the School as it would entail some hardship to have him returned to his parents. I would recommend that he be kept at the School until such time as this whole matter can be definitely cleared up.\n\nNorman Patterson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 2nd November, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to Archie Newsonance. It is noted that you cannot obtain at the present time any further information regarding his religious status and that it would be a hardship to return him to his parents. Under the circumstances he may remain at the Cecilia Jeffrey School until Christmas but the Principal of that school should understand definitely that the Department has not yet made any decision regarding the eligibility of this boy for admission to the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nThis difficulty could easily have been avoided if the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School had carried out the instructions given on several occasions to the effect that any child whose eligibility is doubtful on any grounds should not be admitted to any school until all facts have been placed before the Department and our decision has been given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSept. 4th, 1945.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the OCECILIA JEFFREY (PRESBYTERIAN) Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Chasawagwah\nEnglish name: GEORGE ROBERTS (WAPIEKZ)\nAge: 8 yrs. 5 mos., born May 5, 1936\nName of Band: SHOAL LAKE 39\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 46\nFather's full name and No.: John Roberts (Wapike)\nMother's full name and No.: Roberta\nParents living or dead: LIVING\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Indian Belief\nDoes applicant speak English?

(Quarantine card lifted on October 22nd.)\n\nSeveral of the children were held back from re-admission to school from holidays, for the quarantine. We lose their grant.\n\nRe Discharge letter 108:138 of July 12th, 1945 on following pupils: 0206, 0211, 0216, 0220, 0222, 0224, 0225, 0244, 239, 249, 271, and 266. These were all graduates, and it has been the custom to ask for and receive the grant on graduates for July end August\u201462 days. By error on my part, their discharge was requested on the June Returns, instead of on these September Returns. We, therefore, now request that they may be granted number of days as shown.\n\nRe 294, Johnnie Pemmican, whose admission had been requested by Magistrate Wolfe of the Juvenile Court, this child was a truant through school year Sept./44 to June/45, but was placed in my charge in July/45, after again being before the magistrate. At that time, the Magistrate requested his transfer to Pelican Lake School, Sioux Lookout, the home of Johnnie's Mother. We therefore request his discharge.\n\nWe also request the discharge of 0237, Annie Peters, and 0258, Rosie Peters. Their father, having resigned from O.F.R. lost the privilege of a \"pass\" for the children. He has placed them in a Day School, near their home.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSept. 4th, 1945.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the CICOLIA JEFFREY (PRESBYTERIAN) Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Ken-o-bane-sio\nEnglish name: Sarah Jane\nAge: 6 yrs., Born Nov. 9th, 1939.\nName of Band: Shoal Lake No. 40\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: Shoal Lake No. 40\nFather's full name and No.: John Redsky, Shoal Lake No. 40\nMother's full name and No.: Greta (Michum), now Mrs. Smith.\nParents living or dead: Father deceased, Mother living.\nState of child's health: Fair (See Reverse)\nReligion: Presbyterian\nDoes applicant speak English?

(Agency records.) The children of his two brothers were, or are still pupils here.\n\nWe request that you will forward this protest to the Department. In view of their recent attitude on such matters, it is almost inconceivable that such should be allowed.\n\nWe also again wish to draw to your attention the unusual activity of Father \"Smalls\" of St. Mary's School, in his efforts to persuade our people to leave us and join their (apparently) overcrowded school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nThe attached letter, received from Mr. D.S.

Since our telephone conversation of yesterday, I now understand her to be named Mary Nancy, and her requested Birth Date to be Aug. 3rd, 1940. This makes her one year younger.\n\nI hereby present further information, with the request that you will forward this to the Department for their consideration, (as a Grant Earning Pupil.)\n\n(1) There is a large family, with several small children at home. (2) We have two big sisters here, Mary Agamere, aged 15, and Alice Agamere, aged 13. These two sisters are very good and can look after the little new girl considerably better here than the mother could at home. (3) We are willing to accept her, if the Department is willing to pay the Grant. (4) It has taken a good deal of persuasion to get the people of this Reserve to allow their children to come to school, some just coming in this year at 13 years of age. If we refuse a child, they may use it for further excuses.\n\nUnder above noted circumstances, we request her acceptance by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\nJanuary 31st 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Applications for Admission to the\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached hereto are Applications for Admission to\nthe Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School of the\nfollowing children:\n\nJohnnie Quewezance -- 120 Islington Band\nJoseph Wagamoss -- 156 Islington Band\nMary Nancy Wagamoss -- 156 Islington Band.\n\nIn the connection with the admission of the latter\nchild, it is noted that she is only 6 years of age.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRE: Application for Admission of children of Robert Michaud, Yalington 191.\n\nThe above noted, Robert Michaud, is at present in my office.\n\nHe stated that he and his wife had planned to put their two girls into this school and came to Kenora for that purpose.\n\nHowever his wife took the two girls to the St. Mary's school and they have made out applications (and signed them) for admission to St. Mary's School.\n\nNow the two girls are anxious to come to Cecilia Jeffrey. The Father is desirous of having them here. He attended the old Cecilia Jeffrey School for 14 years and was a member of the Presbyterian Church. He and his wife were married by Canon Sanderson of the Church of England, but were again married by the Roman Catholic Priest, although Robert has never become a Roman Catholic (his statement) although his wife is R.C.\n\nThe chief, Chief Morase Spence, had told us when we visited the Reserve in February that he thought the Michaud's would rather \"return\" to the Church of England.\n\nUnder these above noted circumstances, I am therefore forwarding to your office application forms for these two girls, signed by the father. I feel that this case deserves special consideration, inasmuch as the father's desire appears to be so strongly in favour of attending the school to which he himself belongs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKanora, Ontario,\nApril 16, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Admission of Children of\nHerbert Michaud - #191 Islington\n\nHerbert Michaud called at this office yesterday with his wife and informed me that his wife had left his two daughters, Josephine and Mary Louise, at the Kanora R.C.I.R. School, and intimated that he would rather have them in the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School. After Michaud left the office, an Application for Admission of these two girls was left in the office by Reverend Father A. Lacelle, O.M.I., of the Kanora R.C.I.R. School.\n\nHerbert Michaud is shown in our census book as a Roman Catholic. His father, a Roman Catholic, died when he was four years of age. Herbert later was educated at the Cecilia Jeffery School at Shoal Lake and attended there for fourteen years and he has since then never followed the Roman Catholic faith. His wife, Melvina Cantin, is Roman Catholic. They were married on the Wahigen Reserve by Canon Sanderson, Church of England Missionary, on May 29th, 1934, and later, the marriage was blessed by Reverend Father Lemire at Wahigen, June 4th, 1935. There are two boys and three girls in the family who, I am told, were all baptised Roman Catholic.\n\nMrs. Michaud stated to the writer that she would prefer having her children sent to the Cecilia Jeffery I.R. School, her main reason being that most of the Islington children are still there and that her children did not know anyone at the Kanora R.C. School. Mrs. Michaud visited the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School on the eleventh instant, but did not see the Principal, Mr. D.S. Pitts. She then called at the R.C.I.R. School with her husband and children and asked Reverend Father A. Lacelle to admit the children. Application Forms were signed by the Father and the children were examined by the Doctor, A.D. Ferriar.\n\nAttached to the enclosed Application for Admission form from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffery School, is a letter from the Principal, Mr. D.S. Pitts, which is self explanatory.\n\nThe attached Application Forms from both schools, have not been signed or recommended by the writer, as a decision rendered by the Department in matters of this kind, is desirable.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nEP:WZ\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nLanark, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant,\nwith reference to the children of Herbert Richmond.\n\nI have carefully considered your letter\nand it has been decided that the children should remain\nin the Amos Residential School. You should so inform\nthe Principal of that school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 14, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nGraduation Diplomas\n\nWhen I visited your school recently, I discussed the question of providing students who are completing their studies with a suitable graduation diploma.\n\nI am enclosing a sample of the diploma now being used by the Indian Affairs branch.\n\nIf you will send in the names of all students who are graduating from your school this year, we will complete the diplomas and return them to you for distribution. You will note that the pupil's number is also required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDouglas S.

D. Ferguson, M.D.\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKENORA - ONTARIO\n\nNov. 16th, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRE: APPLICATION - Joseph Morrison.\n\nIn reply to your request of Nov. 5th., I herewith outline further particulars on application for admission of above noted pupil. (Most of this information is included in abbreviated form on the application.)\n\nThe Mother, Ada Crow, (or Norah Crow,) was legally married to Donald Morrison, (or Daniel Morrison.)\n\nThe mother a Treaty Indian, No. 129 Big Island, has been committed to the Sanatorium at Fort William and therefore is not able to care for this boy.\n\nThe Father, Donald Morrison, attended our school as a grant earning pupil under the name of Daniel Morrison, and was numbered 130 on School Quarterly Returns. He served in the Canadian Army as a Volunteer, was wounded, and later Honourably discharged. He brought his little son to the school and asked that we would care for little Joseph.\n\nAt the time of the marriage, we encouraged these two young people to be legally married. If they had not been legally married, the mother would probably still be claimed as Treaty Indian and the boy would be a Treaty Indian. Therefore we feel that they should not be penalized for doing what is right. They are a fine young couple. The boy is quite promising. We feel that he should be given every opportunity.\n\nWe still have room in the school for extra pupils. (He would not be crowding out a Treaty child.)\n\nTherefore we request that the department will give favourable consideration to this application.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nKenora, Ontario,\nNovember 21st, 1947\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Application for Admission\nTo Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.

Pitts, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian\nSchool relative to the above noted subject.\n\nA copy of Mr. Pitts' letter outlining\nthe circumstances of this particular case is hereto\nattached, with Application for admission, and is self\nexplanatory.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nKODAK SAFETY FILM\nOttawa, November 29, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Peterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, you will recall that several months ago we considered the applications for admission of the Morrison children to the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nAccording to our present regulations, Joseph Morrison is not eligible for admission and we are not prepared to make any exception in his case.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP/I/30\nAlthough the Shal Lake Bands were exceptionally prompt in returning all of their children to school on the proper day, this one member Kay Williamson and his younger brother Tommy (staying with father Tom Williamson, at Indian House) defied the Agent and myself by refusing to return to school.\n\nSeveral times I saw Kay and asked when he would return the girls. Later I went three times to his tent to ask him to bring them back.\n\nWhen I reported the matter to the agent, Mr. Paterson, asking for him to use his authority, he said that the Principal must use every effort first. I pointed out that I had done everything humanly possible, short of carrying the girls bodily\u2014which I was not prepared to do.\n\nI do feel that the agent was largely responsible for the break-down in the authority in not insisting on the return of these children. When I protested to him on the phone and in his office he only said that \"my had promised to bring the girls back.\"\n\nFinally I told the father that I would not bother him any more. It was up to the agent and if necessary to use the Moundzor R.C.M.P.\n\nI feel that the agent should have used some pressure\u2014as he was later forced to do with some of the Illington Band, with excellent results.\n\nNow that these children were ignored by us, they have taken them to St. Mary's School. We feel that this should not be allowed and that these children should be ordered forthwith to be removed from St. Mary's School and returned to O.J. School.\n\nI have told the agent that this matter should be referred to you and that they should be returned. As I can get no co-operation (in this one incident) I am taking the matter up with you direct.\n\nThere is also the matter of the Scott children who are still at St. Mary's. The Missionary, Father Macelles says that they have no intention of letting them return to us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nCecilie Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKenora - Ontario\n\nDec. 2nd, 1947.\n\nCol. B.F. Henry,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Henry:\n\nRE: CHILDREN OF KAY WILLIAMSON,\nShoal Lake 34-69.\n\nThe two daughters of above noted Kay Williamson, have not returned to the O.J. School after the summer holidays. I am informed that they are in the St. Mary's Indian School.\n\nThe father and whole family were in the O. J. School. (The Paternal Grandparents were among the first pupils.) The father had at least part of a year at High School.\n\nThe Two Girls, Bertha and Muriel, were both accepted into O.J. School; Bertha Williamson, Authority: Nov. 6/44, File No. 129-3-10; and Mary Ann Williamson, Nov. 15/46, File No. 129-3-10 (WT7).\n\nThe mother had tried once before to put the children into St. Mary's but the father had taken them out and brought her over here, where she should be.\n\nLast summer, the father and mother were apparently looking for something which they could blame. Consequently we had both children carefully examined by Dr. Ferguson before allowing them home for the summer. (The father was with the girls.) Later he wrote to the agent saying the children had contacted scabies and given it to a younger child. We found in our nurses' records when the mother had brought this baby to the school for advice for scabies early in the spring. I told him that he could not blame the school but his own living conditions.\n\nHe still has no house for his family. They spend most of the time in tents, even through part of the winter.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nWe have received your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the children of Kay Williamson.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have received definite information from Indian Agent Paterson that both Mr. and Mrs. Williamson are now recognized as Roman Catholics, their children are therefore eligible under Sub Section 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act to be admitted as grant earning pupils to the Kenora Residential School.\n\nTheir admission to that school has been approved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.S. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res. School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nPP/LED\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKenora - Ontario\n\nDec. 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. Philip Reelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRE: Bertha and Mildred Williamson.\n\nI am informed by the Agent, Mr. E. Paterson, that you have approved of the admission of these two girls to the St. Mary's Indian School, (Roman Catholic).\n\nSome time ago, when we asked for a similar transfer of children whose mother had taken the girls to the wrong school, and both father and mother were Presbyterians, you said that it was not possible to let them in one school and then change to another. (Children of Norman Michaud, Kelvington.)\n\nThe agent only told you on information from the R.O. missionary that Kay Williamson was now recognized as R.O. On Saturday the mother denied this. (This is the same Father Lascelles who decides all the policy as to Christmas Holidays, has on several occasions baptized children whom he knows to be Presbyterian, - Ex. Morrison children - and takes advantage of our Protestant people when they are ill in the St. Joseph's Hospital.)\n\nWhy is the Department allowing all these \"One-way Transfers\" at this time?\n\nAs outlined some time ago, the problem with the Williamson children was entirely lack of enforcing the rules, by the local Agent. My letter must be in your hands, however as yet I have not received any answer.\n\nMay we request immediate reconsideration of this case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKenora - Ontario\n\nDec. 10th, 1947.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMr. Paterson, the local Agent informs me that he has received a letter from you refusing to admit the above noted boy.\n\nWe had written full particulars about this case to Mr. Paterson, on his request, enclosing a duplicate of our letter so that the Department might receive a copy. We wonder now if you received this duplicate.\n\nReference is made to several months ago we considered the application of the Morrison children to the Cecilia Jeffrey School. I should like to point out that evidently on the agent's advice, you consider this the same case. It is not. This is a different family.\n\nThe mother is a Treaty Indian, receiving both Treaty and Interest payments. She is at present in the Sanatorium, and therefore unable to take care of the boy.\n\nThe Father was a pupil of this school. Further he was wounded overseas.\n\nSurely with both parents former pupils, and the mother in the sanatorium, a decision might be made. I realize that the policy is not to deprive children of Treaty parents of an opportunity to receive an education. However, we have not enough children to meet the quota. In some cases the Agent is definitely not co-operating.\n\nMay I request acknowledgement of this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 13, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant with further reference to Joseph Morrison.\n\nWe are quite prepared to agree that it is unfortunate for the boy that his mother is suffering from T.B. and consequently is confined to hospital.\n\nHowever, the fact still remains that the father is not a Treaty Indian. For your information I enclose a copy of circular letter which was issued some years ago in which is still in effect. Possibly you have one of these circulars in your school. However, I would point out that the definite ruling was made at that time and consequently Joseph Morrison is not eligible for admission as a grant earning pupil to an Indian residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.S.
