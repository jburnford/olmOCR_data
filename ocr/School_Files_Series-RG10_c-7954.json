Thomas Badger may take charge temporarily until teacher nominated by Bishop takes charge.

The Agent is being informed that the Department will accept the resignation of Mrs. McCallum, but cannot consent to re-engage her at the end of a year.\n\nWith reference to Thomas Badger I beg to say that he formerly taught the Moose Lake Day School, but, as he has no qualifications, it is considered that it would be unwise to appoint him permanently.\n\nI have to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to endeavour to secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. The name and qualifications of such teacher secured by Your Lordship should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The Department will be prepared to pay an increased salary for a qualified teacher. The returns received show that there are 34 children on the roll, with an average attendance of about 20. It should be pointed out that Your Lordship would give this matter your early attention and endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher. The salary which you consider he should receive should also be stated.\n\nIn the meantime, in order that the school will not be closed and the children deprived of school privileges, the Department respectfully asks you to appoint Thomas Badger temporarily until such time as the services of a qualified teacher are obtained.\n\nIt is hoped that Your Lordship will be able to nominate a suitable teacher for this school at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary,\nRight Rev.

In the meantime the Agent is being informed that her temporary appointment is approved by the Department, pending the approval of Your Lordship.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from Your Lordship at your early convenience as to whether you have any other teacher in view, and, if not, whether you will agree to the re-appointment of Mrs. McGillivray.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

In the past teachers secured by the schools in your agency have had little, if any, qualifications and the success they have met with has not been such as would warrant the payment of higher salaries.\n\nThe Department is not aware as to whether the church authorities augment the teachers' salaries.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

This girl has made fair progress with the children in grades one and two, but the pupil in grade three seems to be just too far advanced, I think the teacher will have difficulty in teaching in standard three.\n\nThere are twenty six children on the register, with sixteen present at time of my visit, though the average for the quarter will not be more than ten, as the trappers were away with the children all spring.\n\nFive children were in A.B.C. class. Seven are in Standard one who can read, spell, add, subtract, multiply, write and draw. Three are in standard two who do much the same work and who can describe in English all local objects pointed out.

We cannot expect much from a grade IV or V pupil.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to secure a teacher with a higher certificate or standing.\n\nJ. S. Peach.\n\nExtract from Commissioner Graham's letter of June 19, 1923 enclosing the above report -\n\n\"This report is not satisfactory in my opinion as this is an important school there being 30 children enrolled. The teacher has not the qualifications and Mr. Peach's recommendation that another teacher should be engaged is no doubt well founded.\n\nW. M. Graham.\n\nCommissioner.\"\nOttawa, June 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Big Eddy Indian Day School, draws attention to the work being performed by the teacher, Miss Mary Jane Cook. He states that little or no progress is being made, owing to the fact that the teacher has no qualifications and that her educational standing is too low for a teacher. He recommends that another teacher be secured, with a higher certificate or standing.\n\nThe Inspector's recommendation that another teacher be engaged is, no doubt, well founded, and it is considered that the services of Miss Cook should be dispensed with and another teacher obtained, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September first, next. I have, therefore, to request that you will take this matter up with the Church authorities, and every effort should be made to secure the services of a qualified teacher for this school for next year. We would be pleased to allow a higher salary if a suitable teacher is secured - the amount to depend upon the qualifications of the person engaged. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicants should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYou will inform Miss Cook that her services will not be further required after the end of the present month, and you should use every endeavour, in conjunction with the Church authorities, to obtain a qualified teacher in time to begin duties when the school re-opens after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Miss Cook lived at home with her parents.

We note that you estimate the cost of these repairs would be approximately $50. You may also arrange, if a teacher is secured, to have the closets built at The Pas and taken out and placed in a suitable position at the school. You should not undertake any of this work until a teacher is engaged, when you may expend an amount not exceeding $125 in fitting up the building as living quarters for the teacher and in erecting the closets.\n\nWe note that, if the services of a married teacher are required, it would be necessary to carry out considerably more repairs in order to provide living accommodation. In that event, any repairs undertaken should be done as cheaply as possible. You should purchase any material required, after obtaining competitive prices, and arrange for the labour in doing the work. You will keep proper time sheets for the labour employed and forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nWe note by your letter of the above date that you have written Mr. Alfred H. Chales and informed him that the Church Authorities do not desire to recommend his application for the position of teacher at this school. We hope they will be in a position to nominate a suitable teacher at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

Mr. Waddy has refused to allow them, I cannot go against his instructions. But at my school it is close to the Reserve so within easy reach of all my pupils who are all non-treat Indians. They are all alike & all closely related to one another. Their is little or no difference. I am writing you direct to ask if you would not join the school. I am sure it would be successful, for there are no whites except my own that attend this school. I have taught school for the I.D. for some 18 years & half. School for 5 years before my certificate. But I feel sure I can give you every satisfaction, if you would communicate.\nwith Commissioner J. A. Campbell I felt sure he would approve as I have a very large school. Now beside the small salary paid by the Indian Department added to my salary would make me a living wage and would be very acceptable according to all accounts. My work has given me satisfaction so I shall when the Educational Commission was here at the Pas I am sure I am well known to the Indian Department. I would like to serve them again.

In your letter of October 24th, last, you state that if Miss L. Millen received the appointment as teacher, she would take up her duties in about a month's time.

From all accounts the rain gets in and the mud smells badly, besides seeping out continually, and altogether the building is disreputable. All agreed with the missionary that Miss Millan's work was thoroughly good and clearly her influence is most marked on the Indians as well as thoroughly good teaching work with the children. She seems to put her whole heart into the work and I would strongly urge that a new school like Humberstone's should be built there.\n\nI ought to add that the opening of these two day schools there has had a very marked effect on the whole Devon Mission, it was a good stroke of work when those schools were opened.\n\nG.

He is continually away, 2 or 3 times every week. This week he has only been once. When I asked the reason, he was sick, but he was seen walking around town every time he was not at school or playing in the bush or on the river. Besides, he cannot be sick 2 or 3 times every week. Twice this week his brother has followed his example. This is playing Truant. It is most discouraging teaching a boy like that. When I ask him he has nothing to say, so it shows it was not sickness. I sent word to them that if he were sick, he was to see the Doctor. But to my thinking, all the doctoring he needs is a sharp reprimand from you. I have threatened to send Police after him. Something will have to be done. If he cannot come regularly to school, he had better be sent to The Mackay Boarding School, and I know his father does not wish that. The way he is going on means ruination to the boy.\n\nHas Mrs. Piott come back with her boys? Joe McGillivary can tell you a lot about Jeremiah. Will you please attend to this.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nL.

Since my last inspection, Miss Ingram has been appointed teacher. She is not a qualified teacher and has no standing in this country. Miss Ingram appears quite alert, employs fairly good methods in her work, but it seems unfortunate, when we have so many qualified teachers in our own province who are unable to obtain schools and who would gladly work for the same salary, that they could not be employed in these positions. I think we should insist that qualified teachers be placed in charge of our classrooms.\n\nThe roll calls for 20 pupils and 14 were present on the day of my visit. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 7      |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 3      |\n| IV    | 6      |\n\nThe children appeared quite alert and speak out fairly well. Some of them were poorly clad and untidy in appearance.\n\nThe classroom was well aired and clean. The seats and equipment are all in good condition. The children are provided with individual drinking cups and towels, and I instructed Mr. Lovell to supply each child with a brush and comb from his warehouse supply. If these are made use of it will greatly improve the general appearance of the children. There is no noon-day meal served as the children live in close proximity.\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActg.

In examining their exercise and text books, I found that a number of the latter had been greatly disfigured by pencil markings. In fact, the printing on some of the pages was almost entirely destroyed. I took this matter up with both the pupils and Miss Ingram and left instructions that the books, as far as possible, should be cleaned up and that I did not wish to find any recurrence of this practice. I was surprised that Miss Ingram would allow anything of this nature and made it quite clear to all that it would not be looked upon with favour by the Department.\n\nDr. Harold W.

Not all traders exploit the Indians, and not all white people are hard and inconsiderate; but most of those who read these words will admit that there is much room for improvement in the present situation. The essential feature of our Indian reconstruction policy must be the effort to give the native race the kind of help that will enable it to be both happy and independent while it is leading the type of life for which it is best suited. There are two ways in which you can immediately render assistance to these patient Indian folk. First, contribute to the missionary apportionment of your local Church, in order that much-needed work among the Indians may be continued, and secondly, treat every Indian with whom you have dealings just as you think Christ would treat him if He were in your place. Most of us still need to pray the prayer expressed in Kipling's words:\n\n\"Teach us the strength that cannot seek,\nBy deed or thought to hurt the weak;\nThat under Thee we may possess\nMan's strength to comfort man's distress.\n\nTeach us delight in simple things,\nAnd mirth that has no bitter springs;\nForgiveness free of evil done,\nAnd love to all men 'neath the sun.\"\n\nA PLEA FOR THE PEOPLE\n\nby Sidney Bingham\n\nThe people are friendly\n\nA HAPPY GROUP AT GILLAM\nThe big girl, who speaks English well, was the writer's guide and interpreter\nHave you ever stopped to think of the most despised and rejected of all the inhabitants of Canada? In their own language, they call themselves \"The People\", for they lived in this land long before white men searching for the Indies, stopped here and called them Indians.\n\nBefore the white man came, the People were free to wander as they pleased, hunting and trapping just enough to provide for their immediate needs, but not attempting to gather together stores or possessions which would be cumbersome as they travelled about. Their wants were few, so they were healthy and carefree as they wandered along well-trodden trails or were carried downstream in their birch-bark canoes. They did not live as the white man does, because many of his ways are ill-adapted to the needs of wanderers in the silent North; but they lived well and happily, according to their standard, and were entirely self-supporting.\n\nBy nature, the People are calm, friendly, affectionate folk with a keen sense of humour and a great love of family life. Their innate reverence for the power of a great Creator manifests itself very clearly when they come under the influence of the Christian Church, and their childlike devotion is a shining example of piety for the scores of professing Christians who seem to think that religion may be put on and off with their Sunday clothes. People who visit Indians in their tents will see good and bad homes, just as they do in any Canadian town or village. Nowhere, however, will they see superfluous possessions and they will probably be filled with amazement that human beings can subsist on so little.\nThey will realize that there is no possibility of keeping extra supplies for unexpected illness or even the feebleness of old age. They will see children who are obviously undernourished and dogs that are on the verge of starvation. Those who are familiar with the requirements of good camping will find many illustrations of this, despite glaring exceptions and a certain superficial untidiness which gives a straggly appearance everywhere. In many families, clothes are washed frequently, tents are aired, and food is securely protected from flies and stray animals; while camp fires and shelters of all types are used, according to individual needs. Dirt and disease are found certainly; but they are not so universal as some folk would have us believe, and a visit to an Indian camp in summertime is decidedly more pleasant than one paid to a slum tenement house at the same season of the year. The much-discussed \"laziness\" of the race is only partially true, and where it does exist, it is due mainly to lack of ambition caused by malnutrition or by the evil effects of unwise charity. Added to all this, there is a dull hopelessness which is the direct result of the treatment accorded to Indians by the very men whose greed for gain has robbed the inhabitants of the North of their means of subsistence\u2014the wild animals which provided them with food, clothing, shelter and wholesome activity. Despite all the stories of tribal feuds and evil practices, the primitive life of North American Indians in the early days was mainly a healthy and wholesome one which gave men time to enjoy something of the \"Peace which passeth all understanding.\"\n\nThen came the white man. Soon the Indian discovered that his furs were of use, not only for clothing himself and his family or for making sleeping-robles, but also for barter. In exchange for them, he received knives and guns and bright trinkets that seemed to represent wealth. Greed for gain grew in the heart of the Indian then, and so he began to trap more animals than he needed in order to exchange their furs for the new treasures that were offered him. The white man was trapping too, so gradually the precious animals became less plentiful, and sometimes Indian women and children were cold and hungry. Before long, white men came to settle in these parts and the Indian began to live on their food, much of which was put up in bright tin cans. Perhaps it was not so nourishing, but it tasted good and could easily be obtained if one had something to trade for it. But when the Indian had nothing to trade he had to go hungry or to wander much further to find the animals that gave him food and clothing.\nGradually the Indians grew poorer as their white brothers became rich.\n\nThat was not all, however, for other troubles arose. The Indian girls were happy and handsome, but white men brought sorrow to many a maiden's heart.\n\nA few of the newcomers settled down honourably with Indian wives, and thereby put themselves \"beyond the pale\" of local groups of white people; but most of them moved on, leaving behind them, in due course, little Pale-faces to be brought up in poverty-stricken Indian camps. Sometimes too, the strangers who came to trade in the North gave the Indians \"fire-water\", and that caused more misery. Then, through the well-meant efforts of government officials, treaties were made and reserves set aside. These brought a measure of protection from exploitation but they also had evil effects. Treaty money seemed untold wealth to the struggling Indians, and other privileges made them settle down calmly to a life of ease. They forgot their old skills and failed to learn new ones. Benevolent ladies from afar sent them great bales of clothing which were often distributed indiscriminately, and made them feel that there was no longer any need to go hunting for warm furs. Thus it came about that strong men lay about in their tents or learned bad habits from the less desirable types of whites in settlements nearby. Those who still tried to hunt became discouraged and came home hungry, because wild animals had fled with the coming of the white men. There was a tendency for the Indians to crowd together round the trading posts, and some of them even took to living in stuffy houses instead of tents. Tuberculosis appeared and still more loathesome diseases were spread by the dregs of the white population which pushed ever northwards in the wild rush for valuable furs. Gradually many of the Indians tended to abandon their old healthy, independent, carefree way of life for an existence that was miserable beyond description, or else entirely irresponsible, with an Indian agent at hand to supply their most pressing needs.\n\nLong after much of this mischief had been done, and when Indians who lived near white men had begun to lose their noble characteristics, the white woman appeared on the scene. In most cases, she\npulled her dainty skirts aside and refused to associate with her bronze-coloured sisters. She taught her children to despise the Indians and forbade them to go near the camps. She forgot that there are good Indians and bad Indians\u2014just as there are good whites and bad whites\u2014and she professed to believe that every Indian home was a hotbed of vile disease. She even thought that swarthy complexions and weather-stained garments were necessarily dirty, because they were unlike her own fair skin and snowy clothes. It was sad, too, to see her attitude towards the white men who had settled down with Indian wives in the days when there were no white women in the North; she probably resented the fact that any white man should wed an Indian bride! Most cruel of all was the white woman's contempt for the little \"half-breed\" children to be found in many an Indian camp. She forgot the suffering and sadness that white men had brought to the now abandoned mothers of these little ones. Perhaps she even forgot the tender pity of the Master Who once said:\n\n\"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.\"\n\nIn her blindness, the white woman persuaded her menfolk to despise the very people whose exploitation made them rich. Such a sad state of affairs could not continue long without kindling the indignation of thoughtful people.\n\nWhen the public conscience was at least pricking\u2014if not fully aroused\u2014efforts were made to right some of the wrongs that had been committed by white men and their women-folk. Missionaries were placed on the Reserves to teach the People about their Saviour and help them in their misery. Boarding schools were founded to train young Indians for earning their own livings along white lines. Day-schools were started on the Reserves to give many more children a chance of learning to read and write. Certain government regulations were made to prevent some of the exploitation of the Indians by unscrupulous traders. Some white women even allowed Indian girls to become their maids, and occasionally they consented to worship with their Indian sisters on a very special occasion! Of course, they did not really treat them as sisters, but they were genuinely glad to make clothes for Indian children or to contribute to the support of Indian Missions. It just did not strike them that the dignified, stoical People had once been fine, self-supporting folk who roamed the land in freedom, long before the first white man set eyes on the \"Indians\" in this country.\nMercifully, however, the public conscience is at last coming to life. Church and government officials alike are investigating the whole situation and giving careful and critical consideration to their own handling of Indian affairs. Health authorities are, at least mildly, concerned about matters of hygiene, if only for the sake of the white people with whom the Indians come in contact. Some educationists are questioning the advisability of educating Indian children on ordinary white lines; others are coming forward with schemes for developing native handicrafts or giving specialized training to fit the children for the way in which they normally earn their own living. Others propose the establishment of centres where mothers may learn child care and cookery. White mothers are beginning to realize that Indian mothers have feelings too, and they know now that the poor health of undernourished half-breed children in our schools is a menace to their own children's health. People who pack bales are no longer saying, \"Anything will do for the Indians!\" They realize that Indian women have invariably fewer facilities for washing and mending clothes, so they deal with dirty and torn clothing before they pack it. They also include in their bales the kind of things that are really useful for women who wander from place to place, or little articles that are a boon to sick people living in dire poverty. Some women now are a little ashamed that their children have so many luxuries when Indian mothers \"across the track\" have nothing for their little ones.\n\nMissionaries are practising more than ever in their daily life, the Gospel that they preach, and are trying to help the Indians regain the old independence that characterized their attitude before the white man reached their hunting grounds.\n\nMuch still remains to be done, and the work is urgently needed, because the Indian population of Canada is actually increasing and will eventually menace the life of the community, if it is allowed to drift on in its distress. Everyone in Canada should make it his or her business to study Indian problems; to give wholehearted support to the missionaries who are working on behalf of this sadly oppressed race; and, wherever possible, to give a kindly word and a helping hand to the friendly folk who have often been...\nwronged by their presumably Christian Brothers and sisters. Not all traders exploit the Indians, and not all white people are hard and inconsiderate; but most of those who read these words will admit that there is much room for improvement in the present situation. The essential feature of our Indian reconstruction policy must be the effort to give the native race the kind of help that will enable it to be both happy and independent while it is leading the type of life for which it is best suited.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have, in the northern part of this Province, a school known as Big Eddy School, which is located within a reasonable distance of the two Indian Schools which operate in The Pas area. The school population of Big Eddy School is composed entirely of half-breed children, all of whom speak Cree for the most part, and the teacher going into this district faces a very definite handicap in this regard. The children from Big Eddy School, being half-breed children, do not attempt in any way to mix with the white children, and they seek their companionship from the children who are attending the Indian Schools in the area.\n\nOur Official Trustee at Big Eddy has discussed the matter with Mr. Lovell, the Indian Agent at that point, and with Mr. Waller, who is a teacher in one of the schools, and all three seem to be agreed that the best interests of the children would be served were the children from Big Eddy School to be allowed to attend either or both of the Indian Schools of the area. They seem to feel that if this were possible, the scheme would work out to the ultimate advantage of both sides if the present Indian population is not too large. We understand that Mr. Lovell has made a check on this and finds that conditions indicate that there would be ample accommodation for the children of Big Eddy School in the Indian Schools.\n\nMr. Bateman, our Official Trustee at Big Eddy, has talked with Mr. Waller on this matter and it appears that none of the children would have over two miles to travel to attend the Indian School. Mr. Waller further feels that the attendance of the children of Big Eddy School at the Indian School would have a very definite effect upon the attendance of his own students, since the students from Big Eddy and from the Indian School mix outside of school hours, and there is apparently a very noticeable tendency for the students of the Indian School to remain outside of school to promote the mixing. It is felt, therefore, that could they be brought together during the school day, the general attendance within the school would be improved. There is the additional factor that Mr. Waller speaks Cree fluently, and this of course gives him a decided advantage in gaining the confidence of the younger students in the class, an advantage which the teacher which we would send into Big Eddy School would definitely not have.\n\nThe point upon which we would like to make inquiry at this time is as to whether or not it is possible to enter into some arrangement with the\nDominion Government for the attendance of the children from Big Eddy School at one of the Indian Schools in The Pas area. The advantages to be gained therefrom have been set forth above, and as previously stated, those who are on the ground and know the children of both schools, seem to feel that the arrangement would work to the advantage of all concerned. If such an arrangement could be made, it would have to be understood by this Department, of course, that the plan could only operate so long as there was sufficient accommodation over and above what was needed for the children of the Indian Schools.\n\nWe understand that a plan of like nature has been in operation in other parts of the Dominion and has met with every success. On this basis we would respectfully solicit your consideration of this matter, and we shall await your advice on same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.W.F. Brisbin,\nAct. Chief Administrative Officer.\nOttawa, September 21, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Brisbin:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 15, in which you submit, for our consideration, a number of suggestions with respect to the operation of the Big Eddy and Pas Indian Day Schools.\n\nI personally can see no objection whatever to the attendance of halfbreed children at either or both of these schools. Unless the schools are unusually large, however, it is difficult for me to convince myself that the children now enrolled at the Big Eddy Public School can be accommodated at our schools. Our records here suggest that we have at this date an enrolment at Big Eddy of 30 and an enrolment of 24 at The Pas. The average attendance at both these schools, of course, appears to be low, but I am naturally anxious not to base my decision on the fact that attendance at our schools will remain unsatisfactory in the future.\n\nWe have, throughout the Dominion, a limited number of Indian schools at which instruction is provided for white pupils. The number of white children at such schools, however, is very limited. It is just possible that we might undertake, by way of experiment, in The Pas area, a program somewhat along the lines you suggest. Halfbreed children might be provided with accommodation and instruction at our schools, on the understanding that the annual per capita costs, which are no doubt very low, would be borne by the Big Eddy Public School District. On the other hand, it might be deemed expedient to provide these pupils with a worthwhile course of vocational instruction and a man employed who would provide this instruction -\n\nG.W.F. Brisbin, Esq.,\nActing Chief Administrative Officer,\nDepartment of Education,\nLegislative Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\ninstruction at both schools. The salary of such an official might be paid by the Big Eddy Board if the attendance of halfbreed children at our schools warranted such payment.\n\nI am disposed to think that a survey might be undertaken of the district by the Official Trustee of the Big Eddy School, Mr. Bateman, Mr. Lovell, the Indian Agent, and the Public School Inspector for the district. Any recommendations made by the committee made up of these men would be very sympathetically reviewed by the Department here.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter forward to Indian Agent Lovell and it is just possible that you may desire to communicate with Mr. Bateman in respect to the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nMr. B. Scott Bateman, the Public School Inspector for the district, came into the office yesterday and brought with him a copy of Mr. Hoey's letter to Mr. Brisbin, dated the 21st ultimo and also a letter from Mr. Brisbin to Mr. Bateman in connection with half-breed children of the Big Eddy Settlement attending our Indian Day Schools on the Pas Reserve.\n\nThe matter was thoroughly discussed and it was decided to make the following recommendations.\n\nThat as many half-breed children as can be comfortably accommodated be allowed to attend the Big Eddy School, preferably the younger children as they would not have far to walk. The half-breed children who could not be accommodated at the Big Eddy School be allowed to attend the Pas Day School. They would have to travel about 2\u00bd to three miles to do this, but this is not any greater than a large proportion of the white children attending country schools have to travel.\n\nThat the half-breed children attending the Indian schools be provided with books, stationery and also biscuits the same as the Indian children. It would not work satisfactorily any other way as one could not expect the teacher to give one child a book and provide him with stationery and also give him biscuits at midday, unless they all got the same.\n\nThe cost of the service our Department would be rendering to the Province and the cost of the supplies provided could be met by a per capita charge to the province. It would cost the Provincial Department of Education to keep a school open only eight months, at least $500.00 and probably more. I think the tuition and supplies could be provided for less than that under the arrangement suggested above.\n\nI cannot recommend starting any vocational training in the schools at the present time. I think it would be better if we tried the above mentioned plan out for a year before we do anything further. If everything works out satisfactorily then the matter of vocational training could be considered.\n\nYou will notice that our plan does not interfere with the Indian children in any way and I believe sufficient room can be found at both schools for all the half-breed children who are likely to attend.\n\nThe responsibility of seeing that the half-breed children attend school regularly should be the duty of the Provincial authorities.\n\nRegarding the Half-breed Settlement at Big Eddy. This is situated close to the Reserve Settlement. In fact one can hardly tell where the Indians' settlement ends and the Half-breed settlement begins. The Half-breeds and Indians are racially the same people, live the same mode of life and cannot be distinguished from each other.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-1, part 1)\nThe half-breeds, at the present time, are getting little or no education. This will make it difficult for them to earn a living, bound to cause trouble and expense in the future and have a detrimental effect upon the Indians.\n\nI do not think the enrolment at either the Big Eddy or the Pas Day School will be as good this year as it was last, as quite a number of children from the Pas Reserve have gone to Elkhorn Residential School. Quite a number of the Indians are now away from the Reserve fishing, lumbering and trapping and their families are with them in many cases.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to allowing half-breed children to attend the Big Eddy and Pas Indian Day Schools. Careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and you may arrange with Mr. B. Scott Bateman and Mr. Brisbin for the attendance of half-breed children at the schools mentioned. The teachers should keep a list showing the names of the half-breed children and the number of months that they attend during the academic year. This list should be handed to you at the end of June, 1944, and should be forwarded to this office. We feel that a charge of $5.00 per pupil per teaching month would be fair to all parties concerned and this figure should be submitted to Mr. Bateman and Mr. Brisbin. If they approve, the list which has been requested in this letter will be later forwarded to the Department of Education at Winnipeg and they will be requested to forward us payment for the tuition of the children at the rate just mentioned.\n\nProvision for the attendance of half-breed children in the manner described above is a new departure and you should keep in touch with the situation in order that we may review the matter at the end of June next and decide if we should continue the same policy during the academic year 1944-45.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 10, 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe - Big Eddy S.D., The Pas, Manitoba\n\nWe are today in receipt of a letter from Mr. B. Scott Bateman, Official Trustee of Big Eddy School District, along with an attached copy of a letter from yourself to Mr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas. There are one or two matters pertinent to the information contained in the said letter, upon which we would like to make comment and ask your opinion.\n\nYour letter to Mr. Lovell states that you feel that a charge of Three Dollars ($3.00) per pupil per teaching month, would be fair to all parties concerned. We are quite in agreement with your suggestion in this regard. There is, however, one factor which arises, namely as to whether or not it would be advisable to have a day rate, rather than a rate per teaching month. The reason for this suggestion is that in the case of sickness, etc., a student might attend only two or three days a month. To cover this point, would it be advisable to make payment on a basis of say, Fifteen Cents (15\u00a2) per day, which on the basis of twenty teaching days per month, would amount to the $3.00 per teaching month. The responsibility of seeing that the Half-Breed children attended, would of course, devolve upon this Department.\n\nYour letter further stated that the teacher should keep a list showing the names of the Half-Breed children and the number of months they had attended during the academic year, and that such list should be handed to Mr. Lovell at the end of June, 1944, and forwarded to your office. This we think, is quite in order, and this list should correspondence to an attendance list which could be submitted to this department.\n\nWe would appreciate having your suggestions as to the advisability of adopting the daily rate, rather than the monthly rate, for the purposes above mentioned, so that arrangements can be completed and the pupils concerned gotten into the schools at the earliest possible date so that their education for the present year will not be further delayed.\n\nThanking you for your consideration in this matter in the past,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAct. Chief Administrative Officer.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to half-breed children attending the Big Eddy Indian Day School.\n\nI note that you suggest a daily rate rather than a monthly rate. At several points throughout Canada we send Indian children to white schools and we have always paid a monthly rate. You realize that even though a child only attends a few days in each month, the overhead expenses go on just the same. Consequently I feel that the monthly rate is fair. Besides, it will involve considerably less work keeping track of the pupils' attendance.\n\nI trust that you will accept our suggestion in this regard and arrange to have the half-breed children enrolled at the Big Eddy School at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.W.F. Brisbin,\nActing Chief Administrative Officer,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovember 26, 1943\n\nMr. R.A.

We have advised Mr. B. Scott Batesman, of The Pas, Official Trustee for the Big Eddy School District, of our approval of this arrangement and have asked him to immediately make arrangements for the entry of the pupils to your School.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAct.

A.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 21 and my reply of October 28, with reference to allowing half-breed children to attend the Big Eddy Indian Day School. The Department of Education, Winnipeg, has now accepted the rate of $3.00 per child per teaching month. As pointed out in my letter of October 28, the teacher should keep a list showing the names of the half-breed children and the number of months during which they are in attendance during the academic year.

The Chief and his Councillors including the President of the Halfbreed Association with his Councillors were present.\n\nThe meeting was for the purpose of discussing matters pertaining to educating the Treaty Indians with the non-Treaty Indians of this district.\n\nA resolution was passed to petition both the Federal and Provincial Governments for an improved Day School sufficiently large enough to accommodate all the Treaty and non-Treaty children living round the vicinity of the Pas, as the Day Schools in the Reserve cannot take any non-Treaty children being too small.\n\nWe have always been informed that the Government was not much in favor of Residential Schools.\n\nThat the Half-breed Day School be opened with a teacher who has taught in Indian Schools and who is able to talk the language until such\ntime an improved Day School could be built. By past experience it has been found that children under such a teacher always get along better.\n\n6. The reason this petition (5) is if the children come back home (Treaty children) from Elk Horn there will not be enough room in the Day schools in the Reserve to accommodate the above children must less the Half breed children.\n\nSigned\n\nChief for Band Indian Reserve Louis McGillivray\nCouncillors.\n\nCornelius Begnell\nAntoine Constant\nAntoine Cook\nDonald Lathlin\nJohn William Harris\nJos Harikapow\nMatthew McGillivray\nWm Lathlin\nJames Partridge\nErnest Jekto\nSam Humpherville\nAdam Dorion\n\nHalfbreeds.

What the visitors saw said that conditions were so bad that it was utterly impossible for any body to believe unless one actually saw with his own eyes. We therefore demand that an investigation be made immediately before\nSome sickness breaks out. The school in our opinion should be closed and children be sent home. We are ready to be questioned on our findings during our visit there. We even brought back some samples of clothing which we found our children wearing.\n\nThere are enough Treaty and Non-Treaty children here right in the Pass for a large improved Day School to be built.

Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nInspector's Report - Big Eddy Day School\n\nMr. Bateman's report on the above school has been received and is fair.\n\nThe Inspector comments on the (1) general disarray and untidiness of her room, (2) untidy and unimpressive class work, and (3) Miss Montgomery's loud and protesting voice.\n\nIn view of the shortage of teachers and the fact that this is Miss Montgomery's first year in teaching Indians, we are willing to continue her services for another year.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends (1) that the blackboards be raised, (2) that several panes of glass be replaced and (3) that precautions be taken to exclude flies and mosquitoes.\n\nWe realize the shortage of labour and materials but suggest that a local estimate might be obtained for such repairs.\n\nThe toilets in this school were also filthy. I suggest the same system of monitors be adopted here as recommended in my letter of this date on the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nAugust 8th, 1946.\n\nHonourable J. A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nIt has been noted with considerable interest in our Department that a joint Committee of the House to survey all matters related to the welfare of the Indian population in Canada has been appointed. The hope is frequently expressed that as a result of the study made by this Committee, recommendations will be made that will be of value to Provincial Departments of Education in their efforts to bring improved educational services to the non-Indian residents of the northern localities. Your action in having the committee appointed is well regarded. We are prepared to offer any information that we may be able to give in respect to communities where, by reason of a mixed population, the problem involves provincial responsibilities to the end that mutually advantageous arrangements may be worked out.\n\nInspectors of our Department frequently cite instances where joint action by the Department of Indian Affairs and the Provincial Department of Education would result in improved service to both groups. One specific illustration is the Big Eddy District close to The Pas. This school district is semi-organized only and the school building we have there is in poor condition. We hesitate to rebuild it into a standard classroom because only 400 yards away, the Indian School is located much more favorably and with good grounds. There are about thirty half-breed children and thirty Treaty Indian children resident in the district. Our Divisional School Inspector, Mr. Bateman, strongly urges the enlargement of your school building by adding a second room so that it can accommodate all of the sixty children in the district. This, he believes, would make for better understanding among the people, a better school service could be offered, and the status of education locally would be raised - something that is sorely needed at present in this particular community. The matter has been discussed with your Departmental official, Mr. Lovall, in The Pas, who also recommends co-operative action if a suitable understanding could be reached.\n\nIt would be necessary to provide for -\n\n1. The appointment of a local board to administer the affairs of the school that could be made up of one member appointed by our Department, one by your Department, and a third who\n\n... might\nmight possibly be a representative of the church - the selection to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n2. The division of the costs of operating the school on a per capita basis. The operating costs could include an agreed upon amount to offset capital charges occasioned by the enlargement of your present building. In this connection, an arrangement that would place the ownership of the building itself in one or other of the two departments would, I believe, be more satisfactory than to attempt a joint ownership plan. In this particular instance, your Department already has a serviceable unit and it would seem to be more practical to have your Department retain the building ownership and include in the operating charges a sum that would carry the item of its enlargement costs. There may be other cases where it would be desirable to have the building ownership rest with the Provincial Government.\n\nWe should also give consideration to the type of education to offer in these special schools. I believe you or some member of your Departmental staff will be interested in reading a special report prepared last winter by Inspector Bateman covering the general situation in the educational field in northern Manitoba. There is strong support for the necessity of providing children, both Indian and Half-breed, in these localities with a type of education adapted to the environment in which they live. By combining our efforts where it is practical and sensible to do so, we can expect to cover the field more adequately by employing specially selected teachers and providing suitable equipment. By attempting to do it through separate organizations, our total costs are certain to run up much higher.\n\nPerhaps you would be good enough to refer this proposal regarding Big Eddy School District to a member of your staff with instructions to examine the possibilities it has as an experimental test. I would like very much at some convenient time, to have the benefit of your own views as to ways and means by which the educational offerings in these mixed communities of Indians and Half-breeds may be better adapted to meet their special needs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Two problems have arisen which we would like you to handle before returning here.\n\nOne is at Edmonton and our telegrams to you have explained the situation sufficiently.\n\nThe second is at the Pas. If you will read the attached letter of last year from Mr. Dryden, the Minister of Education for Manitoba and our own Minister's reply thereto, you will get a good idea of the situation that exists at Big Eddy.\n\nWe have $5,000 now available for the construction of an extra room at the Big Eddy School. I want you to go and see Mr. Rogers, the Chief Inspector of Schools for the Province of Manitoba. We are quite prepared to put an addition onto our school and to have the Half-breed children attend. Then they can close down their present school.\n\nI am going to try to inform Mr. Bateman, the local School Inspector, and Mr. Lovell, the local Indian Agent, of your estimated arrival so that they can go to Big Eddy with you. Apparently it is some eight miles from the Pas.\n\nWhen there I want you to look the school over carefully and decide what will be needed in the way of an addition. Confidentially, we can tell you that we do not want to send anyone from our Surveys and Engineering...\nBranch in to look over the situation unless it is absolutely necessary. They are now swamped with work and if we could get a local contractor to submit a bid as to what we want, then I think we can get approval without much difficulty. Mr. Bateman and Mr. Lovell will probably know local conditions and may know of someone who can handle this situation. If we waste a lot of time with blue prints, etc., etc., we will end the summer with no school building but lots or red tape still to be cut. If necessary, make a sketch upon which a fairly skilled carpenter can go to work, but I will leave the details to your own good judgment.\n\nWould you also discuss with Mr. Lovell the situation re a school at Nelson House. We have $8,000. in the estimates now for a combined school and teacher's residence at this point. I understand from him that it will be necessary to purchase the materials this year and ship them in for construction next year.\n\nPlease get as much information as you can concerning the shipping in of materials so that you will be able to advise us when they are being sent in next winter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard E.

It is not anticipated that we shall experience difficulty with respect to the cost of establishing such schools in cooperation with the provinces or the payment of the operating costs. To say, however, experience difficulty due to the fact that the Dominion Government, under the provisions of the Indian Act, is not in a position to exercise authority with respect to the attendance of pupils at schools other than Indians, or with respect to the courses of study that should be provided for white pupils. In this connection, it would appear that the Provincial Departments are in a somewhat similar position insofar as Indians are concerned. You will readily appreciate, therefore, that any agreement entered into would have to be entered into in the absence of opposition and by mutual consent. Until consideration can be given to this matter, it is our intention to have an official of the Indian Affairs Branch undertake a number of educational surveys in areas such as the Big Sky area in northern Manitoba and in a number of outlying districts where the children of school age appear to be evenly divided between Indians and half-breeds.\n\nThe Honourable J.

(RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nAugust 8th, 1946.\n\nHonourable J.A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nIt has been noted with considerable interest in our Department that a joint Committee of the House to survey all matters related to the welfare of the Indian population in Canada has been appointed. The hope is frequently expressed that as a result of the study made by this Committee, recommendations will be made that will be of value to Provincial Departments of Education in their efforts to bring improved educational services to the non-Indian residents of the northern localities. Your action in having the committee appointed is well regarded. We are prepared to offer any information that we may be able to give in respect to communities where, by reason of a mixed population, the problem involves provincial responsibilities to the end that mutually advantageous arrangements may be worked out.\n\nInspectors of our Department frequently cite instances where joint action by the Department of Indian Affairs and the Provincial Department of Education would result in improved service to both groups. One specific illustration is the Big Eddy District close to The Pas. This school district is semi-organized only and the school building we have there is in poor condition. We hesitate to rebuild it into a standard classroom because only 400 yards away, the Indian School is located much more favorably and with good grounds. There are about thirty half-breed children and thirty Treaty Indian children resident in the district. Our Divisional School Inspector, Mr. Bateman, strongly urges the enlargement of your school building by adding a second room so that it can accommodate all of the sixty children in the district. This, he believes, would make for better understanding among the people, a better school service could be offered, and the status of the education locally would be raised - something that is sorely needed at present in this particular community. The matter has been discussed with your Departmental official, Mr. Lovell, in The Pas, who also recommends co-operative action if a suitable understanding could be reached.\nIt would be necessary to provide for -\n\n1. The appointment of a local board to administer the affairs of the school that could be made up of one member appointed by our Department, one by your Department, and a third who might possibly be a representative of the church - the selection to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n2. The division of the costs of operating the school on a per capita basis. The operating costs could include an agreed upon amount to offset capital charges occasioned by the enlargement of your present building. In this connection, an arrangement that would place the ownership of the building itself in one or other of the two departments would, I believe, be more satisfactory than to attempt a joint ownership plan. In this particular instance, your department already has a serviceable unit and it would seem to be more practical to have your Department retain the building ownership and include in the operating charges a sum that would carry the item of its enlargement costs. There may be other cases where it would be desirable to have the building ownership rest with the Provincial Government.\n\nWe should also give consideration to the type of education to offer in these special schools. I believe you or some member of your departmental staff will be interested in reading a special report prepared last winter by Inspector Bateman covering the general situation in the educational field in northern Manitoba. There is strong support for the necessity of providing children, both Indian and Half-breed, in these localities with a type of education adapted to the environment in which they live. By combining our efforts where it is practical and sensible to do so, we can expect to cover the field more adequately by employing specially selected teachers and providing suitable equipment. By attempting to do it through separate organizations, our total costs are certain to run up much higher.\n\nPerhaps you would be good enough to refer this proposal regarding Big Eddy School District to a member of your staff with instructions to examine the possibilities it has as an experimental test. I would like very much at some convenient time, to have the benefit of your own views as to ways and means by which the educational offerings in these mixed communities of Indians and Half-breeds may be better adapted to meet their special needs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J.C. Dryden - Minister of Education.\nIV - POINTS RELATIVE TO THE EDUCATIONAL SITUATION IN ISOLATED AREAS OF THE NORTH\n\n1. Away from the steel, the great majority of those without educational facilities are the Indians and the Half-breeds. Throughout this discussion it should be noted that an Indian is a Treaty Indian, a ward of the Dominion Government; while a Half-breed is any person who has any proportion of Indian blood but is not a Treaty Indian. It is therefore evident that many Half-breeds are by heritage really Indians, but since they are not on the Treaty lists they are classified as Half-breeds. There are many cases of blood brothers, both of whom were Treaty at one time, but one commuted his treaty money and so lost his standing as a Treaty Indian, while the other remained Treaty. The one would then be classed as a Half-breed and his education would be the charge of the Province, while the other would be classed as Treaty, and he a charge in all respects of the Dominion.\n\n2. In general terms neither the Indian nor the Half-breed is accepted by the white man on anything approaching equal terms.\n\n3. The Indian and the Half-breed have points in common apart from blood ties. They fish the same lakes, trap the same grounds, live in the same type of home, eat the same food, think the same thoughts, worship at the same churches, suffer from the same diseases - and attend different schools (if any), the one Provincial, the other Dominion.\n\n4. Both groups are essentially nomadic. When the mood strikes them, they go. This is partly due to racial inheritance, partly economic necessity. Frequently an Indian or Half-breed on a regular job will get the urge to go somewhere, and he is likely to leave immediately, without waiting to collect his pay or to arrange for mechanical transport. At certain periods of the year he and his family leave for the fishing grounds or the trap-line, and may be away from their home point for several months. Their movements are generally within a circumscribed area and they have what might be termed a permanent address.\n\n5. The Indians may send their children to Boarding Schools operated by the various churches. These schools are not held in high esteem as they take the children away from their families. Contrary to the belief current among Whites, Indians can and do cherish affection for their children. I have frequently seen weeping and wailing when the time came for separation of parents and children. The Boarding Schools and Day Schools operated by the churches are charged with exercising religious interference. I am sure the charge is well-founded. In the first instance the schools are opened in a spirit of missionary zeal. If there is to be no religious influence exerted, why do the churches operate the schools? They have served... a purpose\na purpose in the past, and served it well, but they are now an anachronism.\n\nToo frequently the product of the Boarding School is a problem to himself and to the community from which he hails. He has been away from his normal surroundings during his formative years, while his mates at home were busily learning the traditional Indian skills essential to making a livelihood in the bush. On his return he may speak English fluently and be well versed in many of the white man's ways. He may have learned much about raising crops and stock, and he may have a sound grounding in mathematics. But he cannot compete with the White man in the White man's enterprises - he is in fact an outcast in white circles, his position somewhat analogous to that of the Negro in the Southern States - and he knows nothing of fishing, trapping or hunting, so is unable to compete with his own race. Outside the White Man's sphere of activity his English may serve him well in making a fine speech, but he may not be proficient in Cree; his crops are not found in the field, but on the lakes, marshes and traplines; his stock consists of beaver and muskrats, not cows, sheep or hogs; and his mathematics is useless above the most elementary level. It is not unusual, therefore, the discover that the Indian who writes a fine hand or turns a polished phrase becomes a renegade and ne'er-do-well.\n\n6. The Day School student lives at home, maintains contact with his future surroundings and methods of livelihood, learning as much out of school as he does in it. If the school is free from Church influence, his whole day is devoted to non-religious phases of education. This is important because such schools in the outlying districts cannot hope to hold their students for the extended periods which prevail outside, either on the basis of the number of days in the school year, nor on the basis of the number of school years during which attendance may be maintained. In either case, the payment of Family Allowances may exert an influence yet to be assessed.\n\n7. Because the Indian problem and the Half-breed problem are indivisible the Dominion and the Province have seen fit to enter into a co-operative agreement with regard to the development of the fur resources of Northern Manitoba. In this instance, the agreement calls for a division of the costs of initiating, administering and executing certain fur rehabilitation measures. Surely, if the guaranteeing of a livelihood to these two groups is part and parcel of the same problem, then is not the guaranteeing of suitable education to the same groups a joint responsibility, to be jointly undertaken and jointly financed. (The agreement referred to above is the Dominion-Provincial Fur Agreement, dated March 23rd, 1945. It is a document worth reading if only as an indication of the mutual benefits which may accrue through a policy of mutual action as between Province and Dominion.)\nOttawa, August 16, 1944\n\nDear Mr. Dryden:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 8th, and also a report submitted to you by Mr. B. Scott Bateman sent forward therewith.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch and myself are deeply interested in the subject matter of these communications.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that it is our intention to seek authority in the revised Indian Act to enter into agreements with Provincial Departments of Education for the joint operation of day schools in remote regions of the Dominion.

No Metis schooling has been provided here for nearly five years due to a lack of teachers.\n\nThe program, reported in Ottawa yesterday by federal Indian Affairs, will have Indian and Metis children attending the same schools in future, instead of following the previous practice of segregation.\n\nThe plan is one which Manitoba has had under consideration for some time, Provincial Education Minister J. C. Dryden said here today.\n\nBriefly, the joint education plan will mean this: In the past the Dominion Government was responsible for all Indian affairs, including education, and all Indian schools were established under federal authority. The Metis, on the other hand, came under provincial jurisdiction, and their schools were province-sponsored.\n\n\"One criticism of that mode of operations,\" said Mr. Dryden, \"was that the Indian and Metis children in the northern part of the province played together, ate together and hunted together, when it came to school attendance, they were compelled to go to separate institutions.\"\n\nWill Build Schools\n\nUnder the new plan, the Indian Affairs branch has agreed that in areas where there are no schools and there is a preponderance of Indians, the federal government will build a school.

There are several teacherages in northern Manitoba that should enjoy priority over Big Eddy.\n\nMay I suggest that the Acting Agent be requested to investigate Miss M's complaint to me that the Indians did not dig the inside well deep enough and that it is going dry? She says that the contractor, Mr. Lyons, suggests putting in a sand-point during the Christmas vacation.\n\nThis direction could be coupled with instructions to provide a thermometer for each room and paper towels.

I guess I didn't make it very clear I meant by another teacher available to hire her as I wouldn't want to disappoint you at the last should the doctor advise me not to return to work so by all means hire another teacher.\n\nI am very sorry, but you will understand why I am not able to accept a school right away. I know you are anxious to get the position filled.\nand they have been without a teacher for so long.\n\nI am returning to Montreal after Christmas for my check up. Kindly advise me if there are any other schools available at present. Did you get a teacher for Moraviantown Centre? Should there be any other vacancy and another teacher available before I have my check up I do not hesitate to hire another teacher.\n\nI will correspond with you after seeing the doctor and if I am able to return to work and no school available it just can't be helped. I quite understand you want the position filled, and I can't accept at school now as I don't want to cause any inconvenience.\n\nThanking you for your letter,\n\nFaithfully,\n\nJ. G.

I sincerely regret that just a few hours previous to the arrival of your telegram, we had notified Mr. Bowman to have Miss Irwin report for duty on January 5.\n\nFor nearly a month, we had been negotiating with Miss Fairservice, who has a first class certificate and some 20 odd years' experience in our Indian schools. She is one of our best teachers but has been in ill health for the past few months. On December 16 we received a letter from her, stating that she would be unable to go to Big Eddy until she had a doctor's examination in January. Therefore we notified Mr. Bowman to contact Miss Irwin, about whom he had previously written us. Apparently, she is a friend of Miss Montgomery's and has one year's teaching experience. I did not feel particularly satisfied with sending in a teacher of this calibre to handle the Metis at Big Eddy, but due to the acute shortage of teachers, we decided to accept her services on a temporary basis.\n\nI will be writing you a separate letter concerning the supplying of books and other materials at this school. I sincerely appreciate your efforts in supplying a teacher and hope that we will have better luck for our combined efforts the next time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nR. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nDepartment of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n5th January, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBy coincidence the girl whom your Mr. Bowman has engaged as second teacher at Big Eddy school is the same girl as we had in mind.\n\nI had hoped that we might be able to secure the services of a fully qualified teacher for this room, but the shortage here, as elsewhere, is very acute. Our preliminary enquiries with regard to Miss Irwin brought replies which were quite favourable towards her, and we sincerely hope that she will do satisfactory work at Big Eddy.\n\nAs I believe you are aware, I have more than a passing interest in the successful operation of Big Eddy School as an experiment in collaboration between our two departments. You may be assured that I will do everything possible, now and in the future, to assist you in this district.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB. Scott Bateman\nAdministrative Officer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will recall our discussion in October or 1946 in connection with the operation of the Big Eddy School near The Pas. The understanding which we reached on that occasion was to combine the educational work for the Indian and Half-Breed children in the one unit. Progress along this line appears to be satisfactory and, while we chose to regard this move at Big Eddy as being experimental, the practical advantage of following this plan at other points is evident.\n\nThe case of South Indian Lake, a settlement about 150 miles North of Wabden, is being brought to our attention quite frequently. The school population within a mile and a half radius of the central point is reported as being 61 Indian children and 25 Half-Breed children.\n\nIt is an isolated community and if a building is to be erected, supplies would have to go in by winter freight within the next six weeks.\n\nI would be pleased to have the views of your Department on the advisability of providing the people there with a school. We are ready to co-operate in sharing in the costs of operating the school and to render such assistance as we can in its administration.\n\nTrusting you will let us have the benefit of the opinion of your officials on this proposal at an early date, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.G. Dryden,\nMinister of Education.\nEMPLOYEE QUESTIONNAIRE\n\nTo be filled by all employees when taken on strength of the Department of Mines and Resources. This form may be filled in ink.

The heating unit is a camp comfort stove enclosed with a zinc jacket which works well enough in all but the colder weather. In colder weather it is impossible to keep the school warm according to Mrs. Montgomery. A cupboard is needed in Mrs. Montgomery's room. There should also be a library bookcase provided for each room. The school is without a fire extinguisher. A storm door on the North door would help to solve the heating problem.\n\nA second toilet should be built. At present there is but one toilet for the whole school\".\n\nYou are hereby authorized to make local purchase of the following:\n\n36 rolls Toilet Paper\n12 tins Chloride of Lime\n3 large bottles Lysol\n\nYou are also authorized to build a second toilet at a cost not to exceed $100.

Neary - Educ Division\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease refer to your letter of 3rd inst., files 502-1 (E), 502-5, and 502-6, regarding Big Eddy Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Montgomery has been interviewed, and requested to take more interest in her school activities, and also enforce discipline. She has agreed to our requests and has expressed her willingness to co-operate in both respects. We know there is a marked difference in the teaching ability of the above mentioned and Mrs. Gratton, and would be in favor of a transfer of Miss Montgomery to a smaller school should the opportunity arise.\n\nThe school children last year were separated in order that a grading of the Metis could be obtained. This term the Metis and treaty Indians are intermingled and the school is operating as a combined day school.\n\nThe toilet paper, chloride of lime, and lysol have been delivered to the school.\n\nIn my letter of 3rd inst., file 107-128, I requested authority to dig a spring well at Big Eddy for a total cost of $34.00. The well has been dug and cribbed and a double top put on it and has approximately six feet of water in it. We trust the accountable cheque is forthcoming.\n\nWe have built a storm door for the North side of the school, and have put it on. The cost of lumber and nails for this door is $10.60, and for the thumb latch, hinges and screws is $1.55. There is no charge for labour as we did it ourselves. We will send a voucher on the above two bills.\n\nAs soon as we can get a man to build the toilet, we will proceed with the erection of same.\n\nWe note your comments on the cupboard, bookcases, and fire extinguishers, and will be expecting same, shortly.\n\nTrusting our action is approved,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: B.F. Neary\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wired you yesterday as follows:\n\n\"Due to injuries to Miss E.B. Montgomery, Saturday, November 13th, Stop. One room at Big Eddy School will be closed until she is able to return next week.\"\n\nBelieving that you should know the facts in this connection I would like to advise you that Miss Montgomery was attacked by one of the half-breeds from Big Eddy, on Saturday night, November 13th. As she is the dispenser of drugs for that community she frequently has calls from men at night, so let this man in without hesitation.\n\nApparently he attacked her and she struggled with him both inside and outside the house. It was several hours, most of which was spent outside the house, before she was able to free herself and run for assistance. During this time she was badly bruised about the body and face, and her feet were frozen. She finally reached a neighbor's home and a message was sent to the Doctor. She is at present being cared for at the Doctor's home.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. picked this man up the next day, and we hope he will be convicted on an attempt of rape.\n\nI interviewed Miss Montgomery as regards to her returning to the school, and she said she would be willing to do so as soon as the Doctor approved. As she will be called as a witness when this case comes up, likely at the spring assizes, I feel it would be wise to leave her here, for the full school term.\n\nI would appreciate very much hearing from you if you have any further instructions or suggestions in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.M.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nYour memorandum of November 20th enclosing copy of a letter from E. Law, Superintendent, Indian Agency, The Pas, Manitoba, regarding Miss E. B. Montgomery - Big Eddy Indian Day School, has been considered carefully.\n\nIt is noted that a charge against the person responsible for this attack may be laid under the Criminal Code and also that the suspect is a half-breed and therefore not of Indian status.\n\nIn these circumstances it is presumed that proceedings will be taken in the usual way by the authorities responsible for the administration of justice in the Province of Manitoba. There does not appear to be any action which this Branch could take in the matter. It is agreed, however, that the offence is most heinous and great sympathy is felt for the victim. It is certainly considered that members of the staff devoting their lives to the education of the Indian people, should be protected in every way possible.\n\nThis Branch of course cannot assume any responsibility for any expense involved in Criminal Code enforcement which is the responsibility and duty of the provincial authorities.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 8, 1949.\n\nExtract from Monthly Day School Return.\nRemarks made by Mr. E. Law on the\nBig Eddy Indian Day School.\n\nCalled at the school February 24th\nand found it closed. Miss Montgomery ill with\nflu, but no notification of absence from either\nMiss Montgomery or Mrs. Grattan had been sent in\nto the Indian Office. Considerable lack of\ninterest in their work from both teachers. We\ndefinitely need a change of staff.\n\nRe: asking for further provincial inspector's reports.\nInspector Moffet's report of 19 Oct. '48 indicates that\nhe thinks Mrs. Grattan is pretty good but that he\nshares Mr. Bateman's doubts about Miss Montgomery\nand about the course of studies \"being suited to the\nneeds of the Indians... or whites either (?).\"\n\nI wish I could spare the time after the Assizes\nadjournment dies down and before the onset of summer,\nto spend several days (8.30 - 4.00) observing every\nsubject and analytically \"preparing\" \"progress\" etc.\n\nAt the same time we might come close to finalizing\nmatters at The Pas (on which please see my memo).\nMr. Sup't Law has additional projects that require conversation.\n\nC.A.T.C.\n9/3/49\nJune 22, 1949,\n\nMr. R.S.

I presume that Miss Montgomery could be transferred to the Fairford School at the same time. If Mrs. Olds has a large family, then she would probably have to board in The Pas and travel daily to the school by bus.\n\nBernard F.

As is usual with new teachers, she was only paid for the September quarter, 1921, for the number of days she actually taught the school, and she therefore received the sum of $22.50. For both the December and March quarters she was paid one quarter of her yearly salary, or $112.50 for each quarter.\n\nAs the school year in Indian day schools begins on September first and ends on June 30th, and as her June quarter return showed that she had taught during the period she was in charge of this school the required number of days, the Department paid her for the June quarter the balance of her yearly salary, which amounted to $302.50. If she continues in charge of this school, she will be paid at the same rate as previously, viz.: $450 per annum.\n\nThe method of payment of bonus to teachers of Indian day schools has not yet been decided upon.

He has been in the service of the Department as School teacher for twenty-eight years having taught latterly at Cumberland House and now he is retiring from the service he wishes the Department to be good enough to pay his expenses from Cumberland to St. Peter's where he intends in future to reside as that is the Band to which he belongs.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) X.

The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $20.00 for material, and $5.00 for labour. It will be necessary for you to purchase the material required, and, if possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You or the teacher can arrange for the labour in having the work done.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price on the material and the prices quoted.\n\nThis work should be carried out as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

S.

He also states that two new closets - one for boys and one for girls - placed some distance apart, are badly needed. The old closet is on its side and at the present time there is no toilet accommodation at this school.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the panes of glass required put in and the windows placed in good condition. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou will be good enough to furnish an estimate of the cost of building two closets which you consider would be satisfactory for the use of the boys and girls at this school. This matter should receive your prompt attention, in order that the work can be carried out this summer.\n\nIn official letter of April 3rd, last, you were authorized to have the school room painted inside.

(RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nRe letter 128-15-5 of the 28th ultimo, regards Big Eddy Day School, I beg to state that I got the painting completed in May last.\n\nIn regards to the closets I beg to advise that this be left over until the matter of a new teacher is settled. In case we get a qualified teacher it will be necessary to put up a house, and the matter of construction of closets could be handled at same time. The windows can be left out for same reason, also the children will break more of them before the school is opened, I always have had trouble at this point on this account.\n\nTrusting these recommendations are agreeable to the Department,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

If a teacher is obtained, the Department will expect you to arrange to have any repairs required to the school building carried out in due time.\n\nRegarding the erection of a teacher's residence, it will be necessary for you to give full particulars regarding the house which you would recommend be put up and the approximate cost of the same, also the cost of building two closets.\n\nWe hope that the services of a qualified teacher can be obtained, and the work at this school continued during the next school year. We have had an application from Mr. Alfred H. Cheales, Dominion City, Man., for a position as teacher. He formerly taught in an Indian school for two years, and while he has no professional qualifications, he has had college training in England. We have informed him that there is a vacancy at the Big Eddy school, and that he might communicate with you. His services would, no doubt, be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIn reference to letter 128-15-5 of the 10th ultimo, regards repairs at Big Eddy Day School, third paragraph of letter, I beg to state that there is a one story log building near the school which could be used as teachers residence if we employed an unmarried teacher. It has been unoccupied for two years now and is not in very good repair, but if we succeed in getting an unmarried teacher the cost of putting the place in repair should not cost more than $50.00. In regards to the closets I could have these built in town for about $25.00 each and shipped to the school.\n\nIf the Department grants $125.00 I can have the whole place put in shape, but I would not start any work till a teacher is obtained.\n\nOf course if a married teacher is employed this arrangement would not be sufficient.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nAsst.

I took the matter up with Rural Dean Fraser of The Pas, and he does not like to recommend Mr. Cheales. I know the gentleman personally and although he is a decent chap I do not think he is any improvement on former teachers at that point. I have informed him in a nice letter that the Church authorities do not desire to recommend his application under the new rules.\n\nI am taking up the matter of building in separate letter.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAsst.

We note that you estimate the cost of these repairs would be approximately $50. You may also arrange, if a teacher is secured, to have the closets built at The Pas and take out any surplus in a suitable position at the school. You should not undertake any of this work until a teacher is engaged, when you may expend an amount not exceeding $125 in fitting up the building as living quarters for the teacher and in erecting the closets.\n\nWe note that, if the services of a married teacher are required, it would be necessary to carry out considerably more repairs in order to provide living accommodation. In that event, any repairs undertaken should be done as cheaply as possible. You should purchase any material required, after obtaining competitive prices, and arrange for the labour in doing the work. You will keep proper time sheets for the labour employed and forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nWe note by your letter of the above date that you have written Mr. Alfred H.

It would brighten up the class room if\nwalls and ceiling were painted a cream white. The\nceiling is low - being only 8 1/3 feet. Two of the\nstorm windows should be on hinges in order that the air\nmay be flushed out. It is very difficult to ventilate\nthe building as pupils are close to the windows.\n\nI consider the school house too small for the number\nof children.

Up to the present she has been using the one supplied for the girls at the school.\n\nShe also asks for a fence to be built around her house and the school. This has never been necessary up to this time, but lately some young chaps come around the place and peep in at the windows at all hours, greatly disturbing the old lady. These improvements would cost about $75.00.\n\nI know that funds are precious just now, but if there is anything to spare I would beg to recommend that the above be allowed.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

From all accounts the rain gets in and the mud smells badly, besides seeping out continually, and altogether the building is disputable. All agreed with the missionary that Miss Millan's work was thoroughly good and clearly her influence is most marked on the Indians as well as thoroughly good teaching work with the children. She seems to put her whole heart into the work and I would strongly urge that a new school like Humberstone's should be built there. I ought to add that the opening of these two day schools there has had a very marked effect on the whole Devon Mission, it was a good stroke of work when those schools were opened.\n\nG. E.

This is not sanitary. We really felt we were to have one this last year, and as we did not, the Indians have got discouraged. They were taking the greatest interest in the school work. I had to discharge nearly all my big boys and girls. Those who are left feel the loss. There are many who should be at school, but are forbidden on account of air space. Most of the day, winter and summer, we have to keep our door open, besides the stove pipe is only a few inches above our heads. The heat is awful sometimes. The children are very eager to learn and are doing well. I had one boy who passed from Grade 1 to Grade VII in three years, but he was discharged although he wishes to go on.\nOttawa, 24th April, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the 19th March you forwarded to the Department certain vouchers in favour of the Western Trading Store, The Pas. Two of the firm's accounts, dated 22nd December, 1927 amounted respectively to $6.00 and $16.75, or a total of $22.75. Through inadvertence a cheque No. 3962 covering these accounts was drawn for $22.50, and it went forward to the firm on the 7th instant. It is apparent therefore that an over-payment of 25\u00a2 has been made. Kindly obtain refund to this amount and forward the money to the Department under cover of a letter. This is necessary to adjust the Department's books.\n\nThe voucher Nos were 474 and 475.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nJ.W.

The building in which the school is being held is a very old log building past all repair. It was built about thirty-five years ago without any foundation and the smell of rotten wood makes the atmosphere always musty and disagreeable for both teacher and pupils. The old ceiling is very low and the building has been condemned several times as unsanitary.\n\nYour Inspector visited it the other day and ordered ten or fifteen children to be sent home and the number reduced to twenty because of the confined air space. The Agent has been spoken to several times about the condition of this building and he says that it only needs the application from the Bishop.\n\nThere are thirty-five children around this school of which thirty were actually in attendance when the Health Inspector prohibited more than twenty.\n\nA new school building to hold thirty-five children with a residence for the teacher is urgently needed, and I sincerely hope that you may be able to sanction this so that it may be ready for use before the New Year. It has been badly needed for some time past.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent, Indian Affairs\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSeptember 20, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to a new classroom at the Big Bady Indian Day School. I am pleased to inform Your Lordship that the Department hopes to have funds available for this building next year. A suitable amount will be placed in our Estimates for presentation to Parliament. I may say that it is not the intention to provide a new teacher's residence, as a small cottage was erected there four years ago.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRe: Rev. G. H. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nBIG REDDY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school comes under the Church of England who have Miss Millen as teacher. I understand she has taught for many years and apparently is doing good work.\n\nThe register calls for 22 pupils, but only 15 were present, 7 boys and 8 girls. The grades range from 1 to 6 and the work examined was good.\n\nThe classroom was exceptionally clean and tidy and I believe Miss Millen takes great pride in keeping the school as bright and cheerful as possible.\n\nThe school building is built of logs and sided up on the inside. The ceiling is low and yet the room was well aired on the day of inspection. Miss Millen claimed the place was easily heated, even in the severe weather.\n\nUndoubtedly a new building will be needed here before many years if the school is to be continued. I would, however, point out that the MacKay Boarding School is not more than two to three miles away from any of these Indian homes and as they are practically all Church of England people, it would appear unnecessary to erect a new school, especially if the boarding school can accommodate the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

An item of $5,000 was placed in the Estimates to erect this building, provided it was decided to continue the day school activity. I have examined the returns, and I find that the average attendance has been over 20 for some years. The Department therefore considers it advisable to continue this school. You will please make arrangements for the erection of a new classroom at your convenience.

This is to be built on the same plan as the schools erected on the Brokenhead and Peguis Reserves last summer and is also of the same type as the one erected at The Pas in 1925. The school is 32x30, 10 ft. studs, cement foundation and, of course, will be heated by stove.

I understand Miss Millen is retiring at the close of the December quarter.\n\nThe roll calls for 28 pupils, and I found eighteen present, 8 boys and 10 girls. The children were fairly well clothed, but were somewhat untidy, as though little attention had been given to their personal appearance. A large number of children were suffering from severe colds.\n\nThe grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 12     |\n| II    | 2      |\n| III   | 4      |\n| V     | 3      |\n| VII   | 1      |\n\nThe children appear to understand their work, and in most cases speak out well, at least, much better than in either the Pas Day School or the Mackay Residential School.\n\nThe attendance for the last quarter was 18.4, and so far this quarter, it is equally as good.\n\nW.

Please arrange to have a latch installed and the door repaired.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the blackboard, which is bulged. He states there should have been an air space about the thickness of a latch between the plaster and the board, in order to prevent the board from becoming warped. On the occasion of your next visit to the school, please examine this board, and, if possible, have same repaired and placed in good condition. If unable to place the present board in a satisfactory condition, you should give the dimensions, when consideration would be given to supplying a new board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.128-1556 of the 19th January 1931, I beg to say that the Big Eddy Indian Day School was closed from February 1st till March 11th, owing to the resignation of the Teacher and appointment of the Rev. C. Morris.\n\nThis will account for my delay in this matter.\n\nI visited the school on the 17th instant, and examined the Blackboard with Mr. Morris who claims that the \"bulging\" mentioned does not in any way impair the usefulness of the board.\n\nThe blackboard covers all one side and one end of the school. At one joint it required a strip, which I will have put on, about 2\" wide, to keep the ends in place.\n\nThe latch on toilets will be put on at the same time, and I trust this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

She states also that there is great need for a pump and well.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you, regarding the erection of a new closet and also with reference to the pump and well. I may say that our funds this fiscal year are extremely limited, and the Department will not be prepared to authorize any large expenditure in the erection of a new closet or in providing a well and pump. In forwarding your report as to the work you would recommend be carried out in connection with the above matters, you should give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The other one should be moved to another site repaired and painted. I should say this could be done for $25.00 which would be much less than building new ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, June 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the closets at the Big Eddy Indian Day School. It is noted that one of these closets is in fairly good condition and that, with some repairs and painting, it would be serviceable; also that you recommend the other closet be moved to another site and repaired and painted.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging to have this last mentioned closet moved to another site, repaired and painted, and the repairs and painting required carried out to the other closet. You should see that both these closets are satisfactorily repaired and placed in good condition, keeping all expense for the purpose as low as possible. When the work is completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any materials and for the labour.\n\nRelative to the well, I have to say that we will have no funds this year to provide the expenditure required for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He is a man well up in years but in my opinion is doing very excellent work.

Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Major Clark:\n\nWe have received your telegrams and letters and have gleaned much useful information there from. Two problems have arisen which we would like you to handle before returning here.\n\nOne is at Edmonton and our telegrams to you have explained the situation sufficiently.\n\nThe second is at the Pas. If you will read the attached letter of last year from Mr. Dryden, the Minister of Education for Manitoba and our own Minister's reply thereto, you will get a good idea of the situation that exists at Big Eddy.\n\nWe have $5,000 now available for the construction of an extra room at the Big Eddy School. I want you to go and see Mr. Rogers, the Chief Inspector of Schools for the Province of Manitoba. We are quite prepared to put an addition onto our school and to have the Half-breed children attend. Then they can close down their present school.\n\nI am going to try to inform Mr. Bateman, the local School Inspector, and Mr. Lovell, the local Indian Agent, of your estimated arrival so that they can go to Big Eddy with you. Apparently it is some eight miles from the Pas.\n\nWhen there I want you to look the school over carefully and decide what will be needed in the way of an addition. Confidentially, we can tell you that we do not want to send anyone from our Surveys and Engineering\nBranch in to look over the situation unless it is absolutely necessary. They are now swamped with work and if we could get a local contractor to submit a bid as to what we want, then I think we can get approval without much difficulty. Mr. Bateman and Mr. Lovell will probably know local conditions and may know of someone who can handle this situation. If we waste a lot of time with blue prints, etc., etc., we will end the summer with no school building but lots of red tape still to be cut. If necessary, make a sketch upon which a fairly skilled carpenter can go to work, but I will leave the details to your own good judgment.\n\nWould you also discuss with Mr. Lovell the situation re a school at Nelson House. We have $8,000 in the estimates now for a combined school and teacher's residence at this point. I understand from him that it will be necessary to purchase the materials this year and ship them in for construction next year.\n\nPlease get as much information as you can concerning the shipping in of materials so that you will be able to advise us when they are being sent in next winter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S. The Minister's letters are both confidential and you should not let them get out of your possession.\n\nBFN/MOD\nOttawa, June 4, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A.

Arrangements are being made to forward you an accountable advance for the amount mentioned.\n\nHowever, I would point out that as Major Clark advised you, we have $5,000. provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of this school. We have already issued purchase order 21033 for materials costing $2,060.59. In addition, I understand there will be some more materials required. Taking into account the purchase order mentioned above and the current advance of $2,500. brings the total expenditure already over $4,500.\n\nPlease let us have a detailed report regarding the work that is being done and the progress being made. We would also like your assurance that the total expenditure will not exceed the amount provided in the appropriation.\n\nIn telegram dated June 18th, 1947, you were requested to advise us of the name of the foreman and the monthly salary that he is being paid. This information has not yet been supplied and I would appreciate receiving it immediately.\n\nIs the foreman the only white labourer and are all other employees Indians? When advising us regarding the foreman you should also let us know the wages you are paying the other persons engaged in the work.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nCivil Murray\nPlease write\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJuly 24th, 1947\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 21st, file number 128-15-5 (W.T. 1), in this connection I beg to advise that we are building a new classroom at Big Eddy School, consequently we will require considerable equipment and up to the present time I have not had the time owing to the fact that I have been sick in hospital and confined to the house for the last 5 weeks.\n\nBut as soon as circumstances warrant I will make a thorough investigation and give you a detailed statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

When Major Clark was here from the Department, he secured a tender on this building, which ran over the estimate. I assured Major Clark that I could handle this building with a foreman and Indian labour. Soon after Mr. Clark left I was confined to hospital and then to the house, the consequence was that I could not give this work the attention I expected to. But I secured a bid for labour to erect this school for the sum of $1800.00 with the understanding that as much as possible of the labour would be Indian.\n\nAs regards the amount appropriated for this school I would appreciate it very much if the amount of $500.00 could be added as I intend to dig a well in the basement, also I will have to buy stove, sink, etc to complete the kitchen. I can assure you that it will not be a dollar spent that is not absolutely necessary.\n\nThis school is situated on the main highway which will evidently run from The Pas to Flin Flon, and I would not want to have to skimp any work for a few dollars.\n\nOver\nAs Major Clark said this school is the efforts of the joint governments, as the half-breds will be going to this school and will be rather conspicuous and I want to do a first class job.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I am emphasizing that these should be adapted for opening at the top; proper storm windows to be fitted; fly screens to be provided.\n\nThe basement (18' x 12') cost a lot more than estimated as it had to be fully concreted on all sides to a height of 7' to prevent the gravel on which the old school was built from continually slipping.\n\nMr. Popovich claims to have built successfully many of the type of inside wells which we want.\n\nThe old lath and plaster had to be thrown out, and they are \"waiting\" for Gyproc wall finishing.\n\nPainting has not yet been begun. Mr. Lovell has secured good paint in attractive colours.\n\nThe working gang of six Indians will, Mr. Popovich says, be reduced by half next week.\n\nThe bricklayers will then go to work on a new chimney. Meanwhile, could you advise regarding our purchasing agent's prospects of getting that over-size camp heater, please?\n\nI recommend sympathetic consideration of the Agent's request for an additional $500.\n\nC.C.J.

Cameron.\n\nDon:\n\nOur Dr. Yule at The Pas was telling me with respect to the school which is called Big Eddy School, about a dozen miles out of The Pas, that the heating arrangements are very bad. There is a stove which is really inadequate. He knows this isn't exactly his business but he is concerned about it from the viewpoint of the health of the students, about 50% of whom, (being Indians), are charges of his. He believes that the health of the student is going to suffer by reason of the inadequacy. I understand this is one of those schools run by the province and Dominion jointly because of a mixture of half breeds and Indians and that in this case there is a majority of Indians and consequently, the job is a Dominion one rather than a Provincial one. I guess the matter referred to is one for Bob Howey. There isn't any Indian Agent at The Pas just now; the last man having died a few months ago.\n\nR.M.\n\nLyn - Can you find out the facts for me please so that I can reply to Maybank.\n\nG.D.W.Cameron\n\nNo complaints so far\n\nC.A.F.C.\nMr. G.D.W. Cameron,\nDeputy Minister of Health,\nJackson Building.\n\nEX'D.\nNov. 27/47\n\nMr. Maybank's letter to you of Nov. 18 - Big Eddy School\n\nI have discussed this situation with\nMajor C.A.F. Clark, Field Superintendent of Schools\nfor Indian Affairs, Dept. of Mines and Resources.\n\nHe advises me that this school is the\nresponsibility of the department although a certain\nproportion of the children are provincial responsibility.\nHowever, as the majority of the children attending the\nschool are Seminon, they have assumed responsibility\nfor its administration.\n\nLast year it was operated as a one-room\nschool, but it is expected that commencing January 1st,\na second room will be open. The construction work was\ndone during the past summer.\n\nMajor Clark advises me that last year the\nteacher complained of the school; particularly her\nresidence, being very cold and during this summer the\nbuilding was insulated and a new heater purchased for\nthe school. He has had no complaints this fall but\nstates he is writing to make further enquiries.\n\nIf we obtain any further information, you\nwill be immediately advised.\n\nW.L. Falconer,\nAsst.

The water level has lowered considerably in the inside well at the school. I believe that this well will prove satisfactory if we are granted permission to increase the depth of the well by using an auger. The well would have to be pumped dry first.\n\nRegarding the complaint you received regarding heating of school, presumably from Dr. Yule, at the time he was out there, the storm windows had not been put on. I have visited the school many times since, and found it comfortable. I would suggest that coal be used in addition to wood in order to keep a more steady heat in the building during the night. Our estimates only asked for two tons of coal. This will be inadequate. Five tons would be a more feasible estimate, due to the building being doubled in size. Some kind of grate would have to be installed in the camp comfort furnace. However, I will purchase two thermometers and we can draw our conclusions from them at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.A. Bowman,\nA/Indian Agent.\n\nTAB/d\nJanuary 3, 1947.\n\nMr. T.A.

All pipes were made by Mr. Watts and installed from the furnace to both sides of the school, two hot air pipes and two cold air pipes. Four registers were countersunk in floor and wall. The furnace is encased with galvanized sheeting. All joinings are riveted in pipes and furnace casing. Cold air ducts are installed under the building. Several elbows were made which take a considerable length of time. Besides this Mr. Watts installed a sink with pump and pipes. Also a smoke pipe with damper. Two registers were supplied by Mr. Watts. Also nails and asbestos paper.\n\nThere are two sheets of galvanized iron left, and Mr. Watts states he will give the Department a credit note for same if agreeable. This would be approximately $5.55. If you concur, this amount may be deducted from our Voucher 18.\n\nThe galvanized sheeting was supplied by Department Purchase Order 22066.\n\nTrusting this is a satisfactory explanation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) T.A.

At that time Mr. Lovell felt this camp comfort would give sufficient heat for this building. I still think it can give sufficient heat if fired at night and early morning, but the fire is left when school is dismissed and not finished until school opening, thus the building gets quite cold during the night. During school period a good heat comes from both hot air registers. However, if a furnace was installed, it would cut down on the fuel bill considerably as coal could be used to hold a fire all night, and less wood would be burned.\n\nThe doors on the school are fitted properly, but due to frost they stick. As there are no storm doors on the school, no protection from the outside weather is supplied. Weather-stripping would also prevent the cold seeping in.\n\nI instructed the plumber to put save troughs over the doors while he was at Big Eddy School, but he forgot and I didn't press him, as we were overexpended. The roof should have save troughing all around to prevent ice from accumulating at doors and windows. There is about 175 feet of save troughing and a spout at each corner.\n\nThe cupboard Miss Montgomery had in the old school fell to pieces when being removed during rebuilding of the combined school. It is requested that a similar cupboard to the one in Miss Irwin's room be built for Miss Montgomery. The cost of it was $75.00.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.A. Bowman,\nA/Indian Agent.\n\nTAB/d\nOttawa, April 6, 1948.\n\nMr. T.A.

Law,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nSchool Inspector's Report -\nBig Eddy Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Moffat's report of October 19th on the above school has now been received here. His comments on Mrs. Montgomery's teaching ability are only fair. We have previously discussed this matter and you are aware that it is our intention to transfer her to a smaller school when the occasion arises. However, I note that she is teaching only some twenty children at the present time. He grades her as C plus for teaching skill, management, initiative and discipline. In General Comment he states as follows:\n\n\"Although, Miss Montgomery is not a particularly energetic type of teacher, I would rate her work as fair. I do believe her to be capable of better work, however, if her interest were greater\".\n\nHis comments concerning Mrs. Gratton is much more satisfactory. However, I note that apparently these children are still being separated as to being Indians and Half-Breeds. Your comment on this would be appreciated. In recommending that Mrs. Gratton be retained for another year, Mr. Moffat states as follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Gratton is a very capable teacher who is handling her class very well indeed. Her discipline is excellent without being at all oppressive\".\nBuildings and Equipment.\n\nUnder this heading Mr. Moffat writes as follows:\n\n\"Toilet paper and disinfectant should be secured. The school well has gone dry. A spring is being used as a source of water supply. Steps should be taken to ensure an adequate supply of water at the school. The heating unit is a camp comfort stove enclosed with a zinc jacket which works well enough in all but the colder weather. In colder weather it is impossible to keep the school warm according to Mrs. Montgomery. A cupboard is needed in Mrs. Montgomery's room. There should also be a library bookcase provided for each room. The school is without a fire extinguisher. A storm door on the North door would help to solve the heating problem.\n\nA second toilet should be built. At present there is but one toilet for the whole school\".\n\nYou are hereby authorized to make local purchase of the following:\n\n36 rolls Toilet Paper\n12 tins Chloride of Lime\n3 large bottles Lysol\n\nYou are also authorized to build a second toilet at a cost not to exceed $100. It is presumed that we will have your comments concerning the water situation. You may also build a storm door. If we could have an approximate cost of the last item, the necessary authority can be provided.\n\nWe are ordering the cupboards, bookcases and fire extinguishers required through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. The bookcases will be unpainted and you can arrange to have them varnished or painted when they arrive.\n\nYou might take an opportunity of advising Mr. Moffat of the action taken on his report.\n\nBernard F.

The total cost will be $34.00 with three Indians being employed to dig and crib the well.\n\nThe School Inspector, Mr. Moffat, in his report suggested that this spring well be put into use, as the well in the basement of the school is unsatisfactory.\n\nTrusting to receive accountable cheque as soon as possible, as Indians are going trapping and it will be difficult to get labour before freeze-up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that the Big Eddy School is not warm enough. When the temperature outdoors falls below ten degrees beyond zero, the temperature of the old part of the school does not rise above forty degrees. The heating facilities are inadequate. Mr. Davis was to see about purchasing a new heating system in Ottawa. If then the school is this cold it is extremely difficult to keep discipline. Mrs. Dyratton has noticed this too. She is a capable teacher and has splendid discipline in her class. The first two years I taught in Big Eddy in the old building.\nthe temperature was even colder than in the new school. When I had several big unruly boys in a small overcrowded classroom. These boys are now beyond school age.\n\nIs it possible to secure metal scissors? The plastic ones are useless. Indian children have the tendency to be destructive; easily broken articles further their mischief.\n\nI have one more Grade XII subject to write off to entitle me to my First Class Standing Teacher's Certificate in Manitoba. To obtain this, one needs a certain number of years teaching experience (Grade XII English, 7\u00bd units at summer school and some other subject). Would this standing qualify me for further advancement in your Department?\n\nThe teacherage is warmer since the repairs were made and coal is provided.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. B. Montgomery\n\nMr. Chelan:\nThe \"heating plant\" at Big Eddy, as you know, was completed locally because furnaces were unavailable at that time. It could be transferred to a one-room school if a proper furnace was supplied to Big Eddy.\n\nCATC.\n10th February, 1949.\n\nMr. E. Law,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nFollowing is an extract from a letter which we have just received from Miss E.B. Montgomery, teacher at the Big Eddy Day School:\n\n\"I wish to bring to your attention that the Big Eddy Day School is not warm enough. When the temperature outside falls 10 degrees below zero, the temperature of the old part of the school does not rise above 40 degrees. The heating facilities are inadequate. The teachersage is warmer since the repairs were made and coal is provided.\"\n\nWe understand that the main trouble with the heating system at this school is that the furnace in it was assembled locally due to the fact that we could not secure a proper furnace at the time. However, we thought that possibly you might make some repairs to the present heating system so that it will carry us through the balance of this winter.

DAVIS,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\ndated May 7, 1949.\n\nOriginal on 534-5\n\nThe difficulty experienced at the Big Eddy School I believe has been caused by the fact that they did not put in a proper furnace. The present heating unit is a Camp Comfort heater, boxed in, and there is not sufficient air intake, therefore the classrooms cannot be properly heated. When in Ottawa I intended to take this matter up with you and to request that a new furnace be put in this school. At the present time we have a furnace at The Pas, which was taken from God's Lake. This is a coal furnace but as there is a great deal of wood at The Pas and as the cutting of the wood employs the Indians I would not recommend installing this furnace.\nMay 12, 1949.\n\nMr. R. S.

Mr. Thomas reported that the new schoolhouse which was erected on the Black River Reserve under his supervision is completed and handed in his accounts, but it was found that they were not complete inasmuch as they were not supported by receipts for the wages paid by him. As the appropriation from which these vouchers are to be paid will soon lapse, and it is impossible to obtain those receipts within the time owing to the distant location of this Reserve, I therefore thought it best to put the vouchers through in their present shape. Mr. Thomas has returned to Hollow Water River and has promised to send these receipts, which will be transmitted to the Department as soon as received.\n\nMeantime, if cheques can be issued, I would ask that they be sent to this Office to be held pending the receipt of the receipts.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He says that a well constructed foundation of neatly fitted logs with dovetailed corners has been standing for some time awaiting completion, and that the Indians are anxious to have the building finished since they have done their part of the work.\n\nAlthough no funds are specially voted for this purpose in the current year's Estimates, you may, if you think it advisable, authorize the work to be proceeded with. The amount previously estimated was $250.00, which lapsed, and it is thought that this amount should be sufficient to complete the work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHon.

(RG 10, Volume 6229, file 503-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an account amounting to $111.90 which has been received by the Department from Mr Agent Fleetham for lumber, freighting, etc., in connection with the Black River School. The reasons for sending it to you are as follows:\n\n1. You should certify that the materials charged for have been supplied, and that the work charged for has been performed, and also that the prices charged for supplies and wages paid are fair and just.\n\n2. There are several errors in the account as indicated thus:\n\n   A. There is also an error in the addition of the account.\n\n3. An explanation should be given of the charge for provisions, which include tobacco.\n\n4. The accounts for freighting should be given in detail and receipted by Robinson & Co., if paid by them before the Department can recoup them.\n\n5. Receipts are also required for the wages paid Jones Anderson $65.00, and for cash paid Indian labourers $26.92, and for $8.00 paid John Passage for planting.\n\nIt is considered that you should know that this account would not be acceptable in its present form, as similar accounts in connection with other schools were returned to you last October (Files Nos 118274/5 and 233407) for the same reasons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev J. Sommese,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Selkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn sending the Voucher 134 Bereas River Agency payment to Robinson and Co Black River School House I dispatched it to the Agent R.J. Fleetham giving him all particulars thinking that his affidavit would be sufficient as he was made acquainted with all the circumstances here on the ground.\n\nSince receipt of your letter above noted I have certified to the same and returned it to him in Triplicate for his further endorsement. It should reach you today in its amended form.\n\nThe wrong addition was the fault of the copyist who omitted an entry or two. The total asked was all right as you will see. The corrected copies are more simple.\n\nThe charge for tobacco was as in the other cases of Jack Head and Blood Vein River given in payment of Indian Labor. It must also be remembered that on Lake Winnipeg there are no roads and any movement represents expense in hiring boats and men to return said boats hence charges of this kind. It is difficult to take receipts always for small amounts.\n\nFreighting Accounts are duly receipted. Robinson and the N.W.M. Co and the Dominion Fish Company are one and the same.\n\nIndians who worked then cannot now be found and so the whole is receipted by Mr Thomas the School Teacher at the time and certified by myself.\n\nIt is claimed by Captain Robinson's Accountant that the whole Bill was forwarded to me in 1908 with all necessary receipts. I have no such papers on file and cannot remember sending them to Ottawa so\nam inclined to think it was their mistake. It is probable that the Jack Head Bleed Vein River and this have in some way been confounded but in any case I regret the delay. I am not in the habit of overlooking accounts.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, 28th June, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI return herewith the copies (two) of a receipt from Mr. Thomas which you forwarded recently, for outlay in connection with the Black River School. Where is the original receipt given by Thomas? These are of no value.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev J.

They would do the labor themselves free of charge.\n\nThey also ask for lumber to make a door for the school house porch at a cost of $3.00.\n\nKindly advise me if their request is to be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 23, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in which you state that the Indians of the Black River Band have requested you to obtain authority from the Department to furnish them with sufficient lumber, building paper and nails to board up the outside of the Black River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the lumber, building paper and nails required and the cost of this material, including freight, should not exceed your estimate of $90.00. You may also purchase the lumber required to make a door for the schoolhouse porch at a cost not to exceed $5.00.\n\nBefore making the purchase of the above material you should obtain competitive prices and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified accounts in duplicate should be forwarded by you, together with the quotations received attached in order that payment may be made. It is understood that the Indians will perform the labour required for the above purpose free of charge.\n\nIn January last, the late Agent Colcleugh was authorized to arrange with the Indians of the band to have the logs that are decayed taken out of the building and new ones put in. He said that four of the logs were decayed. He estimated the cost of putting in these new logs to be $15.00 and he was informed that he might make the necessary arrangements to have this work done, the logs for the purpose to be cut and taken to the school during the winter and the repairs made as early in the spring as possible. This work should be done before the outside of the building is boarded.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk,\nMan.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6229, file 503-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 3rd., 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to return herewith voucher No. 244/20 amounting to $12.60 in favour of Mr. George Slater, Jr., for expenses incurred by him in building a porch for the Black River Day School. If Mr. Slater paid for the work done as stated in the voucher, he should furnish a receipt in support of this disbursement. If he performed the work himself the wording of the voucher should be altered accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.O.

I shall be pleased if you will ascertain from the teacher the size and approximate cost of a building that would be satisfactory to contain the winter's supply of fuel. If a wood-shed is built, it is not intended to provide an expensive building for this purpose. Please give this matter your early attention and inform the Department as to the cost and what arrangements can be made for the labour required. It may be that if the material is supplied the teacher would undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O.

I will visit this Reserve about the 5th of June next, will then take the matter up with the teacher and report accordingly.\n\nHoping that this will be satisfactory.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMay 14th, 1924\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter #125-2-5 dated May 10/24 regarding request of the school teacher at Black River Reserve, for a wood shed. While I was there, making Annuity payments on 5th June, I took this matter up with the teacher. This shed would be of great convenience in the winter. To hold the winters supply of wood, the dimensions would be 12 x 12\u20146 ft high, with shingled roof and 1 window, and would cost approximately $60.00.\n\nIf this request is granted, and the material supplied the teacher will do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of erecting a wood-shed for the use of the Black River Indian Day School and stating the dimensions of a building which you would consider satisfactory for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of having this work undertaken. You should purchase and have forwarded to the school the lumber and other material necessary to erect a building of the dimensions given by you, viz.: 12 ft. x 12 ft. x 8 ft. high with shingled roof and one window. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the material purchased from the firm quoting you the lowest price. It is understood that when the material is delivered the teacher will perform the work of erecting the building. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the materials and receipts for any freight charges should be attached. An Abstract of Tender form, showing the names of the firms asked by you to quote and the prices quoted, should accompany the vouchers.\n\nThis matter should receive your early attention in order that the building can be completed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O.

M.

He also states that a blackboard is required and that the floor is badly worn. He further states that if a new floor with paper between were laid it would add to the comfort of the building.\n\nIt is, no doubt, too late in the season to undertake any of the work mentioned, and I have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring. You should at that time furnish an estimate of the cost of painting this building, also the cost of any new flooring required. When this information is received, consideration will then be given to authorizing the work. At the same time you should inform the Department as to the length and width of any new blackboard required, and whether chalk trough and moulding are also required.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, informing the Department that Miss Patricia Fuller, teacher of the Bloodvein River R. C. Indian Day School, has notified you of her intention to resign at the end of June next. It is regretted that Miss Fuller is giving up duties, as her services have been satisfactory.\n\nRelative to the appointment of Mr. Jos. Inglett, who formerly taught this school and also the school on the Waterhen River Reserve, it is considered that it would not be necessary to have him return to Canada for the purpose of taking up work in an Indian school. It is thought that you will be able to nominate the services of a teacher having higher qualifications than those possessed by Mr. Inglett. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will, in due course, give this matter your attention. There are, no doubt, qualified teachers in Manitoba who would accept the position. Please forward the name and qualifications of the teacher whom you recommend for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nOblate Missionaries of Mary Immaculate,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may be possible to provide some funds for this building during the current fiscal year but I would appreciate receiving a more detailed report from you regarding what you consider should be done. You should, also, include a list of the materials required and their approximate cost.\n\nIn connection with the labour, you should state if the Indians will do the work without cost to the Department, provided the material is supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man. June 4th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 202-11A Gen. of the last instant relative to new school proposed for the Bloodvein Reserve.\n\nI consider that this work should be done by contract and in view of no logs being available since the fires last summer, I do not consider the sum of $1500.00 out of the way for a frame school.\n\nConsideration would have to be allowed for freighting this material both on the S.S. Kenora and again from Matheson Island by gas boat to the Reserve.\n\nAs there are no carpenters among the Bloodvein Indians, I would suggest that as many as possible be engaged by the contractor for to do the rough work.\n\nRegarding the Contractor, Mr. J. M. Turner, member for Springfield constituency has written a letter asking that Mr. Hugh McKay of Garacon, Manitoba be given consideration by being allowed to tender.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. McPherson, (signed)\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nEM/FL\nDear Sir,\n\nI received a visit from the Rev. Father Provincial and Brother Leach re the new school to be erected on the Bloodvein reserve.\n\nThe fire has destroyed all the good timber and logs will not be available. The school will need to be of frame construction and the Indians are not carpenters. Brother Leach figured he could have the building erected for $1500.00 and would like to undertake the work. He is convinced it will cost more if given to a contractor. I am sure Brother Leach would satisfy the Department if he were allowed to erect the building.\n\nMr. McPherson, the Agent, states as per the attached letter that the building should be by contract but beyond that has made no recommendation. I believe the material will cost, F.O.B. Bloodvein, at least $1,000.00 or $1200.00 and labor will run from $400.00 to $500.00.\n\nI would like this work started not later than July 10th and would appreciate knowing if the work is to be by contract or day labor, and what parties are to be consulted in connection with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

W.

He states that both are now badly in need of re-painting and if funds are available, I would recommend that the required material be purchased. There will be no expense to the Department in connection with labour to put the paint on.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Manitoba,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department has no record of having previously received Mr. Leach's requisition of March 31st.\n\nLocal purchase is approved for the following items:\n\n- 200 lbs. Beans\n- 100 lbs. Rice\n- 12 lbs. Tea\n- 100 lbs. Sugar\n- 3 Cases Milk\n- 50 lbs. Salt\n- 1 ea. Axe\n- 3 ea. Scrubbing Brushes\n- 4 ea. Brooms\n- 20 lbs. Soap\n- 2 doz. Spoons\n- 12 yds. Dishcloth\n- 12 lbs. Yarn\n- 1 doz. Sets Knitting Needles\n- 1 ea. Cooking Kettle (3 Gal.)\n- 2 ea. Rakes\n- 2 ea. Spades\n- 2 ea. Hoes\n\nI might say that it is noted that Brother Leach requests the same amount of mid-day meal supplies this year as last year. In view of the payment of Family Allowances it is reasonable to suppose that Indian children will be\n\n........over\nbetter fed and consequently their parents should be sufficiently interested in them to provide them with better lunches in coming to school.\n\nIt is not our intention to discontinue serving mid-day meals entirely but by next year we feel that we should limit our contribution to the special biscuit and hot drink.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| QUANTITY | TERMS 7 days net | REG.

With reference to your recommendation of Mr. John Sinclair, I beg to say that the Department cannot consent to his appointment, as he proved himself a failure when in charge of the school at Hollow Water River, and Archdeacon Phair was so advised.

Leclair recommended me for the appointment as teacher of the Brokenhead Indian Day School. In your reply to him dated the 5th Nov. 175821, you stated, that the Dept could not consent to my appointment as I had proved a failure at Hollow Water River. Now, Sir, I would like to know in what way I proved a failure, and who put in the report to that effect? I was at Hollow Water River 14 years & 3 months and not only taught the school but was the catechist in charge. I tried to do my duty in every way. I often had to cut my own wood at the school, and often hauled wood to the school for the Indians for nothing in order to keep the school going. I did my best to keep up the attendance, but this is very hard to do when the Indians move around so much in the summer. They have to do so, as it would be impossible for them to make a living on the reserve all the year round. Now Sir, if any man can do more than this, I should think he would have to be more than mere mortal. Hence, I would say in justice to myself who have been in the service of the Department so long, they should give me a chance to defend myself and not throw me over in my old age.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6229, file 505-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLICQUES CANADA\nA man who has taught for as long as I have (46 years) should deserve a little consideration. When I came up the Hollow Water River School, I was given to understand by the Indian Agent Mr. D.C. Lewis that I could give up that school, and take the Brokenhead School. This is the reason I did not rent in my resignation, as I thought it was merely a transfer from one school to another. When I arrived at Brokenhead Res., I was informed that Miss W.E. Seymour was in charge of the school there, and it was only when she left that Mr. Laclair recommended me for the position and received a satisfactory reply. Enclosing you will put the matter before the proper authorities for their consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Simclair\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo in reference to your appointment as teacher of the Brokenhead Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the reports in reference to your inefficiency as teacher of the Hollow Water River school were received from officers of the Department and, in view of these reports, it would not be justified in appointing you to the position at the Brokenhead School. In any event there is not now a vacancy at the latter school as Miss Isbister was placed in charge in November last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Sinclair, Esq.,\nBrokenhead Indian reserve,\nScantebury, Man.\nSir,\n\nOn my recent visit to the Brokenhead Indian Reserve, I had two applications for the position of teacher in the day school, one from John Sinclair, whose application I have been informed the department have dealt with. The other applicant was Miss. Bella Monkman, a young girl of 17 years of age. Her people live on a farm adjoining the reserve and one mile from the school. She has only had a public school education and attended school at Aliston, which adjoins the town of Selkirk, and is generally a pretty well conducted school. She writes a neat hand and understands the elements of arithmetic and from what I can judge well enough informed for the position as teacher.\n\nThis school has been without a teacher since the December quarter, and it appears to be impossible to get a teacher, as there is no place where they can board.\n\nI know nothing of Mr. Sinclair personally, but he has been a long while working for the department, and I presume they will know what value to place upon his services.\n\nIn one case the applicant is 72 years of age, with many years of experience, the other is 17 years of age and no experience, but seems to be willing to attempt the work and promises to do the best that she can.\n\nI might say that at a meeting of the council I was pressed to hire the appointment of Mr. Sinclair.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As it desirable that the school should be kept in operation the Department will accept the services of Miss Belle Monckman provisionally, her retention to be dependent upon the success with which she meets in the work. Her salary will be at the rate of $300.00 per annum and she will be paid from the time she opens the school.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Monckman of her appointment and impress upon her the necessity for taking an interest in her work not only in the school-room, but in the homes of the parents also. She should also devote sometime to self-improvement, with a view to better fitting herself for the work of teaching. With a view to assisting her in this I am sending you under separate cover a copy of Sinclair's \"First Year in School\", a close study of which will prove beneficial to Miss Monckman, as the suggestions contained in it for primary work are valuable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She has been sick and gave me her formal resignation during the month of January. As we all hoped she would be soon be able to be at work again, I did not like to do anything that would deprive her of work, unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nOn my last visit to the reserve, it seemed to be necessary that the school should be opened. For that reason I accepted the application of Miss Monksman. On the 4th inst., Miss Ishister reported herself ready for work, and I accepted the responsibility of directing her to return to work, which I presume she has already done.\n\nI would not have taken this action upon my own responsibility, had it not been for the difficulty in securing the services of a competent teacher.

To keep up attendance in Indian schools as well as other schools it requires more than a nominal interest in the work.

The agent and I both told the Indians that this was a very unsatisfactory condition. It was pointed out to them that the Department had fixed up the school building and had made every provision to teach their children and that the teacher was not afraid to come before them and us to complain that the children did not attend regularly. They admitted the facts and promised to do better. I think some of these trouble arises from the fact that the chief is a pagan and one who does not realize the advantages of education for the children.\n\nSgd. J.R.

At Brokenhead the teacher again complained of the lack of regular attendance of the children; this matter has been mentioned to the people of this reserve a number of times, they improve for a little time and then fall away; the Chief is a pagan who lacks education entirely so that he does not understand how to take proper interest. The teacher speaks to the Indians all the time about this, he is the lay-reader for the church on the reserve.

I have spoken to the Teacher of this School, Re the appointment of a Truant Officer for this Reserve.

I attended to them all but I wish to register a complaint about a poor old man who is the school teacher there. He is over eighty years of age and he is suffering from a form of cancer of the nose (Epithelioma) and he will persist in putting his hand to it and then handling books and other things at the same time. A good many will not send their children to school on account of it, but they do not like to put in a complaint, as he has been such a faithful old man and has been a good teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO. I. Grain.\nOttawa, March 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that Mr. John Sinclair, teacher of the Brokenhead Indian School, is suffering from a form of cancer of the nose (Epithelioma), which is a menace to the health of the pupils attending his school.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to inform Mr. Sinclair that the Department cannot retain his services as teacher of this school and you will be good enough to see that he ceases teaching at once. As Mr. Sinclair is an old man and has given faithful services for some years, the Department will grant him leave to the 30th of June, next, and he will be paid up to that time. He should forward a return for the number of days he teaches during the present quarter.\n\nYou will be good enough to communicate with the church authorities with a view to obtaining the services of a suitable teacher to succeed Mr. Sinclair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. R. Goldie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6229, file 505-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nOn Friday last I visited the Brokenhead Reserve owing to a report of sickness there. While there I saw Mr. John Sinclair, the school teacher. The old man is suffering from cancer of the nose and he is over eighty years of age. The people are complaining about his condition and some will not send their children to school on account of the habit he has of putting his hands to his cancer sore where there is a discharge, and then handle books and papers. I decidedly object, at a medical point of view, to him holding the position, where it might affect the health of the children. He has been a very faithful servant to the Government and to the Church of England, you may say all his life. He has not been able to save anything so I think some provision should be made for him for the short time that he will have to live. Perhaps you would be kind enough to interest yourself in getting him and his wife, who is old, placed in the Dynevor Hospital. It might be done, I would say, for 50\u00a2 a day for each. However I will leave the case in your hands to deal with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector Bunn,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6229, file 505-1, part 1)\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLAKE WINNIPEG INSPECTORATE\nWINNIPEG, MAN. 6th March 1917\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith I am enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to me, by Dr. O.I. Grain, Medical Inspector, and handed to me, this morning.\n\nWhen the Doctor returned, on Friday the 2nd inst., from Brokenhead Indian reserve, he mentioned the matter referred to in his letter, to me, and intimated that he would write to me, as to the facts, unfortunately the Doctor has been confined to his home, suffering from a bad ear, and he only returned to work this morning, when he immediately placed the promised communication in my hands.\n\nOn my part I have nothing to add to the remarks in the Doctor's letter, and there seems to be no relief, than to take immediate steps to remedy the matter by making a change. This will affect an old man, aged about 80, or very close to that mark, and his wife, also a woman well advanced in years, this poor old man is the victim of a malady, that will no doubt terminate his life shortly. Owing to his long and faithful service for the Indians, he is a non-treaty Indian, I beg to corroborate the suggestion made by the Doctor, there is no doubt that he is deserving, and he is certainly up against a blank and serious future. He has assisted Indians many times, and for that reason, he now merits some consideration.\n\nI have asked Archbishop Matheson for the name of a successor, and he hopes to nominate one in a few days, and submit it at once the name of his choice.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 505-1, part 1)\nThe trouble that affects this man, the teacher of the School at Brokenhead, is such that there is not much hope that it will improve, but rather the reverse, that it will grow steadily and quickly worse, and for this reason immediate action is necessary. I have brought these facts fully to the notice of Archbishop Matheson.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I have had complaints from Members of the Brokenhead Band about the School Teacher at the above mentioned Reserve. They claim that owing to the state of the Teacher's health they will not send the children to School. Dr. Grain has seen the Teacher and he reports that he is suffering from a form of cancer of the nose, and under the circumstances he does not think advisable to retain him as Teacher. Mr. Sinclair the Teacher is getting to be quite an old man and has been a very faithful servant of the Department, and when he loses this position, he will have no means of making a living. He is a non Treaty Indian and if he is at all possible, it would be a God send if the Department could have him placed in the Dynevor Hospital or allow him a pension of fifty cents per day, as it would be a great assistance to him and his old wife.

I have been there four weeks and was fed very poorly, and when I left, very little flesh remained on my body.\n\nI see by your note that the Department is going to pay .50\u00a2 daily for me; what good will that do me. It would be much better if they would let me have that little money and stay at my own home, rather than give it to the Hospital. I know that I would not be treated in a way that I would wish.

When you sent this letter to the Department, you should have made a report thereon.

I might also say that the Dynevor Hospital is a very well run institution and the patients are very well cared for. People don't generally go to Hospitals to fatten up.

This school is very often closed during school days and is the cause of poor attendance and progress.\nOttawa, March 28, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of your report for the month of March on the Brokenhead Indian Day School. It is noted that the clerical duties of the Rev. G. C. Smith, combined with his ill health, make it practically impossible for him to discharge his duties. You have mentioned that this school is very often closed during school days.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that such a condition leads, naturally, to bad attendance and lack of progress on the part of the pupils; and this Department is writing to Archbishop Matheson, with a view to having him impress upon the present teacher the advisability of better work or a change of duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 28, 1922.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of the report of Mr. H. O. Latulippe, Indian Agent of Selkirk, Man., on the Brokenhead Indian Day School for the month of March. Our representative writes that the teacher, Rev. Geo. C. Smith, is in poor state of health and is not able to properly discharge his duties as teacher and missionary. It is stated that the Brokenhead school has been closed on many school days. This, in itself, will result in poor attendance and lack of progress on the part of the Indian children.\n\nAt the time of my visit to this school, in September last, I found two factions among the Indian band. One group were heartily in favour of the present missionary teacher; the other clique complained that the Rev. Mr. Smith kept school open on an average of from two to three hours a day. I learned that the teacher's health was not good and I found many children in the village in necessity, who should have been at school. At that time I took no action on the complaint, because dissension in an Indian band often leads to statements that are far from accurate on the part of one group or another.\n\nI ask Your Grace's attention to these matters and respectfully request suggestions, with a view to bettering the educational facilities for the Indian children on the Brokenhead reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMost Rev. S. P.

As previously reported it is not regularly kept open. The teacher stated that he had requested the church authorities to relieve him as school teacher on account of his numerous clerical duties and health.\n\nH. O. Latulippe,\nAgent.\nOttawa, Feb. 21, 1923.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to a matter arising out of the report of Mr. H. O. Latulippe, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man., on the Brokenhead Indian Day School for the month of January, last. Our agent states that the teacher, Rev. Geo. C. Smith, is in poor health and is not able to properly discharge the duties of both teacher and missionary. The school is not kept open regularly and this, in itself, has resulted in the poor attendance and lack of progress on the part of the Indian children.\n\nWe understand that Rev. Mr. Smith has asked to be relieved of his duties as teacher, on account of his clerical duties and his ill health. It is hoped that it will be possible to arrange for the appointment of a qualified successor to do the teaching only, which would relieve Rev. Mr. Smith for missionary activity. We would be prepared to pay as high as $800 per annum for a properly qualified teacher who would devote all his time to classroom duties. I shall be pleased if you will nominate a teacher for this school and inform me of the name, qualifications and experience of the person whom you are able to secure. There are a sufficient number of children at this point to warrant keeping the school open each teaching day, and, in their interest, it is advisable that a teacher be engaged and the Rev. Mr. Smith relieved of his work in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen.

G. C. Smith to successfully fulfil his duties, it would be necessary to recommend some change to your Department.\n\nSuch recommendation would have been made by us at the beginning of the winter, but for the fact that the Manitoba Department of Education suggested the possibility of combining its responsibilities with ours, and entering into an arrangement with your Department for the establishment of a school suitable to the needs of all classes in and around Brokenhead.\n\nPending the completion of such proposed arrangements, we considered it advisable to recommend no change in the present Indian Day School on the Reserve, but we now agree that action is immediately necessary, and His Grace desires me to say that he will shortly recommend to you the appointment, either of another Missionary...\nDiocese of Rupert's Land\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\nMarch the 27th 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe:- Indian Day School at Brokenhead.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am instructed by His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, to nominate in his behalf, the Rev.

Our Inspector, Mr. Andrew Willows, is of the opinion that these two schools could be amalgamated with advantage to both communities and he thinks the proper site for a school to serve all parties concerned is on the Reserve near the present Post Office.\n\nWe understand that your Department is considering the erection of a new building as the present school building on the Reserve is unsatisfactory, and I am writing to suggest that such new building be so placed, if possible, that your Department and this Department might share equally in the operating expenses of the school and that it might serve both communities. The public school district has not yet erected its own building but has been carrying on in a private house. The two schools combined would furnish a sufficient number of children to make a first class school possible and the expense would be reduced considerably if we could co-operate along the lines suggested herein.\n\nI shall be glad if you will enquire into this matter and let me have your opinion on it. Thanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, June 26, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the suggestion which you make for the amalgamation of the Brokenhead Indian Day School and the neighbouring white school known as the School District of Stony Point. Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, is at present in the West and I will request him to call on you and discuss this matter. I may say that we are not erecting a new building at Brokenhead this year, as we were unable to provide funds for the purpose in our appropriation for Indian Education. I have noted that if these two schools were combined, a sufficient number of children would be available to make a first-class school possible and a consequent reduction in expense would be effected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 26, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from the Deputy Minister of Education, Winnipeg, regarding the amalgamation of the Brokenhead Indian Day School and the neighbouring white school known as the School District of Stony Point. Please call on Dr. Fletcher while in Winnipeg and discuss with him this proposed amalgamation of the two schools. I am informing him that you will interview him regarding the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nC/o Indian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI discussed the proposed amalgamation of the Brokenhead Indian Day School and the Stony Point white School with Dr. Fletcher, Public School Inspector Willows and the Venerable Archdeacon Thomas, now Bishop of Brandon. There are 25 children enrolled at present in the Indian school, but some are not Indian. The Stony Point school district have no school building, but a site on the reserve near Monkman's, one mile west of the station of Scantebury, would be suitable for the white children. I believe it would also be central for the Indians that attend.\n\nIt appears that this Department would have to bear all the capital expense but that the current expenses would be divided. Mr. Inspector Willows would supervise the activity of the school and would be responsible for the appointment of a teacher.\n\nI believe that the Department would be well advised to erect a building in the near future, as soon as funds can be provided, and correspond with the Department of Education in Winnipeg relative to the current expense and management of the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be impossible with such irregular attendance to have real success.\n\nAn attempt should be made to secure better attendance or the results cannot be very satisfactory.\n\nThe children of the first three Grades did not do very good work in Reading, Writing or number work. Grade 4 was decidedly better, of course, there were only eight children present out of twenty-seven so conditions for inspecting were not ideal. Mr. Conlin seemed to be handling the eight children I found present fairly well.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Brokenhead Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the irregular attendance of the Indian children. He states that it is impossible for the teacher to make much success in the work, and that an effort should be made to secure better attendance. On the date of the Inspector's visit there were only 8 children present out of a total of 27 on the roll.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you stating what steps you would recommend be taken to assure a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age. The teacher cannot be expected to perform good work when the conditions as regards attendance are as at present. On the occasion of your next visit to this Reserve, you should take this matter up with the Indian parents and use every endeavour to see that they take advantage of the opportunity offered and send their children regularly to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He desires facing another winter in it. Mr. Stephenson, the Indian Agent at Selkirk, I understand, is familiar with the situation and can give you information about it.

It is the Department's intention to arrange for a new school on another site, as soon as funds are provided by Parliament for the purpose. At that time, we wish to cooperate with the Provincial Department of Education in the conduct of a combined school. As the central point for all children who would attend is on the Indian reserve, the capital expense will have to be met by funds for Indian education - the current costs to be divided. I shall see that a special effort is made to secure the necessary appropriation for next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. S. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6229, file 505-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nThere has been several changes in the teachers of the Indian Day Schools in this Agency since the quarter ending 30th June, and although I have been advised by the Right Reverend Bishop of Keewatin of two of these appointments, and notified by Mr. Leach of his transfer from Little Grand Rapids to Berens River R.C. Day School and the transfer of Mr. Guimond from Berens River to Little Grand Rapids, I have not received any instructions or authority from the Department to place the names of the new teachers on the pay-list or at what salary they are to be paid.\n\nThe following is a list of the changes made:\n\n- Fort Alexander Prot. Day School, Mrs. Chas. Harbord, letter from Bishop of Keewatin, 20th Oct., 1927\n- Hollow Water prot. Day School, E.W. Gardner,\n- Berens River, F. Leach, transferred from Little Grand Rapids R.C.

In this connection I beg to say that you are being informed in a separate communication regarding the change of teachers at each of the schools mentioned.\n\nRelative to the salary allowed the teacher at the Brokenhead Indian Day School, I beg to say that Mr. Conlin, the teacher, is paid salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month. The bonus which was allowed teachers at the rate of $100 per annum, having been discontinued from March 31st, 1925, was added to the teachers' salaries. This accounts for the amount, viz. $95 per teaching month, which is now being paid Mr. Conlin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A.

I advised him to teach songs rather than notes.\n\nA better building and equipment would be an advantage.

J. A. Macgregor to the Broken Head Day School. When he returned from Moose Factory he complained of indifferent health, but the specialist in Brandon whom he consulted passed him as fit to resume work and stated that the doctor whom he saw on his way out took an exaggerated view of his condition, which was caused by the arduous journey to which he was subjected and the difficult portages on very wet roads which he undertook on foot. I do not, therefore, consider it any risk to try him at Somersetbury. Wherever I have employed him in Indian Missions in the past he gave the utmost satisfaction.\n\nYou mention that the salary is $85.00 per teaching month.

Though I made every endeavor to procure a teacher for the Broken Head School, I had not been successful until possibly today. I sent out the Rev. F. Longmore to take the services there on Sunday, with the request that he should look over the situation and let me know whether he would undertake the double duty of Missionary and teacher. He has just called to say that he is quite satisfied to take the position. Mr. Longmore, although he has not a professional certificate, has done a good deal of teaching both in Ireland before he came to Canada and also since he came out here. For the last three years he has had charge of the Residential Indian School at Wabosco, where he was Principal. I believe that he is quite competent to do all the teaching required and as it is most difficult, if not impossible, to procure a certified teacher I shall be very grateful if the Department will consent to his taking the position for a year, as it is most important that the post should be filled before the winter sets in. The Band have been pressing upon me for the return of the Rev. G. O. Smith, who you will remember did not satisfy your Department in regard to his teaching. I have therefore refused to entertain the request. Kindly wire me if consent is given to Mr. Longmore's appointment. With kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. D.

I consider it desirable that Your Grace keep in mind the advisability of securing a qualified incumbent for next September.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. C. A. Stevenson, Indian Agent at Selkirk, pointing out that since the erection of the new school at Brokenhead the roll of pupils has increased from twenty to thirty. In view of this, he states that more desks are required, as those moved from the old school are only sufficient to accommodate twenty-four pupils. He is asking, therefore, to be supplied with additional desks to accommodate the larger enrollment. On the other hand, however, he points out that several of the present pupils are non-Treaty and that they attend because there is no municipal school in the neighborhood. The question arises, should the Department accommodate other than Indian pupils? Personally I do not think we should, because, if so, it might easily happen that in many places the attendance we provide for would be largely exceeded and possibly our own Indian children would be forced out. I shall be glad to have an expression of opinion from the Department on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 19th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 202-11A of the 11th instant regarding the Brokenhead Indian Day School. With reference to accepting children that are not our wards at this school, I beg to say that the Department, upon receipt of your telegram of August 31st last, decided against a combined white and Indian activity at this point. You should inform Mr. Indian Agent Stevenson that this school was provided for our wards only and that the available accommodation is to be used for them and that the Department is not prepared to add equipment for the education of white children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 14, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nYou will recall that when a year ago the Rev. F. Longmore was appointed teacher of the school at Scantebury your Department made the condition that it should be only for one year. For two reasons I am writing to request that his tenure of office may be extended for another year. In the first place, as far as I have learned from the Inspector and from the parents of the children, he has done satisfactory work and is, what is important, quite popular with the Indians of the Reserve. In the second place, I am finding it increasingly more difficult to light upon suitable teachers for these Indian Day Schools and if Mr. Longmore gives up I shall be at my wits' end to find a successor for him. The man is a well educated man and has had considerable experience as a teacher. I shall be greatly relieved, therefore, if the Department will consent to have him remain for another year. I may add that I did not expect to have to make this request, as I had other intentions in regard to Mr. Longmore for next year, but on account of my probable absence at the Lambeth Conference in London until September I do not see how I can secure the time to look out for someone else. I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Longmore, teacher of the Brokenhead Indian Day School, be retained for another year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will be pleased to approve of Your Grace's request for the retention of Rev. Mr. Longmore's services for the next school year, beginning September 1st, 1930. The salary allowed him will be at the same rate as he is at present receiving.

This is reflected in the decreasing number of T.B. cases that I see and children getting more nourishment their resistance is improving.\n\nThe mid day meal at XXX schools has been a great help in building up the children. Also I have advised that the children coming to school be given Cod Liver Oil following the meal. When this is given by the Teacher we know they are getting something that is a big help to their physical condition. We know that if given the Cod Liver Oil to take home, it very often is not used. I saw only one case of Scrofula, amongst all the children. I saw on the trip. It was at Berens River.\n\nAt Bloodbein Reserve I saw three cases of T.B. but they were too weak to bring out for treatment. This Reserve seems to have more T.B. than others. Their health is well looked after by Brother Leach the Teacher here but their resistance is poor.\n\nW.H.G.

Original on 125-3-1\n\nThe stove is badly warped and sprung, permitting cracks to show at each end. A new stove should be provided because at present there is considerable danger of fire.\n\nMore classroom accommodation will be required. Perhaps next year the cloak rooms could be made a part of the class room and an entrance built on the front. This entrance could be on a full foundation and at the same time it could be extended under the present school building far enough to accommodate a furnace. This undertaking could perhaps be carried out for $1,000 or \u00a31,200, and I believe would provide ample class room accommodation.

It is desired to increase the floor area to provide more room both for the increasing number of Indian children and to accommodate a number of non-Indian children for whom the Province does not provide a convenient school.\n\nPhoto No. 2 shows the existing school and the ration house behind it. The school is oriented with windows facing the north. The number of windows is, in any case, too few.\n\nPhoto No. 3 shows the school and the fine new teacherage. This Photo confirms the opinion expressed by the teacher and the agent that the school is too close to the road, and that the windows face the wrong way. Traffic noise disturbs the proceedings in school.\n\nPhoto No. 4 shows the area at the left to which Mr. Supt. Olson desires to move the school. His plan as outlined to me orally, would involve:\n\n(a) moving the school onto new footings,\n(b) removing the partitions for the cloakrooms at the front of the school to add more desk space,\n(c) adding windows facing toward the south,\n(d) conversion of the existing addition to other purposes (e.g. cloakroom, lunch room).\n\nI would recommend that as the plan seems a reasonable and economical project, the Superintendent be requested to forward diagrams and details of his suggestions to this office.\n\nC.A.F.

Neary, Superintendent of Education\n\nFurther to your letter forwarded to Superintendent, Clandeboye Agency, under file No. 505-5 (E.1), I am attaching, hereto, a copy of Mr. Olson's recommendations regarding the modernization and moving of the Brokenhead Indian Day School.\n\nI concur in the suggestion that this school should be moved and repaired but I believe that it would be in the interests of the Department to have a representative of the Engineering Branch estimate on the cost of this work, as the cost submitted by Mr. Olson would appear to me to be a little on the high side.\n\nIt may be possible that we will be able to get away from digging a basement by insulating the floor and putting in a furnace in one end, having the cold air vents enter the rooms at the bottom and the hot air vents being placed somewhere near the ceiling.\n\nI believe that if the above suggestion be forwarded to the Engineering Branch that it would result in a definite saving for our Department. Kindly let me have your further comments.\n\nThere are non-Indians attending here.\n\nEnc.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nThis is in reply to Mr. Neary's letter - file 505-5 (E.1) -\nregarding modernization and moving of the Brokenhead Indian Day School. I write this through your office for your information and recommendation.\n\nMr. Neary's letter requested estimate for the following:\n\n(a) Moving the school onto new footings\n(b) Removing the partitions for the cloakrooms at the front of the school to add more desk space.\n(c) Adding windows and facing of windows toward the south.\n(d) Conversion of the existing addition to other purposes (e.g., cloakroom, lunch room).\n\nI took Mr. Neal McRea with me to check requirements and estimate costs and submit estimate as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Digging basement      | $225.00|\n| Gravel 70 yds.        | 210.00 |\n| Building crib         | 125.00 |\n| Running cement        | 175.00 |\n| Taking down crib      | 50.00  |\n| Levelling mud         | 60.00  |\n| Moving building       | 500.00 |\n| Flag pole             | 25.00  |\n| Work on building      | 350.00 |\n| Insulation            | 60.00  |\n| Flooring              | 75.00  |\n| Windows               | 40.00  |\n| Chimney               | 150.00 |\n| Furnace               | 250.00 |\n| Cement                | 190.00 |\n| 3 ply                 | 100.00 |\n\nTotal: $2585.00\nIn addition it is likely a beam under the building will be required at a cost of $25.00, floor joists at $35.00, lumber for building crib $270.00 and a paint job, inside and out, after work is completed at cost of $300.00.\n\nThe foregoing brings estimate cost to $3,215.00\n\nI would particularly draw to your attention that basement and furnace is included in above estimate. The school being small no proper arrangement of space is feasible without this improvement. The heating unit should be removed from classroom and if any small basement hole is dug, such as one quarter size to accommodate furnace, for relatively small additional cost full basement, giving manual training and noon-meal facilities is most desirable.\n\nI recommend this for your favorable consideration.\n\nB.

We agree with you that the price submitted by Superintendent Olson appears high.\n\nIn connection with your recommendation that a representative of the Lands & Development Services Branch estimate the cost of the work, I understand that they are extremely busy at the present time, and it is doubtful if they could give this matter early attention.\n\nWould it not be possible to obtain tenders from two or more persons who are prepared to do the work, and submit these prices to this office in order that we may obtain the Minister's approval if one of the tenders appears reasonable?\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of letter received from Mr. Olson, Superintendent, Clandeboye Agency, regarding the repairs to the Brokenhead Indian Day School. We have had considerable difficulty getting men to check over this work in order to secure competitive prices. Mr. McRea will re-model the school for $1,185.00.\n\nIt was our intention to put a basement in this school and move it to a different site. However, this would be so costly, I do not feel the move would warrant the expense; therefore, I have requested Mr. Olson to get a price on re-modelling the school - which includes taking out the present cloakroom and chimney, and putting it all into a classroom; relining and partitioning off the present warehouse, that is on the north side of the school, and making this the entrance and cloakrooms.\n\nI consider Mr. McRea's price fairly reasonable, and Mr. Olson will give him authority, if possible, to get this work done - in order that the school will be ready to open in September.\n\nR.

Carter Ind Agt.,\nHalfway, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to inform you that on account of our mission work on Bloodvein Reserve, I had to buy a house which is used both as a residence for the visiting priest and a chapel for the Catholic Indians. I feel that you are entitled to be informed of this and I take the occasion to further advise you that the Indians are anxious to have a real little church of their own and an effort has already been made to make foundation for same and we will proceed to build the church next spring if nothing comes in the way in the meantime.\n\nI am just back from my trip to Lake Winnipeg and I am surprised to not find on my desk your letter containing the list of Catholic children of school age at Berens River Reserve as promised at Mr Disbrow's office at Berens River.\n\nPlease send it to me as soon as possible as I am waiting here for it before I am able to forward to the Indian Department my petition for a Catholic School at Berens River and return to Berens River.\n\nyours truly,\n\n(Signed) S. Ferrault O.M.I.\nHowever, this is only my opinion and I will submit your petition to the Department for its consideration and decision.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nRevd Father S. Perrault O.M.I.,\n341 Selkirk Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Halfway P.O. Man.\n\nAugust 25th, 1917.\n\nI have your two letters having reference to school and mission work in the Bloodvein Reserve and also making mention of my apparent negligence in the matter of forwarding you my list of Roman Catholic children of school age in the Berens River Reserve. I also received your petition for a change in the school administration at Bloodvein.\n\nThe list of children at Berens River went forward by the last mail from this office, but I beg to direct your attention to the fact that we receive mail only once per week and despatch mail once per week from this office.\n\nI shall at once send your petition to the Department for consideration, but referring to your request that it be accompanied by my recommendation I would say that I cannot do this. You will readily see that if Your Church had been established in a reserve for some years and an Agent made a recommendation that a school under your auspices be transferred to the auspices of a Protestant Church, it would appear to you most unjust.\n\nMy office demands that I be fair to all Indians in my Agency, among whom there are many of different faiths; and to be quite frank I am of the opinion that all Indian schools should not be under the auspices of any Church. I most certainly think that the Churches should be encouraged and assisted to take the Gospel to our Indians, but education is one of the treaty stipulations of the treaties and should be given to the Indians whether Pagan or Christian.\n\nThe present policy of denominational schools to which you yourself object in the present Berens River School, seems to be only a cause of strife and a hindrance to proper education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAt the time I inspected the Brokenhead Reserve, the school was closed on account of Smallpox, and the teacher had left the reserve.\n\nThe classroom is practically a new building, only having been erected about two years ago. The teacher, I believe, was a single man, and lived in the old mission house about a mile from the school. I have mentioned in my general report that a teacher's residence is very much needed at this point, and that care should be taken to appoint a thoroughly competent teacher who would give the Agent some assistance with the work on the reserve. I also stated that if the teacher had a proper place to live in, the Agent could make arrangements with him for accommodation when visiting the reserve. As I have pointed out before, there is absolutely no accommodation on this\nRegina, Sask., July 2nd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a report by Inspector M. Christenson of his visits to schools in the Clandeboye Agency.\n\nBROKENHEAD DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe school at Brokenhead was closed on account of Small-pox. The Inspector however remarks on the need of a new residence there for the teacher. I have not been informed whether the Department proposes to incur this expenditure this year.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 202-11 of the 2nd instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his inspection of the schools in the Clansboye Agency.\n\nIn reply I have to say, with reference to the erection of a new school building at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School, that we will have no funds this year to carry out this work, but to provide a residence for the teacher at the Brokenhead Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nA new teacher has been recently appointed for this school, Mr. G. W. McKelvey, who holds a second class certificate. I believe Mr. McKelvey is a very good teacher, and the attendance has been very good since he took charge. I happened to be at the school during the noon hour, and therefore did not inspect the classroom work. The teacher informed me that there were 18 Indian and 17 non-Indian children attending.\n\nHowever,\n\nBROKENHEAD INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nHowever, the children here are a little backward on account of the fact that some of the teachers we have had here have been more of the Missionary type than teachers. Therefore, they have not obtained the results which could be expected. However, with a qualified teacher in charge, better results can now be expected.\n\nI wish to again remind the Department that a teacher's residence is badly required at this point. The present teacher is living in the old mission house about two miles from the school, but until we get a new residence here it will be hard to keep a suitable man as teacher at this school. I am aware that the Department have no funds at the present time, but am merely pointing this out so that it will not be lost sight of.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to point out that the schools inspected are doing as good work as can be expected.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The car for Norway House will be shipped as instructed, 450 bags for Norway House and 180 bags to Scantebury for the prefabricated school residence on the Brokenhead Reserve. I expect this car will be spotted August 4th and delivery will be made to Scantebury either by freight or truck.\n\nThe crib work for the basement of this residence is under construction now and the cement work should be completed from ten to twelve days. I have already notified North American Lumber Company and they will try to have the house ready for delivery.\n\nThere is a tremendous shortage of nails and I learned today that the Central Mortgage and Housing have a supply on hand. I consulted Mr. McClaskey and I feel confident he will release 2 kegs of 2\", 2\u00bd\" and 3\u00bd\". These will be required for the school residence at Gypsumville in connection with the crib work and for building purposes at Norway House. A voucher will be forwarded shortly and I hope my making the purchase will be approved.\n\nWe will get the school residence at Fairfield started as soon as help can be obtained to do the basement. If no one else is available we will try to persuade the carpenter now working on the Brokenhead residence to take on this work.\n\nFurther reports will be submitted from time to time on the progress made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Even though an increase were given Mr. LaFleche, it would be a small amount, and I agree with you that in his own best interests he should endeavour to secure more remunerative employment. The present seems an opportune time for him to act in this way. In making this statement I do not wish to imply that we are not satisfied with his services, because all reports indicate that he has done splendid work. However, as you know, there is a limit to salaries of teachers of Indian day schools beyond which we cannot go.\n\nWe will keep your recommendation in mind, and in the event of Mr. LaFleche deciding to stay in our employment for another year, arrangements will be made to grant him a small increase before October first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nWhitefish Bay, Ont.\nAug. 28th, 1941.\n\nMr. H.A. Hoey, Supt. of Indian Welfare,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO.P.A.W.A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I first joined the Dept. of Indian Affairs, 6 years ago, I had hoped that my experience as a teacher in the public schools of Man., as well as my University degree and my Normal School training would qualify me in time for a good position in the Department.\n\nThese six years have furnished me ample opportunities to familiarize myself with all problems pertaining to Indian welfare and education. I have always liked the work and still do.\n\nBut, there being no chance for me for advancement, (at least for the time being), I sincerely believe that to prolong my staying here would bring more harm than good both to myself and to my family.\n\nMany a time I have declined offers to teach in the High Schools of Manitoba. To-day, in spite of my deep interest in Indian affairs (an interest which will never die out altogether), I am forced to send in my resignation as Teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI shall be leaving Monday, September 1st, for Deloraine, Man., to become Assistant-Principal in the High School.\n\nBefore closing, may I recommend Mr. Leon Trottier, now with me, as my successor. This gentleman whom I have known for several years (he was my pupil at one time), has just completed his second year of Arts at the University of Manitoba. Last June he stayed with me for some time and I had him teach school a little. I know the boy has the real stuff to become a successful teacher. He is very good at manual work and is trustworthy in every way.\n\nI want to thank you for everything your Department has done both for me and for my good friends at Whitefish.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files.\n(HG 10, Volume 6179, File 445-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhitefish Bay, Ont.\nAugust 28th, 1941.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to apply for the position of teacher at the Whitefish Bay Indian day school.\n\nI have successfully completed my second year of Arts at the University of Manitoba. I have done a little teaching here in the last days of June, and I like the work very much. Moreover, I have stayed with the school-teacher a few weeks and he has acquainted me with the work that is to be done.\n\nI will be twenty years old next month and I talk both French and English fluently. Having\nworked during all my vacations as laborer and carpenter, I am very well acquainted with manual work.\n\nI am a Catholic and I have the recommendation of His Excellency Mgr Cabana, also that of Father Boucher and Mr. La Folche, the retiring school teacher.\n\nTrusting you will consider advantageously my application,\n\nI remain yours truly,\nKion Trotter,\nWhitfish Bay,\nAltares.\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nMr. Armand Lafl\u00e8che has just informed me that he wishes to resign as teacher at Whitefish Bay, Ont. He has accepted the position of Assistant Principal in one of our Manitoba High Schools.\n\nI beg to recommend Mr. L\u00e9on Trottier to succeed Mr. Lafl\u00e8che. Mr. Trottier has no Normal School training but he has completed his second year of Arts at the University of Manitoba. He is fairly conversant with the school and district of Whitefish Bay because he spent his holidays there last year. He has the recommendation of the Archbishop of St. Boniface and also that of the Director of the Juniorate College, St. Boniface, Man.\n\nFrom information that I have been able to gather concerning this young man, I think he is well qualified to fill the position. You know that it is quite difficult at the present time to secure male teachers, so I would ask that you approve of his nomination immediately so as to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files.  \n(RG 10, Volume 6179, File 445-1, part 1)\nKenora, Ontario.\nAugust 28th 1941.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been notified by Mr Armund LaFleche, teacher at Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, that he is leaving on Sunday the 31st instant to take a position as Assistant Principal of the High School at Deloraine, Manitoba.\n\nHis wife is a teacher and will carry on at the school until a new man is appointed providing this is not delayed too long.\n\nMr LaFleche has recommended his brother-in-law, Leon Trottier. I have met him and believe he would be suitable.\n\nNo doubt you will wish to get in touch with the Roman Catholic Church authorities at St. Boniface.

W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. L\u00e9on Trottier has been recommended for the position of Postmaster at Whitefish Bay, Ont. He is of military age according to his own statement.\n\nMr. Trottier mentions also that he has been appointed by Ottawa as teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School and is thereby entitled to the residence adjoining the school.\n\nWould you be good enough to advise this Department if the position of school teacher at Indian Day School is a regular public service position and whether Mr. Trottier has been appointed by your Department? If Mr. Trottier was appointed by your Department would you have any objection to his appointment as Postmaster at Whitefish Bay? The work to be performed in the Post Office is apparently not very heavy as the revenue for the last fiscal year amounts only to $122.86.\n\nNo applications were received for this position and Mr. Trottier is the only person recommended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Superintendent\nof Post Office Service.\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 26th ultimo, addressed to Dr. McGill, has been brought to my attention.\n\nMr. Leon Trottier has been appointed teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. From the information given in your letter it appears that the duties of the Postmaster are not very onerous and I presume would not interfere with his duties as teacher. Consequently we have no objection to his appointment as Postmaster at Whitefish Bay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.J.

If your statement is correct, there is a shortage of $12.00. If not, kindly correct it as I would like to file my claim of refund of National Defence Tax.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL\u00e9on J.

The difference of $12.00 which you mention in your letter is made up of a further 5% deduction of your monthly salary of $60.00 and is an account of Retirement Fund. This amount is placed to your credit in the Retirement Fund Account and will be returned to you together with interest at such time as you leave the Service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

You may experience difficulty in securing a male teacher for this school. I note from the records that Mr. W. Pinsonneault was nominated for the position last fall and it is just possible that his services might still be available.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nExtract from Inspector Greening's report on the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School visited on February 19, 1943.\n\nThe scarcity of teachers is making it increasingly difficult to secure completely satisfactory teachers for these little schools so far from the bright lights of the cities.\n\nMr. Allard is the second extremely youthful young man who has been sent to this school in as many years, quite devoid of professional training or experience.\n\nHe is, quite noticeably, in deadly earnest and doing his very best. Perhaps I am a little too sympathetic towards young people who are obviously doing their utmost to fill positions, in these days of stress, for which they are not any too well prepared; and so I told Mr. Allard that I thought that he was doing as well as could be expected and that, if it depended on my report, there would be no reason why he could not return to Whitefish Bay next year if he wished. Having recorded this, my conscience is now clear upon the matter.\n\nFor the sake of the pupils, however, it is to be hoped that this frequent changing of teachers is not to become a too regular habit. Mr. Trottier, the last teacher, had not reached the age of 21, and so has since been called up for military service. Mr. Allard seems to be in very much the same boat.\n\nA suggestion is made that the employment of young men within military call-up age groups cannot make for a great deal of continuity in planning or teaching.\n\nMr. Lafleche who had this school until June, 1941, was, admittedly, an unusually capable teacher, and one whom any successor would find it hard to succeed; but one has not to be very long at Whitefish Bay to notice the change that the passage of two years of unqualified teachers has made.\nOttawa, May 3, 1943.\n\nC. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant re-resignation of John Allard it is felt that no advantage can be derived by the appointment of a teacher for the balance of this term. The school will remain closed until the end of June. Steps will be taken to appoint a teacher to take over by September 1st.\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., enclosed with copies of the different courses, similar to the ones sent by your department to the residential schools, and also with the chart of badges for proficiency in these courses. I wish to thank you very sincerely, and may I state my appreciation for the work done by your department under your wise guidance and your vast experience. I am sure you endeavour to find means which will best help our Indians in the schools, but especially away from the schools.\n\nYou may rest assured that all the principals of the Indian Schools under my jurisdiction are eager to cooperate with the department in fostering the welfare of those amongst whom they labour.\n\nI take this opportunity to mention to you the fact that a teacher in one of our day schools has received his military call, and has left the school vacant at Whitefish Bay, in Ontario. I submit to your approval Mr. Aristide Gauthier of 6293 St. Denis, Montreal. This gentleman has already taught school at Island Lake, Manitoba, and would be willing to take up the school at Whitefish Bay. He would be ready to start at any time, upon receiving your decision, which you may forward to the above given address.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. R.A.

Roberts, Acting Indian Agent at Kenora, advised this office that Mr. Allard, who received a call for military service, had been medically examined and rejected. Under the circumstances the Agent instructed him to return to Whitefish Bay and resume his duties as teacher for the balance of the current term.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\nJune 17, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Mr. Peter Fenez, Teacher\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nA letter from the above noted has been received, and a copy is attached for your information. I would respectfully submit the following comments relating to Mr. Fenez's letter.\n\nFor some time past, the teacher has intimated to me that he could get a higher salary at other Agency Day Schools; particularly in the Port Arthur Agency; and the matter was discussed by him with Mr. Greenway, the Catholic School Inspector.\n\nThis in itself seems very irregular to me. First, in that there seem to be different salaries offered to teachers in the different agencies, and a higher salary in some instances to teachers having very much smaller attendance than at the Whitefish Bay School.\n\nSecondly, I do not favour, as an Agent having a School Inspector discussing the matter of wages or inducing a settled teacher such as Mr. Fenez, to make a change. Mr. Fenez has done a very good job at Whitefish Bay and I feel confident in verifying the statements in his letter. Our associations have been cordial and we have worked together in a cooperative sense to the benefit of the pupils at the school.\n\nMr. Fenez took unto himself a wife last September, and no doubt feels that it is up to him to better himself, and I in no way would desire to step in his way. However, if an increase in salary is in order under your present regulations, and money available, I would recommend this request be given your favourable consideration.\n\nNone is irreplaceable, but after giving some considerable time to the welfare and betterment of the Whitefish Bay pupils, I feel that changing and replacing teachers of Mr. Fenez's calibre, is not conducive to the advancement of our Indian children; regardless whether there may be teachers having special certificates, or not, as teachers with first hand knowledge of Indians are not easy to find.\n\nPlease do not consider the foregoing critical to Department methods. I only wish to place before you, in a small measure, my ideas in regard to the welfare and betterment of our Indian Day School pupils and give some encouragement to the Day School teachers as a group.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files.\n(HG 10, Volume 6179, File 445-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nJune 29, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\n- MR.

He expressed the opinion that the Indians are discontented with the services of the present teacher. The serious shortage of teachers was pointed out to Mr. Roy and the possibility that it would be very difficult to obtain a replacement for Mr. Fenez.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if you would discuss this complaint with Mr. Roy and also with the Roman Catholic missionary on this reserve.

You have claimed classification as a Grade 2 teacher with a salary of $1,650. If you read the regulations carefully, you will note that only certificated teachers can be classified as Grade 2 teachers. You will fall into the Grade 3 category as you hold only a teaching permit and not a certificate. Your teacher training apparently consists only of a two weeks' course in Winnipeg. Therefore, this will mean that your salary will be unchanged from its present rate of $1,120 until you have increased your qualifications. We would recommend that you see your local Provincial Inspector of Schools with a view to doing this as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I, too, hope Mr. Douglas drops in to see me during the Easter holidays and that we have an opportunity of discussing our future plans (which I hope will be mutual).\n\nI was pleased to find out that Mr. Fenez intends to go to normal school and note that he will require at least five Grade Thirteen papers before he can do so. The information which you gave him was entirely correct and we would be quite willing to grant him a year's leave of absence without pay to attend Normal when he is ready. We certainly would try to give Mrs. Fenez a small school so that she could help by earning money while he is at Normal School. At the present time Mr. Fenez is a temporary civil servant and cannot apply for permanency until he gets a proper teaching certificate. Therefore, teaching at Kenora would not greatly affect his civil service standing because he is not yet permanent. As you suggest, I am writing to him directly and so far as he knows, am indicating that you have advised only as marked by pencil in your paragraph. I attach a copy of my letter to him for your information. I will write to him again when I hear further as to his plans. In the meantime please accept my sincere thanks for the interest which you have shown in our work in the past and are continuing to show at present.

She is not an outstanding teacher but is steady and good with the primary grades.\n\nWhen we hired three male teachers at Caughnawaga this year to replace the women lay teachers formerly there, she was not willing to accept a transfer to a school too far from her home because of the fact her mother was ill.\n\nNow I understand she is prepared to accept a school in Ontario and I have given her your address.

The Fort Frances Highway runs about 1 mile South of Sansons Landing, which is situated on a Bay lying south of the Reserve and is roughly 1 mile by Lake from the Day School. In the summer months, access to Reserve is made by outboards or canoes. During the freeze up walking from the highway or transportation by pony is the only means of travel. A daily bus service from Kenora serves the District.\n\nThere is a population of 180 on this Reserve composed of 56 men, 40 women and 87 boys and 53 girls under the age of 21. An average of 50 pupils are in attendance at this school. They are predominantly of the Catholic Faith with some few Protestants and pagans.\n\nThere is no R.C. Church on the Reserve. The Rev. Father Antonio Lascelle, O.M.I., is the missionary for this district and holds services in the school house periodically. There is a small R.C. Mission situated on the Fort Frances Highway near Sioux Narrows; this being about 10 miles from the Reserve.\n\nThe Band members on this Reserve make their living by Commercial Fishing, guiding and trapping. At Sioux Narrows there is a Post Office, Day School and 3 or 4 stores. This is a busy community during the summer months serving and catering to the tourist trade.\n\nThe present teacher, Mr. Peter Fonesz is married and have a little girl 2 years old. They are of French Canadian stock from Manitoba. Mr. and Mrs. Fonesz are a very nice couple and have taken a great interest in the welfare of this Band and have made many friends in and around Sioux Narrows.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has a full basement. No running water or electric lights. Outside toilets for pupils and an inside toilet in the teacherage. It is situated about 300 yards from the lake and in the centre of the Reserve.\n\nThe Indians in this Agency are of the Ojibway tribe and with the exception of some aged Band members all speak fairly good English.\n\nFor your further information I am enclosing a map of the area.\n\nI trust this information will be helpful to you in gaining a full picture of the location etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nHD/S\n\ncc. to B.F.

I have been thinking about the Whitefish Bay School, and it seems that the more I think about it the farther away it gets.\n\nIs it not in any way possible to place me in a non-Catholic school closer to home until there is a vacancy in a Catholic one? I don't necessarily mean Laughnawaga, but anywhere close by.\n\nIf all the reports made against me at Chetlain School have anything to do with all this stalling around, please would you give me a chance to tell my side of the story. I'm not trying to deny nor apologize for anything because my conscience is clear as far as that is concerned.\n\nI was told of illness at the Chenail school. If it is serious enough to require a new teacher, do you suppose maybe Miss Beck and myself could be shifted around?\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files.\n(RG 10, Volume 6179, File 445-1, part 1)\nMaybe not yet, but I have great hopes for vacancy somewhere close by before Christmas.

I have received a letter from a teacher indicating that she is not prepared to go to a new two-room school which we are building near Kenora. This teacher's mother has been ill and she does not wish to go too far from her home in Hogansburg.\n\nThe school is Whitefish Bay Day School and it is situated on the Whitefish Bay Indian Reserve approximately fifty miles south-east of Kenora. I can best describe the school by quoting from a recent letter from Mr. Norman Paterson, our Indian Superintendent, to the teacher formerly interested in this position.\n\n\"It is accessible by Highway, Lake and Air. The Fort Frances Highway runs about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile South of Sammons Landing, which is situated on a Bay lying south of the Reserve, and is roughly 1 mile by Lake from the Day School.

Mr. Greening inspects this school and no doubt will be able to\nhelp you in working towards a First Class Certificate. If you wish any details not covered in this letter, please do not hesitate to write to our Indian Superintendent, Mr. Paterson at Kenora.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: School teacher for Whitefish Bay, Kenora Agency.\n\nPlease find enclosed one Copy of letter received by Fr. Scheffer from M. Leo LISOWSKI seeking information regarding opening for teacher in an Indian School. As I am asked by Mr. Peter Fenez of Whitefish Bay, to answer your call for a teacher there, and as this gentleman might better fit in Whitefish Bay, I am glad to forward his request for information to you, at Father Provincial demands.\n\nIn order not to further delay the answer to him may I suggest that you answer him direct at Roma, Sask.\n\nIt is my opinion that a married couple, boarding outside of Mr. Fenez living quarters, would better suite all concerned. As I understand that Mr. Fenez might not be staying there after the end of the year Term, Mr. Livinsky would then have enough experience in September to take over.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to offer you the Season's Greetings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFather Antonio Lacelle O.M.I.\nBox 40 Kenora Ontario\nRAMA, Sask.\n\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate,\nProvincial Administration\n340 Provencher Avenue\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nDear Rev.

Unfortunately, this has already been filled with a teacher who has a First Class Certificate and 15 years of experience.\n\nHowever, there is a vacancy in Saskatchewan which might interest you. This is at a new school being erected on the Foundaker Indian Reserve in the Battleford Indian Agency.\n\nI attach one of our standard application forms which I would like to have you complete and return to me so that we can review your qualifications and determine the salary which we can offer you. For further details on the Foundaker School would you please write to Mr. J.P.B.

LaSalle, O.M.I.,\nBox 40, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWHITEFISH BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nDear Father LaSalle:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 19. I have already been in correspondence with three teachers concerning the Whitefish Bay Day School. Mr. Lisowski wrote in concerning the Fort Alexander Day School. We have already accepted another teacher for this position, with a First Class Certificate and 15 years of experience. I believe we can place Mr. Lisowski in a day school in Saskatchewan, his home province. The teacherage provides living accommodation for two single teachers and if one of the teachers is married, then alterations can be made in the basement to permit bedrooms being provided there. We do not wish to rent extra accommodation as this renting of teachers' quarters costs the Department a great deal of money and we are discouraging it everywhere.\n\nI note that Mr. Fones might not be staying there after the end of the year term. I am also advised that the contractor will probably not finish this project until March 15, 1950. I believe that we can obtain the services of a single male teacher at that time and possibly replace Mr. Fones with a married couple for September, 1950.\n\nIn conclusion, may I extend to you the Season's Greetings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Leffler is now back taking the school. As he has a sister to help him in the work, I trust that if he is successful in getting a similarly favourable report from the Agent or Inspector, you will see your way to making his salary $400.

Leffler, the Teacher, I find that he is doing his work in a conscientious manner and the children show a slight improvement, but the trouble seems to be in the irregularity of the attendance.\n\nI might point out that Mr. Leffler seems to have too much Mission work to be able to devote all his time to the School.

Mr. Leffler does not understand teaching and no progress has been made in three years. He does not like the work and has had no experience. He is a well educated man and if he could be sent to Winnipeg, say for three months to the Normal school I have no doubt he would be taught how to teach the young people of the reserve.

Mr. Leffler, teacher of the Chisasibi Bay School, shows that no progress is being made owing to the inexperience of Mr. Leffler and a lack of interest in his work. It would appear that the work in connection with the mission is sufficient to fully engage Mr. Leffler's time.\n\nI shall be glad to have you consider the question of appointing a teacher to this school who will give all his time to the work, as the number of children available to attend the school warrant such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen.

Mr. Leppler will resign charge of the school at the close of June 30, and I would recommend Rev. S.C. Beaton as his successor. I think that the lack of progress in Mr. Leppler's work is due not to the mission work encroaching his time, but to lack of interest in the work, and I would ask you to give Mr. Beaton a trial. In fact, it is impossible to obtain the services of a teacher worth having for $300 per annum, and the church cannot afford to pay the full stipend of a missionary and at the same time supplement the salary of a school teacher, in a small mission like Cedar Lake.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

He is entitled to receive for his services 56/200ths of the yearly salary of $300, or a total of $84.00.

Mr. Deacon who was appointed Teacher of the Indian Day School at Cedar Lake has applied for four months leave of absence commencing Dec. 12th. Rev. R. McLennan has been appointed to take charge of the Mission work but he is not able to take charge of the school, his eyesight not being equal to the work. He intends, if there is no teacher appointed, to give a certain amount of attempt to viva voce instruction, but not to do anything that could entitle him to the Government grant. The Church supplemented Mr. Deacon's salary but it cannot undertake to supplement a teacher's salary in addition to paying Mr. McLennan's salary, and, unless the L.S.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nIn any case supplemented, the services of a qualified teacher cannot be obtained.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would respectfully suggest that it might be advisable to allow the school to remain in abeyance, so far as the Department is concerned, until Mr. Deacon's return.

Mr. Deacon, who was appointed teacher of the Chumawin Day School, is being granted four months' leave of absence.\n\nThe Department was not aware of this fact when the balance of the salary earned by him during the September and December quarters was forwarded. Archdeacon MacKay suggests that it might be well not to make any appointment of a teacher in the meantime. He states that the Rev. R. McLennan, who has been appointed to take charge of the mission, while he is not willing to undertake the school work, will see that the children are given a certain amount of oral instruction and the Department thinks that it would be as well to adopt Mr. MacKay's suggestion.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. James Taylor,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report in connection with Chemawawin Day School, results under the present teacher are anything but satisfactory. The man in charge is a minister, and will only teach when his clerical duties allow him, that is, he will not allow the school to interfere with his duties as a clergyman. Consequently the school suffers. Discipline is slack, and the children cannot even read. In fact we see no results for money expended year after year for teacher's salary. Therefore I strongly recommend that the school be closed until the church can put a man there who will attend to the school. Under present conditions the Department is simply helping to pay a clergyman's stipend for church work. The teacher was away six months last winter and he again closed the school for summer holidays. I trust therefore that I will get instructions to close this school by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 3, 1923.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a very unfavourable report on the work of the teacher at the Cheresawin Day School.\n\nIt would appear from the information the Department has received that the trouble is that Rev. Mr. Deacon cannot attend to the school work as his time is fully taken up with his duties as missionary. Mr. Deacon was away for six months last winter and resumed his duties on June 1st, but closed the school again on June 30th, the usual time, notwithstanding the long vacation. It is said that the children cannot even read and it would appear that the school might as well be closed as conducted as at present.\n\nI should be glad to have Your Lordship's opinion as to the appointment of a teacher whose time would be given wholly to the work or on the advisability of closing the school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

Scott, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou will remember that Cedar Lake school has been closed for some time now, ever since I removed the Rev. S. Deacon from the mastership, because he was unable to do the duties satisfactorily to your department. Hitherto I have not been able to find a teacher for it, and I greatly regret the loss of teaching for the Indian children there. It is impossible to get a satisfactory teacher for the old stipend of $400. I desire to recommend for that school Mr. R. G. V. Cooper, who is ready to accept the position at a salary of $600, or at least $500. I would suggest you offer him $500 with a hope that it may be increased to $600, if he brings the school into good state and standing. Mr. Cooper has been teaching Indian schools for over three years. I expect you can find his report and history in your files. He came out from England May 1909 to go to Athabasca. He taught the Indian school there at Wabasea for one year. The school was one of our mission schools, and he gave satisfaction. Then for two and a half years he taught in the Gordon Indian Boarding School at Punnichy, Sask. He worked there under three different Principals, I believe with good report, and then left for personal reasons. He would like to continue in the Indian work permanently. He has been offered a public school in Manitoba on a permit, but would prefer the Indian work if he can obtain a living wage. He is forty-five years old and unmarried, and bears a good character.\n\nI shall be glad to know as soon as possible whether you will offer him Cedar Lake, and at what salary.

The remedy for this state of things lies with the Government through the Department by either imposing and enforcing compulsory attendance at school or by providing some means so that the children could be left behind, fed, cared for and attend school while their parents were hunting.\n\nThe progress in the school room is slow on account of the reasons given above. I would suggest that the reserve policeman be paid a small salary by the Department to act as truant officer.\n\nSgd. Richard G.V. Cooper,\nTeacher.\nOn my arrival at Chemawawin Reserve I found that the School had been closed for about three weeks. Several days for want of wood, the rest of the time the teacher being sick.\n\nThe Doctor examined this man and reports him in bad shape internally and advised him to go into civilization for treatment at once. His ailment is caused principally from want of fresh air and exercise, and from appearance and all accounts the man is absolutely lazy. His own house and the school are a poor example for the Indians in cleanliness. There is a general complaint that this school is very irregular, and I would recommend that Mr. Cooper be asked for his resignation to take effect at the end of the present quarter, and Mrs Morris, the Missionary's wife, be appointed. She takes a personal interest in the Indians, has about thirty children attending her Sunday School, and her influence can be seen in every house on that Reserve. I have no doubt with her standing among the Indians, the attendance at this school could be doubled and some improvement shown. According to the Indians Mr. Cooper never investigated absences or took any personal interest in the children outside of the school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient servant.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, February 16, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that on your arrival at the Chemawaswin Reserve you found that the school had been closed for about three weeks on account of lack of wood and the illness of the teacher and recommending that Mr. Cooper, the teacher be asked for his resignation to take effect at the end of the present quarter and Mrs. Morris, the Missionary's wife, be appointed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as recommended, you should ask Mr. Cooper to send in his resignation to take effect on the 31st of March, next, and you may appoint Mrs. Morris to take charge of School temporarily after that date.

Taylor, the Indian Agent at The Pas, vacated his position to join the Army, and early this year a new man (Mr. S.G. Macdonald) was appointed Agent. He signs himself as \"Acting Indian Agent\".\n\nAt the end of January last he visited this Reserve for the first time as Agent accompanied by a Doctor, Dr. Bailey of The Pas.\n\nUnfortunately I was laid up at that time suffering from a severe attack of influenza which kept me away from school for 10 days. I was convalescent but not well enough to attend to my school duties when Mr. Macdonald arrived.\n\nI told him and the Doctor that I had no accommodation at my house (which possesses only one small room) to give them hospitality for the night and I referred them to the Mission house where the Rev. L. Morris and his wife are in occupation and also where the late Agent Mr. Taylor has often stayed.\n\nWhether Mr. Macdonald took offence...\nor not I do not know, but last Saturday\nthe 17th inst. I received a most unexpected\nand extraordinary letter from him, a\ncopy of which I enclose.\n\nIn that letter, as you will observe, he\nmakes 3 charges against me which are\nabsolutely groundless and unfair, the second\none being quite devoid of any truth, and\nthen he demands that I send in my\nresignation and hand the School over to\nMr. Morris who is the wife of the Rev.\nC. Morris the local resident Minister\nhere!\n\nMr. Macdonald states\u2014\u201cIn view of\n1 complaints by the Indians and the\n2 very poor showing of the Chemawin\nSchool and 3 partly on account of the\nDoctor\u2019s report of your physical condition\u201d\n\nI would ask you to kindly allow me\nto briefly point out the unfairness of\nMr. Macdonald\u2019s charges against me.\n\nIn a few days I will have completed\na period of 3 years work at this school,\nand during all this time I have never\nheard of any complaints from the people\nhere regarding my work but have received\na good deal of praise for the same.\n\nMr. Macdonald\u2019s unfairness in his first\ncharge of \u201cComplaints by the Indians\u201d is\nevident when I state that he has never\nwritten to me stating the nature of these\ncomplaints nor asked me whether they were\ntrue or not. He confronts me without hearing\nmy defense and uses this charge as a just\nreason for demanding my resignation!\nEveryone who has worked for any length of time among the Indians knows that they are always making \"Complaints\" and for an Indian Agent to give such \"Complaints\" as a reason for the condemnation of the work of a Teacher, indicates that that Agent must be very hard up for valid reasons for a justifiable condemnation.\n\nThe second charge of \"the very poor showing of the Chemawowin School\" is absolutely untrue. The late Indian Agent (Mr Taylor) has generally expressed himself as quite satisfied with the Educational progress of this school and he has from time to time made a report in the Register to that effect. He has never expressed dissatisfaction in any way. But the ridiculousness of Mr Macdonald's charge on this point is that he has not visited the school at all, as I was ill at home at the time of his first and only visit to this Reserve! He charges me with the \"poor showing\" of this School when he has never entered the School door!\n\nI doubt very much if he had been present at the school during an examination of the children that his report would have been of much value for he is very deaf.\n\nWhen Inspector Jackson, Indian School Inspector last visited this Reserve in July, 1916 he reported that the Classes in my school here were a good deal in advance of the same Classes in most other Indian schools.\n\nAnd lastly\u2014his charge of the \"Doctor's report of my physical condition\". I had an interview with the Doctor for about 10 minutes.\nonly. I told him that I was just recovering from a severe attack of Influenza and that I had also had some tapeworms during the last 6 months but otherwise was all right.\n\nHe told me that he thought that town life would suit me better than the country and then he gave me a prescription for some medicine. That was all. I am now quite well and do all my own chores and can hold my own with most men of my age (48).\n\nI took over this school from a young minister who had sadly neglected it for over 2 years. Not a child in the school could read more than a few of the simplest words and none could add up more than a single column of figures.\n\nI have now 3 children doing the Compound rules with problems in Arithmetic (one a girl who has just turned 11 years) and 6 are using the Second Reader and reading very well. Hygiene is carefully taught, morals, Religious instruction, Geography, Grammar, Singing, Calisthenics &c.\n\nI purchased a large set of dumb bells for the children to drill with and I have made 10 different articles of furniture for the school.\n\nLast July on Treaty-payment day Inspector Jackson and the late Indian Agent (Mr Taylor) nominated me for the position of Police Magistrate for this Reserve. I was duly appointed in October last and have just dealt with my first two cases\u2014one of drunkenness and the other of wife-assault. Last October...\nyour Department kindly purchased a Teacher's house here well fitted up with good equipment for storing the Reserve drugs.\n\nIf I am forced to resign this house must be closed, as Mrs. Morris (the Minister's wife who was offered the position of Teacher by Mr. Macdonald) lives at the mission house with her husband; the distribution of the Rations must be left to the tender mercies of the Indians as a woman-teacher cannot do this work, and my Magisterial work and Office must come to an end as there is no one else here willing or capable of filling that position.\n\nIn stating the above facts of this matter so fully to your Department I have not done so through being over anxious to retain my position here as Teacher and Police Magistrate, but I am naturally desirous of frustrating, if possible, any attempt to force me to resign through bare-faced misrepresentation and perversion of the truth.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say that I leave with confidence this matter entirely in the hands of your Department and if the letter which I have received from the Agent has been authorized by your Department, then I ask you to kindly reconsider this matter in the light of the facts which I have enumerated above and upon receipt of your decision the same will receive my prompt and willing compliance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRichard S.

He told the Indians that the Department might not allow any expenditure at this time and to leave the old school alone. However, I heard on arrival back here that the Indians had pulled the school down and were starting to put the logs of a new school up, they did not wait for any authority. Under the circumstances I have not asked for any grant towards a new school until my next visit to Chemawawin in September, as if the people there wish to do all the work without authority they may perhaps wish to pay for it.

I had this place washed out and well scrubbed as it was not in a very tidy condition.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the teacher of Chemawawin Day School asks for permission to close the school on May 31st next, on condition that he opens the same one month earlier in the summer holidays.\n\nThe people leave the Reserve in the summer to look for work with the fishermen away from the district, and I would beg to recommend that the request be allowed on the conditions set forth.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, reporting that the teacher of the Chumawin Indian Day School requests permission to close the school on May 31st next, for the summer holidays as the Indians leave the reserve at that time.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this school being closed on that date, on the condition that the teacher re-opens the school on the first of August, next, and teaches continuously from that date. You will be good enough to inform him accordingly. He should understand the conditions under which permission is being granted to close the school a month earlier than usual for the annual vacation.\n\nHe should forward a return showing the attendance and days taught during the current quarter. Full salary will be allowed him for the quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPas,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that the school teacher of the day school at Chemawawin Reserve started school on August 1st., he had closed the school on June 1st as I advised the Department.\n\nI visited this school on September 9th., and there were present 6 boys and 6 girls, being equally divided in Standard 1 and Standard 2. There is not much improvement here, about the best I can say is that the children do not go back in their studies, they showed a little advance in division.\n\nThe school was clean and tidy. I took with me the supplies authorised in letter 118338/4 of August 22nd. last.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 8th inst., I visited the Chemawawin Day School on the Chemawawin Reserve.\n\nThe teacher at this point is Mr. J.G. Kennedy, who has taught for a number of years in these schools, he has no qualifications, and in my opinion will never get the children above the third grade, most of his pupils stick at the second grade, and the parents take them away as soon as they are big enough to be useful on the hunt or around the camp.\n\nThere are nineteen on the register, of which seventeen were present at time of my visit. The average for the quarter will be about ten, which is larger than usual at this point.\n\nSeven children were in a.b.c. class, they knew very little, six are in first standard and they can read, spell, write, do simple addition, and multiplication. Four were in second standard who are a little further advanced, these children can name in English nearly any article in common use.\n\nThe school is very clean, and the children were tidy.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, July 5th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nYour remarks regarding the services being performed by the teacher, Mr. J. G. Kennedy, are noted. As it appears that his services are not very satisfactory, it might be advisable to make a change for the next school year.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views as to whether or not you would recommend that Mr. Kennedy's services be dispensed with and another teacher engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 128-4-1 regards teacher at Chemawawin Reserve Day School.\n\nThe teacher is a very old man who has been with the Department for a long time, he does his best. In case he is to be replaced by another teacher it would be well first to find if the new bishop, Bishop Lloyd, has anyone who would live at Chemawawin and do the work.\n\nThe teacher carries on other work such as dispensing medicines, issuing rations, and teaching the people how to garden etc, but as a teacher he is not advancing the pupils very much. To be fair of course it must be admitted that the children do not attend regularly, as they live on islands and cannot always reach the school when at home, and often they are absent with the parents on a hunt.\n\nBishop Lloyd may have some solution to the question.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 4, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the services of Mr. J. G. Kennedy, Teacher of the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are communicating with Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, Missionary Society, Church of England in Canada, Winnipeg, Man., who is in charge of Indian work for the Anglican Church in the West. He has been requested to furnish a report as to the action which the Church desires to take in having another teacher engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, August 4, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. J. G. Kennedy, Teacher of the Chemawawin Reserve Day School, is a very old man and is making no progress in the work at this school. Mr. Kennedy has no qualifications, and our agent reports that the children are receiving very little instruction. Besides his duties as teacher, he carries on other work, such as dispensing medicine, issuing rations and teaching the Indians gardening. There are 19 children on the register.\n\nIt is considered that it would be advisable, if satisfactory arrangements can be completed, to make a change in the teacher at this school. I shall be pleased to have your views as to whether or not you would recommend that Mr. Kennedy's services be dispensed with and another teacher engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n39-40 Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 4, No. 128-4-1, concerning Mr. J. G. Kennedy, teacher of the Chemawawin Reserve Day School, I beg to state that I am forwarding a copy of your letter to the Ven. Archdeacon John McKay, in the Diocese of Saskatchewan, where I believe this School is situated, and any further action which may be necessary in this case will be taken by him who will also correspond with you with regard to the same.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nAugust 12th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 128-4-1, of the 4th inst., addressed to Dr. Westgate and which has been forwarded to me, with regard to Mr. J. G. Kennedy, Teacher of the Chemawawin Reserve Day School, I am aware that he has no qualifications, and I have no doubt that your Agent's report, \"that the children are receiving very little instruction\" is quite correct. The difficulty is to get a qualified teacher for a post like Chemawawin. May I ask what salary the Department would allow if a properly qualified teacher could be found? I am not sure also what the teacher's accommodation is like, but I am making enquiries.\n\nKennedy is not a very old man, and, physically is equal to his work. He is lacking in educational qualifications, although, as you are no doubt aware, he has been employed for many years as teacher of different schools in the Pas Agency.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nActing ASST. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 18, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the services being performed by Mr. J. G. Kennedy, Teacher of the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department recognizes the difficulty of obtaining a teacher for a post like Chemawawin. We are not fully aware as to the accommodation provided for a teacher at this point. If the services of a qualified teacher can be obtained, the Department will be prepared to allow a salary at the rate of $750 per annum plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nMr. Kennedy has been employed as teacher for a number of years, and the Department does not desire to act unfairly in having him replaced. The matter of obtaining another teacher will be left in your hands. If you consider that it would be in the interests of the work that the services of a qualified teacher be secured, you may arrange for the appointment of such a person. The teacher engaged would have to perform the duties of dispensing medicine, issuing rations, etc.\n\nIt might be advisable to allow Mr. Kennedy to remain until the end of the present year at least, when, if it is your intention to make a change, he could be notified in due time that his services are not required after that date. If a new teacher is engaged, the name, qualifications and experience should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.128-4-1 of the 18th ult. with reference to the services being provided by Mr. J. G. Kennedy, teacher of the Cheresawin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, that in accordance with your wishes I will endeavour to find a more capable teacher. I think, however, that it will be advisable to carry out your further suggestion and allow Mr. Kennedy to remain until the end of the present year, at least.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, if a new teacher is found, the name, qualifications and experiences will be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nArchdeacon\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the day school at Chawawin Reserve on the 10th inst., and I examined the pupils etc., with following results.\n\nThe register showed 6 boys and 9 girls in attendance.\n\nThe school had been open for 47 days up to time of my visit since beginning of the quarter. The average attendance up to that time was 11.\n\nIn grade 3 there were 2 boys and 2 girls. I examined these children and they were very backward in reading and spelling from third book. They could do simple addition, but could not divide, or subtract, and knew very little of multiplication.\n\nThe ones in grade two were also very backward in every study.\n\nThe children in the A.R.C. class had only been taught their alphabet, they did not know the figures from 1 to 10, and the teacher said he had not come to that yet.\n\nI have protected this old chap and tried to get him to make progress but it seems a useless job, there is nothing I can do in the case except to recommend that he be replaced. I think the Department should see if the Church authorities cannot replace him. His name is J.G. Kennedy, and he has taught for years, gradually getting worse. I hate to recommend anything of this sort, but have to look at the question from the standpoint of the children.\n\nMr. Kennedy told me the children had not been attending school regularly, but he had his register marked up without any breaks. I did not enquire of the parents if the children had been attending steadily, but think the register is plugged.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1924.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nMr. J. G. Kennedy, teacher of the Chawawin Reserve Day School, who is an old man, is making no progress in the work at this school. Mr. Kennedy has no professional qualifications, and our Agent reports that the conditions in the classroom, especially as regards the pupils' studies, are gradually getting worse. Besides his duties as teacher, Mr. Kennedy carries on other work for the Department, such as dispensing medicines, issuing rations and teaching the Indians gardening. There has been an average attendance of eleven pupils during the present quarter.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the work, if satisfactory arrangements can be completed, to make a change in the teacher at this school. I may say that this matter was drawn to the attention of the late Ven. Archdeacon MacKay and he concurred that it would be advisable to make a change, and stated that he would endeavour to obtain a teacher. The Department recognizes the difficulty of obtaining a teacher for a post like Chawawin, but I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will take into favourable consideration the question of obtaining the services of a teacher for this school to begin duties after the summer holidays, or about September last, now that the services of a qualified teacher can be obtained, the Department will be prepared to allow a salary at the rate of $750 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. The teacher engaged would be required to perform the duties of dispensing medicines, for which service he would be allowed a small remuneration. I shall be pleased to hear from Your Lordship regarding the dispensing with the services of Mr. Kennedy and the engaging of another teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Rev.

We are communicating with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan regarding the matter, and suggesting the advisability of dispensing with the services of Mr. Kennedy at the end of the present school year, and the obtaining of the services of a qualified teacher to begin duties after the summer holidays.

There were present at the time seven boys and eight girls. However, the register showed that there would be practically very little work done at this school until May 26th. The average attendance for the quarter, up to the time of my visit, would not be more than five.\n\nThe teacher will probably be leaving in about ten days as he has to catch the steamboat about that time, and the school will then be closed.\n\nI will be obliged if the Department will ask the Authorities of the Anglican Church if they will endeavor to get the new teacher for this place by August 15th.

At the conclusion of the course I was granted an Academic Certificate which is the highest grade of Certificate issued by the Department of Education in Alberta.\n\nI was educated at the Universities of Edinburgh & Oxford. I am a graduate M.A., of the former and went to Oxford to specialize...\nI taught during 1923 at Maywood School No. 3951 in this province and came to this school last November. Maywood was a Norse, and this is a Ruthenian Settlement and, as I have conducted both schools successfully, I do not just think that an Indian School will present any greater difficulties. I had some Indians at Maywood who were my best pupils.\n\nMy wife is actively interested in the W.C.T.U. movement.

Banks to position as teacher at the day school on the Chemawawin Reserve, I beg to say that Mr. Banks went to Chemawawin last week and opened the school on Friday the 28th November.\n\nI stated in my former letter that Mr. Banks had been under considerable expense, being held here awaiting such time as travelling was safe. He asked for allowance this quarter as teacher to date from the 10th of November.\n\nI beg to recommend that this be allowed if possible, and if it is done I will try to have Mr. Banks teach during the holidays to make up the extra time. He was very hard up and the Department has advanced $75.00 to him for travelling expenses which would practically eat up the salary for the quarter if he is not allowed time from November 10th last.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, regarding the appointment of Mr. D. Banks to the position as teacher of the Chumawain Indian Day School, and informing the Department as to the date upon which he opened the school and began duties. In reply I beg to say that the department will allow Mr. Banks salary from the 10th of November last, as it is noted that he was ready to proceed to the school on that date, but was unable to do so, owing to travelling conditions.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Banks that his salary will date from the 10th ultimo. He should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught by him at the end of the present quarter and send it through your office to the Department, in order that the balance of the salary due him for the current quarter as well as the bonus can be paid him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the teacher at Chumawawin Day School advises me he has no pupils attending school at present as the parents took them away when they went to the rat swamps for the spring hunt and there is no one at the reserve to keep them. This is the usual procedure, but generally enough children are left home with old people to keep the school going. There is, I am certain, a move on foot amongst the Indians to get rid of Mr. Banks, not from educational grounds but from some church dispute. I understand he is also in wrong for some reason with the Rural Dean.\n\nThis letter is just to advise the Department that they may hear from other sources on this matter and they will understand the situation. In the meanwhile I have told Mr. Banks to attend school every day to give no excuse that he was not present to teach.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Agent,\nThe Pas.\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby request permission from the Indian Department to have the summer holidays altered from July and August to include September instead of July, thus having the holidays from August 15th to September 30th.\n\nI ask this for domestic reasons necessitating my wife and I going to The Pas east in September, as there is no doctor here. It would\u2014apart from personal reasons\u2014be better for the scholars, as their absence from the Reserve with their parents during the school season up to May 15th has made them backward, and the past two or three weeks have been chiefly used in recapitulation of work done before their absence. To close the school at the usual time, i.e., June 31st would enable very little progress to be made before another stagnant period commences. An extra four weeks in July would enable a foundation to be laid that would\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be pleased to hear later as to what arrangements were made between the teacher and yourself regarding the holiday period at this school.\n\nIf the school is conducted continuously until the end of July, next, the teacher should prepare his return at that time showing the days taught, attendance, etc., for the month, and forward same through your office in order that payment of salary due can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Report\ndated Feb. 20th, 1928.\n\nOriginal on File 128-4-7.\n\nThere is not much progress here.\n\n\"The Indians at this place are about the most poverty stricken lot I have seen. I hardly know what to recommend about it, but it appears to me that on account of having to stop home to keep the children at the school they just about starve themselves as there is no game to be obtained locally. The school is closed more or less every spring for the rat hunt and there will be few people home in March and April. It appears as if we should operate this place as a summer school only; the Indians could keep alive then by fishing. Then in the fall and winter they could go off to some district where they could get moose, fish and rabbits. I wish the Department would take the matter up with the church authorities and have the matter discussed. I do not want my opinion to be taken as the only solution of the matter, but if you saw these half-starved people sitting in empty shacks with nothing to eat you would feel like making a change of some sort, I am sure.\"\nOttawa, February 28th, 1928.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that Mr. Agent Waddy, in a report on the school activities at the Chippewawin Indian Day School, states that not much progress is being made in the work. I quote from his report as follows:\n\n\"The Indians at this place are about the most poverty stricken lot I have seen.

I shall be pleased to have, at your early convenience, your views as to whether you would approve of this school being conducted during the summer months only - from say May 1st to September 30th. If this arrangement is carried out it will, no doubt, lead to a more regular attendance of the Indian children during the period the school would be in operation and would also assist the Indians in obtaining a livelihood as it would not be necessary for them to remain at home during the hunting season in order to keep their children at school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev.

He knows the whole situation thoroughly and agrees that it would be better to follow the Agents suggestion, but with these added points:\n\n1. The school for this present term should be carried on to the end of August (if the teacher is willing) then close the school until May 1st 1929.\n\n2. I think we can find good teachers for these three summer schools Stanley, Pellican Narrows and Cedar Lake but they might not be trained certificated teachers. The dates of summer schools prevent regular teachers getting regular schools afterwards.\n\n3. The date for a teacher to be at The Pas should be May 5th in order to avoid delay caused by ice in the Saskatchewan river.\n\nI presume you will give the present teacher Mr Banks official notice that his services will not be required after the end of August or earlier if he needs to close up in order to reach another school.

His Lordship states that he has taken up the whole question with the Rev.

He put the pupils present, number attending was 18, through exercises in reading, spelling, writing and arithmetic, the conduct of the children in their responses indicated that the teacher was doing his work with some results, several of the children, were bright and indicated a good knowledge of the subjects they were being tried out in.

In this connection I have to say that the former Indian Agent, Mr. Waddy, and the Church authorities recommended that this school be conducted during the summer months only, beginning last year. It was stated that this school was closed more or less every Spring, as the Indians go away with their children to the rat hunt, and that in the Fall and Winter months they go off some distance where they can get moose, fish and rabbits.

It is noted from your letter that you state you were employed as teacher at the Moose Lake Indian Day School from 1895 to 1901. I may say that during this period our books show that this school was taught by Louis Cochrane. The first record we have been able to find of your service was as teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School from September 1, 1892. It is also noted that you started teaching in 1889. We can find no record of your service previous to September 1, 1892.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. C. Lundie, Esq.,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nNovember 9th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to report that Mr. P. Barrett, teacher of the Chemawawin Indian Day School at Cedar Lake, Manitoba, was brought to The Pas late last night by canoe, suffering from typhoid fever.\n\nAfter getting him to the Hospital, and seeing him as comfortable as he could be, I had a talk with him, but he states that there are no Indians at Cedar Lake sick just now.\n\nAs you will remember five Cedar Lake Indians were brought to The Pas the beginning of October with typhoid, but one died, and the other four returned just a week ago.\n\nOn talking the matter over with Dr. Robertson, the Doctor said he did not think we would have any more cases from Cedar Lake as the five that were brought in were at a camp some 35 miles away from the reserve.\n\nHowever when the Doctor was at Cedar Lake recently, he made arrangements with Mr. McDonald, the Hudson's Bay Company Manager, to get this office know immediately if he had any suspicions of another outbreak, and so far no word had been received here.\n\nShould anything arise from this I will let you know immediately, and trust this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. A. G. Richardson,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nFor your information I enclose copy of a letter received from A. G. Richardson, Acting Indian Agent at the Pas, with reference to the arrival at The Pas of Mr. P. Barrett, teacher at the Chemawawin Indian Day School at Cedar Lake, suffering from typhoid fever. In the third paragraph Mr. Richardson refers to Indians from Cedar Lake suffering from typhoid having been brought to the Pas in the beginning of October. I think he has made a mistake and meant to say August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-12B of the 12th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Acting Indian Agent at The Pas with reference to the illness from typhoid fever of Mr. P. Barrett, teacher of the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that we are communicating with His Lordship the Bishop of Brandon relative to the engagement of a substitute teacher during Mr. Barrett's illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. N. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 20, 1931.\n\nRight Rev.

It is noted that he is suffering from typhoid fever, having been taken to the hospital at The Pas on the 8th instant. The Department regrets the illness of Mr. Barrett and hopes that he will make a speedy recovery and be able to resume duties.\n\nAs it will be some time before Mr. Barrett will be able to resume duties, I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department if the school should remain closed, or if you are prepared to nominate the services of a substitute teacher. If so, I shall be pleased to have full particulars regarding the qualifications, etc., of the teacher whom you recommend to take charge of this school until such time as Mr. Barrett is able to resume duties.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

P. Barrett. You will be glad to hear that the medical men consider his condition to be favourable, and have hope of his recovery. He is, nevertheless, a very sick man, and will not be able to resume his duties for some time.\n\nI am arranging to visit him very shortly, and shall then decide whether to recommend a substitute teacher for a month or two, or to leave the school closed until Mr Barrett can return. I shall lay the matter before you for your approval on my return from The Pas.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours.\n\nBishop of Brandon.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6230)\n\nFile 506-1, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Chemawawin School -\nChurch of England - General Adminis-\ntration. 1893 - 1931\n\nFile 506-3, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Chemawawin School -\nChurch of England - Teachers' Sala-\nries. 1912 - 1947\n\nFile 506-5, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Chemawawin School -\nChurch of England - Building Mainte-\nnance - Supplies - Accounts. 1895 -\n1937\n\nFile 506-5, part 2\nThe Pas Agency - Chemawawin School -\nChurch of England - Building Mainte-\nnance - Supplies - Accounts. 1939 -\n1949\n\nFile 506-8, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Chemawawin School -\nChurch of England - Teachers' Resi-\ndence. 1916 - 1950\nProvince of Man.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED Dec. 31st 1912.\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Rev.
