Without this memorandum the papers would have been incomplete, and although this Department is not yet formally notified of the approval of His Excellency the Governor General, the Minister is informed that such approval has been given.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA.

That the small water frontages of which half-breeds are at present in bona fide possession, by virtue of residence and cultivation, be sold to them at one dollar per acre, the area in no case to exceed forty acres, and payment therefor to be made within two years.\n\n2. That in satisfaction of their claims as actual settlers upon these small water frontages which are proposed to be sold to them, they be permitted to select from lands open for homestead and pre-emption entry, as nearly as possible in the vicinity of their holdings, one quarter-section of one hundred and sixty acres, more or less, the patent for which, however, should not issue until payment has been made in full for the lands of which they are now in occupation, as aforesaid.\n3. That in the case of children of half-breed heads of families residing in the North-West Territories prior to the 15th day of July, 1870, and born before that date, instead of an issue at two hundred and forty dollars in scrip, they be granted a certificate, entitling them to select two hundred and forty acres of land from any lands open for homestead and pre-emption entry.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nD.

We leave on Tuesday morning.\n\nW. P. R. STREET.\n\nWINNIPEG, 5th April, 1885.\n\nMy Dear Sir David,\u2014We arrived here early this morning and I met my fellow commissioners at the Dominion Lands Office at 10 o'clock. They introduced the subject as to which I telegraphed you yesterday, and spoke very strongly as to its being one which was likely to be a serious stumbling block in our dealings with the half-breeds. Lest you should not fully have understood my telegram, I will shortly state the point. Suppose we find that a half-breed has been, upon and since 15th July, 1870, in occupation of a parcel of, say 160 acres, under circumstances which, if he were a while settler, would entitle him to a grant of the land under the homestead clauses of the Dominion Lands Act: under the authority we now possess we could, if he wore the head of a family, allow him nothing more than the 160 acres; we could allow him nothing for his claim as a half-breed, and inasmuch as the Government has all along been purporting to deal with the half-breeds as if they had some general rights beyond those of ordinary incoming settlers, my fellow commissioners say that great dissatisfaction and disappointment will be created if we give to these occupying half-breeds only that which any ordinary settler can claim, and nothing for the extinguishment of his Indian title. Mr. Pearce discussed the matter very fully with us and concurred in the advisability of our obtaining, if possible, the power to enable us to allow the half-breed to claim the land occupied by him under the homestead provisions, and in addition to give him his scrip for the $160, or $240, as the case may be, for his Indian title.\n\nI enclose copies in English and French of the notice we have issued: the places for which dates have not yet been fixed will be grouped in the further notice when it is given.\n\nThis letter may, of course, be used officially, should you desire so to use it.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nW. P. R. STREET.\n\nHon. Sir DAVID L. MACPHERSON, K.C.M.G., Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNotice is hereby given that the undersigned have been appointed by letters patent, dated 30th March, 1885, from Her Majesty the Queen, under the Great Seal\nof the Dominion of Canada, commissioners with authority, among other things, to make an enumeration of the half-breeds, who previous to the 15th July, 1870, were resident within the ceded portions of the North West Territories, and outside the limits of the original Province of Manitoba, and to investigate their claims as such half-breeds existing in connection with the extinguishment of the Indian title, and to issue certificates to such half-breeds as shall prove before the commissioners their claims to consideration under sub-section E, of section 81, of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883.\n\nThe commissioners will attend for the purpose of receiving, hearing and adjudicating upon such claims at the undermentioned places at or about the dates mentioned below. Should circumstances prevent their reaching the places appointed at the days mentioned, timely notice of the change will be given:\n\nAt Fort Qu\u2019Appelle, April 9th to April 14th, both days inclusive.\nAt Touchwood Hills, April 16th and 17th.\nAt Regina, April 23rd to April 27th, both days inclusive.\nAt Maple Creek, April 29th.\nAt Calgary, May 1st to May 6th, both days inclusive.\nAt Ford McLeod, May 9th to May 12th, both days inclusive.\n\nDates for the sitting of the commission at St. Albert, Edmonton, Fort Saskatchewan, Victoria, Fort Pitt, Battleford, St. Laurent, St. Louis de Langevin, Duck Lake, St. Antoine de Padone and Prince Albert will shortly be fixed.\n\nDated at Winnipeg this 4th April, 1885,\n\nW.

FORGET,\n\nCommissioners.\n\nNote.\u2014The French translation of the foregoing notice is omitted.\n\nSOUTH CENTRE, MANITOBA, 4th April, 1885.\n\nIf desired by half-breeds, would it not be advisable to grant scrip, one sixty or two forty dollars, permitting them to acquire title to land in occupation through possession? Otherwise, Government really gives nothing for Indian title.\n\nDo you wish me to give notice that commission will take evidence of claims other than those of half-breeds? Pearce concurs in first suggestion.\n\nW. P. R. STREET.\n\nSir D. L.

DRINKWATER, Esq., Secretary C.P.R., Montreal, Que.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 30th March, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to inform you that a commission has been appointed to investigate and report upon the claims of half-breeds in the North-West Territories; and I have this day instructed the secretary of the Land Board at Winnipeg to place himself in communication with you at once, for the purpose of ascertaining how many copies of a poster, notifying the public of the times and places of the sittings of the commission, you can advantageously distribute, the object of the Government being to have one of such notices posted at each station, section house and telegraph office within your division, at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYour prompt action in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nJOHN M. EGAN, Esq., Superintendent\nWestern Division C. P. R., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 30th March, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Minister of the Interior to inform you that you have this day been appointed chairman of a commission to make an enumeration of the half-breeds resident in the North-West Territories of Canada previous to the 15th day of July, 1870; and to report, from time to time, to the Minister of the Interior, the persons who are entitled to be dealt with under sub-clause (e) of clause 81, of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883; and the Order in Council of the 30th instant; also the extent to which they are entitled.\n\nA copy of the said Dominion Lands Act, and of the Order in Council of the 30th instant, are among the enclosures herein, and are marked respectively A and B.\n\nYour colleagues on the commission are Roger Goulet, Esq., of the town of St. Boniface, Province of Manitoba, Dominion Lands Surveyor, and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Edmond Forget, Esq., of the town of Regina, in the provisional district of Assiniboia, Clerk of the North-West Council, both of whom have been instructed to join you at Winnipeg for duty, not later than the morning of Monday, the 6th of April, proximo.\n\nSub-clause (e) of Clause 81, of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order in Council of the 30th instant, hereinafter referred to, indicate very distinctly the purposes for which the commission have been appointed; and I am to request that in the performance of their duties they will be guided generally by the following instructions:\n\n1. The advance of spring renders it desirable that as little delay as possible may occur in the commencement of the work of the commission. It is assumed that you will be ready to leave Winnipeg on the 7th of April, proximo, and an alternative itinerary will be found enclosed, marked C. It will be the duty of the commission, unless obstacles not now anticipated should interpose, to adopt the route northward from Qu'Appelle, and hold the sittings of the commission in accordance with the itinerary prescribed for that route, and to have prepared and printed in French and English posters notifying all whom it may concern of the dates at which the commission will sit at the several places mentioned.\n\nTo facilitate this part of your work, the secretary of the Land Board at Winnipeg has been directed to place himself and the whole staff of that office at your disposal, and he has also been instructed what steps to take to have the printed copies of the notice which you may decide upon so distributed throughout the Territories that all concerned may be duly notified.\n\nIt is believed that the itinerary applicable to this route will afford ample time for the completion of the work of the commission at the several places to be visited. But, while it is desirable that the sittings of the commission should correspond, as nearly as possible, as to date and place, with the printed notices issued in advance, circumstances may arise which will render it necessary to vary the arrangements.\nsomewhat, or even to depart from it entirely, but this should not be done without the specific authority from the Minister of the Interior. In that event, it will be the duty of the commission to take proper steps to give timely intimation of the change to all whom it may concern.\n\n2. It is not improbable that the commission may meet on the trails throughout the Territories numbers of half-breeds who are entitled to be reported to the Minister of the Interior as coming within the scope of sub-clause (e) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order of the Privy Council of the 30th instant. In all such cases it will be the duty of the commission, without reference to their pre-arranged sittings, to take steps to make the necessary investigation into the several claims on the spot.\n\n3. Enclosed is a specimen, marked D, of the form of declaration which the commission will require each claimant to make and subscribe to; but wherever deemed expedient, the commission may curtail, add to, or vary the questions contained in the said form; and to aid the commission in deciding cases in respect to which there may be doubts as to whether the applicants have already received grants to land or scrip as half-breeds residing within the Province of Manitoba at the time of the transfer, and who, therefore, do not come within the purview of the commission, lists of the allotments of land and scrip made to the half-breeds of the several parishes in that Province have been placed in the custody of the secretary of the commission. These lists will require to be returned to the Department when the labors of the commission have been completed, as they form part of the permanent departmental record.\n\n4. The Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs has been requested to cause instructions to be issued to the various Indian agents in the North-West to attend the sittings of the commission at the several points within their respective districts, to enable the commissioners to decide upon the spot any doubt which may arise as to whether any claimant who presents himself is or is not a recipient of an annuity or other grant as an Indian, and therefore not within the purview of the commission. In respect to applications of this class, which may be made in the absence of the Indian agent, which it may be impossible for the commission, upon the evidence before them, to decide upon the spot, the name and an accurate description of the claimant should be sent to the agent for the district within which the claimant may have been residing for the past few years, and the decision of the commission should be based upon the agent's report. Care should be taken to give treaty Indians distinctly to understand that they are not eligible to be enumerated as half-breeds; but it would be well to explain to them that when, under and in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act, they make application for enfranchisement, they will be dealt with by the Government equitably and liberally.\n\n5. It is not improbable that the attention of the commission may be called to claims to land preferred by squatters other than half-breeds. Although it is not the intention that the commission should deal with cases of this sort, it is nevertheless desirable that such evidence as the claimants may wish to submit should, if properly corroborated, be taken before the commission on the blank forms furnished for the purpose, a specimen of which, marked E, is hereto attached; and assurance should be given in each instance that the claims will receive the prompt and liberal consideration of the Government, through the agency of the Land Board.\n\n6. To entitle a claimant to be dealt with under sub-clause (e) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order in Council of the 30th instant, such claimant is required to furnish to the commission evidence on the following points; such evidence to be in each case by affidavit of the claimant, to be made before the commission, and substantiated by the affidavits, sworn as aforesaid, of two reliable and disinterested witnesses personally cognizant of the facts: (a) That he is a half-breed head of a family resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th July, 1870, or (b) That he is a child of a half-breed head of a family resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, and born before that date.\n\n7. In the case of a half-breed head of a family, or the child of a half-breed head of a family who has attained the full age of eighteen years, proving to the satisfaction of\nthe commission that he is entitled to be dealt with under sub-clause 2 of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order in Council of the 30th instant, the commissioners shall grant him a certificate to that effect in one or other of the forms hereto attached, marked F and G, as the case may be, and shall report to the Minister of the Interior to the same effect on one or other of the forms hereto attached, marked H and I, as the case may be.\n\n8. In the case of a claimant who proves to the satisfaction of the commission that he is entitled to be dealt with under sub-clause (e) of clause 81, of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order in Council of the 30th inst., but has not yet attained the full age of eighteen years, such proof to consist of an affidavit of the half-breed head of the family, if living, and if dead or absent from the Territories, such other evidence as may be satisfactory to the commission, of the date when the claimant will attain the full age of eighteen years, together with a certificate of his birth or baptism, if in the opinion of the commission it be procurable, the commission shall issue a certificate on one or other of the forms hereto attached, marked K and L, as the case may be, and shall make a return to the Minister of the Interior to the same effect on one or other of the forms hereto attached, marked M and N, as the case may be.\n\n9. In case of persons claiming as heirs of half-breed heads of families, or of children of half-breed heads of families who would have been entitled to be dealt with under sub-clause (e) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and the Order in Council of the 30th inst., but who have died since the 15th day of July, 1870, the commission shall require evidence on the following points:\n\n(a.) That the deceased was a half-breed head of a family resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870. (b.) A certificate of the birth or baptism and also of the death of the claimant, if in the opinion of the commission such certificate or certificates be procurable, but if not, then such evidence as shall be satisfactory to the commission. (c.) That the claimant is the heir of the deceased half-breed head of a family or half-breed child, as the case may be, according to the law in force in the North-West Territories at the time of the death of such half-breed head of a family, or such child of such half-breed head of a family.\n\n10. For the purposes of the grant to be made upon the report of the commission, the term half-breed head of a family resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, shall be held to mean half-breed mothers equally with half-breed fathers, or both, as the case may be, and all children of a half-breed head or half-breed heads of a family, as above described, shall be entitled, whether male or female.\n\n11. In view of the exceptional condition of the country previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, the illegitimate child of a half-breed head of a family shall be allowed to participate in the grant to be made, upon the report of the commission.\n\n12. Orphan children of half-breed heads of families, the latter having died previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, shall also be entitled to participate, provided such children were resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870.\n\n13. Children of half-breed heads of families resident in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, but who were themselves absent from the North-West Territories at the said time, and who may not have returned to the Territories, shall also be allowed to participate.\n\n14. Half-breed children living in the Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, but whose parents or families were resident elsewhere at the said period, shall not be entitled to participate.\n\nCircular letters have been addressed to all Dominion land agents and Crown timber agents in the North-West to assist the commission in the performance of their duties in every possible way. Steps have also been taken to procure the issue of similar instructions to the various Indian agents and officers of the Mounted Police.\n\nMr. N. Omer Cot\u00e9, of the Secretary's branch of this Department, has been appointed secretary to the commission. He has a thorough knowledge of both the English and the French languages, and a fair knowledge of short-hand.\nIt will be your duty, as chairman of the commission, to make all necessary disbursements for transport and incidental expenses, other than living expenses, and for all such disbursements, except railway, cab and stage fares, properly signed and witnessed vouchers in duplicate must be furnished.\n\nIt will also be your duty to see that these expenditures shall be as economical as is consistent with comfort and the efficiency of the service.\n\nThe allowance for living expenses for yourself, the other two commissioners and the secretary, will be at the rate prescribed by the order of the treasury board of the 29th November, 1837, of which a copy will be found herewith, marked P.\n\nThe living expenses of any men the commission may find it necessary to employ, being the actual disbursements made in that behalf, must be accounted for in the same manner as the incidental expenses of the commission, and properly signed and witnessed vouchers in duplicate must be furnished. Mr. Cot\u00e9 carries with him a supply of the requisite form of voucher.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nW. P. R. STREET, Esq., Q.C., London, Ontario.\n\nNote.\u2014The forms of declaration and certificates here following being blank forms, it is ordered by the Joint Committee not to have them printed.\n\nCERTIFIED COPY of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 30th March, 1835.\n\nOn a report, dated 28th March, 1835, from the Minister of the Interior, submitting that by sub-clause (c) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1833, it is provided that the Governor in Council shall have power \"to satisfy any claims existing in connection with the extinguishment of the Indian title preferred by half-breeds resident in the North-West Territories outside of the limits of Manitoba previous to the fifteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, by granting land to such persons, to such extent and on such terms and conditions as may be deemed expedient,\" and he is of opinion that it is expedient that those claims should be satisfied by granting\u2014\n\n1st. To each half-breed head of a family resident in the North-West Territories, outside of the limits of Manitoba, previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, the lot or portion of land of which he is at the present time in bona fide and undisputed occupation by virtue of residence upon and cultivation thereof, to the extent of one hundred and sixty acres, and if the lot or portion of land of which he is in bona fide occupation as aforesaid, should be less than one hundred and sixty acres, the difference to be made up to him by an issue of scrip redeemable in land at the rate of one dollar per acre, and in the case of each half-breed head of a family residing in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, who is not at present in bona fide occupation of any land, scrip be issued, redeemable in land, to the extent of one hundred and sixty dollars.\n\n2. To each child of a half-breed head of a family residing in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, and born before that date, the lot or portion of land of which he is at the present time in bond fide and undisputed occupation, by virtue of residence upon and cultivation thereof, to the extent of two hundred and forty acres, and if the lot or portion of land of which he is in bond fide occupation as aforesaid should be less than two hundred and forty acres, the difference to be made up to him by an issue of scrip, redeemable in land, at the rate of one dollar per acre, and in the case of each child of a half-breed head of a family residing in the North-West Territories previous to the 15th day of July, 1870, who is not at\npresent in *bona fide* occupation of any land, scrip be issued, redeemable in land, to the extent of two hundred and forty dollars.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior, on representations made that it was desirable to have made an enumeration of half-breeds in Manitoba and the North-West Territories who would have been entitled to land had they resided in Manitoba at the time of the transfer, was authorized by Your Excellency in Council, under date the 28th of January last, to appoint commissioners, and the following gentlemen were accordingly appointed to carry into effect the said Order of Your Excellency in Council, namely: William Purvis Rochfort Street, of the city of London, in the Province of Ontario, one of Her Majesty's counsel learned in the law, who is to be the chairman of the commission; Roger Goulet, of the town of St. Boniface, in the Province of Manitoba, Dominion lands surveyor; and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Edmond Forget, of the town of Regina, in the provisional district of Assiniboia, Clerk of the North-West Council and barrister-at-law.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior is of opinion that the scope of the enquiry to be made by the commissioners appointed under the authority of the Order of Your Excellency in Council above mentioned should be enlarged, and that they be empowered not only to enumerate the half-breeds resident in the North-West Territories outside of the limits of Manitoba, previous to the fifteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, but also to report, from time to time, to the Minister of the Interior, the persons who are entitled to be dealt with under sub-clause (e) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883, and also the extent to which they are entitled; it being understood that the expression \"North-West Territories,\" contained in the third line of sub-clause (e) of clause 81 of the Dominion Lands Act of 1883, shall, for the purpose of the enumeration and report to be made by the commissioners, be held to include all that portion of the Province of Manitoba, as now constituted which was not within the said Province as constituted under the Manitoba Act (33 Vic., chap. 3).\n\nThe Minister deems it important that the said commissioners be authorized, under clause 83 of the Dominion Lands Act of 1883, to summon witnesses before them, by subpoenas issued by them, to examine such witnesses under oath, and generally to do all things and exercise all powers and functions provided for by the said clause 83 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the Order of Your Excellency in Council of the 28th January last, hereinbefore referred to, be cancelled.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior recommends that the commissioners who shall make the enumeration and report herein provided for be the same as were appointed under the authority of the above mentioned Order of Your Excellency, namely:\u2014William Purvis Rochfort Street, of the city of London, in the Province of Ontario, one of Her Majesty's counsel learned in the law, who shall be the chairman of the commission; Roger Goulet, of the town of St. Boniface, in the Province of Manitoba, Dominion lands surveyor; and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Edmond Forget, of the town of Regina, in the provisional district of Assiniboia, Clerk of the North-West Council, and barrister-at-law.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing report and the recommendations therein contained, and they advise that the above named be constituted a commission, with all the powers recommended by the Minister of the Interior.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nJOHN J.

BURGESS,\u2014I forward to you the following files of this Department:\u20142094, 3559, 4041, 4145, 4953, 10766, 12014. These files contain correspondence referring more or less to half-breed matters in the North-West Territories. They have been culled from an immense number of other files on Indian matters, and I think they should properly have been retained in the Department of the Interior.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL. VANKOUGHNET.\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nProposed and adopted amongst ourselves that messengers be sent to all the M\u00e9tis and to the Cree, Assiniboine and Saulteaux nations.\n\nThis 3rd May, 1873, we have received the votes of all the M\u00e9tis of the North-West, and the assurance of the friendship of all the Indian nations.\n\nAddress to the Lieutenant-Governor, Alexander Morris, Public Meeting, 5th May, 1873.\n\nWe, the Council and the public, through this petition, respectfully submit to the Lieutenant-Governor that we are aware that the Canadian Government has annexed our lands to Canada, which lands are all known to be of the greatest value.\n\nWe mean to speak here of the manner in which the Canadian Government have made their treaties at Red River, causing a great deal of anxiety among us, for the people of Red River being our own people, if they are maltreated, we know that we will be treated similarly. Bright promises will be made to us, but never will be carried out afterwards.\n\nWe are aware that Governor McDougall did, three years ago, declare war against our people at Red River, without the Queen's instructions; that Dr. Schultz, Col. Dennis and other such men, have good positions, and one might suppose that those persons were given those positions in order to give them a chance of annoying the people of Red River\u2014Dr. Schultz being a member of the Council of the North-West and Provencher, we are told, being Indian agent, who, like Mr. Clark, have fine words and flatteries to tell the Indians, in order to better deceive them afterwards.\n\nWe beg of you, our worthy Lieutenant-Governor, to listen to what we have to say, and although we do not know how to express ourselves, we wish to manifest the sense of respect we have for you. We consequently request you to listen to our just prayer and give us your protection in preventing strangers from disturbing us on our lands, although they do not form part of the Province.\n\nWe also ask of you, our Lieutenant-Governor, to give us lands in compensation of our rights to the lands of the country as M\u00e9tis.\n\nAnd we also beg to call your attention to the fact that a preference is shown towards the strangers in the Province, and we would like a stop being put to such a\nstate of things, even in our midst, who do not belong to the Province although those are but a few strangers, still they are trying to supplant us.\n\nWe also tell you, as our Lieutenant-Governor, that we find it hard of the Canadian Government not having as yet fulfilled the agreements entered into with the people of the Province; for the last three years those agreements have remained a dead letter, and if the people of the Province is so badly treated we cannot expect to be treated otherwise.\n\nWe would be very glad to see the Canadian Government adopting a frank and open course, and if they were to give to our people of the Province the lands which in their agreement with the Canadian Government they were to have.\n\nWe further beg to ask of you, our Lieutenant-Governor, for a general pardon in favor of Mr. Riel and the principal men who supported him, for they are not safe in visiting the city, and our people cannot appear in the city without being molested and ill-treated by the strangers and also by the soldiers, and no reason can be obtained against them.\n\nWe write to you, our Lieutenant-Governor, to let you know that we respect you and that we speak well of you to all the Indian nations, and that we do all we can to induce them to act according to law and justice. Peace and tranquility exists everywhere in the camps and in the M\u00e9tis settlements, and the Indian nations say that if good propositions be made to them by the Government that they may perhaps make a treaty of peace for the roads.\n\nAnd as there are no laws made as yet for this country, we go on as heretofore. We make a law, and that law is strong, as it is supported by the majority.\n\nWe terminate, awaiting good proposals and assuring you, our Lieutenant-Governor, of our respect.\n\nJOHN FISHER.\nAnd ten others.\n\nTranslation.\n\nGovernment House, Fort Garry, 4th June, 1873.\n\nGentlemen,\u2014The address voted at your meeting held on the 5th May last, which you erroneously designate under the name of \"Council,\" has been submitted to me; and I must say that I received it only when Mr. Fisher gave me to understand that it was not a Council but simply a committee formed in order to prepare the address, there being but one Council for the administration of the affairs in the North-West, of which I have the honor of being the Governor. In answer, I must tell you that you are in error when you suppose that there are no laws in force in the North-West Territory. The laws of England are in force here, and the administration of the territories has been confined to me as Governor and to a Council appointed by the Crown, which is now composed of eleven members, and the number of which may be increased to twenty-one.\n\nThe criminal laws of the Dominion have been extended to the North-West, and a severe law prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquors therein.\n\nMagistrates will be appointed for the carrying out of these laws and a police force will be kept up to maintain order and prevent crimes and offenses against our people.\n\nI will submit your letter to the Council of the North-West, and will also forward a copy of the same to the Secretary of State at Ottawa.\n\nI do not answer you more lengthily at present, but I wish you to understand that the Government has but one object in view, which is to treat the inhabitants of this country with justice and impartiality, and to administer the affairs of the country for the greater weal of the people. Of this you must be well assured.\n\nYou ask that Louis Riel may not be troubled for his past conduct. I can only say, in answer to this, that I have not the power to grant you your request, as the Queen alone, in the exercise of Her discretionary power, can pardon offenses of the nature of which he is accused, if she thinks proper so to do.\nI thank you for the expression of your good sentiments and for your confidence in me as your Governor.\n\nI will do my utmost to preserve that confidence, in acting with justice and impartiality, and with the earnest desire to insure to our populations the exercise of their just rights, as well as that tranquility, prosperity and contentment compatible with the institutions which govern it.\n\nI remain, &c.,\n\nALEXANDER MORRIS, Lieutenant-Governor.\n\nJOHN FISHER, President of the meeting held on the 5th May last, and others.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, FORT GARRY, 5th June, 1873.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose a (literal) copy of a petition received from John Fisher and others, of Fort Qu'Appelle, together with my reply thereto.\n\nI have the honor be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nALEX. MORRIS, Lieutenant-Governor.\n\nHon. the Secretary of State for the Provinces, Ottawa.\n\nOFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE PROVINCES,\nOTTAWA, 17th June, 1873.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 36 n, of the 5th instant, covering a copy of a petition addressed to you by John Fisher and others, of Qu'Appelle, together with a copy of your reply thereto.\n\nYour despatch and its enclosures will be submitted for the early consideration of the Governor General in Council.\n\nE. A. MEREDITH.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, Fort Garry, Man.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, FORT GARRY, 9th June, 1874.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose memorandum of information furnished by Mr. John Mackay, of Prince Albert, on the Saskatchewan, to Mr. Urquhart, Secretary of the North-West Council.\n\nMr. Mackay is a very reliable man, a brother of the Hon. James Mackay.\n\nIn reference to what he states about the land, I beg to refer to my previous despatches, Nos. 50n, 151n and 159n, the statements contained in which are confirmed by Mr. Mackay.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant.\n\nALEX. MORRIS, Lieutenant-Governor.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nP.S.\u2014Referring to your despatch of the 2nd April last, and Colonel Dennis' report transmitted therewith, you will perceive that the Surveyor-General was misinformed as to \"a man named McBeath being the only grumbler\" in regard to the complaint concerning the land surveys.\n\nMr. John Mackay, of Prince Albert, on the Saskatchewan, in the North-West Territories, furnishes information of which the following is the substance:\u2014\n\nThe settlement of Prince Albert is on the North Branch, about 50 miles from Carlton, and between there and the Forks. It consists of about 50 permanent, well-built houses (the pine wood of which they are constructed being found in the immediate neighborhood), and there are between 300 and 400 settlers. These are principally English half-breeds. More settlers are coming in, principally English half-breeds from Manitoba. There is a settlement, not far distant, called St. Laurent, on the South Branch. The settlers here are French half-breeds.\nThe people of Prince Albert are very anxious to have a treaty concluded with the Indians. The Indians are also desirous of coming to some settlement as to the future\u2014that is, the majority of them. They want to see the Governor. The Governor would have a better chance of making a treaty than anyone else. The Wood Indians (Crees) are all in favor of a treaty. Some of the Plain Crees are opposed to one being made. Probably if they had been let alone they would not have been opposed to a treaty, but they have been influenced by the French half-breeds from St. Laurent and Qu'Appelle. The English half-breeds take to farming; the Metis live by hunting. Thus it is that the former are in favor of and the latter opposed to a treaty.\n\nHe (Mr. Mackay) a short time since received a letter from Gabriel Dumont, of St. Laurent, inviting the people of Prince Albert settlement to join him and his compatriots in the establishment of a provisional government. Gabriel Dumont had been elected president, and the people of St. Laurent had sworn to obey laws passed by him and his council. The people of Prince Albert would have nothing to do with the movement which he (Mr. Mackay) does not think, as yet, really amounts to much. The people, however, of all nationalities, are anxious to see civil and criminal laws established, and are growing impatient that something should be done. In the absence of the properly constituted officials and the enforcement of Dominion law, they are, after a time, naturally tempted to establish laws of their own for their protection, and hence the repeated talk about setting up provisional governments.\n\nThe people of Prince Albert want the land question settled. They wish to know how the land is to be laid out. The Hudson Bay Company, instead of taking up the land round their post, claimed their reserve three miles away, on better land, claimed by the settlers. A public meeting was held and the settlers refused to give up this land, amounting in all to about 3,000 acres, and it is now held and cultivated by them, although the company still claim it and have had it surveyed and staked out. This matter the settlers are very anxious should be settled. They also want a justice of the peace appointed, with powers to appoint constables. J. H. Kerr, who was commissioned justice of the peace, has left the Territories, and had done so before the commission issued.\n\nHad heard that the police were coming; treaties should be made with the Indians before the police come, or, if this cannot be done, carefully selected messengers should precede them, to explain the object of their coming. If this is not done, the Indians will say that they are going to have their land taken from them without any remuneration.\n\nAll well affected settlers in the North-West are anxious that treaties should be made, and law and order established without delay, as until this is done there must always be danger.\n\nN.B.\u2014Mr. Kerr was appointed under O. in C. of the 23rd December, 1873 (No. 130), Mr. Chastelair (Joniss) was appointed by the same O. in C. a J. P. Both were residents at Prince Albert.\n\nOTTAWA, 22nd June, 1874.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 191, of the 9th instant, covering a memorandum containing the substance of the information communicated to the Secretary of the North-West Council, by Mr. John Mackay, of Prince Albert, on the Saskatchewan, in reference to the state of feeling now existing among the Indians and half-breeds of that locality.\n\nThe matters therein referred to, so far as they have not already been dealt with, will receive early attention.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories,\nFort Garry, Man.\nOTTAWA, 11th May, 1885.\n\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In reply to your note of the 8th instant, I enclose herewith copy of the letter of the 2nd of December, 1874, addressed by Mr. Meredith to the Rev. P\u00e8re Decorby, Roman Catholic missionary at Qu'Appelle, being a reply to his letter of the 1st of October previous, relative to half-breed matters in the North-West. File No. 4145, respecting which, was transferred to your Department recently, together with other files of this Department on similar matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. VANKOUGHNET.\n\nA. M. BURNESS, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, INDIAN BRANCH,\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1874.\n\nSIR,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 1st October last, giving certain explanations in relation to the half-breed population of Lake Qu'Appelle, and asking, on their part, that the Government of the Dominion should leave to the half-breeds their lands as they took them, that is to say, that they be not held strictly to the lines.\n\nI shall make it my duty to submit your letter for the consideration of the Minister of the Interior on his return to Ottawa.\n\nI have the honor to be, Rev. Father, your obedient servant,\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nRev. Father Decorby, Lake Qu'Appelle, N.W.T.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nLAG QU'APPELLE, 1st October, 1884.\n\nSIR,\u2014As the Government has entrusted the affairs of the North-West to you, I take the liberty of addressing you some explanations regarding the Lakes Qu'Appelle and the half-breed population established there.\n\nThe spirit of justice which animates you, and the desire you have manifested to us, to work for the good of those whose interests are confided to you, make me hope that you will deign to take them into consideration, and bring them to the knowledge of the Government, in order that they may treat the half-breeds of Lake Qu'Appelle with justice and generosity, according to the kind words of His Excellency our Governor, Alexander Morris.\n\nI may remark, at once, that the half-breeds have a right to some privileges in this place. It was they who made a kind of conquest of it, by obliging the Indian nations who formerly warred there to retire. It is they who still keep them off, and it is to their presence that is due the honor of peace, and the security which is enjoyed all around.\n\nI cannot state the exact period when the half-breeds began to winter at the Lakes Qu'Appelle, but having explained to His Lordship the Bishop of St. Boniface the wish to have a Catholic priest among them, My Lord Tach\u00e9, now Archbishop of St. Boniface, went there himself, in 1865, chose the present site of the mission, gave orders for the erection of a chapel, and took for the requirements of the mission all the points comprised between the two streams, called the Mission Streams, that is to say, of the extent of about a mile of front.\n\nThe half-breeds then established there promised to respect the land reserved by His Lordship. The Hudson Bay Company, and the Indians of some importance, to my knowledge at least, did not advance any claim to it.\n\nA good part of the space reserved is dirty, marshy land, and quite unfit for cultivation. Of the remainder, we must make three parts: the first part must be left for the use of voyagers, as many Indians as half-breeds, who would come to the mission either for instruction or to perform their religious duties; the second part must be devoted to the establishments of the mission, church, presbytery, schools,\n&c.; the third part, that which is on the eastern stream, must serve for the formation of a farm, which will certainly soon be indispensable to the existence of the mission. Also, in the whole reserve there is little but what is necessary to the wants and the objects of the mission.\n\nAssured of the definite establishment of the mission, the half-breeds also began to take lands. Each cut his piece after his own fashion. This one took a little point. That one a stream, where there was a little wood and good lands; another marked for himself a good length on the little piece of woods which covers the southern declivity of the valley.\n\nNow, the half-breeds desire and ask the Government to leave their lands as they took them; that is, that they will not force them to exact lines. This may appear exorbitant to those who have no knowledge of the place, but to those who have seen it there is nothing but what is reasonable. Good land is scarce\u2014wood still rarer\u2014particularly serviceable wood. Consequently, if they draw lines the same as has been done in other places, it will happen that the lines, which will certainly not bend according to the caprices of the streams, nor to the shape of the points, will cut off, or take from them, the little good land or wood of any value which made them choose the place, and which are indispensable for their maintenance. They will thus have to establish themselves in other places, because the lines will not leave them enough to live upon.\n\nFurthermore in granting this the Government need have no fear of giving too much to the half-breeds, or of interfering with the vast plans they may have formed regarding the North-West Territory. In my humble observation, some acres of land in Manitoba would be very preferable to many thousands here.\n\nThere will never be a great flow of emigration to the Lakes Qu'Appelle. And I am also persuaded, on account of the few resources there are in wood, hay, &c., that it is only by keeping at distances from each other that the persons now established there will be able to maintain themselves.\n\nIn closing these explanations, perhaps a little too long, permit me, Sir, to thank you for your kind visit, and to subscribe myself, with sentiments of the deepest gratitude,\n\nYour very humble and obedient servant,\n\nDECORBY, P., O.M.I.,\nMissionary, Lake Qu'Appelle.\n\nHon. Mr. Laird, Minister of the Interior.\n\nGovernment House, Fort Garry, Manitoba, 17th October, 1874.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose you a copy of an address from the M\u00e9tis of Lakes Qu'Appelle, which was presented to me on the 13th September last by the Hon. Pascal Breland. I also enclose copy of my reply thereto, bearing date 16th September.\n\nFor convenience, I also enclose translations from the French of the address and reply.\n\nBefore replying, I had the opportunity of consulting with the Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe requests of the M\u00e9tis with regard to the lands occupied by them, and as to the Catholic mission, who have a church and residence there, seemed reasonable, and I felt at liberty to reply in a manner to relieve their minds of anxiety as to their holdings, having been authorized, by a despatch from the Minister of the Interior, to communicate similar information to Bishop Grandin, with regard to the M\u00e9tis in the Saskatchewan district. I trust that the tenor of my reply with regard to this and other questions, treated of in the address in question, will receive approval.\n\nI was gratified to receive from the M\u00e9tis their assurances of respect, and, as they themselves phrased it, \"of their perfect submission to the Government,\" as at one period a feeling of uneasiness and dissatisfaction prevailed amongst the M\u00e9tis of the region in question, but which, I believe, is now happily allayed.\nI would suggest that steps should be taken to secure the laying off of the Indian reserves early next season; so as to open the land for occupation in the vicinity of Qu'Appelle settlement.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nALEXANDER MORRIS, Lieutenant-Governor N.W.T.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nLAKE QU'APPELLE, 11th September, 1874.\n\nYOUR EXCELLENCY,\u2014The half-breeds of the Lakes Qu'Appelle and environs offer you today their homage, and submit to you the following petitions, which they present in their name and in the name of all their brethren scattered over the prairies, and beseech you to give them a favorable hearing, and to remember them in the various arrangements that the Government may make with the Indians.\n\nThey ask you,\u2014\n1st. That the Government allow to the half-breeds the right of keeping the lands which they have taken or which they may take along the River Qu'Appelle.\nThe right of fishing in all the lakes of the above mentioned river.\nThe right of hunting freely in the prairies west and south-west of the Lakes Qu'Appelle, without being arbitrarily hindered by the Indians, but only in virtue of the regulations that the Indians in concert with the half-breeds and the Government shall establish hereafter for the good of all.\nThe right of trading at the lakes and environs of the Lakes Qu'Appelle.\nThey ask,\u2014\n2nd. That the Roman Catholic mission may have the free and tranquil enjoyment of its possessions and participate in all the privileges and rights of the half-breeds.\nThey ask,\u2014\n3. That the Government, in concert with the Indians and the half-breeds, do make, with regard to winter quarters and buffalo hunting, laws which will be of great use to all, such as to prevent wintering too far out in the prairies and to compel every one to start together for the chase, &c., &c.\n\nMoreover, that the Government establish an authority composed of persons who have the confidence of the people of the place, and charged to manage the affairs of the country, make its laws, see that they are put in force and judge differences.\n\nIn all these demands the half-breeds have no intention of depriving the Indians of their rights, but merely claim the recognition and respect of their own, and are disposed to live with the Indians as with brothers and with friends.\n\nHoping that these demands will be favorably received, they beg Your Excellency to accept the assurance of their profound respect for you and of their perfect submission to your Government.\n\nThe half-breeds of Lake Qu'Appelle:\u2014\n\nAugustin Bralant, John Fisher,\nBaptiste Davis, Alex. Fisher,\nMechat Deparlaix, Alex.

The same remark applies to the possessors of the Roman Catholic mission, and I think that the zeal of these devoted men, who follow the half-breeds and Indians in the vast lands of our North-West, should be recognized, by giving them a certain portion of land, suitable for their object.\n\nWith regard to the lands which the half-breeds wish to take in future, I would remark that as we have just made a treaty with the Indians, it will be necessary to make the reserve for them, as soon as possible, with the view of leaving the other lands open, to be taken up by settlers.\n\nWith regard to the chase, you have the same rights that the other subjects of the Queen have, and I shall be happy to put before the North-West Council, charged, as that Council is, with the government of these territories, your views on the chase, so as to see if it be necessary to make some good laws and provision for the regulation of buffalo hunting. This subject is of great importance to the half-breeds, the Indians and the whole country, and I believe that the North-West Council will be ready to give the matter the most serious consideration.\n\nIt is the wish of the Government to establish its authority everywhere in these vast territories of the Queen, and I would be glad if the Council and Government in Ottawa are able to find competent persons, having your confidence, and capable of executing the laws that the Parliament of Ottawa have a right to make from time to time, or those that the North-West Council in the exercise of their powers as a Local Legislature may enact, but I do not think that the Privy Council will be willing to give the power of making laws to such small communities as the half-breeds and others in these remote territories.\n\nI am very glad to know your disposition towards the Indians, and I hope that the treaty which the Queen's commissioners have just had the good fortune to make with them will greatly tend to propagate a spirit of contentment amongst the half-breeds and Indians.\n\nWith the best disposition towards you, and wishing you all prosperity,\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nAlexander Morris, Lieutenant-Governor, N.W.T.\n\nFort Qu'Appelle, 16th September, 1874.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 7th December, 1876.\n\nMemorandum.\u2014The undersigned has the honor to report that he finds that by an Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1873, the sum of $300 per annum was appropriated in the aid of the Indian school at St. Albert, in the Saskatchewan district, and that by the same Order in Council a similar amount was promised in aid of another school in the same district, to be hereafter designated by the Roman Catholic Bishop of the diocese of the Saskatchewan, such aid to be given on the understanding that an average of sixty scholars (subsequently reduced by Order in Council of the 3rd of April, 1874, to twenty-five) was in attendance.\nBy his letter of the 7th of January, received in March last, the Bishop reports that the average attendance at the St. Albert school is upwards of sixty, and he applies, in the same letter, for similar aid to the two schools at Lac la Biche and Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, both on the Athabasca River, in the diocese of the Saskatchewan. The Bishop states that the average attendance of scholars of the two latter schools was between twenty-five and thirty.\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to recommend that in accordance with the promise made by the Order in Council above referred to, the sum of $300 be paid to the Bishop of the Saskatchewan for the school at St. Albert, for the current year, and that a further sum of $300 be placed at the disposal of the Bishop for school purposes in his diocese, to be given either to the school at Lac la Biche or to that at Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, or to be divided between them as he may think proper.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDAVID MILLS, Minister of the Interior.\n\nHon. the Privy Council.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 28th August, 1876.\n\nSir,\u2014Permit us to inform you that His Lordship Bishop Grandin, of St. Albert, on the Saskatchewan, received your letter dated 31st July, 1875, wherein you reply to his of the 3rd April, in the same year.\n\nAs Vicar-General and attorney of that Bishop, in his absence, and by his order, we take the liberty of informing you that His Lordship received the cheque for $300, for the support of an Indian school at St. Albert; and in accordance with your suggestion, we hasten to say to you that four other localities, under the jurisdiction of the same Bishop, have schools in the same condition, and with the smallest possible means of support.\n\nThe missions where these schools exist are Lake la Biche, Lake St. Anne, Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, and St. Laurent of the Saskatchewan. We therefore ask for these schools the same assistance which has been accorded to that of St. Albert.\n\nWe would observe, from what you are good enough to say and explain to Bishop Grandin, that we have every reason to believe that your Government is willing to continue the grant to St. Albert school, and to commence at the above places.\n\nIn closing, we beg you to submit these lines to the Hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe have the honor, Sir, to submit ourselves,\n\nYour most humble and obedient servants,\n\nALBERT LACOMBE, Grand Vicar of the Diocese of St. Albert.\nH. LEDUC, Attorney of the Diocese.\n\n(Translation)\n\nSTE. MARIE DE WINNIPEG, MAN., 16th August, 1875.\n\nHon. Sir,\u2014In my capacity as Grand Vicar to His Lordship Vital Grandin, Bishop of St. Albert, in the North-West, and acting as his representative here, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter addressed to His Lordship, and of the cheque for $300 therein enclosed.\n\nAt the first favorable occasion I will transmit the said letter and the offering of your Government to their destination.\n\nI have the honor to subscribe myself your most obedient servant,\n\nALBERT LACOMBE, Priest, O. M. I.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nOTTAWA, 31st July, 1875.\n\nMy Lord,\u2014I have the honor, by the desire of the Superintendent-General, to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd of April last, calling his attention to the condition of the settlers in your diocese in the North-West.\n2. The Superintendent-General desires me to say that he has read with much interest your valuable communication which reached him some days ago.\n\n3. He wishes me to assure Your Lordship that he and his colleagues in the Government have the most earnest desire to promote the well-being of all the inhabitants of the North-West, whether Indians or half-breeds, and it will afford the Government sincere pleasure to co-operate, so far as is in its power, in your praiseworthy efforts to elevate their condition.\n\n4. The Superintendent-General is gratified to receive from Your Lordship the assurance of the great benefits to the cause of law and order in the territories which have already resulted from the action of the Government in sending the Mounted Police into the country. He regrets to learn, however, from your letter, that a large number of the M\u00e9tis had contemplated abandoning the Province and settling in the United States, but is gratified that through Your Lordship's judicious intervention they were induced to remain in Canada.\n\nThe Superintendent-General is surprised and grieved at the statement in your letter that the M\u00e9tis in your diocese regard the Dominion Government with feelings of uneasiness and distrust, and point to the occurrences in connection with the troubles of Red River as an evidence of the want of friendly feeling of the Government towards them.\n\n6. The Superintendent-General thinks that a calm review of all the facts connected with those unhappy occurrences ought to convince any candid and thoughtful person that the Government has acted throughout towards the M\u00e9tis who were compromised therein in a spirit of kindness, and Your Lordship can assure the settlers in your diocese who continue peaceable and law-abiding that the Government will be prepared to deal with them in a spirit of generous consideration.\n\nThe Superintendent General hopes; therefore, that Your Lordship will be able to dispel the minds of the M\u00e9tis of the Saskatchewan of the erroneous impressions they would seem to labor under with regard to the feelings entertained towards them by the Dominion Government.\n\n7. The Superintendent-General has read with especial interest your remarks upon the subject of schools for the Indians and M\u00e9tis, believing as he does that it is to the education of the rising generation of Indians we must look for any permanent elevation of the red man.\n\n8. I shall now proceed to notice, seriatim, the several heads under which you ask the Government to aid the settlers in the North-West. You ask for:\n\n1. Encouragement for the settlers in agriculture.\n2. Aid for hospitals.\n3. Aid for schools.\n4. Aid for orphan asylums.\n5. Concessions of land for orphan asylums and model farms.\n6. Reserves of land for the children and aid to help them in farming, and\n7. And lastly\u2014reserves for the Indians of arable land, situated near fishing lakes.\n\nAs to the first, namely, the encouragement of agriculture among the settlers, the Superintendent-General cannot but congratulate Your Lordship upon the efforts made by the mission, especially by the establishment of mills to enable the settlers to utilize the grain raised in your diocese.\n\nThe Superintendent wishes to remind you that this is a subject which will properly come within the province of the Local Government, soon to be inaugurated in the North-West. He thinks, however, that it is obvious that the measures now being taken by the Dominion Government to carry a railroad and telegraph line through the territories must have the effect of opening up the country and of facilitating transport through it, and in this way cannot fail to give an impetus to the agricultural interest of the territory.\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th heads referred to by you are all matters which come specially within the Province of the Local Legislature.\nWith regard to the third head, however, I may remark that the Dominion Lands Act makes provision by a liberal land grant to aid general educational purposes in the territories, and so far as the Indians are concerned the Dominion Government will, no doubt, be prepared when the territory is surrendered, to make the same provisions there as elsewhere, by treaty for Indian schools. In the meantime, I am directed by the Minister to transmit to Your Lordship an official cheque for the sum of $300, in aid of the school at St. Alberts, authorized by Order in Council of the 22nd October, 1873, as it is assumed from Your Lordship's report that the average attendance of Indian children at this school is not less than the number required by the Order in Council, namely 25.\n\nAny one of the other schools which Your Lordship may think proper to select will be entitled to a similar rate for the current year, provided, of course, the average attendance of Indian children throughout the year is not less than 25.\n\nAs to the fifth head, namely, concessions of land for orphan asylums and model farms, the Superintendent-General is not prepared at present to make any definite pledge on behalf of the Government. On this point the Superintendent-General will be able to speak more definitely after a treaty has been made and when the question of the extent of land asked for, for the purposes above mentioned, is more accurately known.\n\nThe sixth head refers to a large question of public policy, on which it would manifestly be premature at present to pronounce an opinion. The settlers in the North-West have good grounds for believing that the Dominion Government will deal liberally with them. There is a sufficiency of land in the territories for all of them and their children, and it is earnestly to be hoped that they will cultivate as much of it as possible and secure for themselves comfortable homes in the country to which they belong.\n\nAs regards the seventh head, namely, the reserves for the Indians: This matter has hitherto been fully provided for and all treaties made with the Indians by which assistance in money and agricultural implements has always been secured to them, and there can be no reason to doubt that these matters will be dealt with in a similar spirit of liberality in future treaties.\n\nThe reservation secured to the Indians will no doubt have a fair proportion of arable land, and will include, when it is practicable, any fishing lakes which the Indians may desire to avail themselves of.\n\nIn this connection Your Lordship will bear in mind that in all cases Indian reserves are selected after conference with the tribes interested, and in this way every reasonable precaution to guard the interest and meet the wishes of the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be, Your Lordship, &c.,\n\nDAVID LAIRD.\n\n(Translation).\n\nBISHOPRIC OF ST. ALBERT, 7th January, 1876.\n\nSir,\u2014It was not till the 14th of November last that I was enabled to get the letter you had the goodness to send me from Ottawa on the 31st of July previous.\n\nBefore everything else, permit me, through your intervention, to testify my lively gratitude to His Honor the Minister of the Interior for the $300 he was good enough to cause to be sent me, to assist in maintaining my school at St. Albert.\n\nThe average number of children attending that school is not 25 only, as is supposed, but rather 60 and often 70 children. Besides the school at St. Albert, I have in my diocese two other establishments of Sisters of Charity, one at Ile \u00e0 la Crosse and the other at Lac la Biche. These two schools are frequented by at least 25 to 30 children, and to the present time, although they, as well as the St. Albert school, have existed for at least ten years, I have not been able to obtain help to assist me in supporting them. I trust, Sir, you will have the kindness to obtain for those schools the same aid the Government has been good enough to grant that of St. Albert. I do not now ask anything for my schools at Lac St. Ann, Caribou and St. Laurent, not being certain that they combine the requisite number of children.\nHaving passed all last summer with the Indian tribes in the north-east of my diocese, and having, since my arrival, about four months ago, been all the time ill, I have not had much direct communication with our M\u00e9tis. As far as I can perceive, the uneasiness and distrust which prevailed last year has quite disappeared.\n\nThey now speak only of the Governor who is to be given to us. Everyone is desirous of knowing who he will be, and all are astonished and complain that he is going, they say, to fix his residence at Fort Pelly.\n\nI spoke to His Honor last year of families who wished to locate themselves in the territory of the United States.\n\nIf there are any going there, they are very few in number. I have actually, not long since\u2014received a letter from the chief of that party, asking for a priest no longer to go with him and his to the United States, but to Lac du Boeuf, where he is living with all his married children. They have now a priest residing among them.\n\nThis is all the information I can now give about our people. Furthermore, since the police have been with us the colonel and captain can give good accounts of our country and people.\n\nWe have the honor, Sir, to be your obedient servant,\n\n\u2020 VITAL J., Bishop of St. Albert, O.M.I.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nBISHOPRIC, ST. ALBERT, 5th April, 1875.\n\nSir,\u2014You will perhaps be surprised that, without the advantage of knowing you, or of being known by you, I venture to address your honor personally.\n\nI would not have ventured on this boldness if the worthy Col. Jarvis had not apprised me of your indulgence, and great desire to render any service.\n\nAssured by your goodness, I will write to you at length, hoping you will have the patience to read and take into consideration what I shall tell you. The little news we receive from Manitoba had made us suppose that the Government at Ottawa was a good deal occupied about our country. However, until the arrival of the troops, we had not received the slightest mark of interest from that Government. The Government rendered a real service to the country in sending us the soldiers, who have, at last, stopped the infamous traffic in intoxicating drink. They will also make certain malefactors understand that they can no longer commit theft and rapine with impunity. But I venture to hope that the civilizing influence of Government will not stop there, or in many ameliorations.\n\nWe would make our country a real Canada, and for that reason we desire all civilized and civilizing people to come to inhabit it. Permit me, Sir, to tell you frankly that it appears to me, while encouraging emigration into the North-West Territories, the Government should consider the benefit of the present inhabitants of the North-West. Apart from the sending of the soldiers, nothing has been done, at least of which we are aware; and this single benefit is far from being known and appreciated by all. The prosecution of certain M\u00e9tis compromised at the time of the change of Government, at Red River, and particularly the condemnation of Lepine, have caused much uneasiness among the people of this country. Of 700 M\u00e9tis established at St. Albert, at least 300 have gone, with many others, to reside at different places on the River Lac du Boeuf. Lately a number of them have come to see me. Before giving them time to speak to me, I reproached them for having left St. Albert, assuring them that before long the country would become prosperous.\n\n\"My Lord,\" they replied, \"we know too well that we have nothing to hope from the Canadian Government, except ill-will and contempt. The facts which have occurred, and are still taking place, at Red River are proof of it. Rather than be ill treated (brow beaten) like our parents, we have decided to locate ourselves in the territories of the United States. With that object, we have chosen an excellent place, where we shall soon fix ourselves, if you will allow us a priest.\" My positive refusal will arrest their project. Not returning to St. Albert, they will go to the limit of English territory, to be ready to pass over to our neighbors when they think\nthe time has come. It appears to me then that in the interest of the country the Government should, without neglecting the encouragement of emigration, occupy itself in retaining the inhabitants who are now here. \"But,\" they will say, \"the M\u00e9tis are good for nothing\u2014a people idle and without economy!\" If they were a hundredfold worse, if you will, those who have such advantages over them should not forget that the M\u00e9tis are generally descended from the servants of the Hudson Bay Company. That these servants, almost exclusively engaged in voyaging, did nothing, or nearly nothing, during their long winters; and could not consequently give their children a liking for work\u2014not seeing its utility. Who was there to teach them notions of order and economy? The mothers had not the faintest idea. Besides, receiving each day the food necessary for the whole family, what was the good of managing? The company alone profits; and the company is rich, says a proverb well known in the country. If they left the service, the buffaloes, then very numerous, supplied them with abundance of food, with little labor. The surplus of provisions and the furs and skins, also very abundant, procured them the necessary clothing. But they do not even manage their money. How can they? Many of them never saw money, and have not the least idea of its value. Why deprive themselves of anything during the year? The only advantage they will acquire will be to learn, on the return of the courier (postman), that the books of York Factory contain so many louis to their credit.\n\nOthers, who have spent all their wages in fine clothes for themselves and their families, have a pile of pleasant and useful little things. In this they behold a fortune; money nor an account book is of any consideration.\n\nI ask Your Honor's pardon for such details; but I do not consider them altogether useless. Whatever draws attention to the chain of circumstances in which the M\u00e9tis are born is important, and which being multiplied, cannot but excuse them for faults with which they are reproached, nor be surprised that they are even as they are.\n\nI could cite more than one tourist, who by their writings have contributed to make them be regarded in Canada and other places as barbarous and savage people, incapable of culture or civilization, and who have left among the M\u00e9tis and the Indians themselves a very sad idea of the morality of civilized people.\n\nNo, Sir; the M\u00e9tis are not such as they would wish to make them appear\u2014a barbarous people, incapable of culture. I think, on the contrary, that they merit all the sympathy of a good Government. Let it give them some encouragement and it will see if there is nothing to hope from them.\n\nLately, from possessing a mill which I had erected at Lac St. Anne, I strongly urged the farmers to cultivate well. \"Assuredly!\" they replied: \"Your mill will be a great encouragement to us; we shall not now be reduced to eating our barley and wheat in soup.\" However, it is not so easy to cultivate as you appear to think; how shall we procure the necessary implements? It is needful to be rich here to get a plough. With what difficulty we get a hoe; and how many among us can have any when we want them?\n\nIn fact, the difficulty is serious; transport is so expensive that they cannot, except at great cost, procure the most indispensable articles of living. I know some families who each year plant a field of potatoes of a certain extent. It is a fortune to possess a hoe, the greater part of the work being done with sticks, fire-hardened, and yet they are not disheartened. To cultivate under such difficulties, in spite of very little success, evidently denotes a people who are not entirely wanting in energy.\n\nI therefore venture, Sir, to pray you to take in hand the cause of these poor M\u00e9tis, and that the Government will be good enough to do something to encourage farming among them, at least to those who exhibit such a willingness.\n\nEverything is scarce and so difficult to get in this country that not only the M\u00e9tis but strangers themselves can only vegetate. What, in fact, can a poor immigrant do, who arrives here nearly at the end of his finances? He must pay $20 for a bag of flour, $1 for a pound of tea, as much for a pound of tobacco, half a dollar for some needles and hooks, and everything in proportion.\nWe have boasted of our territory being called the garden of the north and the fertile belt. This does not prevent those who inhabit it from suffering, and those who will come from suffering still more.\n\nTo encourage agriculture it is not only necessary to procure farming implements at a low rate, but, as soon as possible, to have easy ways of transport for the actual necessaries of life.\n\nThere is another important amelioration to be made as soon as possible for the inhabitants of the country, and particularly for strangers and travellers\u2014it is some help, at least, for the foundation of an hospital. The M\u00e9tis, poor as they are, have generally a house, or that of their parents, but strangers, who fall sick, are absolutely devoid of help, and often die from misery and want of care.\n\nOur Sisters of Charity perform impossibilities in receiving and nursing the sick of this class, but their house is overcrowded with children, and they cannot open it for the sick. That of the missionaries, which we called the Bishop's Palace, is not more disposable for a similar purpose. However, we often receive them; and even now I am writing these lines by the side of a poor soldier, the victim of an accident. To receive them we have to inconvenience ourselves a good deal; and it is not well the Sisters are obliged to come many times a day to care for them\u2014and if another sick person should present himself, we would be unable to receive him. They talk of crossing our country with a railroad. That would be an appreciable benefit, much desired by everyone; but how many of the operatives will be victims of accidents during those works, and to how many will it not be painful to be unable to offer an asylum where they can be received and receive intelligent care? Our worthy religious orders are well disposed to make personal sacrifices; but they will necessarily require the means wherewith to exercise their zeal, that is to say, a hospital either at St. Albert or near the Government fort. For such an establishment there are absolutely no funds.\n\nIn June, 1873, taking advantage of a trip to Europe, I passed through Ottawa, and had the honor of an interview with the Right Hon. John Macdonald and H. Langevin on the affairs of our country. In the month of September following I addressed a letter directly to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada. On my return from Europe I found a letter at St. Albert which His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba had caused to be written to me. According to that letter I had every reason to hope that my requests would be complied with. I attempted and caused steps to be taken; but I am again reduced to hope; and it is with the object of obtaining, through Your Honor, the realization of my hopes, that I address you this too long letter.\n\nTo advance the civilization of our population, all M\u00e9tis and Indian, everyone is aware that schools are of the last importance. I was convinced that under the Government of Canada the encouragement of schools would be one of its first boons; till now I have hoped in vain.\n\nI now maintain with difficulty five schools:\u20141st. That at St. Albert has an attendance of 70 to 80 children, of both sexes, of whom a score of M\u00e9tis and Indian orphans are wholly supported at the expense of the mission. Two of our ecclesiastics are exclusively engaged with these children, instructing them in French and English, and one P\u00e8re Oblat is charged with the surveillance of the little boys not in the classes.\n\n2nd. The school at \u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse, although frequented by only 30 or 40 children, requires the same number of employ\u00e9s. Of these 30 to 40 children, 12 or 15 orphans or Indians are at the sole charge of the mission.\n\n3rd. That at Lac la Biche, attended by 25 to 30 children, a Sister of Charity is alone in charge till now.\n\n4th. That at Lac St. Anne, attended by the same number of children, also directed by one person.\n\n5th. The school at Lac Caribou does not count more than 15 children, and is directed by a P\u00e8re Oblat.\nWe have a 6th school at St. Laurent de Carlton. It was attended by 25 to 30 children during the day, and 12 to 15 young people at night. The missionary had to keep this school himself, and had partly to give it up, not being able to attend to his occupations.\n\nYour Honor will comprehend that in a country like ours, where the religious men and women fail me, it is not easy for me to find anyone who will consent to keep school for the love of God alone.\n\nAlthough the Oblats and the Sisters of Charity, who assist me in doing good in my diocese with a truly admirable devotion, only ask for the price of their labor the same salary as the Bishop himself, namely, food and clothing, yet in regard to charity alone I am often embarrassed to meet the expenditure. The schools alone do not cost me less than $2,000 to $3,000 each year. If the Government had paid, as it had led me to expect, $300 for each school attended by 25 children, even supposing it could not have given me anything for that at Caribou, being attended by only 15 children, without doubt the one at St. Laurent de Carlton would not have succumbed, and perhaps I might soon be able to establish superior schools, which would soon become indispensable to the country. Besides the schools, we have also orphan asylums. I have the advantage of having three in my diocese, where 50 children have been brought up, both M\u00e9tis and Indian.\n\nThey speak of civilizing the Indians by making them cultivate. It may arise that the missionaries, by working with them, ploughing and making them plough their lands, may, in the course of time, reach some results, but they will be slow and inappreciable. Fifteen years' experience does not allow me to doubt that we can succeed in bringing up the little children. Many, doubtless, will not be able to receive a thorough education; but at least they can speak their Indian tongue, and getting accustomed to work, their savage life will be no longer possible. They can rank and mix with the M\u00e9tis, with whom we marry them without much difficulty, and they will end, I doubt not, in forming good families, who will have no traces of the Indian but the blood. If, then, instead of three asylums for orphans, I had a certain number wherein I could admit all the little Indians they would give me, we would advance civilization.\n\nEach child does not cost less than $100 per annum. Reduced, as we are, to acts of charity, I may say even to poverty, we can only, from the force of privation, do this work and sustain them in a small way. On this account we can only receive such children as would die without us\u2014like the case of a little Blackfoot living with his mother, who, in a crisis, died of hunger, and whom a starving Indian would have eaten. Often we have to take in children who can never leave our establishment, such as the blind, the deaf and dumb, the lame and idiots. Such children cost us more, as we can never get rid of them. I am certain, Sir, that you can obtain indespensable assistance for us, not only to support this work, but to enlarge and extend it; with assistance from Government we could establish model farms, and convert into good cultivators children who would otherwise remain savage, and whom famine and the abuses of civilization would soon carry off.\n\nReligion is not agitated here; we do not wish to make these children recluses or monks, but men of honor, who will be able to take part in society.\n\nIt is certain that such an enterprise can only be carried to a successful issue, and at the smallest cost, by religious bodies. I can rely on the devotion of the Oblats and the Sisters of Charity of the Grey Nuns of Montreal. If I could equally calculate on being recouped by the Government, I would proceed in advance.\n\nThese aids would be\u2014\n\n1st. Vast concessions of land for such establishments.\n2nd. Grants of money in proportion to the number of children brought up there.\n3rd. A law giving us paternal authority over these children till the age of 20 or 22 for boys, and 15 to 18 for girls.\n4th. I think there is something more required on the part of Government. We cannot portion these children when they grow up. After leaving our establishments they can do nothing but engage in the services of someone richer than themselves.\nIf, when we marry them, we could procure them a farm, and the beginning of some farm movables, there is no doubt they would succeed, and become good settlers.\n\nIt would be necessary to accord a certain reserve of land beside each orphan asylum, or model farm, exclusively for these children, till they established themselves. They could not, of course, enjoy those advantages without certain conditions; and, moreover, would not be at liberty to sell their farms, but only to leave them to their children. Those young married people, too, established beside the mission, could still be directed by it, and certainly they will require it. They will also have the advantage of the example of other settlers, and can, themselves, become an example to other children of the asylum, who, seeing the benefits accorded to their elders as a recompense for their assiduity, their economy and their good conduct; in a word, will, in their turn, be encouraged to act equally well. The better to succeed in our aim at civilization, it will be necessary to marry these children at least with M\u00e9tis. The dower which will be allowed them at the time of their marriage will be an efficacious means of making them desired and sought after by persons more advanced in civilization.\n\nBelieve me, Sir, that I do not make this request with the view of increasing our influence, but with the sole object of being useful to these poor people, and to enable them to enjoy the benefits of civilization.\n\nAs regards those who are Indians, if the Government will make reserves in their favor I venture to beg that Your Honor will ensure that these reserves be composed of cultivable lands, and situated near fishing lakes.\n\nIn this way, besides cultivation, which will not amount to much, they will have two other means of living: hunting and fishing.\n\nI ask pardon, Sir, for abusing your patience so long; but I still rest on what the brave Col. Jarvis told me of your indulgence.\n\nI have shown you my mode of procedure to elevate the position of the inhabitants of this country.\n\nMore than twenty years of experience among them makes me believe that my plans are not bad.\n\nI venture, then, Sir, to reiterate my requests; and to earnestly pray Your Honor to use all your influence to procure them for me.\n\n1st. Before all, I ask some encouragement for the settlers.\n\nThe Catholic missionaries have done almost impossible things in this direction. They have, at different places, three mills. For the third time we have tried to erect one in the colony of St. Albert\u2014behold more than \u00a3900 sterling, which we have sacrificed for it, and we are still uncertain whether we shall succeed. That the Government may on their part deign to do something to encourage agriculture.\n\n2nd. Aid for a hospital\u2014at least to construct it, and put it in a condition to receive the sick.\n\n3rd. Aid for schools\u2014the Government makes large outlay for education in all Canada; is our North-West to be alone withheld assistance? It cannot be said that we require help less than other parts of the country.\n\n4th. Aid for our orphan asylums, that we may increase these establishments, so as to be able to take in a greater number of little savages.\n\n5th. Concessions of land for each orphan asylum or model farm.\n\n6th. Reserves of land for the children thus brought up; and aid to help them on to a little farm, once they are married.\n\n7th. And lastly\u2014that the reserves to be made over to the Indians be of arable land, and situated near fishing lakes.\n\nI am really ashamed, Sir, of the length of my letter, which I have been obliged to write in haste, because I was sure of the opportunity which offered of its reaching you.\n\nI wrote the lines close and tried so to economize my paper as to conceal my prattling. I have only succeeded in making it the more apparent.\n\nYour Honor knows what babblers the Indians are. It is not surprising if I should resemble them, after living twenty one years amongst them. This letter, coming to\nyou, as it were, from a poor Indian, will, such as it is, be received and read by you indulgently. You will also, I am sure, take it into consideration and constitute yourself our advocate.\n\nReceive in advance the assurance of my consideration, and be good enough to believe me, Sir,\n\nYour Honor's humble and respectful servant,\n\n\u2020 VITAL J., Bishop of St.-Albert, O.M.I.\n\nTo His Hon. the Very Honorable D.

M.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE, WINNIPEG, 16th March, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to submit for your consideration the enclosed communication from Mr. Police Magistrate Ryan, not considering that the matter is one coming properly within the sphere of my official duty.\n\nWithout offering, therefore, a recommendation in the matter, permit me to remark that it seems to me to be no part of the duty of the Government to compel, so to speak, the half-breeds to prove their claims.\n\nA printed notice, in English and French, posted at the points usually frequented by them, to the effect that Mr. Ryan, at Swan River, and the agent of Dominion lands at Winnipeg, are still authorized to receive proof in the usual manner, ought, I submit, to be deemed a sufficient effort upon the part of the Government to secure to the half-breeds the benefits intended for them by law.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDONALD CODD, Agent of Dominion Lands.\n\nThe Surveyor-General, Dominion Lands, Ottawa.\nSwan River, 3rd March, 1877.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In the matter of my continuing the half-breed lands investigation, as the only official communication I hold on the subject is a telegram authorizing me to take the evidence of claimants who may come before me in the North-West Territory, would you kindly inform me, as soon as possible, whether it was the intention of the Department that I should put myself in communication with half-breed claimants by visiting the localities in which they reside, or that I should act in their behalf as they might casually come before me in the course of the discharge of my magisterial duties? If the latter were the intention, I fear that no early practical good can be effected. The greater number of the half-breeds of the different settlements can only be met at certain periods, before their departure to hunt, and after their return, and I am not aware at present at what period or periods I am likely to be engaged as a magistrate at these respective places. My apprehension is, that to trust to the coincidence of our thus meeting would be to defer the investigations indefinitely, and ultimately to cause many of the half-breeds and others in the territory the loss of the benefits intended for them by law. Would it not be well, therefore, for me to make special endeavors in their behalf during the coming seasons of spring and autumn? I can conveniently go to Lac Qu'Appelle in May, where, as I am advised by Mr. McLean, agent of the Hudson Bay Company, and by the Catholic Cur\u00e9, the bulk of the half-breeds can be met between the middle of that month and the 10th or 15th of the next. And later I may be able to visit the Scotch settlement of Prince Albert, and the French of St. Laurent, and so on. I am not informed, either, as to the matter of expenses, but presume they are to be paid under authority of the Department of the Interior. Would you please instruct me on this head, and generally on the subject of the latter, at your earliest convenience; and believe me to be.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMATTHEW RYAN.\n\nD.

S. DENNIS, Surveyor-General.\n\nMATTHEW RYAN, Stipendiary Magistrate, Swan River Barracks, N.W.T.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 26th March, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to inform you that the Superintendent-General has had before him your letter of the 12th ult., covering an extract of a letter from Mr. James Walker, inspector of the North-West Mounted Police at Battleford, respecting disputes arising out of land claims at St. Albert and St. Laurent, and submitting your views in reference to the prosecution of the special survey in the Saskatchewan during the coming season.\n\nThe Superintendent-General desires me to enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum from the Surveyor-General, on the matters submitted in your letter, and to state that the Superintendent-General approves of the suggestions contained in the 1st, 2nd and 4th paragraphs of the memorandum of the Surveyor General, and has given instructions that they should be carried out.\n\nIn reference to the 3rd paragraph of the memorandum, I am to inform you that the Superintendent-General is inclined to concur in the view of the matter taken by the Surveyor-General, and will consider the propriety of giving effect to the same by legislation next year.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor D. LAIRD, Indian Superintendent, Livingstone, N.W.T.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, DOMINION LANDS OFFICE,\nOTTAWA, 14th March, 1877.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014Referring to the despatch of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, dated the 12th ultimo, on the subject of surveys and\nsettlements on the Saskatchewan River, the undersigned has the honor to report as follows:\n\n1. The programme for the special survey party provides for the work being extended during the coming season, to intersect the Saskatchewan in the vicinity of the principal settlements on that river.\n\n2. It is proposed, in all cases where settlements have been formed along the rivers in the Territories, to adopt the surveys of the farms accordingly, that is to say, giving an average (where practicable) of 10 or 20 chains frontage on the river and letting the lots run back far enough to make 160 acres each, the lines between lots (as a rule) to be made to conform to the direction of the section lines in the regular survey adjoining.\n\n3. The question raised by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, as to the manner in which the claims of settlers may be adjusted who located upon lands in the North-West Territories previous to the transfer, involving, as it does, a question of policy, is for the Minister to consider. The undersigned would, however, in reference thereto, venture to express the opinion that land so settled on, without the same may possess exceptional value, owing to its situation, and had been taken up with a view to speculation, if the claimant shall have been constantly residing upon and cultivating it to a reasonable extent, should be granted free to the occupant. To give effect to such a policy, however, legislation would be required.\n\n4. It is hoped that the arrangements proposed by the Assistant Surveyor-General for determining the precise longitude of Battleford this year will enable him to effect that object, on which the plot of the proposed site of the capital may be projected and such portion thereof laid out during the coming year as the Minister may deem expedient.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Surveyor-General.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 12th March, 1877.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The accompanying despatch of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, transmitting extract of letter from Mr. Inspector Walker, M. P. F., respecting disputes as to land claims at Prince Albert and St. Laurent, is submitted for the report of the Surveyor-General.\n\nBy order.\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe Surveyor General.\n\nSwan River, North-West Territories, 12th February, 1877.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to transmit herewith extract of a letter from Mr. James Walker, Inspector of the North-West Mounted Police at Battleford, respecting disputes arising out of land claims at Prince Albert and St. Laurent.\n\nThe subject is one materially affecting the prosperity of these and other settlements in the Territories. I should hope, therefore that the labors of the Special Survey Party will be continued in the ensuing summer, and that points may be fixed which will enable the surveys to be prosecuted along the Saskatchewan where settlements exist or may soon be formed.\n\nIt appears to me that where there are settlements along the river, a system of survey similar to that adopted on the Red and Assiniboine rivers will have to be conceded. Settlers should be allowed their frontage on the river, the lines running back so as to give them an average of 160 acres each.\n\nThere is another question which will doubtless present itself. Should settlers who have located before the transfer be obliged to enter their lands under the homestead provision of the Dominion Lands Act, and consequently be required to wait three years after the survey before they receive their patents such a requirement would seem to be harsh to those who have been many years in the country.\nI need scarcely remind you, also, in connection with the surveys, that unless Battleford town plot is laid off next spring, the delay will seriously retard the growth of the intended capital of the Territories.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nD. LAIRD.\n\nThe Honorable the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\n(Extract.)\n\n\"CARLTON HOUSE, 29th December, 1876.\n\n\"SIR,\u2014I have the honor to report for your information that I have been called upon several times this winter by settlers from Prince Albert mission, in reference to disputes they have with their neighbors concerning cutting wood on each other's claims and encroaching on each other's lands, but as no survey has yet been made of the disputed lands, it is impossible for me to give any satisfactory answer as to how these disputes are to be settled, or when a survey will be made. I beg leave to recommend most strongly that a survey be made of this and the St. Laurent settlement, which is in a like position, at as early a date as possible, as it will save many disputes and much ill-feeling in the future. Prince Albert settlement has at present about one hundred and fifty families, and is being largely increased every year by settlers from Manitoba and the older Provinces.\n\n\"I have the honor to be, &c.,\n\n\"JAMES WALKER, Inspector E, Division, N.W.M.P.\n\n\"To His Excellency Hon. David Laird,\n\n\"Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories, Swan River.\"\n\nOTTAWA, 27th December, 1877.\n\n\"SIR,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 71, of the 19th ultimo, covering a petition presented to you at the Blackfoot Crossing of the Bow River on the 22nd September last, by certain half-breeds of the south-western portion of the North-West Territories, praying, for the reasons set forth in the petition, that assistance be given them in agricultural implements and seed, and also transmitting a copy of your reply.\n\nYour despatch with its enclosures will be brought under the notice of the Minister of the Interior on his return to the seat of Government.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.

Their case is deserving of favorable consideration, insomuch as though they have a large admixture of Indian blood, and have been living, in a great measure, like Indians, yet they have not been admitted into the Indian treaties. I, at least, deem it my duty to bring their petition under the notice of the Hon. the Privy Council, as it\nappears to me that if any help is afforded them it can only come through the Dominion Parliament.\n\nI likewise transmit a copy of my reply to the said petition.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nBLACKFOOT CROSSING, 19th September, 1877.\n\nHONORABLE SIR,\u2014It is with sentiments of intermingled hope and fear that we, the undersigned, your petitioners, approach you today. It is to claim your kind sympathy and help in our present deplorable circumstances that we undertake to present you this paper, and to that end we will briefly state our reasons, to which we humbly pray Your Excellency would give the kindest consideration. Before the year of the small-pox, 1870, memorable for its disastrous effects on the native population of this country, we, your petitioners, although not rich, were, however, in comfortable circumstances. We had small homes of our own near Edmonton, and cultivated the soil more or less. Hunting was plentiful, and we were encouraged by the Hudson Bay Company to follow it as much as possible, because their only interest in the country was the fur trade. They were the only merchants amongst us, and this unique interest prevented them from giving any encouragement to the husbandman, and consequently from bringing farming implements for sale, except very few, which were sold at such an enormous price that the poor man could not think of buying them. Thus, Hon. Sir, the only encouragement to farming was given by the ministers of the different denominations in our country, and their means also were limited. It was by their advice and assistance that we took to farming as much as our poverty would allow us. Our little gardens, our few cattle and the produce of our hunt supplied us with plenty, and we were happy. But the year 1870 came, that year so terrible to remember, in which the dire malady decimated the whole population, and following in its wake was famine. This combination of evils ruined us, driving us from our homes and compelling us to lead an entirely nomadic life, as the Indians on the plains. Since that time we have had nothing to depend upon but our guns. The game we kill feeds ourselves and our families, and the furs we gather are our only money wherewith to buy clothing, and God knows we do not see how we are to rise above our present condition. It is on this account, Hon. Sir, that we now appeal to the charity you bear towards all your subjects. We hail your arrival as the opening of a new and better era for us all. We humbly approach you today and beg you to help us. The help we implore is farming implements and seed to begin with. We want to settle and till the land, but we have no capital\u2014nothing at all to start with. Also, Hon. Sir, we beg that the game laws be not too stringent, until such time as we have something else to subsist on; otherwise we shall be unable to live.\n\nWill Your Excellency give these things the kindest consideration?\n\nIn conclusion, Hon. Sir, we, the half-breeds, your petitioners, welcome you to this country and wish you many years of happiness and prosperity, whilst we sign ourselves the devoted and humble subjects of Her Majesty the Queen and the most obedient servants of her delegate.\n\nJohn Munro,\nFrancis Munro,\nBaptiste Anas, sen.,\nIsaac Dangon,\nFran\u00e7ois Deschamps,\nBaptiste Deschamps,\nNarcisse Cardinal,\nRichard Collin,\nHenry Collin,\n\nJean Baptiste Dumont,\nPaul Fayant,\nFran\u00e7ois Larocque,\nBaptiste Deschamps, sen.,\nWilliam Champion,\nJames Ward,\nBasile Favel,\nFrancis Vandal,\nAntoine Godin;\nMichel Grey,  \nMagloire Grey,  \nAlexis Bellecourt,  \nBasile Lawrence,  \nJohnny Lawrence,  \nJoseph L'Hyrondele,  \nFrancis Semyre,  \nPierre Boucher,  \nJoseph Bellecourt,  \nLouison Boucher,  \nJules Boucher,  \nBaptiste Anas, jun.,  \nLouis Rouselle,  \nRoger Paul,  \nAlexis Bruno,  \nThomas Cameron,  \nPierre Nadon,  \nAlexandre Petitcouteau,  \nJoseph Deschamps,  \nJohnny Deschamps,  \nLouis Rouselle,  \nJoseph Allard,  \nAugustin Goin,  \nEdward Boucher,  \nDaniel Dagnon.\n\nHon.

John Munro, Fran\u00e7ois Munro, Baptiste Anas, sen., and other Half-breeds in the Western portion of the North-West Territories.\n\nGentlemen,\u2014I am much pleased with the respectful tone of your petition, and cannot but feel that sympathy for you in your circumstances which you claim.\n\nDoubtless the small-pox visitation of 1870, to which you allude, tended to drive you from your homes, and to induce you to lead an entirely nomadic life, as the Indians on the plains. Several years, however, have elapsed since that calamity occurred, and it is to be regretted that ere the buffalo became so thinned in number by their promiscuous slaughter at all seasons, you had not endeavored to resume the cultivation of the soil.\n\nThe help for which you pray, to be assisted with implements and seed to begin farming, it is not in my power to promise. I shall, however, forward your petition to the Government at Ottawa, with a recommendation that it may receive the favorable consideration of His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nWith respect to the game law in force in the Territories, I may state, in reply to your request, that for the approaching winter, until its provisions become more generally known, it is not the intention of the authorities to be very stringent in enforcing its penalties.\n\nIt affords me much pleasure to learn that you desire to settle and cultivate the land. Such a course is the true one for you to pursue, and until the crops and stock you may be able to raise are sufficient for your support, the privilege of hunting buffalo three months every autumn will enable you to lay in a winter's stock of provisions.\n\nI can assure you that the Government feel a kindly interest in your welfare, and it is because they desire to see you enjoying the full franchise and property rights of British subjects, and not laboring under the Indian state of pupilage, that they have deemed it for the advantage of half-breeds themselves that they should not be admitted to the Indian treaties.\n\nIn conclusion, I tender you my sincere thanks for so kindly welcoming me to this country, and for wishing me many years of happiness and prosperity.\n\nI am, Gentlemen, yours respectfully,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\n\nBlackfoot Crossing of the Bow River, 22nd September, 1877.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 22nd February, 1878.\n\nMemorandum.\u2014Respectfully referred for the consideration and instruction of the Minister.\n\nJ.

It is therefore resolved that an humble petition be addressed to His Excellency the Governor General, praying that the two members of the Council remaining still to be appointed under the authority of the Act of 1875 and its amendments, be selected from the old residents of French origin, and in order to give full and entire justice to the nationality of your petitioners, that the nomination of a stipendiary magistrate, equally of French origin, be proceeded with.\n\nThat with a view to promoting the interests of education, by the establishment of schools in the principal centres of the Territories, a grant of five dollars ($5.00) per pupil be allowed, to the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00). This amount, added to the voluntary subscriptions, will permit, in more than one place, the erection and the opening of schools, the creation of which, without it, would be indefinitely retarded.\n\nThat all the heads of families of half-breeds and their children who have not participated in the distribution of scrips and lands in the Province of Manitoba be allowed such like scrips and grants of lands as were allowed in the said Province (at least that bush land be granted to them).\n\nThat it is of the greatest importance that the Government cause to be surveyed, with as little delay as possible, the lands occupied and cultivated by the half-breeds or old residents of the country, and that patents for the said lands be granted to them.\n\nThat the sudden transition from prairie to agricultural life, necessitated by the rapid disappearance of the buffalo, and the Orders in Council of the North-West Territories, as regards hunting, have brought your petitioners to their last resources, and compel them to address themselves to the Federal Government to obtain therefrom assistance in agricultural implements. Those instruments, excessively scarce, are only sold here at prices so exorbitant that your petitioners are for the most part unable to procure any.\n\nThat His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories be respectfully requested to submit the said petition to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, with such remarks as his good wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the country may dictate to him.\n\nAnd your petitioners will never cease to pray.\n\n(For signatures, see original.)\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 17th May, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 54, of the 10th ultimo, covering a petition from certain French Canadians and half-breeds near Edmonton, on the subject of various matters affecting their interests in the North-West, and am to state, for the information of the petitioners, that their petition will receive consideration in connection with the petition of the half-breeds of St. Laurent, transmitted with your despatch of the 13th February last, which is now before me.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID MILLS, Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.

T., 10th April, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to transmit to you, for the purpose of being laid before His Excellency the Governor General in Council, a petition of certain French Canadians and half-breeds of St. Albert, near Edmonton, in the North-West Territories, relating to matters which they desire to be brought under the attention of the Dominion Government.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to offer any remarks on this petition, the prayer of which is almost precisely in similar terms to the one covered by my despatch, No. 47, of the 13th February last.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor of the N. W. T.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOttawa, 13th May, 1878.\n\nReferred to Surveyor-General for brief report on paragraph 5 and 6 in the accompanying despatch of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories.\n\nBy order.\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe Surveyor-General.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The undersigned has the honor to state that the several subjects affecting Dominion lands, alluded to in the despatch of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, dated the 13th February last, it is intended shall be discussed between Mr. Lindsay Russell and the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territories, during Mr. Russell's visit to the Saskatchewan, in the course of the ensuing season, the result of which discussion will be fully reported by Mr. Russell, upon which such action may be taken in the way of legislation or otherwise as the Minister may deem most expedient to effect the settlement of the several questions alluded to.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Surveyor-General.\n\nOttawa, 18th March, 1878.\n\nSubmitted for the consideration of the Hon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nE. A. MEREDITH.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 18th March, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 47, of the 13th ultimo, covering a petition addressed to you by certain half-breeds of the parish of St. Laurent, relating to several matters affecting the interests of the half-breeds in the North-West.\n\n2. You are requested to inform the petitioners that I shall have much pleasure in submitting their petition for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\n3. In the meantime, you may intimate to the petitioners that should it be thought desirable to appoint additional members to the Council of the North-West, I shall be prepared to recommend to His Excellency's consideration their application that such members should be selected from the old residents in the Territories, and that if possible one of them should be of French Canadian origin.\n\n4. The propriety of passing an Act to secure for the half-breeds some more speedy means of acquiring a title for settlement purposes than under the provisions of the present Homestead and Dominion Lands Act, has for some time past engaged my attention.\n5. As regards the application of the petitioners for an early survey of the settled lands along the principal rivers, I have to request you to inform the petitioners that the surveys of such lands has already been carried out to some extent, and will be prosecuted as rapidly as the funds at the disposal of the Department will permit.\n\n6. The application of the petitioners to be aided by the Government with seeds and agricultural implements in their farming operations I confess I am not disposed to view favorably. I do not see upon what grounds the half-breeds can claim to be treated in this particular differently from the white settlers in the Territories.\n\n7. The half-breeds, who have, in some respects, the advantage over new settlers in the Territories, should be impressed with the necessity of settling down in fixed localities, and directing their energies towards pastoral or agricultural pursuits, in which case lands would no doubt be assigned to them in the same way as to white settlers. But beyond this, they must not look to the Government for any special assistance in their farming operation.\n\n8. The petitioners are in error in supposing that the Government has given seeds or farming implements to any other class of white settlers in the North-West. Money has been advanced in some cases to certain settlers, on the distinct understanding that it would be repaid to the Government by the parties to whom it was advanced. I may add that the result of this experiment has not been such as to induce the Government to repeat it.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID MILLS, Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the N. W. T., Battleford, N. W. T.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, BATTLEFORD, N. W. T., 13th February, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to transmit herewith a petition of certain half-breeds of St. Laurent, relating to several matters affecting their interests in this country.\n\nThough the petition is addressed to the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, yet as it refers to questions for the most part wholly under the control of the Dominion Parliament and Government, I am requested to forward it to His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nI hope you will have the goodness, at an early day, to lay it before His Excellency in Council.\n\nShould it be the intention of the Government to appoint any additional members to the Council of the North-West Territories, the prayer of the petitioners that such should be selected from the old residents of the country is well worthy of consideration.\n\nIt is important that the land policy of the Government towards old settlers and others living for many years in the Territories should be declared. It appears to me that they have a claim to some more speedy means of acquiring a title for settlement purposes than the homestead provisions of the Dominion Lands Acts.\n\nTo prevent disputes between neighbors, it is highly desirable that the survey of lands settled upon along the principal rivers should be prosecuted with all convenient speed.\n\nWith respect to the prayer for assistance in procuring seeds and implements to commence farming operations, it is similar to the request made to me by the half-breeds of Bow River during the Blackfeet treaty negotiations, and which I forwarded to you and commended to the favorable consideration of the Government.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient Servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\nTo His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories:\n\nThe humble Petition of the undersigned half-breeds of the parish of St. Laurent, in the North-West Territories, respectfully showeth:\u2014\n\nThat on the 1st February instant, in public meeting assembled, in the said Parish of St. Laurent, under the chairmanship of Mr. Gabriel Dumont, Mr. Alex. Fisher acting as secretary, the undersigned, your petitioners, resolved as follows:\u2014\n\nThat the population of the North-West Territories is for the greater part composed of French half-breeds, without any stipendiary magistrate understanding and speaking the language, and without any person of their race to represent them in the proceedings of the North-West Council; be it therefore resolved, that a petition be forwarded to His Excellency the Governor General, praying that the two members of the Council remaining to be appointed under the authority of the Act of 1875 and its amendments, be selected among the old residents of the country, and that at least one be a French half-breed, and that in order to render full and entire justice to the nationality of your petitioners, steps may, without further delay, be taken for the appointment of a person of French origin as a stipendiary magistrate;\n\nThat in order to promote the interests of education, by the establishment of schools in the leading centres of the Territories, a grant be made of $5 per child, up to the sum of $200; that sum added to the proceeds of voluntary subscriptions will enable schools to be built and opened up in many places where the opening of schools would otherwise be indefinitely delayed;\n\nThat there be granted to each half-breed head of a family, and to their children, who have not participated in the distribution of scrip and lands in the Province of Manitoba, a like amount of scrip and like land grants as in Manitoba;\n\nThat the sudden transition from prairie to agricultural life, necessitated by the rapid disappearance of the buffalo, and the ordinance respecting hunting, of the North-West Council, have brought your petitioners to their last resources, and force them to apply to the Federal Government for assistance in agricultural implements and seed grain, like assistance having been granted to certain foreign immigrants in the Province of Manitoba. Those instruments, besides being excessively scarce, are only sold here at prices so exorbitant that it is impossible for your petitioners to procure them; if, therefore, the Government were unable to grant this help, many of your petitioners, however willing they might be to devote themselves to farming, would be compelled to betake themselves to the prairies, at the risk of infringing the ordinance providing for the protection of the buffalo, however just it may be, since the time during which hunting is permitted is too short and the buffalo now too scarce to enable them to lay in a sufficient supply and provide for their own needs and those of their families during the rest of the year;\n\nThat His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor be respectfully requested to submit the said petition to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, with such remarks as his good wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the country may suggest to him.\n\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\n\nhis\n\nGABRIEL x DUMONT, Chairman.\n\nmark.\n\nALEX. FISHER, Secretary.\n\nST. LAURENT, 1st February, 1878.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, DOMINION LANDS OFFICE,\n\nOTTAWA, 23th February, 1878.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The within petition is respectfully referred for the information and instructions of the Minister.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Surveyor-General.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior.\nOTTAWA, 23rd February, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a petition numerously signed, addressed to His Excellency the Governor General, praying that the lands at and in the vicinity of Prince Albert settlement may be surveyed at an early day; also that provision may be made for an issue of scrip to the half breeds and old settlers in the Territories, similar to that made to these classes in Manitoba;\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Surveyor-General.\n\nCapt. Moore, Prince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nTo His Excellency the Governor General of the Dominion of Canada in Council Assembled:\n\nThe petition of the undersigned settlers and residents at Prince Albert settlement, in the North-West Territories of the Dominion of Canada, humbly represents:\n\n1. That the population of this settlement now numbers between one thousand and twelve hundred souls; that new settlers are constantly coming in, even during the winter season, and that a greatly increased immigration is certain to take place upon the opening up of navigation and other routes of travel in the spring.\n\n2. That the proceeds of the last harvest amount to over 30,000 bushels of grain; and that this yield will, with a usual season, be more than doubled next summer.\n\n3. That many disputes and disagreements are now arising among the settlers, concerning alleged encroachments upon each other's boundaries, which disputes are undoubtedly certain to increase in number and bitterness with the increase of settlement.\n\n4. That these difficulties are owing entirely to the absence of legally constituted boundaries and surveys, the want of which not only leaves the settler open to trespass, but also retards farmers from settling in desirable localities.\n\n5. That with a view to the foregoing facts, it is most desirable and indeed urgently necessary that surveys of this settlement and the neighboring localities be made at an early day.\n\nWherefore we humbly pray that Your Excellency will cause a sufficient sum of money to be set aside for that purpose, and that instructions may issue to competent persons to complete said surveys and establish our boundaries during the ensuing summer.\n\n6. Your petitioners, in conclusion, humbly represent that considerable portions of the lands at present occupied on the Saskatchewan River in this settlement were settled upon before the transfer of the North-West Territories to the Dominion of Canada, and in the manner customary at that period, viz: in a narrow frontage and a depth of two miles.\n\nThat the houses and other improvements of many of the settlers are situate upon these claims so taken.\n\nWherefore your petitioners humbly pray that Your Excellency will, when instructions are issued to the Dominion Surveyors, reserve the same rights and privileges to the aforesaid old settlers and pioneers of this settlement as were reserved to the old settlers in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nLastly, your petitioners would humbly represent that whereas a census of the half-breeds and old settlers was taken in the Province of Manitoba shortly after the organization of that Province, with a view to the distribution of scrip, &c., said scrip having since issued to the parties interested, and whereas, at the time this census was taken many half-breeds, both minors and heads of families, resided in the Territories and were not included in the said census.\n\nYour petitioners would humbly represent that their rights to a participation in the issue of half-breed or old settlers' scrip are as valid and binding as those of the half-breeds and old settlers of Manitoba, and are expected by them to be regarded by the Canadian Government as scrupulously as in that Province. And with a view\nto the adjustment of the same, your petitioners would humbly request that a census of said half-breeds and old settlers be taken, at as early a date as may conveniently be determined upon, with a view to apportioning to those of them who have not already been included in the census of Manitoba their just allotments of land and scrip.\n\nGeorge McKay,\nHarry C.

S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories,\nBattleford, N.W.T.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, BATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 30th September, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to transmit to you a petition numerously signed by half-breeds, usually resident in the neighborhood of Cypress Hills, praying that a reserve of land and other advantages may be granted to them, together with a resolution relative to said petition, passed by the Council of the North-West Territories at its legislative session which closed on the 2nd of August last.\n\nI feel it my duty to ask you to urge upon the Dominion Government the necessity of taking early action with respect to the claims set forth by the half-breeds of the Territories, either in the direction indicated by the resolution of the North-West Council or in such other manner as the Government may deem meet;\n\nThe half-breeds of Manitoba (the heads of families as well as the children) having received either scrip or land, I may remark that from what information is within my reach I have no doubt the half-breeds of the Territories, who think they have as good a claim to consideration as their compatriots in Manitoba, will be very much dissatisfied unless they are treated in a somewhat similar manner.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant Governor North-West Territories.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\nTo the President and the Honorable Members of the Privy Council of the North-West Territories:\n\nThe humble request of the undersigned, all half-breeds, living in the vicinity of Cypress Mountains, exposes very respectfully,\n\n1st. For a number of years we have always been in the habit of roaming over the prairies of the North-West for the purpose of hunting, above all other animals, the buffalo, thereby sustaining our families.\n\n2nd. That the hunting of buffalo is the only means of subsistence in this part of the Province.\n\n3rd. That before the arrival of the North-West Mounted Police, who came to put in force the laws and tranquillize the various Indian tribes; they had to defend themselves all alone against the continued attacks of the savages, and often had to spill their blood in procuring food for their children.\n\n4th. That the chase of the buffalo is to-day, for your petitioners, the sole and only means of subsistence, and their last resource in obtaining food for their wives and children.\n\n5th. That your petitioners have ever entertained a high respect for the civil and military authorities sent thither by the Government, and that they will always hold the same sentiments of submission to the laws, that it may please your excellent body to pass from time to time, with a view to the peace and prosperity of the Province.\n\n6th. That the majority of us, upon the cession of the Province to the Canadian Government, were temporarily absent, and were thereby deprived of the benefits of the scrip given to those half-breeds who were, at that time, present in the Province.\n\n7th. That last year your Council, having passed a certain regulation relative to the hunters in the North-West Territory.\n\n8th. That by this same regulation, the half-breeds are prevented from hunting from the 14th day of November in each year.\n\n9th. And also that the Indians are only restrained from the 15th day of February in each year, or three months later.\n\n10th. That the period of this prohibition is actually the very time when the animal produces the most benefit: in the first place, the meat of the cow being then only fit for food; secondly, the pelt being then in season to make the best robes, and the one commanding the highest price in the market.\n\n11th. That the half-breeds, by this law, are placed in a critical and embarrassing situation, as they find themselves deprived of their only possible means of supporting families.\n\n12th. That they see no reason why you will not accord to them at least the same privileges that are granted the Indians, regarding the chase.\n\n13th. That the greater part of us have, no more than the Indians, the ability to amass sufficient provision for five or six months in advance.\n\nFor these reasons, your petitioners ever humbly pray your Council to take into consideration the critical position in which they are placed by your Order of last year concerning the buffalo; and having judged of the rectitude of their intention, and of the delicate position in which so many families will be placed by the execution of this law, they ask you to amend the clause referred to above, granting them the same rights and privileges that are allowed the Indian, in regard to the hunting of buffalo in the North-West Territory.\n\n2nd. Considering the desire that your petitioners have of adopting a life more conformable to a true civilization.\n\nConsidering that, according to the actual habits and ordinary disposition of the half-breeds in general, it is impossible for them to form any congregation profitable to their families among the white emigrants who are establishing themselves in the North-West Territory.\n\nThat it may please your Council to obtain for the undersigned a section of land, for a special reserve, perpetual and inalienable, upon which they can establish themselves in a permanent manner, and fix their families, to the exclusion of all whites.\nexcept such employees as the Government shall find proper to send there, according to the needs of the population.\n\n3rd. Your petitioners would respectfully represent to your Council their desire to have defined the situation and limit of the reserve above mentioned, as follows:\n\nCommencing at a point upon the international line, where crossed by the Pembina River; thence running west along said line, 150 miles; thence at right angles, north, 50 miles; thence due east, 150 miles; thence due south, 50 miles, to point of beginning.\n\n4th. Your petitioners beg leave to state to your Council that the land above described is the only one offering to the half-breeds the requisite facilities for a permanent home.\n\n5th. Considering the state of poverty in which the half-breeds are in at present, that the above mentioned trail may be given to them in such a way that they can live thereon free from taxes, &c., whether forever or for a sufficient term of years, that at the end they can pay them without detriment to their families.\n\nThey demand, for the same reason, that they will be allowed school houses, school masters and school mistresses, whose expenses shall be defrayed by the Government; also churches, and the priests of their religion.\n\n2nd. For the sure and speedy advancement of the half-breeds, they ask to be allowed mechanics, to whom they can apply in time of need, and by whom they may be taught the various necessary arts of civilized life, as blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, &c.\n\n3rd. For the first five years of their establishment they may be given seeds according to their need.\n\nAnd your petitioners will always ask, &c.\n\nDavid Laverdure, fils,\nEzedore Dumon, fils,\nEnrie Vital,\nEzedore Patrice,\nSt. Pierre Laverdure,\nCharlie Malaterre,\nEzedore Dumon, p\u00e8re,\nBaptiste Jolibois,\nJoseph Vilbrun,\nNerman Marion,\nFran\u00e7ois Delorme,\nWilliam Bosse,\nElie Parents,\nPier Santigras,\nDavid Boyer,\nNapoleon L'Edoux,\nAntoine Rocheblave,\nJoseph Thomas,\nFran\u00e7ois Lafontaine,\nFran\u00e7ois Kole,\nAndr\u00e9 Kole,\nCalice Kole,\nWilliam Fayiant,\nMichelle St. Den\u00e9e,\nCelestin St. Den\u00e9e,\nJohn Welsh,\nEzedore Dumon,\nFran\u00e7ois Lemire,\nXavier Lemire,\nPascal Breland,\nPatrice Breland,\n\nAlexis Malatorre,\nJames Grant,\nLouis Morrin,\nJean B.

ordinance for the protection of the buffalo,\nalready dealt with by the Council, calls attention to the petitioners' present state of destitution, and urges upon the Council to obtain for them a special reserve of land one hundred and fifty miles in length, and fifty miles in width, immediately north of the international boundary, as also seeds for a number of years, and other advantages, to enable them at once to adopt a mode of life more conformable to a true civilization.\n\nAnd whereas it is not within the power of this Council to grant lands, assistance to procure seeds, or any such like advantages,\n\nResolved, therefore, that the Lieutenant-Governor be requested to forward the petition to the Dominion Government, together with the following suggestions, which they respectfully but strongly urge may receive the early and earnest attention of His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\n\n1. That it would be injudicious to set apart reserves of land for the half-breeds of the North-West Territories, or give them negotiable scrip.\n\n2. That in view, however, of the fact that grants of land or issues of scrip were made to the half-breeds of Manitoba towards the extinguishment of the Indian title to the lands of that Province, there will undoubtedly be general dissatisfaction among the half-breeds of the said Territories unless they receive some like consideration.\n\n3. That this consideration would most tend to the advantage of the half-breeds were it given in the form of a non-transferable location ticket for, say, one hundred and sixty acres to each half-breed head of a family and each half-breed child of parents resident in the said Territories at the time of the transfer thereof to Canada, the ticket to be issued immediately to any half-breed eighteen years of age, or over, on furnishing evidence of claim, and to every child on arriving at that age, and furnishing the necessary evidence.\n\n4. That each half-breed holding such a location ticket should be allowed to locate it upon any unoccupied Dominion lands, but the title of the land so entered should remain in the Crown for ten years; and if, at the expiration of three years after such entry the half-breed locatee have made no improvement on the land, his claim thereto shall be subject to forfeiture.\n\n5. To induce those half-breeds who now procure their livelihood by hunting on the plains to abandon their present mode of life and settle on their locations, by which course it alone appears possible to arrest the great destitution with which they are threatened, owing to the imminent early extinction of the buffalo, that aid in agricultural implements and seeds be allowed them for three years, but only once for each family that may settle within that time.\n\n6. That half-breeds who have shared in the Manitoba distribution of lands and scrip should not be entitled to receive location tickets in the Territories, though now resident therein.\n\nA true copy, which I certify.\n\nA. E. FORGET, Clerk Council N.W.T.\n\nDominion Lands Office,\nPrince Albert, N.W.T., 10th March, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th January last, referring to Mr. Peter Hourie's claim to lots Nos. 5 to 13 inclusive, of the Prince Albert settlement survey.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I have informed Mr. Hourie of the substance of your letter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. DUCK, Local Agent Dominion Lands.\nSurveyor-General Dominion Lands, Ottawa.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Dominion Lands Office,\nOttawa, 20th January, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014In further reference to your letter of the 30th November last, respecting that portion of it which relates to the claim set forth by Mr. Peter Hourie on behalf\nof himself and sons, for certain lots in Prince Albert settlement, I have to state that at the time of the survey by Mr. Aldous, Mr. Hourie's occupation by residence was confined to lot No. 12, and he also had a small field on lot No. 7.\n\nIn Mr. Aldous' return he is entered for lots 12 and 13, to one of which he would have a homestead, and to the other a pre-emption right, as he lives on the former.\n\nMr. Aldous also has the names of Mr. Hourie's two sons noted for lots 5, 6 and 7, but neither of them, either at the time or previously, resided upon any one of these lots.\n\nMr. Aldous' notes further shew that Mr. Fiddler and three sons had taken possession, by residence and cultivation, of lots 9, 10, 11 and 14. When your office is regularly opened, and having received the returns of survey, you are prepared to take entries. If Mr. Hourie's sons have not gone on to their lots, Nos. 5, 6 and 7, to live thereon, they will have neither the homestead nor the consequent pre-emptive right to these lots; and, in such case, unless they should tender immediate purchase money, the lots would be open for entry by anyone else.\n\nYou will please inform Mr. Hourie of the substance of this letter, in reply to his own, which you have transmitted here.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Surveyor-General.\n\nGeo. Duck, Esq., Local Agent of Dominion Lands, Prince Albert, N. W. T.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, DOMINION LANDS OFFICE,\nOTTAWA, 14th January, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 30th November last, enclosing one from Mr. Peter Hourie, respecting his claim to certain lots fronting on the River Saskatchewan, in the Prince Albert settlement survey.\n\nThe rule with respect to river front lots is that they are ten chains in width. One of these can be taken as a homestead claim and another as a pre-emption, by the same person.\n\nYou will be later advised in regard to Mr. Hourie's case, as before coming to a decision therein it will be necessary to examine Mr. Aldous' survey, and to refer to that gentleman for facts which he observed on the ground in connection with Mr. Hourie's occupation.\n\nIn surveying the townships fronting on the Saskatchewan all river lots will be posted in ten-chain widths, with a depth back from the river of two miles.\n\nThe departure from this rule that has been made in the case of the holdings of older settlers in Prince Albert and other places was made in view of the fact that the intention of the Government so to lay out the lands on the river had not been made generally known previous to their occupation. But in the present, and all future time, people are to understand that no one can hold in any manner more land on the river than I have above indicated\u2014that is say, twenty chains as homestead and pre-emption.\n\nA petition was given me to lay before the Minister of this Department from certain settlers, eastward of the main Prince Albert settlement, to be permitted to retain their lands with the half-mile width of frontage, in which manner they had taken up and occupied them.\n\nI have not yet succeeded in having this granted, although I have favorably recommended it in view of the reason above stated, that in taking up the lands they did so in accordance with the published regulations of the Dominion Lands Act, setting forth the system of their survey.\n\nShould any enquiry be made of you by parties interested, you may inform them that the matter is still in abeyance.\n\nYour information respecting the timber cut upon Government land is noted, and you will be duly instructed when it has been fully determined what action you should take in the premises.\nI would request that in future, in communicating with this office, you be careful to write your letters, relating to different subjects, on separate sheets.\n\nThe including of several subjects on the same piece of paper causes a difficulty in filing the various matters according to subject in the records of the office.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Surveyor-General.\n\nGeo. DUCK, Esq., Local Agent of Dominion Lands, Prince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE,\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T., 30th November, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose, for your consideration, a letter received by me from Mr. Peter Hourie, relating to his claim upon lots 5 to 13 inclusive, of the Prince Albert settlement survey.\n\nI beg to request advice as to the amount of river frontage allowed individual settlers\u2014that is, can I allow a settler to homestead and pre-empt two quarter-sections, both having a river frontage?\n\nI deem it my duty to inform you that I have been advised that there has been a large quantity of timber cut on Government land in this vicinity by a man named Cameron. From what I have been able to learn he has cut this timber with a view of speculation, to the detriment of neighboring settlers, some of it having been felled and allowed to rot on the ground. I should respectfully advise an investigation into the matter to prevent further occurrences of a like nature.\n\nI have much pleasure in informing you that a large quantity of land outside the Prince Albert settlement survey has already been settled upon during the past season. There are, so far as I am aware, very few cases of disputed claims, the settlers are all anxious to make the necessary entries to secure themselves. The chief difficulty in this matter will be the want of money, of which there is none in circulation, and although the crops have been fairly remunerative, and all more or less in a position to pay fees or purchase money, the want of a circulating medium will be a great drawback to many.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. DUCK, Branch Agent D.L., Saskatchewan.\n\nSurveyor-General Dominion Lands, Ottawa.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 24th October, 1878.\n\nSir.\u2014The object of the present communication is to make a statement about a piece of land in the Prince Albert settlement on which I have squatted for the last four years, which has partly been taken forcible possession of by another party, and with a view to redress therein by the Government. In the summer of 1876 I squatted on a piece of land on the north branch of the Saskatchewan River, which, since the surveys of the past summer, has turned out to contain ninety chains of a frontage, viz., lots 5 to 13 inclusive, in the Prince Albert settlement survey. I made improvements on lots 12 and 13, as also on lots 5, 6 and 7, thus leaving lots 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 unimproved, and on the three last, of which during my absence to Winnipeg the past summer, a man of the name of Edward Fidler has squatted, contrary to the remonstrances of my family, and for which I now request redress from the Government.\n\nMy idea at the time for taking such a large tract of land was to secure homesteads for my growing up family\u2014three of whom are now of age\u2014in the event of their being unable to participate in the Manitoba half-breed land grant, and which I have been since advised they are unable to do.\n\nPraying your kind attention to the above.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nPETER HOURIE.\n\nGeorge DUCK, Esq., Dominion Lands Office, Prince Albert.\nMemo.

S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W. Territories,\nBattleford, N.W.T.\n\nOFFICE OF THE NORTH-WEST INDIAN SUPERINTENDENCY,\nBATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 15th November, 1878.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to call your attention to the fact that several half-breeds who were admitted by the commissioners who negotiated treaty No. 6, into that treaty, have applied for leave to withdraw therefrom. It is unfortunate that they were ever paid under the treaty; but in some cases I admit it is difficult to distinguish certain half-breeds, who have adopted Indian habits, from full-blooded Indians.\n\nBy clause (e) of sub-section 3 of section 3, of the \"Indian Act, 1876,\" half-breeds, under very special circumstances, may be admitted into an Indian treaty. But the Act does not appear to make any provision in regard to withdrawing from a treaty. Section 70 appears to exclude them from the other rights if they do so, unless the withdrawal were prior to October, 1874.\n\nIt appears to me desirable that half-breeds should be permitted to withdraw from any Indian treaty, provided they returned to the Government the gratuity and annuity money which have been paid them. Probably the Government may deem it advisable to so amend the Act, as to enable half-breeds to withdraw from treaty without any such condition; or perhaps you may be of the opinion that permission can be granted without amending the Act.\n\nIn any case, I desire to be advised as to the reply I shall give to the applications I have received.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor and Indian Superintendent.\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nMemo.\u2014I do not think it at all politic, if any other course can be adopted by which half-breeds can be satisfied, that persons of this class should be treated with and paid as Indians.\n\nIt is however for the Minister to say.\n\nJ. S. D., D.M.\nI quite agree with the Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nJ. A. McD.\n\nMemo. by Copyist.\u2014Both of the above memorandums are written across Mr. Laird's letter.\n\nOffice of the North-West Indian Superintendency,\nBattleford, N. W.T.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to call your attention to a difficulty which has arisen in this superintendency, from the action of the commissioners who negotiated treaty No. 6, in 1876. They received several half-breeds into the treaty, and in the case of a small band at Lac la Biche, the chief and nearly all in connection with his band were half-breeds.\n\nIn 1877, when Mr. Dickieson made the payment, a number more half-breeds being relatives of the Lac la Biche chief and of some of his people, came forward to be paid, Mr. Dickieson, though he could not well refuse paying those formerly admitted into the treaty, declined to pay any other of the same class, holding that to do so would be a violation of the Indian Act. It would at least have proved very inconvenient and expensive, for there is a large number in the Territories of just such half-breeds (who live a great deal like Indians) as those who compose the Lac la Biche band.\n\nThe chief of that band visited me last summer, and complained of the injustice done some of his people, by their being refused admission into the treaty in 1877. I told him I was of opinion that the commissioners, when they received him into the treaty, did not understand that he was a half-breed, and if a mistake had been committed by them, perhaps in ignorance, it was not my duty to widen the error by taking in more of the halfbreed class. I, however, said that those formerly paid would again be paid in 1878, and that I would apply to the Department for instructions. By clause (c) of sub-section 3 of the Indian Act, \"under very special circumstances\" half-breeds may be admitted into an Indian treaty, but it seems proper that the Superintendent-General should be consulted before a course is adopted, which, if carried out, may involve a considerable increase of expenditure.\n\nI trust, therefore, you will have the goodness to forward your instructions at an early day in regard to the complaint of the Lac la Biche chief.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD,\n\nLieutenant-Governor and Indian Superintendent of the N.

Now therefore your petitioners who are interested in these matters do most humbly pray that you will place us on an equal footing, and cause scrip to be issued to us at an early date, in satisfaction of our just and lawful claims.\n\nAnd whereas the half-breed heads of families and the children of the same, born in or resident in the Territories previously to 15th July, 1870, have not yet had their claims to equal right and privileges with their brethren in the Province of Manitoba investigated, as is justly due to them and is provided for by sub-section (e) of clause 125, 42 Victoria, chapter 31, and whereas the continued delay in ascertaining and investigating said claims is creating great and general dissatisfaction throughout the Territories, we, your petitioners, do humbly pray that you will cause a commission to be issued at an early date to enquire into and confirm the said claims, not only with regard to scrip and allotments of land, as provided for in Manitoba, but moreover to confirm the titles of land occupied by or purchased by parties from occupants of claims taken previously to the transfer of the Territories to the Dominion of Canada.\n\nAnd whereas by section 7 of the regulations issued by the Department of the Interior, on 14th October, 1879, respecting the disposal of certain public lands for the purpose of the Canadian Pacific Railway, \"all payments for railway lands and also pre-emption lands within the several belts shall be in cash, and not in scrip or military police bounty warrants,\" and whereas we humbly believe that this exclusion of our scrip, owing to the immense reserves which have been created, practically amounts to its confiscation and involves a great injustice to all who are interested in.\nthe same, and whereas we firmly believe that no regulations should be retrospective as regards our property, and that the solemn convention of 1870 should be fully and faithfully carried out, we do therefore respectfully and humbly pray that the regulations of 14th October, 1879, may be so modified as to admit our scrip at its face value in the purchase of lands within the railway reserves.\n\nCharles McKay,  \nMargaret McKay,  \nCaroline McKay,  \nW.

RUSSELL, Acting Surveyor-General.\n\nPETER LAPIERRE, Esq., Qu'Appelle, N.W.T.\n\nTo the Most Honorable the Marquis of Lorne, Governor General of Canada, and Vice Admiral of the same, K.T., G.O.M.G., &c., &c.\n\nThe humble petition of Peter Lapierre, Simon Blondin, John Fisher, Alexander Fisher, John Simpson, Xavier Denommie and others, half-breeds of Qu'Appelle settlement, humbly sheweth:\n\nThat owing to their being temporarily absent from the new Province of Manitoba at the time of the transfer of the said Province and the North-West Territories to the Dominion of Canada, they have been deprived of and debarred from several remunerative advantages which were accorded to their confr\u00e8res who were residents in the Province of Manitoba, at the time of the aforesaid transfer, and that your petitioners are of opinion that they have been unjustly treated, as their conduct and actions at the time referred to deserves the kind consideration of the Government.\n\nTherefore your petitioners humbly pray that they be dealt with and treated similar to the half-breeds of Manitoba, and that the Government will grant even scrip to the heads of families, and grants of land to the children of the heads of families of half-breeds in the North-West Territories, in like proportion as was granted to half-breeds and old settlers in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nYour petitioners also humbly beg to bring before Your Excellency's notice, that when Her Majesty's commissioners came here, in the autumn of 1874, to treat with the Indians of this region, they, on behalf of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, ceded a promise to your petitioners that their rights would be recognized and respected.\n\nYour petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will be pleased to cause a survey to be made of their present holdings, similar to the old settlers' claims on the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, in the Province of Manitoba, allotting to each actual settler a certain number of chains frontage fronting on the lakes or rivers, as the case may happen, throughout their settlement, and running two miles back, north or south, as the case may be, with a privilege of two miles additional for hay and wood purposes.\nYour petitioners humbly beg further to represent to Your Excellency that many of them are in a very destitute condition and helpless state, more especially since the buffalo have disappeared and receded to beyond the international boundary line, and have thereby been deprived of the means upon which they have been, to a great extent, subsisting for a number of years past, and are totally without the means requisite and necessary to till the soil, from which a livelihood can be made. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Your Excellency be pleased to lay before Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada the necessity of extending to such of them as require it a certain amount of assistance in farming implements and seed grain, to enable them to make a start in farming, and become able to support themselves and families. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.\n\nPeter La Pierre,\nSimon Blondin, sen.,\nJohn Fisher,\nAlexander Fisher, sen.,\nLouison Blondin,\nZachary Blondin,\nNapol\u00e9on Blondin,\nAntoine Fayant, sen.,\nWilliam Fayant,\nAntoine Fayant, jun.,\nJean Louis Fayant,\nFran\u00e7ois St. Dennis, sen.,\nBaptiste Robillard,\nFran\u00e7ois St. Dennis, jun.\nJoseph Racette,\nCharles Racette, sen.,\nToussaint Gallarneau,\nThomas La Pierre,\nJean Bapt.

Of course, any sub-division differing from the regular survey they may desire they can procure for themselves when the lands come into their possession. You will please, therefore, communicate this decision to the persons interested.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Secretary.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE, PRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T., 11th March, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014As the majority of the settlers on the south branch of the River Saskatchewan, in the vicinity of the parish of St. Laurent, have taken up their lands previous to the survey, with narrow frontages, similar to those river claims in other parts of this district, and in view of the difficulty likely to be experienced in this office in adjusting the boundaries of these claims in accordance with the section survey, I have, at the request of several of the settlers so situated, the honor to request information as to the possibility of re-surveying these sections into river lots on a similar plan to that adopted in Prince Albert settlement, none of these claims having as yet been entered in this office.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. DUCK, Agent Dominion Lands.\n\nSurveyor-General Dominion Lands, Ottawa.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA 13th October, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt, through you, of a petition, dated the 4th ult., from 47 French half-breeds, on the subject of certain lands on the Saskatchewan, in the district of Prince Albert, on which they have squatted.\n\nIn reply, I am directed to request you to inform the petitioners that when the proper time arrives the case of each bona fide settler will be dealt with on its own merits; but as regard the surveying of the land in question, that all lands in the North-West Territories will be surveyed according to the system now in force.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, D. M. Int.\n\nCHAS. NOLIN, Esq., J. P.,\nSt. Antoine de Padou, South Branch of the Saskatchewan.\n(Translation.)\n\nST. ANTOINE DE PADOU, SOUTH SASKATCHEWAN, 4th September, 1882.\n\nTo the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, Minister of the Interior, Ottawa:\n\nSir,\u2014We the undersigned French half-breeds, for the most part settled on the west bank of the Saskatchewan, in the district of Prince Albert, N.W.T., hereby approach you, in order to set forth with confidence the painful position in which we are placed, with reference to the lands occupied by us in this portion of the territory, and in order to call the attention of the Government to the question which causes us so much anxiety.\n\nCompelled, most of us, to abandon the prairie, which can no longer furnish us the means of subsistence, we came in large numbers, during the course of the summer, and settled on the south branch of the Saskatchewan; pleased with the land and the country, we set ourselves actively to work clearing the land, but in hope of sowing next spring, and also to prepare our houses for the winter now advancing rapidly. The surveyed lands being already occupied or sold, we were compelled to occupy lands not yet surveyed, being ignorant, for the most part, also, of the regulations of the Government respecting Dominion lands. Great then was our astonishment and perplexity when we were notified, that when the lands are surveyed we shall be obliged to pay $2 an acre to the Government, if our lands are included in odd-numbered sections. We desire, moreover, to keep close together, in order more easily to secure a school and a church. We are poor people and cannot pay for our land without utter ruin, and losing the fruits of our labor and seeing our lands pass into the hands of strangers, who will go to the land office at Prince Albert and pay the amount fixed by the Government. In our anxiety we appeal to your sense of justice as Minister of the Interior and head of the Government, and beg you to reassure us speedily, by directing that we shall not be disturbed on our lands, and that the Government grant us the privilege of considering us as occupants of even-numbered sections, since we have occupied these lands in good faith. Having so long held this country as its masters and so often defended it against the Indians at the price of our blood, we consider it not asking too much to request that the Government allow us to occupy our lands in peace, and that exception be made to its regulations, by making to the half-breeds of the North-West free grants of land. We also pray that you would direct that the lots be surveyed along the river ten chains in width by two miles in depth, this mode of division being the long-established usage of the country. This would render it more easy for us to know the limits of our several lots.\n\nWe trust, Sir, that you will grant a favorable hearing to this our petition, and that you will make known your decision as soon as possible. We await it with great anxiety, and pray God to protect you and keep you for the direction of this great country which you so wisely govern.\n\nYour humble petitioners:\n\nGabriel Dumont, Jean Carron, Baptiste Rochlot, Mo\u00efse Parenteon, Pierre Glonory, Baptiste Delorme, William Fidler, Baptiste Boyer, Damase Carri\u00e8re, Napol\u00e9on Neault, Andr\u00e9 Neault, Napol\u00e9on Carri\u00e8re, Patrice Touron, Callixte Touron, Antoine Vandale, Baptiste Vandale, Antoine Ferguson, Baptiste Vandale, Joseph Touron, William Vandale, Jean Carron, Th\u00e9ophile Carron, R.

McGEE.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 14th October, 1882.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The undersigned has the honor to report to Council that cases sometimes arise in his Department where, through delays attendant on investigation of claims preferred to homestead entry, the applicants, though decision may be ultimately in their favor, are placed at a disadvantage, in that their occupation and culti-\nvation of the land during the interval between the claim for entry and the decision does not count to them as any part of the term of residence required by the law for their obtaining patent. These cases not being anywhere specially provided for in the Dominion Lands Act, he recommends that, under the provisions of the 125th section of that Act, he be authorized, when finally according to homestead entry in such cases, to ante-date the entry in such manner as to cover the time after application and before the giving entry, during which the applicant may have been a bond fide settler on the land.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJOHN A. MACDONALD, Minister of the Interior.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 20th October, 1882.\n\nSIR,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated the 26th ultimo., transmitting a petition from the settlers of the Battleford district, praying that a survey be made during the coming winter of the townships in the vicinity of the confluence of the Battle and Saskatchewan Rivers, and, in reply, to say that such a survey would necessitate the establishment of lines south of Battleford, where the country is not sufficiently wooded for winter operations.\n\nInstructions will be given to have the outlines of the townships established next summer.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Deputy Minister of Interior.\n\nHon. LAWRENCE CLARKE, Member North-West Council, Prince Albert, N. W. T.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T., 26th September, 1882.\n\nSIR,\u2014The enclosed memorial has been handed to me to transmit to your address, for the consideration of the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLAWRENCE CLARKE, Member North-West Council.\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nTo the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior of Canada:\n\nSIR,\u2014The undersigned have the honor to state that at a public meeting of the settlers at and around Battleford, held at Battleford on the 9th day of September, A.D. 1882, the undersigned were named a committee for the purpose of presenting to the Hon. the Minister the necessity which exists for surveys of land in and around Battleford, in order that settlers may apply for and derive titles for their holdings.\n\nThe following facts are presented for consideration:\u2014\n\n1. Actual settlement commenced in the spring of the year 1876, in which year the first farm produce was raised.\n\n2. There are now over 100 farms in actual operation (many with over 50 acres improved, several with 80, and one with over 100), and the fact that in every year, including 1876, the efforts put forth by farmers have been attended with success, the absence of summer frosts, and the abundance of good land, wood and water, prove conclusively the suitability of the neighborhood for settlement.\n\n3. The making of some surveys, by which lines could be ascertained, would, it is respectfully submitted, prove an incentive to greater exertion by those already settled, and offer inducements to many who, consequent upon the absence of survey, would, like others in the past, feel unwilling to risk labor and capital without certainty of title.\n\n4. That the increase in the number of farms would afford employment to many of the Indians in this vicinity, thus providing for their support and relieving the Government of the burden.\n5. That several surveyors are at work in the Saskatchewan valley in districts where there are no inhabitants, but so far as can be ascertained no surveyor has instructions to operate at or around Battleford, except Mr. A. G. Cavana, who is engaged laying out a town site.\n\n6. That the formation of the country, the mildness of the winter, and the proverbially light snowfall, render work during the winter months quite practicable.\n\nThe undersigned therefore respectfully urge that the Minister may see fit to direct at an early date the laying of and sub-dividing of some townships having the confluence of the Battle and North Saskatchewan rivers for a centre.\n\nS. CLARKE,\nP. G. LAURIE,\nHUGH RICHARDSON,\nE. A. NASH,\nWM. LAURIE, Secretary.\n\nPETITION from M. A. Macdonald et al., of Battleford, N.W.T.:\n\n(Precis.)\n\nStates that the interests of the residents of Battleford, suffering from want of security to enable them to erect permanent places of business and dwellings.\n\nWants that a survey of the town site and of a few adjoining townships be ordered and proceeded with at once.\n\nBATTLEFORD, N. W. T., 4th March, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to present herewith a petition from the residents of Battleford and vicinity, praying that you will be pleased to cause a survey of the town site, and of a few townships in the neighborhood, to be made with as little delay as practicable.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nP. G. LAURIE.\n\nTo the Hon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa:\n\nThe petition of the undersigned residents of Battleford, in the North-West Territories,\u2014\n\nHUMBLY SHOWETH:\n\nThat the town site of Battleford was reserved in the year 1876 by the Government.\n\nThat it is the present seat of Government, the headquarters of the North-West Mounted Police on the Saskatchewan, and of Indian Affairs in this district.\n\nThat Battleford is situated on the Battle and Saskatchewan Rivers, and is the centre, not only of a large and fertile agricultural country, but of the North-West, politically, geographically and commercially.\n\nThat a bridge over Battle River is now in process of construction, which will still further attract travel and business to this point.\n\nThat the town site has not been surveyed.\n\nThat in consequence of this Battleford has made no real progress, as intending settlers could not build on land reserved by the Government, and not surveyed and placed in the market for sale.\n\nThat a number of us are now, and have been, ready and willing to erect substantial residences and places of business, and only wait for the town site to be surveyed.\n\nYour petitioners would therefore ask that a survey of the town site, and of a few adjoining townships, be ordered and proceeded with at once.\n\nAnd as in duty bound, will ever pray.\n\nMahoney & Macdonald,\nP.

BRAUN, Secretary.\n\nR. A. MEREDITH, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 7th June 1876.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honor to inform you that, in connection with the special survey in the North-West Territories now being carried on under the direction of Mr. Lindsay Russell, Assistant Surveyor General, that gentleman has been instructed to determine, during the present season, the longitude of the intersection of the Battle River by the proposed line of the Canadian Pacific Railway also of the intersection of said railway line by the one hundred and third meridian.\n\nThis object it is proposed to effect with the aid of telegraphic signals between the points mentioned and Winnipeg, and I am to request that you will be so good as to cause the contractors of the telegraph line to be instructed to allow the line to be used by Mr. Russell for the purpose above mentioned, and advise this Department accordingly.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. A. MEREDITH, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\nHon. the Minister of Public Works, Ottawa.\n\n(Telegram.)\n\nWINNIPEG, 12th September, 1876.\n\nTo Lt.-Col. Dennis, Ottawa.\n\nUnlikely effect anything this season; line imperfect; too late Edmonton.\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL.\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 5th September, 1876.\n\nMy Dear Col. Dennis,\u2014I am getting much disgusted with waiting the putting of the telegraph line in order. It is extremely likely that after expense incurred of sending people to Battle River I shall have to recall them, without having effected anything beyond the survey of the point between the rivers. They\u2014King and Checkley\u2014were not prepared to winter there; it would not be expedient they should. Consequently, the journey will have to be done over next spring.\n\nHow would it do to send up, say Reid\u2014and have town plot laid out independently of the township lines, letting the latter but on the townplot outline in whatsoever manner it may befall? Unless I am altogether mistaken, there is but poor chance of any, even determination this season.\n\nThe method of sending messages now is to telegraph from here to Swan river, then repeat there to Battleford. The line between here and Swan river is in so bad plight\u2014insulation so imperfect\u2014that it is all they can do from the Winnipeg battery to shove a message through to Swan river. Sometimes barely that in these conditions impossible to carry through to Battleford. There is no good complaining at headquarters; the contractors are doing what they can (in their own interest) to get line in order, but it was so badly put up at first that it seems an endless job; next, they are under no obligation to put it in order. Yet, not until time of handing it over as completed can the Government complain. I heard from A. L. Russell, on arrival here, that all were well and work progressing satisfactorily. King and Checkley got through with their instructions in good order, their mishaps being confined to smashing a waggon. Should you decide to survey townplot independently, there would yet be time by immediate answering or instructions.\n\nThere has been a plentiful harvest, and the most of the grain has, in spite of unfavorable rainy weather, been safely gathered in. Encouragement for settlers, but there is no money in the country, what farmers will do with their surplus when the business of the country is all importing, nothing goes out but the furs and but a moderate portion of their value comes back again. How they can get cash for anything but a small part of the grain they will have to sell, I am at a loss to conceive.\n\nNever saw so continuously bad weather and bad roads in Manitoba since first I knew it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL.\n(Telegram.)\n\nOttawa, 21st September, 1876.\n\nTo Lindsay Russell, Winnipeg.\n\nNo authority yet for survey Battleford, Tell Whitcher Fornire's account settled.\n\nJ. S. Dennis.\n\nTechnical Branch, Ottawa, 28th November, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014The standing instructions to surveyors prescribe that river lots shall be numbered downstream from one upwards, separately, in each township, commencing on the left bank first, then on the right bank.\n\nSome surveyors have numbered the lots in a different manner, and others have made lots, part of which is in a township and part into the next one.\n\nWill you be good enough to advise me whether this will interfere with your arrangements, or whether the townships should be re-surveyed.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. Deville, Chief Inspector of Surveys.\n\nA. M. Burgess, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nTechnical Branch, Ottawa, 26th November, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 23rd inst., in which you ask the names of the rivers in the North-West Territory the frontages of which have been surveyed into river lots, I beg to state that the standing instructions are to lay out river lots along the Saskatchewan, Battle, Bow, Red Deer and Belly Rivers.\n\nSpecial instructions have also been given to lay out river lots along the shores of Lake Winnipeg and of the islands in it, and also in three townships fronting on Old Man's River.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. Deville, Chief Inspector of Surveys.\n\nJ. R. Hall, Esq., Secretary Department of the Interior.\n\nOttawa, 23rd April, 1883.\n\nDear Mr. Russell,\u2014I enclose a communication from Father Andr\u00e9, Superior of St. Lawrence, N.W.T., upon the question of surveys.\n\nHow is it these difficulties recur so often, when it is the rule of the Department to survey around the old surveys without disturbing the occupants? Were the surveyors properly instructed?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. L. Macpherson.\n\nLindsay Russell, Esq.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nSt. Lawrence, 16th January, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I write you for the purpose of calling your attention to the painfully embarrassing position in which the French half-breeds settled on the southerly banks of the Saskatchewan River are placed.\n\nAccording to an old custom in Manitoba, they took up their lots, ten chains wide in front by two miles in depth, trusting that the Government, acting on the rule already established, would survey these lands into lots ten chains in width by two miles in depth.\n\nTheir surprise may be imagined when they saw the lands along the Saskatchewan measured off into squares of forty chains, without any heed being given to their just claims and protests.\nWhat is the result of this abnormal division? Our half-breeds are overwhelmed with difficulties on account of their land, and this proceeding will now sow division and discord among our people, and will render the Government odious in their eyes, considering it as guilty of a gross injustice towards them.\n\nThis survey lamentably mixes things; some lose their land, which is being grabbed by their neighbors; others see the fruits of their industry and their improvements dissipated.\n\nThis unhappy state of things could be easily made to cease by giving ear to their just claims. And how can this be refused them when you granted a similar favor to Prince Albert? All the lands along the branches of the Saskatchewan have been surveyed in this manner; everybody was satisfied; and not the least complaint was heard about the survey.\n\nI cannot understand, Sir, why your surveyors should have two different methods of parceling the public domain; one for Prince Albert, ten chains in width by two miles in depth, which we approve, and which we claim as a right, seeing you have granted it to Prince Albert; the other, of blocking out the land in squares of forty chains, without taking the river nor location of the settlers into consideration. The latter method we protest solemnly against, all of us, and humbly pray, Sir, that you order a new survey, and thus validate our request.\n\nAlready the people of this colony have addressed to you a petition on this subject, but the answer, given under your directions, is not one calculated to inspire them with the hope that you would right the wrong of which they complain.\n\nKnowing the difficult situation in which our people are placed, I have resolved to make another effort, which I trust will bring happy results, and I dare to hope that you will accede to their just request, and no later than next summer order a new survey of the lands on the south branch of the Saskatchewan.\n\nBy your kindly concurrence in this matter you will do an act of justice to our people and render them a service for which they will ever be thankful.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your humble servant,\n\nFATHER ANDRE, Superior of St. Lawrence, N.W.T.\nGrondine P.O.\n\nRight Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 28th July, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd March last, B. 1561, enclosing a communication from Mr. Inspector Pearce, asking for advice with reference to the date from which settlement should count in cases where parties have settled prior to survey, but have neglected to apply for entry within the proper time. In reply, I am directed to say that my letter of the 17th instant will have been a sufficient answer to your communication and the enquiries of Mr. Pearce.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Acting Secretary.\n\nAquila Walsh, Esq., Commissioner of Dominion Lands, Winnipeg.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 20th July, 1883.\n\nMemorandum.\u2014With reference to the letters hereunder from the commissioner and from the inspector of agencies, I think we recently wrote Mr. Walsh a letter which covers the whole class of cases alluded to, and instructed him not to take advantage of the neglect of the settlers in advance of survey to give the notice required by sub-section 5 of section 34 of the Act 42 Vic., chap. 31, because of the misleading character of the circular issued from the Department on the 22nd November, 1879.\nIf my recollection is correct, it would be well to write to the commissioner, saying that the letter in question will have sufficiently answered his communication and the enquiries of Mr. Pearce.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Esq., Secretary Department of the Interior.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE, WINNIPEG, 22nd March, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Inspector Pearce, in reference to a class of cases brought to his notice on the occasion of his late visit to the Birtle district.\n\nThe point is so fully stated by Mr. Pearce as to make any comments on my part unnecessary. I therefore submit the matter for your consideration and decision.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. WALSH, Commissioner.\n\nRight Hon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOFFICE OF THE DOMINION LANDS COMMISSION,\nWINNIPEG, 13th March, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014During my visit to Birtle, last week, I was asked by several parties if their time for residence would count prior to date of entry under the following circumstances:\n\nOn the 22nd November, 1879, a circular, copy of which is given below, was sent from the head office to the various local agents:\n\n\"NOTICE.\n\n\"It has been brought to my notice that in cases where occupation and improvements have preceded homestead entry the period of settlement duty has been counted from a period prior to that entry.\n\n\"This practice is contrary to the Dominion Lands Act, and a further continuance of it cannot be allowed.\"\n\nMany parties now contend that at date of entry they had occupied and resided upon their lands for some months, in some cases upwards of a year; but owing to the said notice they did not strictly comply with the provisions of sub-sec. 5, sec. 34, 42 Vic., chap. 31, in so far as furnishing the local agent at time of entry with proof of prior occupation and cultivation.\n\nThe recent Order, that time counts from settlement and occupation in cases where parties have so settled prior to survey, has caused these parties to ask that the neglect of theirs be waived.\n\nThe whole point hinges on what is held to be the date of survey\u2014whether, at the time, sufficient work has been done in the field to enable a settler to know readily on what particular quarter-section he is located, or the date when the township is opened for entry. If the latter is the correct interpretation of the Act, I think in equity these settlers should receive the benefit of that time\u2014their contention for non-compliance with the strict provision of the Act being a reasonable one. If I interpret the Act correctly, the sub-section referred to is not intended to apply to such cases as the present.\n\nBy reading sub-sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11 of section 34, in conjunction, I think the whole spirit of the Act, in speaking of unsurveyed lands, is meant to apply only to those cases where, so far as any surveys effected by the Government, the party settling was ignorant of his position. Of course parties can make any surveys they wish, at their own expense, in order to secure themselves from settling on a section owned by the Hudson Bay Company, as in that case the Government would not be bound to protect them.\nThe clause referred to reads thus:\u2014\"Provided that on a survey of a township being made the Government shall not be bound to protect any person found to have settled on land which by law or allotment only made may be claimed by the Hudson Bay Company.\"\n\nThis clearly established in my mind that unsurveyed lands mean those in which the Government have taken no steps to define the position of the various sections. This view is strengthened by sub-section 2, section 22, 42 Vic. chap. 31.\n\nIn most if not all the cases which will arise in the Birtle district, settlement was effected after at least two limits of each township had been defined on the ground and in the great majority of them the field work of the entire township was completed\u2014though they were not open for entry until some time after.\n\nI would therefore suggest that you would embody your views on this matter in a report, and refer the whole case to the Minister, for his ruling.\n\nHe might deem it advisable to submit the matter to the law officers of the Crown.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nWILLIAM PEARCE, Inspector.\n\nA. WALSH, Esq., Commissioner, Winnipeg.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 4th October, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 16th instant, enquiring whether a settler, squatter can procure patent under the provising of sub-section 11 of section 34 of the Dominion Lands Acts, without reference to date of entry, I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to inform you that if the squatter made his entry under and in accordance with the provisions of sub-section 5 of the aforesaid section, and filed the evidence of occupation prescribed therein, he is entitled to patent.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Deputy Minister Interior.\n\nALFRED CARSS, Esq., Rapid City, Man.\n\nRAPID CITY, 16th September, 1882.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Has the Minister of Justice yet given his opinion as to whether these parties can procure their patents three years from date of settlement, under sub-section 11 of section 34. You will likely recollect talking the matter over with Mr. Newcomb and myself, about four weeks ago. I have written the Deputy Minister of Justice for his opinion, but do not wish delay of answer in regular order; so I write you privately, hoping you will oblige me with an early reply.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nALFRED CARSS.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 10th January, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo, and in reply to state that the applicants should be called upon to explain why they did not make their entries within three months after the land was open for entry, and that if the evidence furnished in each case is satisfactory, the Minister does not see any reason why the issue of their patents should not be recommended.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Secretary.\n\nA. WALSH, Esq., Commissioner Dominion Lands, Winnipeg, Man.\nOFFICE OF THE DOMINION LANDS COMMISSIONER,\nWINNIPEG, 14th December, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to request attention to my letter of the 9th October last, B. 2258, having reference to applicants for patent who did not make entry within three months after the land was open for settlement.\n\nAdditional cases are occurring of this nature.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. WALSH, Commissioner.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOFFICE OF THE DOMINION LANDS COMMISSIONER,\nWINNIPEG, 9th October, 1883:\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to request instructions as to whether, under section 28 of the Dominion Lands Act of 1883, a settler upon unsurveyed land is only entitled to credit for prior residence upon his exercising the right of entry within three months from the date the land is open to entry.\n\nSub-sections 5 and 11, section 34, of the Act of 1879, appears to make the point quite clear, but the new Act seems only to secure the prior right of entry for three months after the lands are open.\n\nI have some applications for patent before me, in which the parties establish residence for a sufficient time to entitle them to patent, but they did not make entry within three months after the land was open for settlement.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. WALSH, Commissioner.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 17th July, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, B 1957, asking instructions whether the power to ante-date homestead entries may be exercised when applications for patent are made, or only when finally according homestead entry and in reply to inform you that the contention of the applicants, as stated in the sixth paragraph of your letter, is undoubtedly well founded, and in all these cases, where indisputable evidence is furnished of three years bona fide residence and cultivation, it would be inequitable and unfair, in view of the erroneous construction placed upon the law by the Department for several years, and of the publicity given to that construction, if any person who accepted the situation and failed to do what the law actually required should suffer loss or delay in the issue of his patent.\n\nCarrying out this principle to its legitimate conclusion, it follows that the reply to the last paragraph of your letter would be that the authority may also be exercised when application for patent is made.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Acting Secretary.\n\nA. WALSH, Esq., Commissioner Dom. Lands, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nOFFICE OF THE DOMINION LANDS COMMISSIONER,\nWINNIPEG, 7th July, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to request instructions in reference to a class of applications for patent submitted for my approval.\n\nThe applications now pending are made by farmers who were squatters in the Souris district, and whose claims were reported upon by the Land Board during the season of 1882.\n\nThese persons make affidavit to the length of residence to entitle them to patent, but their entries have been for a much shorter period. The Minister of Justice has\ngiven the opinion that a squatter upon unsurveyed land, making application for entry within three months from the time the land is open for entry, and submitting evidence of previous occupation and cultivation, is entitled to the benefit of the time covered by such previous occupation.\n\nIn the application now under consideration, there is no explanation as to when the lands were open for entry, or whether the applications for entry were made within three months thereafter, and the necessary affidavits as to residence and cultivation filed. I return them to the agent for explanation and amendment.\n\nIt is urged in some cases as a justification for the neglect in filing the evidence referred to that a notice had been issued by the Surveyor-General that time previous to entry would not count. By reference to my letter of the 22nd March last, B. 1561, enclosing letter of Mr. Inspector Pearce, of the 15th March, B, 1511, you will find the case of this class of persons fully stated.\n\nBy Order in Council of the 19th October, 1882, No 541, authority is given the Minister \"when finally according homestead entry\" to ante-date the entry in cases in which the delay was not the fault of the applicant.\n\nI beg to be instructed whether the authority given by the Order in Council referred to may be exercised when applications for patent are made, or only \"when finally according homestead entry.\"\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA.

McGEE.\n\nOctober, 1883.\n\nGovernment House, Regina, 9th October, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose you herewith a memorial from the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories in Council, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. DEWDNEY, Lieut.-Governor, N.W.T.\n\nHon. the Secretary of State, Ottawa.\n\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\n\nMay it please Your Excellency:\n\nYour memorialists, the Lieutenant-Governor and the Council of the North-West Territories, show as follows:\n\n1st. That the reservations held by the Government at Regina and Moose Jaw, and the reserve known as the \"Mile Belt\" reserve, are detrimental to growth and\nprosperity, large blocks of land being held by the Government, and settlers being debarred from locating upon them, paralyze the expansive force of this young country, and by bounding the railway by a tract comparatively uninhabited, gives the traveller a false idea of the North-West, and an inadequate and, sometimes, misleading impression of the character of the soil. Your memorialists are aware, too, that many bond fide settlers have located upon lands included in these reserves, innocent of any order to the contrary, and have, in many cases, been driven from their claims, and in others have been prevented from obtaining those advantages which the inducements held out by the Government led them to expect. Your memorialists, therefore, pray that immediate action be taken to remove these barriers to the development of the country.\n\n2nd. Your memorialists also pray that immediate measures be adopted to determine title to lands that have been over three years in cultivation; that patents issue at once to those entitled to them; that pre-emptions and squatters' claims, settled on prior to the 14th of October, 1879, be allowed at a price in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time of settlement. That settlers who have entered upon lands prior to survey, and previous to the 14th of October, 1879, at which time there did not exist any distinction between odd and even-numbered sections, and after survey are found to be located on odd-numbered sections, should be allowed their homesteads and pre-emptions on such sections at a price in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time of settlement.\n\nThat settlers on school lands who settled thereon prior to survey, and ignorant of the fact, be afforded security in their holding. That the Government will use its good offices to obtain security for those who have in good faith settled on Hudson Bay sections, prior to survey and after 1873, and in ignorance that they were such sections.\n\nYour memorialists further pray that those half-breeds in the Territories who have not participated in the arrangement to extinguish the half-breed claim in Manitoba should enjoy the same rights as accorded half-breeds in that Province.\n\n3rd. Your memorialists also pray for more extended surveys in the country of the North Saskatchewan that the special settlement survey on the South Saskatchewan, in the parish of St. Antoine, made by Mr. Aldous, Dominion land surveyor, be approved, and that the land agent of Prince Albert be instructed to receive entries for such lands that the lands in the parishes of Grandin, St. Laurent and St. Louis, and fronting on the South Saskatchewan, be surveyed into ten chain lots, it being occupied by settlers in this manner.\n\n4th. That the system of granting of leases of lands in the western grazing districts be discontinued, as injurious, and for the reason that a very large portion of the land so leased is fit and required for actual settlement.\n\n5th. That homesteads cancelled for any cause should be again open for entry, and not held for sale, is, we believe, best calculated to settle the country.\n\n6th. That the safety of documents valuable alike to the Government and the people demand that vaults should be erected in lands and registry offices in the Territories.\n\n7th. That at least two additional stipendiary magistrates should be appointed for the Territories.\n\n8th. That power be given to the North-West Council to incorporate companies having territorial objects, and to enforce ordinances by imprisonment.\n\n9th. That subsection 2 of section 91, of \"The North-West Territories Act\" of 1880, be amended so as to vest all trails and highways in the Councils of the North-West Territories.\n\n10th. That the duties on agricultural implements and lumber should be reduced. It having heretofore been the policy of Your Excellency's Government to foster the industries of the country, we feel that the heavy duties imposed on lumber and implements used in agricultural pursuits, together with the heavy rates of freights which must be paid, is calculated to so increase the cost of building and of farming that the effect must be injurious to settlement.\n11th. That largely increased sum should be voted for expenditure on the Saskatchewan River to improve the navigation of that stream, it being the only means of outlet for a very large section of the North-West, and the Canadian Pacific Railway on the south being at such a great distance, making it, as a means of cheap outlet, almost impracticable.\n\n12th. That mining laws and regulations should be assimilated to those of British Columbia and Montana Territory.\n\n13th. That the right of pre-emption should not be abolished.\n\n14th. Your memorialists also pray, in view of the very large increase of the population in the Territories and the consequent increased demand for various improvements, that a sum per capita, based on the assumed population of one hundred thousand now in the North-West Territories, be given for expenditure by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, as best calculated to suit the requirements of the people than at present followed.\n\n15th. That the system of granting immense tracts of the choicest lands in the Territories to colonization companies is inimicable to the best interests of the country. Your memorialists therefore pray that no more such grants be made, that the companies now holding the same be compelled to fulfil the conditions imposed upon them, in letter and in spirit and that the agents of the companies be not allowed to act as the agents of the Government in any respect. That granting lands already thickly settled, as in the case of the Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company, is contrary to the intention of the Land Act. That the company profits to an undue extent by the energy and forethought of the pioneers of the country, who are prevented from reaping the advantage of their own labor, in that the odd-numbered sections are locked up for speculative purposes, which would otherwise be open for settlement or held for sale by the Government on reasonable terms. Your memorialists therefore pray that Your Excellency's Government will enquire into the matter and redress the above grievances.\n\n16th. Your memorialists believe that the success of the North-West Territories is of such importance to the whole Dominion that the time has arrived when representation for the Territories should be had in Parliament. At the present time the people of the North-West Territories are without representation of any kind, and have to depend solely on petitions and memorials to make their wants known.\n\nAnd your memorialists will ever pray.\n\nCertified.\n\nA. FORGET, Clerk of Council.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 15th July, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 26th April, respecting the desire of certain settlers on the South Saskatchewan to have their lands surveyed into river lots, and, in reply, to inform you that immediately upon the return of the Deputy Minister of the Interior from the North-West, which is expected to be within a very few days, your letter will be brought to his attention, with a view to immediate action being taken upon the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nP. B. DOUGLAS, for the Secretary.\n\nLOUIS SCHMIDT, Esq., Grandin, Saskatchewan, N.W.T.\n\nGRANDIN, SASKATCHEWAN, N. W.T., 26th April, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to lay before you the following facts:\n\nI am one of the settlers on the South Saskatchewan, in the electoral district of Lorne, who, during the last four years, have sent petitions upon petitions to your Department to have their lands surveyed in ten or twenty chains frontage by one or two miles long, as the same has been done for the Prince Albert settlement, on both the north and south branches of the Saskatchewan.\nI regret to say that so far our prayer has not yet been granted, nor even an answer of any kind has been given, and I feel bound to say that such a state of things is almost intolerable.\n\nThe most part of those settlers, and I am among the number, have lived on and cultivated their lands for over three years, and ought to be entitled to a patent from the Crown. Yet, as they have taken up their lands close to each other, and in the hope of having them sub-divided in river lots, they have not been able to enter them in the lands office.\n\nYou see, Sir, in a glance, the real state of things, and I need not occupy your valuable time any longer in entering into more details.\n\nI pray you, therefore, most earnestly, to have the matter remedied to, for the satisfaction of so many loyal subjects of Her Majesty, and of your humble servant.\n\nLOUIS SCHMIDT.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOFFICE OF THE DOMINION LANDS COMMISSIONER,\n\nWINNIPEG, 19th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., No. 13486, having reference to a communication from the Rev. V. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville, missionary at St. Louis de Langevin, near Prince Albert, in which the Chief Inspector of Surveys suggested a mode of dealing with the French half-breed settlers on the south branch, who are desirous of having the lands claimed by them laid out in river lots, and you direct that Mr. Inspector Pearce be instructed in accordance with the said suggestion.\n\nIn reply, Mr. Inspector Pearce states that if he, personally, had time to make a survey of those settlers' holdings, he has no doubt that entries could be granted in legal subdivision or fractional parts thereof, so that each person's interest would be as well protected as if laid off in river lots, but that he has not time to do as that suggestion would demand, much as he would like that kind of work. He also states that he thinks, owing to points and bays on the river, it will be found that no regular width of lots will meet the wishes of those people, that their improvements are in all courses, that they seem determined to have their holdings laid out in river lots, and it will be found that they will expect the lines between every lot plainly defined on ground\u2014at least, that is what Mr. Pearce states he inferred from interviews he had with them. Further, he tried to explain to them how their wishes could be met by means of a L.S. survey, or fractional portions thereof; but he fears they did not comprehend what he desired to impart. In fact, it was a matter which he took particular pains to discuss with others, and the better educated portion of the community, and the answer invariably was: \"That is plain enough to you, as a surveyor, but it is Greek to us. Those parties are bona fide settlers, as such have or will acquire title, and if they wish their land laid off in a certain way, why should the Government object? In fact, it is the duty of the Government to survey it, as requested.\"\n\nMr. Inspector Pearce further states that neither the agent nor his assistant are sufficiently conversant with surveys to go over the ground and allot those lands by L.S. or fractional portions thereof, and would recommend one of two courses to be adopted:\n\n1st. To send with agent on the ground a surveyor who can make a rough traverse of improvements on each section, and then entries can be given by legal subdivision, so as to preserve to each man his improvements, as far as possible.\n\n2nd. To lay out in river lots on ground, employing a surveyor of considerable experience in that kind of work. If he or his assistant spoke French, so much the better; and give him sufficient latitude in his instructions, so that he could make the lots of such widths as to preserve to each claimant, so far as possible, his improvements.\n\nIn both cases he would suggest the township road allowance be kept open.\n\nIf the first course is adopted, he begs leave to suggest that Colonel Sprout, or J.L. Reid, D.L.S., who are now on the ground, be instructed to proceed with the\nagent and assist to carry it out, as he thinks time would be saved by so doing\u2014expense also.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nWM. PEARCE for the Commissioner.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, TECHNICAL BRANCH,\nOTTAWA, 12th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I am in receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. Wm. Pearce, in reference to river lots in Townships 45, Ranges 27 and 28 west of the 2nd Meridian, and Townships 44 and 45, Range 1, west of the 3rd Meridian.\n\nSome river lots have been laid out in the above townships, but the greater part of the river front has been sub-divided into sections.\n\nRev. V. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville and Hon. Charles Nolin refer, probably, to a promise of the Minister to Rev. V. Leduc and Mr. Maloney, that certain lands would be laid out into river lots.\n\nI do not know whether or not such a promise has been made.\n\nAs to the proper course to be adopted, I would refer you to my letter of the 14th ult. (S. 7175) to the Deputy Minister.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. DEVILLE, Chief Inspector of Surveys.\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Esq., Secretary Department of the Interior.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 10th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ult. (S. 7175), enclosing a communication from the Rev. V. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville, missionary at St. Louis de Langevin; and to say that a copy of your letter, and a translation of that of the Rev. Mr. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville, have been sent to Mr. Commissioner Walsh, with a statement that the Minister approves of your suggestions, and a request that the Inspector of Dominion Lands Agencies be instructed accordingly.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Secretary.\n\nE. DEVILLE, Esq., Chief Inspector of Surveys, Ottawa.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 10th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to enclose you copy of a translation of a letter from the Rev. V. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville, missionary at St. Louis de Langevin, near Prince Albert, together with a copy of a communication from the Chief Inspector of Surveys, in reference thereto. The Minister approves of the suggestions which are made by the Chief Inspector, and directs me to request you to instruct Mr. Pearce accordingly.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Secretary.\n\nA. WALSH, Esq., Commissioner of Dominion Lands, Winnipeg.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, TECHNICAL BRANCH,\nOTTAWA, 14th February, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014In transmitting the enclosed letter from the Rev. V. V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville, missionary at St. Louis de Langevin, near Prince Albert, I beg to draw your attention to the\nclause stating that last year Rev. V. Leduc and Mr. Maloney obtained from the Government written assurances that the lands occupied by French settlers on the south branch of the Saskatchewan would be laid out into river lots.\n\nI am not in a position to state whether or not such is the case, but I am aware that a similar promise was made for the Saskatchewan, Edmonton and St. Albert settlement.\n\nThe wishes of the settlers could easily be met, without inconvenience or prejudice to the Government, by adopting the following course:\n\n1st. If the Inspector of Agencies, when on the ground, should be satisfied that the great majority of the settlers in a township desire river lots, then he should have power to direct that every homestead fronting on the river in that township shall be composed of four quarter quarter-sections, forming a lot of twenty chains in width by one mile in depth.\n\n2nd. Except when all the occupants of a section prefer having it allotted into quarter-sections, in which case their request should be complied with.\n\n3rd. Except when all the occupants of two sections desire that the lots should be ten chains in width, and should extend two miles to the depth of the two sections, in which case their wishes should also be complied with.\n\nA lot twenty chains wide by one mile deep would be described in the patent as composed of four quarter quarter-sections.\n\nA lot ten chains wide by two miles deep would be described as the western, eastern, northern or southern halves of eight quarter quarter-sections.\n\nThe areas could easily be found by reference to this office.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. DEVILLE, Chief Inspector of Surveys.\n\nA. M. BURGESS, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T., 19th January, 1884.\n\nSir\u2014I have just seen Inspector Pearce, and to my great surprise that gentleman was unable to answer satisfactorily the questions I put to him. He confined himself to advising me to write to you, promising to do so himself at once.\n\nSome twelve years ago settlers located themselves on the banks of the south branch of the Saskatchewan; about the end of the winter, in 1881, the missionary of St. Laurent, west side of river, S. 21, Tp. 44, R. 1, W. 3, being no longer sufficient for the population, which was increasing and extending to a distance, I was directed to establish a new mission at Batoche Crossing, Tp. 43, R. 1, W. 3, about 8 miles above St. Laurent and on the opposite (east) side, which was being more rapidly settled.\n\nThe presence of the missionary, coupled with the local advantages of good lands, located on the banks of a great river, caused the settlement to increase wonderfully. On surmounting the difficulties connected with the foundation, I gave my place to a fellow missionary in order to go and establish an easier mission at Prince Albert. But the south branch was constantly calling for me. This time I went down as far as Tp. 45, R. 2., W. 2, on the opposite side from St. Laurent, the south side, for higher up the river makes a right angle. Immigration was already tending to that point and has continued to flow to it ever since. Now the right bank of the south branch is settled uninterruptedly for a distance of some 50 miles, from the Smith reserve, Tp. 46, R. 26, W. 2, to Tp. 38, R. 1 and 2, W. 3.\n\nThe intention was to take up river lots, ten chains in front, two miles in depth. The settlers erected houses and other necessary buildings. They laid out fields of greater or less extent, in spite of the uneasiness which, at times, made them drop their implements from their hands, as you can well understand.\n\nWhen the first surveys were made, five or six years ago, only a few miles were surveyed in the same way as the rest of the country in sections. A base line was drawn for a few miles more, but not a single lot was surveyed within the limits marked.\nSince the opening of the land office these poor people have been asking that their lands be surveyed, in order to enable them to enter them and secure the property therein by means of patents.\n\nI myself have several times got Mr. Duck, D.L.S., of St. Albert, to write to Ottawa, and in every case without success; so that I myself lost all hope, and several parties went away, some of them selling their lands for a nominal price and others abandoning them without any indemnity.\n\nIn February, 1883, Rev. Father Leduc and Mr. Maloney were deputed to set forth our grievances and present our claims to the Government. They were promised, in writing, that the lands we occupy should be surveyed as river lots ten chains in front by two miles in depth, and that the survey would be made in the following autumn (1883).\n\nThe autumn has passed; winter is advancing; what has become of those promises? Has some surveyor been entrusted with the work and failed to perform his duty? To you, Sir, we put these questions, and this is also, Sir, what I ask you today.\n\nI do not put these questions merely in my own name, or merely in the name of the two missions I have founded on the right bank of the South Saskatchewan. I repeat what Father Leduc and Mr. Maloney said to the members of the Government in the winter of 1883; I repeat to you what our settlers say to the land agents at Prince Albert; I am the faithful interpreter of the whole population.\n\nBe good enough, Sir, to consider the consequences of a painful delay. The settlers have made settlements, and are making them day by day, without knowing where the lines of their future properties are to pass. These inflexible limits, right-lines and parallels, will traverse fields, pass through houses, cut off farm houses from the fields connected with them. This must inevitably occur where parties have already put up buildings, and wherever buildings are erected; until the survey is made. What serious hardships, what deplorable results must flow from all this! Three-fourths of these miseries might have been avoided had the survey been made when asked for and promised.\n\nI trust, Sir, that the troubles which now press so hardly upon our people may have a speedy end, for one word from you is all that is needed. Be good enough to remind the surveyors appointed to do the work that this part of the country is in more urgent need of the survey than other places which are not yet being settled. And if surveyors have not, as yet, been appointed, there are enough of them in the country to enable you to select some of them and send them to the place, in order to render the people contended and satisfied, so far as it may be possible to do so.\n\nBut you will tell me to be patient, and with time all will be well. That I cannot admit. The time is past, and for a two-fold reason. Prince Albert was settled at the same time that this colony commenced. The Prince Albert settlers have long ago had their lands surveyed and received their patents.\n\nSecondly, I would not have it said that there are places in this country where immigrants are treated like Helots. Opposite the mission I am establishing, on the north bank, Tp. 45, R. 27 and 28, W. 2, there are but two families, and already, in the two townships, the sections have been altered to river lots. I see them marked on the maps. Ten years ago a certain number of families settled on the south bank; they now number some thirty families; next summer there will not be room for all who have promised to come, and yet not a single river lot has been surveyed. What would immigrants do if they knew that in this country they are exposed to treatment so flagrantly partial as this?\n\nIf I were on the spot I could get this letter signed by heads of families representing a population of 2,000 souls; but I prefer to send it to you at once, hoping to receive your reply before the departure of Mr. Pearce, who might give us a surveyor.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nV. V\u00c9GR\u00c9VILLE, Missionary of St. Louis de Langevin.\n\nCapt. Deville, Chief Inspector of Surveys, Ottawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 10th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I enclose herewith copy of a letter, dated the 17th January, from Mr. Pearce, Inspector of the Dominion Lands Agencies, who refers to a petition from settlers on the South Saskatchewan, asking for surveys of the river lots in Townships 45, Ranges 27 and 28, west of the 2nd Principal Meridian, and Townships 44 and 45, Range 1, west of the 3rd Principal Meridian.\n\nWill you please state for the information of the Minister, how this matter stands at present, and what promises have been made to the petitioners?\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Secretary.\n\nE. DEVILLE, Esq., Chief Inspector of Surveys, Ottawa.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 17th January, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that I was this day called upon by Rev. P\u00e8re V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville and Hon. Charles Nolin, in reference to the survey into river lots of the land bordering the south branch of the Saskatchewan River, in Townships 45, Ranges 27 and 28, West 2nd Meridian, and Townships 44 and 45, Range 1 West 3rd Meridian.\n\nThey state that the Government promised that this sub-division into river lots would be made last year, and that it has not been done.\n\nAt their request I promised to submit the matter to your consideration. They will themselves communicate with you on the subject.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nWM. PEARCE, Inspector.\n\nHon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE, PRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T., 17th December, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose herewith file number 924 of this office, covering a letter from Mr. Louis Schmidt and others, as also a petition signed by a number of the inhabitants of the parish of St. Louis de Langevin, praying for a re-survey of the lands on the River Saskatchewan within the parish into lots of ten chains frontage, on a plan similar to that adopted in the parish of St. Laurent.\n\nAs I have already expressed my opinion as to the desirability of such a re-survey, I have the honor to refer you to my previous letters on the subject.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. DUCK, Local Agent.\n\nSecretary of the Department of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\n(Translation.)\n\nST. LOUIS DE LANGEVIN, 9th December, 1883.\n\nMr. Duck,\u2014Since the annexed petition was made and signed, facts have occurred which are well calculated to increase in a two-fold degree our uneasiness with reference to our lands.\n\nTo our knowledge, a person named Thomas Salter has entered a quarter-section of land at your office, and that piece of land, located \u00bc mile from the river, was already taken as a river lot, with the work done thereon, on the bank of the river.\n\nWe regret that the Government did not inform you of its intention to grant river lots, so that you might not be able to enter at your office lands comprised in river lots.\n\nWe hope you will make your Government understand the true position in which we were placed, so that they may put an end to it.\n\nLOUIS SCHMIDT,\nBTE. BOUCHER.\n(Translation.)\n\nST. LOUIS DE LANGEVIN, 19th November, 1883.\n\nSIR,\u2014The undersigned farmers, residents of the parish of St. Louis de Langevin, on the south branch of the Saskatchewan, beg to set forth, as follows, their grievances, in relation to the lands on which they are located.\n\nMany of us are here since the years 1873, 1874 and 1875; others, in still greater numbers, since 1880. Each and all of us took up our lands in accordance with the method formerly prevailing on the lands of the Red River and the Assiniboine\u2014that is to say, in river lots.\n\nIn the autumn of 1880 we petitioned the Minister of the Interior, at Ottawa, for a special survey into river lots, as was granted to the Prince Albert settlement\u2014and to a portion of the St. Lawrence settlement. We all signed that petition, not excepting Michael Canny, who has since entered his lot at your office as a sectional lot, and against whose action we hereby strongly protest.\n\nSince that date, we have sent more petitions, at various times, for the same object, supporting the same with the influence of all persons in authority who took an interest in us, such as Messrs. J. Royal, M. P., D. H. Macdonall, Member North-West Council; L. Clarke, His Lordship Bishop Grandin, and Father Leduc.\n\nFinally, Father Leduc, who had been sent as delegate to Ottawa by the people of Edmonton and St. Albert, showed us the answer of the Government promising a special survey for all located lands on the Saskatchewan. Since then we have waited in vain for the new survey.\n\nAs we stated at the beginning, many of us have occupied our lots long enough to entitle us to patents, and yet there has been no way, as yet, of getting them entered at your office.\n\nWe beg of you to represent to the Government the grievances herein in part set forth, and urge them to put an end thereto as quickly as possible, for the welfare and peace of loyal subjects of Her Majesty the Queen of England,\n\nYour humble servants,\n\nWilliam Bremner, jun.,\nMaxime Lepine,\nOctave Regnier,\nBte.

Lestock Reid, Dominion Lands Surveyor, residing here, be directed to survey the said lands, and that the same be laid out with a frontage of ten chains and a depth of two miles, as other surveys of river lots hereabout. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c., &c.\n\nJames Treston, Thos. Powers,\nR. Gaymore, John Barritt,\nJacob Crosford, Balrom Olson,\nGuy Seaton, William McKinney,\nWm. V.

In reply, I am to inform you that the Minister, among other amendments to the Dominion Lands Act which he has recently proposed for the consideration of Parliament has included a provision for the case of settlers who have complied fully with the spirit of the homestead law before it was possible for them to obtain regular entry. The other points raised in your letter are reserved for the Minister's special consideration.\n\nI have, &c., &c.,\nA. M. BURGESS, Secretary.\n\nLAWRENCE CLARKE, Esq.,\nMember of the North-West Council, Carlton, N.W.T.\n\n16th June, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014Referring to your letter of the 27th March last, addressed to the Prime Minister, on the subject of title to land in the Prince Albert district.\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Minister, among other amendments to the Dominion Lands Act which he proposed for the consideration of Parliament, included a provision to meet the case of those settlers who have complied fully with the homestead law before it was possible for them to obtain regular entry, but it was found impossible to pass the measure through all its stages, and it had to be withdrawn at the last moment, the Minister, at the time, promising that it would be re-introduced next Session.\n\nThe Minister expresses the view that the Crown has no power to deal with lands which, by the law, or allotment to the Hudson Bay Company, except in cases when settlers were in peaceable possession before the passing of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872, assigning to the company certain fixed sections in each township.\n\nSquatters who went into occupation of unsurveyed lands previous to May, 1880, when the Act 43 Vic., chap. 26, came into force, will get their homestead, whether they are found on even sections or on odd, provided they can show that they have been continuously in occupation and cultivating the same up to the time of survey.\n\nGenerally speaking, however, each case will be required to be settled upon its own merits.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\nA. M. BURGESS, Secretary.\n\nHis Honor, Lieutenant-Governor DEWDNEY, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nOFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, 27th March, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to suggest that some early action be taken to enquire into and settle the land question in the district of Prince Albert.\n\nI append a copy of the resolution passed at a public meeting at Prince Albert, in October, 1881, which shows the wants of the settlers.\n\nI also send extract of a letter to me from Mr. Macdowall, a prominent resident of Prince Albert, on the same subject.\n\nAs this is a very thriving and old established settlement, the sooner the question is dealt with the better, as the longer delayed the greater will be the complication.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. DEWDNEY, Indian Commissioner.\n\nRight Hon. Sir J. A. MACDONALD, K.C.B., Stadacona Hall, Ottawa.\n\nThe following is a copy of resolutions passed at a largely attended public meeting, held at Prince Albert, N.W.T., 8th October, 1881:\n\n1. Whereas land was reserved for railway purposes only as late as May, 1881, and previous to that date many bond fide settlers in the district of Lorne, N.W.T.,\nhad performed homestead duties on odd-numbered sections\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant homestead patents to such settlers.\n\n2. Whereas the price of land for pre-emption and purchase was largely increased in May, 1831, and many persons had settled in the district of Lorne, N.W.T., previous to that date\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant to such settlers their land at a price in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time of settlement.\n\n3. Whereas, previous to the survey of this section of the country, many land claims were taken up, occupied and improved by bond fide settlers, and on the survey being made, found themselves on Hudson Bay Company's and school lands; Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to secure such occupants in their holding.\n\n4. Whereas many persons have been settled on land in this district for three years and more, and have performed the homestead duties required by law, and many persons have bought land from such settlers, depending on the good faith of the Government for security in their holding\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant patents to such persons with as little delay as possible.\n\n5. Whereas the Indian title in this Territory has not become extinct, and the old settlers and half-breed population of Manitoba were granted scrip in commutation of such title, and such allowance has not been made to those resident in the territory\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant such scrip to those settlers, thus placing them on an equal footing with their confr\u00e8res in Manitoba.\n\n6. Resolved, that no land entries be made unless they are accepted in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time such lands were taken up.\n\n7. Resolved, that the hon. the member for the district of Lorne be requested to present a copy of the above resolutions to the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior, and to obtain a reply.\n\nTHOMAS McKAY, Chairman.\n\nEXTRACT from McDowall's letter:\n\n\"Patents for land, if issued, would materially improve the prosperity of the settlement. No banks or other such institutions will open business, as there is no security.\n\n\"There is no quantity of money in the settlement in consequence, and therefore trade is carried on under disadvantageous conditions. Farmers live entirely on credit, and consequently have to pay much higher prices for goods than would be the case if they had cash. A much more satisfactory business could be done for cash than on doubtful and extended credit.\n\n\"Reasons for asking for patents\u2014Many persons had performed settlement duty, five, four and three years ago.\n\n\"At the time they settled land was at $1 per acre; it is now raised to $2. Can they not purchase their land at a price in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time of settlement, viz., $1 per acre? Those who went to Prince Albert at that time were among the most advanced of pioneers, and if they had stayed in Manitoba they might have had their land at $1, and got their patents long ago.\n\n\"If, therefore, they are charged $2, it will be placing a heavy tax on enterprise.\n\n\"The land at Prince Albert was surveyed five years ago, but many were settled before survey, consequently some anomalies have arisen, many find themselves on odd-numbered, school and Hudson Bay Company's sections.\n\n\"Transactions in land have gone on as though there were security, as the people have had every confidence that they could depend on the good faith of the Government in granting patents and dealing with such cases. Thus, some more difficulties have arisen. A settler on some land, when surveyed, it turns out to be an even-numbered section. He resides three years; does homestead duty; and sells to\nB; B resides two years, further improves the land and then sells to C; C is a merchant in the town; he pays a good price for the claim and further improves it, but resides in town attending to his business there. He cannot take the homestead oath, as he cannot reside on the land; no one else can homestead it, as the land is improved, and consequently denied to outsiders. Being an even-numbered section, it cannot be sold. What is to be done? Can C purchase it at $1 per acre? It was taken up when land was that price, and there was no distinction between odd and even numbered sections.\n\nD. H. McDOWALL.\n\nCARLTON, N.W.T., 25th January, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd November last, embodying the reply of the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior to a memorial, handed in by me, of certain resolutions passed at a meeting of the inhabitants of the district of Lorne, held at Prince Albert on the 18th October, 1881.\n\nWith regard to resolution No. 3, it is remarked that:\n\n\"As by treaty with the Indians, their title to any portion of the Territory included within the district of Lorne, has been extinguished, this resolution would need explanation.\"\n\nI would respectfully submit that the Indian title, no doubt, has been extinguished, but evidently not that of the half-breed residents of the North-West Territories.\n\nThe Government of the Dominion of Canada have repeatedly acknowledged the right in the soil of the half-breed inhabitants, as is proved\u2014\n\nBy the Parliament of Canada, in 1870, 33 Vic., chap. 3, section 31, as follows:\u2014\n\n\"And whereas, it is expedient towards the extinguishment of the Indian title to the lands in the Province to appropriate a portion of such ungranted lands, to the extent of 1,400,000 acres thereof, for the benefit of the families of the half-breed residents, it is hereby enacted that under regulations to be, from time to time, made by the Governor General of Canada in Council, the Lieutenant-Governor shall select such lots or tracts in such part of the Province as he may deem expedient, to the extent aforesaid, and divide the same among the children of the half-breed heads of families residing in the Province at the time of the said transfer to Canada, and the same shall be granted to the said children respectively, in such mode and in such condition as of settlement and otherwise, as the Governor General in Council may, from time to time, determine.\"\n\nIn 1874 the Parliament of Canada passed an explanatory Act to that of 1870, and by 37 Vic., Chap. 20, limit the grant of 1,400,000 acres to the half-breed children of heads of families residing in the Province at the time of the transfer of the country to Canada, and providing for the granting of land scrip to each half-breed head of a family, of the nominal value of a quarter-section $160, resident in Manitoba on the 15th July, 1870.\n\nIn all treaties made outside the boundaries of the Province of Manitoba with Indians the half breeds' right to participate therein was acknowledged, and numbers of those people were admitted into treaties.\n\nThe Indian Act of 1876, paragraph (e) of sub-section 3, specially confirms this right, in these words:\u2014\n\n\"3. The term Indian means\u2014\n\"1st. Any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band.\n\"2nd. Any child of such person.\n\"3rd. Any woman who is or was lawfully married to such person.\"\n\nAnd in an Act assented to on the 15th May, 1879, styled an Act to amend \"The Indian Act, 1876,\" paragraph (e) of sub-section 3, of section 3, of \"The Indian Act, 1876\" is hereby amended, by adding at the end thereof the words:\u2014\n\n\"And any half breed who may have been admitted into a treaty should be allowed to withdraw therefrom on refusing all annuity money received by him or...\"\nher under the said treaty, or suffering a corresponding reduction in the quantity of any land or scrip which such half-breeds, as such, may be entitled to receive from the Government.\"\n\nIn 1879 the Government excluded half-breeds from being admitted into purely Indian treaties, and in the same year, in the general provisions of the Consolidated Lands Act of 1879, in section 125, sub-section (c) there is provision made:\n\n\"To satisfy any claims existing in connection with the extinguishment of the Indian title preferred by half-breeds resident in the North-West Territories, outside of the limits of Manitoba, on the fifteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, by granting land to such persons to such extent and on such terms and conditions as may be expedient.\"\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that from the first enactment, in 1870, to the last, in 1879, the rights in the soil of the half-breed have been recognized by the Government and provision made for the extinguishment of their title.\n\nA very strong memorial on this subject was laid before the North-West Council at its last meeting in June, 1881, and a resolution adopted by that body that the memorial should be remitted to the Governor General of Canada, with a recommendation that His Excellency would be pleased to draw the attention of His Ministers to the grievance complained of.\n\nAt Prince Albert, on the 19th instant, I had the honor of reading your letter to a large assembly of my constituents, when much satisfaction was testified for the concessions made by the Minister of the Interior with regard to their lands.\n\nA strong feeling of regret, at the same time, was expressed that the law debarred the pioneer settlers, who had performed all settlement duties prior to the opening of the local lands office, from obtaining immediate patents for their lots, and a confident reliance that on further consideration the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior would have the law amended so as to allow of this just grievance being redressed.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. CLARKE,\nMember N.W. Council for District of Lorne.\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Esq., Deputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\n(telegram.)\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA, 1st December, 1881.\n\nTo L.

Clarke,\n\nLetter was mailed to you, addressed Winnipeg, on the 22nd instant.\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 22nd November, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014By direction of the Minister of the Interior, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of memorial handed in by you, of certain resolutions passed at a meeting of the inhabitants of the district of Lorne (which you represent in the North-West Council), held at Prince Albert on the 18th October, 1881.\n\nIn reply to the questions involved in the several resolutions contained therein, I am to say as follows:\n\nResolution No. 1. The holders of the meeting were evidently under a misapprehension as to the date of which the withdrawal of odd-numbered sections from homestead entry was ordered by Government. It was on the 9th July, 1879, that an Order in Council was first passed to that effect, and it was made public in the Official Gazette, and generally through the newspapers of the Dominion. Those who were actual settlers previous to that time, and who have since continued to be such, by their own residence on and cultivation of the quarter-sections taken, shall be allowed homesteads and pre-emptions as if the sections on which they settled were still open for this class of entries, but by the law no patent can issue until the expiration of the three years after the date of entry. Nothing short of the authority of Parliament could permit of the patent being granted earlier.\n\nResolution No. 2. The request contained in this resolution will be granted, so far as concerns quarter sections which have been actually settled upon and improved, on evidence being furnished of the nature of such settlement and extent of improvement, satisfactory to the Minister, being requisite in each case, and the privilege being granted or withheld as the facts may warrant.\n\nResolution No. 3. As by treaty with the Indians their title to any portion of the territory included within the district of Lorne has been extinguished, this resolution would need explanation.\n\nResolution No. 4. Answer to the request in resolution No. 4 is included in replies above.\n\nResolution No. 5. The law provides that in cases where an actual settler occupies and cultivates land in unsurveyed territory, which proves, on survey, to be a quarter-section of school land, he is permitted to obtain homestead entry therefor, other land being selected in lieu thereof for the purposes of school land.\n\nIn cases of similar settlement on Hudson Bay Company's lands, the option rests with the company whether or not to surrender the land and accept other in lien thereof from the Government. Hitherto, in cases of bond fide settlement in advance of survey, the company has always consented to such an exchange.\n\nIn closing; I am to say that the Minister will cause enquiry to be made, through his own officers, with reference to the several subjects of these resolutions, and will, on their report, have such action taken in the premises as may be in accordance with law, and necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nLINDSAY RUSSELL, Acting Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHon. LAWRENCE CLARKE, Member of the N.W. Council, at Toronto.\n\n(Telegram from Toronto)\n\nOTTAWA, 21st November, 1881.\n\nTo LINDSAY RUSSELL, Deputy Minister Interior.\n\nI leave for the west by evening train. Have you mailed despatches? Please reply.\n\nL. CLARKE.\n\nRESOLUTIONS passed at a largely attended meeting representing the entire District of Lorne, North-West Territories, held at Prince Albert, N.W.T., 8th October, 1881.\n\n1. Whereas land was reserved for railway purposes, only as late as May, 1881, and previous to that date many bond fide settlers in the district of Lorne, N.W.T.,\nhad performed homestead duties, on odd-numbered sections\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant homestead patents to such settlers.\n\nMoved by Mr. Powell, seconded by Mr. Bishop, carried unanimously.\n\n2. Whereas, the price of lands for pre-emption and purchase was largely increased in May, 1881, and many persons had settled in the District of Lorne, N.W.T., previous to that date\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant to such settlers their lands at a price in accordance with the Order in Council existing at the time of settlement.\n\nMoved by Mr. Miller, seconded by Mr. Spencer. Carried unanimously.\n\n3. Whereas the Indian title in this district or Territory has not become extinct, and the old settlers and half-breed population of Manitoba were granted scrip in commutation of such title, and such allowance has not been made to those resident in this Territory\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant such scrip to such settlers, thus placing them on an equal footing with their confr\u00e8res in Manitoba.\n\nMoved by Mr. Erasmus, seconded by Mr. Baker. Carried unanimously.\n\n4. Whereas many persons have been settled on land in this district for three years and more, and have performed the homestead duties required by law; and many persons have bought land from such settlers, depending on the good faith of the Government for security in their holding such land\u2014Resolved, that the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior be requested to grant patents to such persons with as little delay as possible.\n\nMoved by Mr. Campbell, seconded by Mr. Dilworth. Carried unanimously.\n\n5. Whereas, previous to the survey of this section of country land was taken up and improved by bond fide settlers, and on the surveys being made they found themselves on school or Hudson Bay Company's lands\u2014Resolved, that such occupant be secured in such holding.\n\nMoved by Mr. Bartlett, seconded by Mr. Deacon. Carried unanimously.\n\n6. Whereas the Lands Office being at last opened\u2014Resolved, that no entries of land claims shall be made until a satisfactory reply has been received to the above resolutions.\n\nMoved by Mr. Dilworth, seconded by Mr. Erasmus. Carried unanimously.\n\n7. Resolved that the Hon. the member for the district of Lorne be requested to present a copy of the above resolutions to the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior, and obtain a reply, to be sent to the chairman of this meeting.\n\nMoved by Mr. McDowall, seconded by Mr. Miller. Carried unanimously.\n\nH. MacBEATH, Secretary.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa, 13th March, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014Your letter, dated the 8th December last, addressed to the Minister of the Interior, in reference to the settlement of the claims of half-breeds in the Fort Qu'Appelle district was duly received.\n\nThe Minister has himself been very anxious to have this question settled, and on the 18th September last Mr. A. Walsh, Commissioner of Dominion Lands at Winnipeg, was instructed to visit this locality and make an investigation into the claims of these half-breeds, and other matters. Owing, however, to an unusual pressure of business, Mr. Walsh has so far been unable to visit this locality, but he has again been written to, and requested to make this investigation at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nI have, &c., JOHN R. HALL, Secretary.\n\nT. W. JACKSON, Esq. (Jarvis & Jackson, Barristers, &c.), Troy P.O., Assiniboia.\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES, FORT QU'APPHELLE, 8th December, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014You will pardon the liberty I now take in addressing you privately, when I tell you that it is at the urgent request of a large deputation of half-breeds that I do so. They, in common with the country, have heard of the generally satisfactory settlement of the \"mile belt\" and \"reserve\" question, and urge, perhaps with reason, that if their own grievances, upon which the Government have been repeatedly petitioned and memorialized, were brought personally to your notice, some immediate action would be taken. Under any circumstances there would not be very many to deal with, and the settlement of their claims need not be a troublesome one. But there are half-breeds in the Territories who have never received anything from the Government, and who, it has been admitted, are entitled to some consideration.\n\nThe new regulations from your Department, I have reason to know, are considered satisfactory, and I beg to be allowed to congratulate yourself and the Government on the solution.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nT. W. JACKSON, Member of the North-West Council.\n\nHon. Senator Macpherson, Department of Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOTTAWA, 19th March, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to return files No. 57126 and 42479, handed to me by your Department, in reference to half-breed and mission claims in the valley of the Qu'Appelle.\n\nLast summer I forwarded a petition from the half-breeds, in reference to their claims in this district, to the Department of Interior, on the occasion of a claim being made by the Qu'Appelle and Ontario Land Company to some of their land.\n\nThere are a number of half-breeds in this district who have been settled in the Qu'Appelle valley for many years. These went on their usual hunt for buffalo, returning to their homes at different times during each year; others have settled since 1879, and have remained pretty constantly on their land.\n\nThe Dominion land surveys have demonstrated that many of them have been living on the same section, and as land became valuable a scramble was made by land speculators to obtain the right, titles and interest of those settled in the most favored localities.\n\nThe sooner the claims of these half-breeds are determined the better, as a number of them are bona fide settlers and deserve consideration.\n\nThese settlers have not claimed their land, as was done in some parts of the North-West, by small frontages, running back some miles, although the bulk of them built their homesteads close to each other, and near the water, where they could easily catch fish. They, however, consider they are entitled to as much land in area as they would have been had they taken up their claims as had been the custom with half-breeds. It is very difficult to suggest a plan for the settlement of their claims, but if the parties are unable to agree among themselves as to a fair division of the properties, the simplest way would be to sell them, and divide the proceeds among the claimants, after deducting the Government price of the land, and giving the claimants the privilege of selecting homesteads on any unoccupied Government land in other localities, for which an immediate patent might be issued, provided they had occupied their old claim for some years.\n\nIf the question of the settlement of these claims is to be left to arbitration or to a commissioner, a very careful selection should be made, in the interest of the Government and the half-breeds. A perfectly independent man should be appointed, and one in no way connected with the land speculators in the Qu'Appelle district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nH. DEWDNEY.\n\nRight Hon. the Minister of the Interior.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 6th July, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Minister of the Interior to send you herewith the enclosed copies of the correspondence concerning the claims of certain half-breed settlers in the Qu'Appelle valley, and to request that you will, at your convenience, investigate and report upon these claims.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Acting Secretary.\n\nA. WALSH, Esq., Commissioner Dominion Lands, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 6th July, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 29th of August last, enclosing a petition from sundry half-breed settlers of the Qu'Appelle valley, with reference to their claims to certain parcels of land along the said valley, I am directed by the Minister of the Interior to inform you that the correspondence in this matter has been referred to Mr. Commissioner Walsh for investigation and report.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJOHN R. HALL, Acting Secretary.\n\nHis Honor the Hon. EDGAR DEWDNEY,\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Regina, Ass.\n\n(Telegram.)\n\n29th August, 1883.\n\nFrom Qu'Appelle, via Troy, N.W.T., to Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nHalf-breeds holding old claims in valley waited on me today, and complain that Osler Land Company are warning them off and claiming their lands; would recommend that this company be notified not to interfere with them; have written.\n\nE. DEWDNEY.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 13th September, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated 29th ult., enclosing a petition from sundry half-breed settlers of the Qu'Appelle valley, with reference to their claims to certain parcels of land along the said valley.\n\nThe petition of the half-breeds will be submitted to the Minister on his return to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. RUSSELL, for the Surveyor-General.\n\nHon. E. DEWDNEY, Lieutenant-Governor N.W.T.; Qu'Appelle, N.W.T.\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE,\nQu'Appelle, N.W.T., 29th August, 1882.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose you, under cover, a petition from sundry half-breed settlers of the Qu'Appelle valley, with reference to their claims to certain parcels of land along said valley.\n\nThe declarations set forth in the petition are, to my knowledge, generally correct. I have informed the petitioners that I will duly communicate to them your answer in connection with the said petition.\n\nWith reference to these claims, I yesterday had the honor to address a telegram to you, and the recommendation therein contained I now beg to reiterate.\n\nAs I glean that many of the claims are somewhat conflicting, and in some instances run part on even and part on odd-numbered sections, I would respectfully suggest that either Mr. Commissioner Walsh or Mr. Inspector Pearce be instructed\nto examine into and adjust them on an equitable basis, and that without delay, as the half-breeds interested are very uneasy about their holdings, and may be looked upon as the pioneers of the district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. DEWDNEY, Lieutenant-Governor, N.W.T.\n\nRight Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, K.C.B.,\nMinister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nTo the Hon. Edgar Dewdney, Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.T.\n\nThe petition of the undersigned half-breed settlers,\u2014HUMBLY SHOWETH:\n\n1. That as far back as the year 1860, and up to 1879, we settled or squatted on land situate on the banks of the Qu'Appelle River, erected comfortable dwellings and outbuildings thereon, ploughed and cultivated the soil, and, by continual residence, have complied with all the Government conditions.\n\n2. That we have erected a church and school in a central position, built and opened up roads and bridges, and made numerous improvements, which are to-day of great value to the new settler.\n\n3. That the surveys lately made have discovered some of us to be on railway land, now owned by the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Company\u2014whose agent has informed us that we must either buy the land from them or move off\u2014in fact, we are informed that they have sold some of the land at present occupied by a bond fide settler.\n\n4. That we have refused to comply with the request of the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Company, and claim a patent from the Crown for our respective pieces of land, or quarter-sections, fully believing that we are justly and legally entitled to the same.\n\n5. We would, therefore, respectfully ask Your Honor to lay our claims before the Right Hon. the Minister of Interior (who, we know will do us justice in the matter), and request his earliest attention and answer.\n\nAnd your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c.\n\nJohn Simpson, his Pollyon + Blondeau, mark his\n\nAntoine + La Roque, mark his\n\nSimon + Blondeau, mark his\n\nLouis + Flamand, mark\n\nPierre Poitras, his\n\nBaptiste + Robillard, mark his\n\nMatthias + Desfirlais, mark his\n\nXavier + Perrault, mark his\n\nAntoine + Amelain, mark his\n\nKenneth + McKenzie, mark\n\nLeon + Nault, mark his\n\nBaptiste + Dauphine, mark his\n\nAntoine + Fayant, mark\nPierre + St. Denis,\nmark\n\nNapoleon + Amelain,\nmark\n\nJoseph + Blayan,\nmark\n\nLouison + Blondeau,\nmark\n\nZaccharie + Blondeau,\nmark\n\nBaptiste + Rou\u00e9,\nmark\n\nFran\u00e7ois + Perrault,\nmark\n\nJohn A. + Cline,\nmark\n\nCamillo + Perrault,\nmark\n\nBaptiste + Perrault,\nmark\n\nChrysostome + Robillard,\nmark\n\nAndre + Flamand,\nmark\n\nMaxime + Flamand,\nmark\n\nJean + Blondeau,\nmark\n\nAntoine + Laroque,\nmark\n\nAntoine + Fayant, jun.,\nmark\n\nSimon + Blondeau, jun.,\nmark\n\nJoseph Marion,\nhis\n\nWm. + Fayant,\nmark\n\nIsidore + Plante,\nmark\n\nGustave + Brabant,\nmark\n\nEdouard + Brabant,\nmark\n\nAlex. + Brabant,\nmark\n\nNorman + Welsh,\nmark\n\nAlphonse + Martin,\nmark\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 22nd July, 1881.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014The undersigned submits for the information of the Acting Minister the file herewith, on the subject of the claims preferred by half-breeds in the North-West Territories to lands or scrip following upon the grants in this behalf made by Parliament to the half-breeds of Manitoba.\n\nIn reference to the class of half-breeds who moved from Manitoba to the North-West Territories without having received land or scrip, mentioned by Mr. Lawrence Clarke, the undersigned may state that proofs as to the right of many of these people to participate in land or scrip have been investigated, but the returns did not come in time to enable the persons who would appear to be entitled to participate in the land grant of $1,400,000 acres before the said grant had become entirely exhausted. It remains now for the Government to say whether they will make an additional grant to meet such claims, whether they will issue scrip to meet the demands, or, finally, whether, in view of its being, to a considerable extent, the fault of the parties themselves, that their claims were not made in time, they should be refused altogether.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHon. D. L. MACPHERSON, Acting Minister of the Interior.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, BATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 14th June, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to transmit herewith copies of two memorials of Lawrence Clarke, Esq., one relating to the claims of half-breeds now residing in the\nNorth-West Territories, and entitled to land or scrip in the Province of Manitoba, and the other relating to the claims of half-breeds residing, at the time of the transfer, outside of the limits of what became the Province of Manitoba, but being at that time in the North-West Territories.\n\nThese memorials were presented to the Council of the North-West Territories at its recent session, and as they relate to subjects exclusively within the control of the Dominion Government and Parliament, I was requested, by a resolution of Council, passed on the 16th instant, to transmit copies thereof to be laid before His Excellency the Governor General, and to express the hope that His Excellency may be pleased to draw the attention of his Ministers to the grievances complained of.\n\nI trust you will have the goodness, at an early day, to bring the subjects to which these memorials refer, under the consideration of His Excellency in Council.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\n\nRight Hon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nCopy of a Memorial from L. Clarke, Esq., member of the North-West Council for the Electoral District of Lorne, to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n\nCOUNCIL CHAMBER, GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\nBATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 6th June, 1881.\n\nYour Honor and Gentlemen,\u2014The undersigned has the honor to represent, for the consideration of Your Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,\n\nThat there are residents within the North-West Territories, in various settlements, but more particularly, so far as the personal knowledge of the undersigned extends, about Edmonton, Carlton, Duck Lake, St. Laurent, Prince Albert and Qu'Appelle, a number of half-breeds who were residents in what is now the Province of Manitoba, at and before the 15th day of July, 1870, but who, in the interval between this date and the distribution of the scrips and lands specially provided in the terms of transfer, had removed from their residences, and are now living in the North-West Territories.\n\nThat the undersigned, from such information as he has been able to collect, is quite convinced the total number of the above described class of half-breeds is not large, and that proof of their claims has long since, in the majority of cases, been taken by Mr. Ryan, before his commission lapsed, or since by the local land agents, and which proof, for some time back, has been in the possession of the Department of the Interior at Ottawa.\n\nThat these half-breeds, in many instances, were not aware of the sittings of the commissioners in Manitoba being limited in point of time, and in nearly every instance, even had they been aware of such being the case, were not possessed of means to bear the expense consequent upon attendance thereat.\n\nThat the general feeling of the community is that these half-breeds, possessing even rights with those who have already received scrip or grants of land in Manitoba, have not had that measure of justice meted out to them to which, by the terms of the surrender, they were entitled.\n\nThe undersigned considers the subject as one of considerable importance, very desirable for the peace, welfare and good government of the Territories, and should be taken up and adjusted by the Dominion Government with as little further delay as possible.\n\nAnd therefore the undersigned respectfully recommends that with the approval of Council Your Honor may see fit to bring the subject of dealing expeditiously, equitably and finally, with the claims of the class of half-breeds above mentioned, under the notice of His Excellency the Governor General.\n\nI have the honor to be, Your Honor and gentleman,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nL. CLARKE,\n\nMember North-West Council for Electoral District of Lorne.\n\nCertified\u2014A. E. Forget, Clerk of the Council.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, Battleford.\nCopy of a Memorial, from L. Clarke, Esq., Member North-West Council, for the Electoral District of Lorne, to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,\n\nCOUNCIL CHAMBER, GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\n\nBATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 7th June, 1881.\n\nYour Honor and Gentlemen,\u2014The undersigned has the honor to represent:\u2014\n\nThat a feeling of dissatisfaction and discontent exists among the half-breed element of the North-West Territories.\n\nThat such feeling has arisen from what these half-breeds consider a disregard of their rights, and in the opinion of many, whose standing in the country gives such opinion weight, has, to some extent, at least, increased the difficulties encountered by the Dominion Government in their dealing with the Indians, between whom and the whites the half-breeds form a distinct class, possessing, as a rule, great influence over the Indians.\n\nThat the half-breeds have always been recognized as possessing rights in the same soil, subject to which the Dominion accepted the transfer of the Territories, and while ample provision has been made for those resident in Manitoba on the 15th July, 1870, nothing, so far, has been done towards extinguishing that portion of the Indian title to lands in the Territories outside of the Province of Manitoba, as originally formed by the Act of 1870.\n\nThe undersigned further draws attention to the fact that by law the half-breeds are excluded from the benefit conferred upon Indians.\n\nThat the undersigned has been given to understand several petitions from various quarters have been presented to the Dominion Government on the subject of the half-breeds particularly referred to, but no notice taken thereof.\n\nThat the undersigned knows that a considerable portion of these half-breeds were and are still residents of the electoral district of Lorne, and feels, as the electoral representative of that district, his duty to bring under notice their grievance, in the hopes that some action may be taken at an early day towards removing what seems to be just cause for complaint.\n\nThe undersigned recommends that through Your Honor in Council the attention of His Excellency be respectfully drawn to the subject, and he be memorialized to direct the attention of his Ministers to the position of the half-breeds, who, at the transfer to Canada were and still are residents of the North-West Territories, and have not become parties to Indian treaties, and the taking of such steps as may lead to a speedy adjustment of the grievances they labor under.\n\nI have the honor to be, Your Honor and gentlemen,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nL. CLARKE,\nMember North-West Council for the Electoral District of Lorne.\n\nCertified\u2014A. E. Forget, Clerk of the Council.\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, Battleford.\n\nOTTAWA, 13th January, 1880.\n\nDear Col. Dennis,\u2014Having passed three years in the North-West, and during that period seen a good deal of the half-breed population, the following, induced by the remarks of the Right Hon. the Premier, in my presence, last Saturday, may not be out of place, the subject of dealing with the half-breed element of the North-West being, as I then gathered, intended for early discussion:\u2014\n\n1st. These half-breeds claim and insist that as a distinct class they have a share in the Indian title to the lands outside of Manitoba, which has not been extinguished, and, as such distinct class, entitled equally with the half-breeds of Manitoba to special consideration. That grounds exist for such contention appears by reference to statutes of Canada, 1870, chap. 3, sec. 31.\n\n2nd. Admitting these half-breeds might (as some few have, but now regret) join in the Indian treaties, I am convinced such a contingency is not only not probable,\nbut that, if requested, they would reject the offer; besides, I do not think their joining in the Indian treaties would be in the public interest, but decidedly the opposite.\n\nHow best to deal with the element has, as you are aware, been considered, and you already hold my views on the subject.\n\nI may, however, be permitted to express the opinion, that opportunities now present themselves for removing the dissatisfaction existing among these people, and securing their good will towards the Government, because: 1st. Their former occupation as hunters is gone. 2nd. They are as a class destitute. A further reason for urging, as I respectfully do, early action, is that they are scattered among the Indians, and latterly subjected to the evil influences of leading spirits of the Manitoba troubles of 1870, who, during the past season, have been traversing the country, doing at least \"no good.\"\n\nI am faithfully yours,\n\nHUGH W. RICHARDSON.\n\nLieut-Col. DENNIS, Deputy Minister Interior.\n\nOTTAWA, 1st December, 1879:\n\nMEMORANDUM.\u2014I have carefully read over the propositions contained in file 208, as requested by the Deputy Minister of the Interior, and submit the following ideas upon the printed remarks of that official:\n\nCol. Dennis suggests three courses for dealing with the half-breed element of the North-West, but very properly, as I think, disposes of two numbers\u2014one and two\u2014as impracticable, as number three suggestion is, I think, the only satisfactory way of meeting the difficulties which seem to beset the Government.\n\nAs soon as steps are taken to ascertain the number of half-breeds in the Territories who have not already shared in the Manitoba grants, the scheme suggested by Col. Dennis, in the conclusion of his memorandum, could, I think, give satisfaction generally.\n\nI differ, however, with Col. Dennis on one or two details. I do not think that greater educational facilities should be given to them than to the other settlers; and if it be that they are to be provided with schools and teachers without contributing any portion of the expense, the white population will, I think, have fairly just grounds to claim similar rights, and to grant this would not be practicable at present. Reduced to few words, my ideas on the educational point, would be a general scheme applicable to all, by which the Government, on the establishment of schools in settlements, should contribute a fair proportion of the cost of maintenance.\n\nIt should not be overlooked, in this connection, that the North-West Territories Act of 1875 has introduced into the Territories, the Separate School system. See North-West Territories Act, 1875, section 11.\n\nI do not think that it would be necessary to provide teachers to instruct these people how to raise and care for stock, because there is hardly a family in which such is not understood, and it is from these people the whites learn how to take care of stock in that climate.\n\nI have also to state that I have read Archbishop Tach\u00e9's remarks, and differ with him in the mode suggested for settling down half-breeds. His Grace limits the proposed settlements entirely to the formation of small colonies.\n\nMy experience of three years goes to show that while, as a rule, it is very desirable to have these isolated settlements or small colonies, yet there are here and there occasional instances where the half-breed families prefer locating themselves in the neighborhood of existing settlements and acting independently.\n\nA scheme being adopted for the assisting of these half-breeds might be very readily extended, so as to give a proportionate share in the shape of implements and seeds to families preferring independent locations.\n\nOf course the land itself should not be granted to these people for at least a long term of years, and then only in cases where farms have been established. The time limited (three years) for acceptance of the scheme is, I think, ample for every purpose.\n\nHUGH RICHARDSON.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 17th April, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 13th ult., expressing your general approval of the suggestion contained in my confidential memorandum to the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior, respecting the half-breeds of the N.W.T., copy of which I forwarded to you in December last, and conveying, further, your views respecting the policy which should be pursued toward that class of the population.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ.S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.T., Battleford, N.W.T.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, BATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 13th March, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014Your letter of the 27th December, covering a copy of your confidential memorandum to the Minister of the Interior, respecting the half-breeds of the Territories, was not received until the 24th of February. The first out-going mail since will leave here in a few days, and though the business of the parliamentary session will probably be nearly concluded before this letter reaches you, yet it may not be too late to express my general approval of the suggestions contained in your memorandum.\n\nIf a number of half-breeds would express the desire to settle down at once together, I most certainly think that land should, for a short time, be reserved to them for that purpose. But I believe it would be a mistake to thus lock up land for a longer period than two or three years.\n\nThe North-West Council did not recommend that the half-breeds should be provided with school teachers at the expense of the Dominion, but if the General Government can undertake this duty, and especially if the teachers selected are able to instruct the people in raising stock and in practical agriculture, I feel certain that the members of the Council would consider that a great difficulty had been met in a liberal spirit.\n\nWith respect to industrial schools for this country, I have doubts whether their benefits would be commensurate with the cost. At any rate, some time must elapse before their advantages would be felt. The wants of the Indians and half-breeds are pressing, and it appears to me that the same money that would support industrial schools could, in the meantime, be better employed in hiring a few practical men to go at once in the reserves and teach them how to plough, sow and save their crops, in order that, if possible, starvation in its worst forms may be averted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\n\nColonel Dennis, Deputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 1st March, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Col. Dennis,\u2014I could not see the Hon. James McKay before yesterday. He received me in his room, and what with his rheumatism and his wife's death, he seemed much broken. He asked for another interview, and fixed Monday as the day he would like to meet me, as he wanted a little time for consideration. His knowledge of the whole question is perfect. I think, however, some of his ideas and plans are not the outcome of the standpoint of public policy pure and simple. I leave here on Tuesday morning, if the train runs. This week it did not run for three days, that I am told some arrangement which will secure more regularity has been made. I have now seen everybody who could give me any information. Quite a number have called on me. Some of the testimony is conflicting, but I think my ideas of the situation are full and correct.\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\nN. FLOOD DAVIN.\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 22nd February, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Col. Dennis,\u2014I have not yet, owing to the illness and death of his wife, had an interview with Hon. J. McKay. I have seen everybody else of importance here. I wish I could see some Methodist authority, also a church of England authority. My interviews with Archbishop Tach\u00e9 and Father Lacombe are not concluded, because they have not yet been able to make up their minds. Both are wholly opposed to Qu'Appelle. I hope some time next week to meet Mr. McKay (who sent me a message to-day) and to conclude my labors. I received your letter and suggestions, for which, thanking you,\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\nNICHOLAS FLOOD DAVIN.\n\nHon. Col. Dennis, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\n2 Little Deansford, Westminster, S.W., 15th February, 1879.\n\nDear Colonel Dennis,\u2014Your confidential paper on the half-breeds of the North-West came by a later mail.\n\nI am afraid that my knowledge of them is too limited to give much value to anything I can say.\n\nI suspect the great difficulty will be actually to bend their minds to the taking of farming as their life work. They will be inclined always to choose a location rather for its opportunities for hunting and fishing than for good soil or farming capabilities. They need then, above all, at the fort, a wise and trusted adviser to guide them right in their choice of settlement. Still, I should be averse to any setting apart of reserves for them, either on their own account or that of the Government. I think they are as entitled to a free choice of the whole land as any other settlers, but not to the tying up of choice land to suit their whim. Still there would be a great advantage to them to be grouped together. The hiring of a teacher would be much for the advantage of the country in helping their settlement. In their case it might be well to encourage grouping, by restricting the promise of a teacher to a group of fifty or more families. I think the giving of such a teacher would be a great help and a great inducement for settling. If the Government do it not in the way of giving a saw or a coat to a chief, but with a sense of its importance and the time to fulfil, as far as they can, the promise. I confess that, as far as I understand the matter, the promise of a teacher under the Indian treaties has scarcely been fulfilled. The Government seem to feel themselves at liberty to deal out rules that virtually make the promise inoperative.\n\nThe band at Islington, on the Winnipeg River, had the promise of a teacher. The majority are christians. Quite a few families have already settled. But the Government made a regulation that if the number of children were under, I think, twenty-five, there should only be a grant of $100. A grant of only $100 in those wilds would, ordinarily, be equivalent to a refusal of a teacher. It would only be of use as being supplemented by a gift from a missionary body. But can such be the natural meaning of the promise of a teacher?\n\nAgain, in the Indian settlement only one grant was allowed, though there was a large population, with many children, scattered over many miles, requiring several schools. Probably in this case the letter of the treaty was fulfilled, but was the spirit or the policy that dictated the offer of a teacher? The Local Government grant in Manitoba allows the full grant to any new settlement having 100 children. Should the Government of the Dominion, after its promise and its policy, act in so niggardly a spirit with the grants for teaching? Now, we hope we have secured a very experienced American clergyman to take charge of the missions at the Sioux reserve, just outside Manitoba. He is to arrive in June. Both he and his wife have been seven years over a Sioux mission, and speak Sioux. I am sure it would greatly help what is so important for the country\u2014the settling of the Sioux. If the Government would so far work with us as to provide a teacher in farming with us, but such a\nteacher is surely as much needed in the early days, when settlers have to be attracted and encouraged to settle, and taught agriculture, as when there is a settled community that is living by farming, and can afford 50 children or 60 children. When should the Indians have a teacher for farming but when they begin? Surely not when, by other means, they have already had some teaching. I mention this because I think your suggestion is most important, only to be important it must be the result of a deliberately-weighed policy to be effectively carried out, and not as far as possible, for economical reasons, to be neutralised.\n\nI feel gifts of implements and seed are necessary at first and may have to be partially renewed, but the less of such gifts the better. They are apt to do mischief; but competent teaching and help in education and farming, &c., would, to my mind, be a great boon and blessing.\n\nI am, Dear Col. Dennis, very sincerely yours,\n\nR., RUPERTS LAND.\n\nCOL. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., 7th February, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Sir John Macdonald,\u2014I drop you a line just to let you know how I am getting on. I arrived here on Thursday morning, and in the afternoon presented the introduction to Sir Edward Thornton, who received me very kindly and asked particularly about you. In the evening he sent to my hotel a letter with some introductions, which I have found useful. The Hon. Carl-Schultz took considerable interest in our project, and having talked with me a considerable time, sent me to the Indian Commissioner, with whom I spent the greater part of a day. He had to start for New York before he could give me all the information I required. Before doing so he made an appointment for me with the leading men of the Cree and Cherokee nations, with whom, today, I have had a long conference. I have got from them a great many facts bearing in a striking manner on my mission. Mr. Hayt, the commissioner, will be back on Monday, when I hope to meet him at 10 a.m., and having gathered what further information he has to impart, I will leave for St. Paul, which is the most distant point a ticket is issued for here. I dropped into the Senate and also into the House of Representatives. In the Senate I heard a \"smart man\" read his printed speech, while some sixteen senators chatted in small groups.\n\nI am, my dear Sir John, yours sincerely,\n\nN. FLOOD DAVIN.\n\nDear Col. Dennis,\u2014In accordance with the request of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I have considered, with the greatest attention, your \"remarks on the condition of the half-breeds of the North-West Territories,\" and beg to submit the following observations on the same subject, expecting that you will be kind enough to bring this document to the notice of the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nI will divide my observations as follows:\n\n1st. The importance of the half-breed question in the North-West.\n2nd. What ought to be avoided when alluding to the half-breeds.\n3rd. Grant of lands.\n4th. Help in farming to be given.\n5th. Schools.\n6th. Industrial schools.\n7th. Speedy settlement of the whole matter.\n\nAllow me to use many of your own words in the expression of my convictions:\n\n1st\u2014Importance of the Half-breed Question.\n\nIt must be freely admitted that the half-breeds of the North-West have a claim to favorable consideration. Great uneasiness is felt by them in consequence of no steps having yet been taken in their behalf. A liberal policy on the part of the\nGovernment would attract to its side a moral and physical power, which the present critical relations of the various tribes of Indians towards each other, and towards the Government, would prove of the greatest value to the Dominion. On the other hand, the half-breed element, if dissatisfied, would turn a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of the Territories. There is no doubt that the state of affairs in the Territories in relation to the Indians and half-breeds is calling for the serious consideration of the Government, and measures should be adopted to cultivate and maintain relations with the half-breed population calculated to attach them to us.\n\nThe formidable Indian question has not yet arisen in our midst, owing, largely, to the influence of the half-breed element. The disparition of the buffalo, and especially the extension of the settlers in the Indian country, are preparing difficulties which may be avoided, I hope, but which would otherwise involve such terrible and expensive results that it is the duty of all the friends of the Government, and of the country, to do all in their power to prevent such misfortune.\n\nThe result depends, in a great measure, on the way the half-breeds will be treated. Friendly disposed, they will mightily contribute to the maintenance of peace; dissatisfied, they would not only add to the difficulty, but render the establishment of the country the next thing to an impossibility.\n\n2nd\u2014What ought to be avoided when alluding to Half-breeds.\n\nIt is important in public documents to avoid to compare the half-breeds with the Indians, and it is not just to say that a certain class of them differ but little except in name, from the Indians. They have not the tastes, habits and instincts of the Indian. They are hunters, traders or settlers, but no portion of them can be classified with the savages of the plains.\n\nThe settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, St. Ann, St. Laurent, Victoria, &c., &c., depend for their living partly on farming and partly on hunting. Those at Wood Mountain or the Cypress Hills, &c., do not farm at all, and are supported by the chase and trade; but none, as a class, ought to be compared to the wild Indians, as very little better able to take care of themselves, but they ought to be spoken of as a Christian people, and they are, in fact, more polished, more honest and more civilized than many in certain classes of the most advanced communities.\n\nCommon lumbermen, fishermen, sailors, &c., as a class, are much more rough in their manners, and have no more idea of thrift than most of the half-breeds of the plains. They are, however, never represented as being in a semi-barbarous state, nor as semi-savage. Farming, although so desirable, is not the sole condition in the state of civilization.\n\nThe half-breeds are a highly sensitive race; they keenly resent injury or insult, and daily complain on that point. In fact, they are daily humiliated with regard to their origin, by the way they are spoken of, not only in newspapers, but also in official and semi-official documents. Lord Dufferin felt the injustice, and tried to repair it, as shown in his parting speech when leaving Manitoba.\n\nAs a rule, new comers to this country do not spare the feelings of the half-breeds, and many sad consequences result from that habit. As the tone is to be given by the Government, I take the liberty to say that it is important that public documents or the instructions given to officials, instead of conveying an unfavorable idea of the half-breeds, should be marked by courtesy and an agreeable appreciation of the services rendered by them.\n\n3rd. Grant of Land.\n\nEveryone acknowledges the desirability for the half-breeds to settle definitely on lands to cultivate them. Here is a scheme I take the liberty to propose.\n\n(a.) I esteem the half-breed population actually in the North-West to number about twelve hundred families. Let the Government make twelve reserves for them, in the very places the half-breeds themselves will like to have them.\n\n(b.) Each reserve should be for one hundred families at least, and contain an area of twelve square miles of available land\u2014that is to say, the extent of four townships.\n(c.) All the half-breeds, men, women and children, residing in the North-West on the 1st January, 1879, ought to receive two non-negotiable scrips for eighty acres of land each, to be located by them in any one of the twelve above mentioned reserves.\n\n(d.) Said lands could neither be sold, mortgaged nor taxed before they should have passed through the hands of at least the third generation of those who receive them, or of their representatives. I say, at least, because I am strongly inclined to believe that it is desirable that such land be entirely unalienable; and such an idea cannot seem unreasonable to those who consider the advantages deriving from a similar policy with regard to real and unalienable estates of noblemen. Raise the half-breeds to the condition of landlords; you will thereby confer a real benefit on them, and we will not see a repetition of the regrettable occurrence which took place in Manitoba.\n\n(e.) The only traffic of land which I would like to see allowed would be the exchange of a full lot for another full lot between two half-breeds, even if it should be in different reserves. That would be no encouragement to speculators, but great facility to the half-breeds, especially when they marry.\n\n(f.) In the settlements already formed the half-breeds ought to be confirmed in the possession of the lot or lots they claim and on which there are improvements, even which is very rare, when they claim more than one hundred and sixty acres. When the lots claimed are less than one hundred and sixty acres, scrip for the balance ought to be given.\n\n(g.) I say that two scrips of eighty acres each ought to be given to every half-breed, and I say so because I think it desirable and, in reality, very much desired by the half-breeds themselves, that a slight modification be made in the survey of lands put aside for them. Let the townships, sections and the roads be laid out as elsewhere, but I would recommend that the sections should be sub-divided into eight lots of ten chains by eighty. By such mode of dividing, along a road of six miles or two roads of three miles, you may locate ninety-six families; consequently, the hundred, or about, families of one reserve could have all their houses close to one another and be all at only a reasonable distance from the church and enjoying great facilities for schools.\n\n(h.) The heads of families ought to have, during three years, the choice in the best row or adjacent rows of lots, according as they enter upon the reserve or locate their scrips thereon. After three years the balance of the reserve ought to be allotted between the women and children for their respective two scrips, and the heads of families for their unlocated scrips.\n\nEighty acres of land is plenty, for many years to come, for the half-breeds to cultivate. Several of them have already large herds of horses, and will raise cattle, so they need a considerable tract of uncultivated land for grazing. The mode of division I propose would amply supply that want, in rear of the occupied part of the reserve.\n\n(i.) In every six square miles of a reserve the Government ought to keep, near the most convenient point, one lot (eighty acres) for a church and its dependencies, a certain number of lots for school houses and a couple of lots near the church lots, to sub-divide into village lots, to be ceded to strangers coming to settle in the reserve to exercise their profession or trade.\n\n4th\u2014Help in Farming to be given.\n\nAid in farming implements and seed grain would be surely an inducement and a great help to begin to farm, but I am not prepared to say that it is advisable that such aid be given in all cases. Judicious enquiry is to be made first; and I think it would be sufficient, for the present, that the Government should be empowered to meet the wants of the half-breeds to a reasonable extent. Two or more inspectors ought to be appointed by the Government, to study and examine the reserves of the half-breeds, remain with the inhabitants and make known their wants to the Government. The selection of such inspectors is perhaps the most important point of the\nwhole scheme proposed. They ought to be men of the most respectable character, of the same religious persuasion as the inhabitants of the reserve entrusted to their inspection. They ought to be half-breeds or, at least, well known friends of half-breeds. Their judicious co-operation, with that of the missionaries, would secure to the Government the most reliable information with regard to the actual wants and the way to alleviate them, as well as the encouragement to be given occasionally. The presence of such men in the reserve would command confidence to the half-breeds, and the result would amply compensate the expenses incurred for the maintenance of the gentlemen on a respectable footing. I take the respectful liberty to say that the appointment of these and such inspectors is so momentous that the Government cannot over-value it.\n\n5th\u2014Schools.\n\nSchools ought to be established in every reserve, and in such number as to meet the requirements of the population. Should the scheme I propose, with regard to the division of the land, be adopted, one school would be sufficient for every fifty families.\n\nFor a number of years these schools would have to be supported entirely by the Government. I should say: give the missionaries the money necessary for the establishment and maintenance of such schools, and let them provide schoolhouses, teachers, &c. Surely the Government cannot dread the action or influence of those who devote their whole life to the welfare of the half-breeds.\n\nThe inspectors of the reserve, if chosen as above mentioned, might be appointed as superintendents of education for the schools of the denomination to which they belong; and if the Government do not find sufficient security to ascertain the benefit derived from the money given for schools, a board of education might be nominated, on the principle of denominational schools.\n\n6th.\u2014Industrial Schools.\n\nI think the establishment of industrial schools for boys would necessitate a large expenditure of money without securing the desired result. The half-breeds are very handy, ingenious, good working men, and in many ways more skilful than most of the farmers of other countries. The use of agricultural implements and even the repair of the same is no difficulty for them. It is not the theory in farming they need; it is the practice. The moment they make up their minds to cultivate, they succeed at once. I have often seen beautiful fields ploughed and sowed by buffalo hunters. So that the real want of the population is not to have their boys brought up in industrial schools, and I am afraid the young lads themselves would not remain long under such tuition.\n\nIndustrial schools for females appear to me under quite a different aspect. They are wanted and they are possible. Females brought up on the plains have no training whatsoever for the different industries required in a farmer's house; and a farmer cannot till the soil with profit if his wife does not know how to utilize the resources a farm affords to domestic industry. The experiment has been made in Manitoba, and several families have benefited by the industrial schools established for girls at St. Boniface, and a number of young persons have remained with pleasure and advantage in such schools.\n\nI would therefore recommend the establishment of industrial schools for girls at the most important stations.\n\n7th\u2014Speedy Settlement of the whole matter.\n\nIt is desirable that the half-breed question should be decided without any further delay. The required legislation ought to be passed in the coming Session of the Legislature. Immediately after inspectors ought to be appointed, and I would particularly recommend Mr. Angus McKay as one of the inspectors. Surveyors will have to be sent to the Territories next summer to mark immediately at least the outside lines of the reserves, with one or two rows of lots. Other details may come\nafterwards, provided they be not delayed unnecessarily. There is no doubt the difficulties increase with the delay.\n\nSuch are, Dear Sir, my views, and those, I dare say, of all the true friends of the half breed population of the North-West. I respectfully submit them to your favorable consideration, and I hope you will join with us in recommending their adoption to the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior.\n\nI remain, with respect and esteem, yours truly,\n\n\u2020 ALEX., Archbishop of St. Boniface, O.M.I.\n\nSt. Boniface, 29th January, 1879.\n\n21 Beresford Road, Highbury New Park,\n\nLondon, Eng., 18th January, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Col. Dennis,\u2014I have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of your \"remarks on the condition of the half-breeds of the North-West Territories,\" addressed by you as a confidential communication to the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, Minister of the Interior; and I beg to express my thanks to the Right Hon. gentleman for his courtesy in inviting my remarks on the subject of your paper.\n\nFirst of all, I wish to state generally that I thoroughly sympathize with you in the anxiety you show to conciliate the half-breeds of the North-West Territories. The Plain Crees and the Blackfeet have been but recently reclaimed from a state of constant warfare between themselves, by the introduction of the Mounted Police force; and the presence of large bands of Sioux, renowned for their warlike habits, might, at any moment, without great administrative skill on the part of the Government, lead to dangerous outbreaks, that would not only be deplorable in their immediate results, but tend to damage the prospects of the country in regard to settlement. In bringing so prominently into the foreground the value of the half-breed element being in sympathy with the Government in dealing with the Indians, I think you have grasped the main point of the whole question. The experience of all the years I have lived in the North-West points to the conclusion that the Indian has a tendency, in all his dealings with the white man, to consult and largely be guided by the opinion of the half-breed. If, therefore, you have the whole half-breed element (to use the language of your remarks) \"in sympathy with the Government in dealing with the plain tribes of Indians,\" I would express a very hearty conviction in the conclusion that you draw, viz., \"that we should attract to our side a moral power, which in the present critical relations of the various tribes of Indians towards each other and towards the Government, would prove of the greatest value to the Dominion.\"\n\nPassing now from the general principle of your recommendations to particular points, I would remark, first, that I agree with you in thinking that the result of the plan pursued in Manitoba, of giving grants of land to the parents and children respectively, has not been such as to justify a repetition of it in the North-West Territories. This, I think, is generally admitted, and therefore needs no argument.\n\nYou state three other courses, marked 1, 2, 3. In regard to No. 1, I am of opinion that to treat the half-breeds as wards of Government would be to throw them back from such measure of self-respect and independence of spirit as they may have already attained, by the very fact of their being of mixed race, and of their thus having come more in contact with the habits and civilization of the white man. The object of the Government would undoubtedly be to use every means to raise the Indian, as speedily as possible, to the self-dependent habits of civilization.\n\nThe second alternative, that of giving an absolute issue of scrip to each individual, and then leaving him to his fate, would, I feel sure, end in disastrous failure, as regards the ends that the Government would have in view. The only class of persons likely to be benefited by this course would be traders and land speculators, who would soon obtain the scrip of the inexperienced half-breed at a low or only nominal price, and thus leave him as poor as he was before, but probably not so well\naffected to the Government, and therefore more likely to be dangerous in relation to the Indians.\n\nYour third alternative, viz., to give the half-breeds inducements to settle on lands, and practical help in doing so, is the only one that seems to me to meet the requirements of the case. I am glad to see that it is the one that is recommended by yourself. Coming now, to the details of what the practical measure of help should be, I notice that the North-West Council recommend two things: (a) a grant of non-negotiable scrip to each half-breed, under certain conditions; (b) a certain amount of help, in the shape of implements and seed grain. You appear to think their proposal good, as far as it goes, but you are of opinion that something more is required. You suggest (1) that the half-breeds should be settled in bands; (2) that schools and teachers should be provided, with the view of training them in farming, stock-raising and the mechanical trades, as well as the ordinary branches of knowledge suitable to their condition in life. In these recommendations you have my hearty concurrence, for the following reasons: The half-breed cannot compete with the white man in the discharge of the duties of civilized life, unless some steps are taken at the outset to equalize the conditions on which they start. The white man comes out to the Territory trained to agriculture, stock-raising and the mechanical trades, by teachers who have had the advantage of by-gone centuries of civilization. The half-breed has no such training. On the contrary, his past experience of life tends to unfit him for the exercise of these pursuits. Unless, therefore, he is patiently trained to new habits of life, under the fostering care of Government, he will never be able to hold his ground in the presence of the white man, but be tempted to give up the effort, forsake the abodes of civilization, fall back, as far as he can, on the roaming habits of his Indian forefathers, and thus become, in time, a source of trouble, expense and danger to the Government of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, I may be permitted to say that it will not be the least of the many benefits that Canada owes to the statesmanship of the Right Hon. gentleman at the head of the Government if, under his guidance, such a wise and humane course of policy is now adopted towards the half-breeds of the North-West Territories as will secure for them a steady advancement in the scale of civilization, and enable them, in due time, to fulfil all the duties of citizens of the Empire and loyal and attached subjects of the Throne.\n\nI trust it may not be considered unbecoming if I also add, as the result of not a few years' observation and experience, that your own knowledge of the affairs of the North-West, and the considerate spirit you have always shown in dealing with the half-breed and Indian element, afford a strong presumption that in the position you now occupy you will be able to give valuable aid in bringing this important question to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nWith best wishes, believe me to be, very faithfully yours,\n\nI., SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nCol. Deknis, Deputy Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nOTTAWA, 8th February, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Archbishop,\u2014Before this reaches you, you will have received a letter which was intended to have been presented to you in person by the gentleman, Mr. Davin\u2014the introduction of whom to Your Grace was the object I had in view in writing it. It was, however, inadvertently placed under cover direct to Your Grace. I have written to Mr. Davin to explain, and he will doubtless call upon you at an early day, if indeed he may not have done so prior to your receipt of this communication.\n\nLet me refer for a moment to the remarks of Your Grace in paragraph 2 of your report on the half-breed question, in which you make allusion to the extreme sensibility of the half-breeds respecting the manner in which they are regarded by new comers into the country. I am aware that there is not, unfortunately, that consideration extended to them generally to which they are entitled. I will only say, for\nmyself, I am not one of those open to censure in this respect. I have among them intimate friends, whom I am proud to know and esteem; and as regards the class out on the plains, I have a strong desire\u2014as the fact of my having so promptly taken up this question, after being placed in a position, as Deputy Minister, to do so amply, testified\u2014to do all I can to help them.\n\nBelieve me, my dear Archbishop, very sincerely yours,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS.\n\nHis Grace the Most Reverend Archbishop TACHE, St. Boniface, Man.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 4th February, 1879.\n\nMy Dear Archbishop,\u2014I have much pleasure in introducing to Your Grace Mr. Nicholas Flood Davin, who, at the request of the Minister of the Interior, has visited Washington, to obtain all possible information regarding the cost and practical value of the industrial schools in operation among the Indians and half-breeds of the western Territories, as administered by the United States Department of the Interior.\n\nMr. Davin has been further requested to visit Winnipeg, to confer with Your Grace and such other gentlemen in the Province as might be able to give him information of importance respecting the Indian and half-breed question in the Territories, and especially with regard to the expediency of establishing some such institutions as those referred to for the benefit of our own Indians and half-breeds of the plains.\n\nThe Minister is satisfied, from the special interest which he is aware Your Grace continues to take in the welfare of the native element in the Province and the Territories, that you will cheerfully advise with Mr. Davin, giving him the benefit of your great experience, in order that the Government may be placed in the best possible position to deal intelligently with the question, which it is proposed to do at the earliest possible date.\n\nBelieve me, my dear Archbishop, very sincerely yours,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS.\n\nHis Grace the Most Reverend the Archbishop of St. Boniface, Man.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 28th January, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior, to inform you that he would be glad to avail himself of your services to obtain information and make a report upon the subject of industrial schools for the education of Indians and half-breeds, as these institutions exist in certain States of the adjoining Republic, and are administered by the Department of the Interior at Washington.\n\nThe Minister has had under consideration a scheme for the establishment of similar schools in the North-West Territories of the Dominion, with a view to the amelioration of the present condition of the Indians and half-breeds there. It has been represented to him that such institutions would, in all probability, prove of much value in paving the way for the gradual emancipation from a condition of tutelage and dependence of the aborigines, and also of the nomadic element in the half-breed population, the general care of whom has fallen to this Department.\n\nThe present condition of the people proposed to be benefited by these schools is such, taken in connection with the fact that within a very few years their means of subsistence, that is, the herds of buffalo now on the plains, will have entirely disappeared, that unless some measures are adopted by which they may become more or less self-supporting, they are likely to be a very serious charge indeed upon the Government.\n\nAmong the most available means of teaching these people self-reliance and of affording them the opportunity of gradually becoming self-supporting, schools of the character alluded to should take, it is believed, a prominent place. This Department, however, is without information as to the cost of establishing them, as well as\nof the actual practical results of those in the United States, some of which have now been in operation for several years.\n\nIt will therefore be your duty to visit Washington, for the purpose of obtaining the fullest information possible on these heads. With this view, a letter is enclosed, from the Minister to the Hon. Carl Shurz, Secretary of the Interior, on the presentation of which the gentleman named will no doubt cause every facility to be afforded you by his Department for obtaining the fullest particulars.\n\nFrom Washington you will proceed to Winnipeg, where letters will be awaiting you which will place you in communication with such of the clerical dignitaries and gentlemen of the Province of Manitoba as it may occur to the Minister might be able and willing to advise with you as to the number of such schools it might be necessary to establish, and the sites which should be selected for the purpose.\n\nUpon collecting all the information obtainable upon this subject, without unnecessarily extending your enquiry, in view of the near approach of the sitting of Parliament, during which legislation giving effect to the policy of the Department in this particular may be necessary, be good enough to report fully, at as early a date as possible, in order that the Minister may submit the whole question for the consideration of the Privy Council.\n\nIn connection with your mission, I enclose you a printed copy of a confidential report which I made to the Minister some time ago, which will, unless you are already conversant with the subject, place you in possession of all the facts as regards one section of the population intended to be benefited by such schools\u2014that is to say, the half-breeds of the Territories.\n\nI am further to enclose a map of the Territories, on which the locale of the several tribes of the plains is, in a general way, marked, accompanying which is a statement containing an approximate estimate of the population of each tribe.\n\nFinally, I may say that it has been suggested to the Minister that three schools of the nature indicated would be sufficient for all present requirements, and that sites for such schools respectively have been proposed, as follows:\n\n1st. One at Qu'Appelle; 2nd. One under the mountains at the head of the Bow River or in that locality; and 3rd. One on the line of the River Saskatchewan, at Prince Albert, or at some point to be hereafter fixed. You are to understand, however, that as regards the number of schools and the localities where it may be deemed most expedient they should be placed, you are to advise with the gentlemen who may be named to you in the letters to reach you at Winnipeg, and you will report accordingly, setting forth the reasons in each case which may have decided you in making the recommendations.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nN. F. DAVIN, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, &c., Ottawa.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 28th January, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014Referring to the instructions addressed to you today, requesting you to make certain enquiries in connection with the establishment of industrial schools for the education of Indians and half-breeds in the North-West Territories, and to make a report on the subject, I have the honor, by direction of the Right Hon. the Minister of the Interior, to inform you that your remuneration will be at the rate of six dollars ($6) per diem during the time you are so employed, including that occupied in travelling on this service, together with travelling and living expenses, whatever the same may be.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nN. F. DAVIN, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, Ottawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 28th January, 1879.\n\nSir,\u2014It has been represented to me that certain industrial schools established by your Department among the Indians and half-breeds in the west are doing an excellent work in bringing about the civilization of the people in whose interests they have been instituted. The suggestion has also been made that similar schools in the Territories of the Dominion, if efficiently conducted, would prove of great value to the Government, in gradually emancipating from a condition of tutelage and dependence the Indians and half-breeds now in charge of this Department in the North-West; and if the matter can be at all compassed, I am desirous of recommending to the Government of Canada a trial of a few of such institutions.\n\nI am without information, however, as to the system upon which the staff is organized, the cost of establishing these institutions now in operation under your Department, and their practical value and results so far. To obtain this information I have deputed the bearer, Mr. Nicholas Flood Davin, barrister-at-law, to obtain the same, with your permission, and with that view I now beg to introduce him to your good offices.\n\nI shall esteem it a great favor if you will cause Mr. Davin to be given access to any reports on the subject in your Department, or place him in communication with gentlemen who may be able to aid him in his mission; and I need hardly say that at any time you may freely command me in reciprocating any courtesy of this nature which may be extended to him.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN A. MACDONALD, Minister of the Interior.\n\nHon. CARL SHURZ, Secretary of Interior, Washington, D. C.\n\n(Private.)\n\nOTTAWA, 23rd December, 1878.\n\nMy Dear Archbishop Tache,\u2014The enclosed memorandum, entitled, \"Remarks on the condition of the half-breeds of the North-West Territories,\" submitted by myself to the Minister of the Interior, on Saturday, has been sent to you, at the suggestion of Sir John A. Macdonald, in order that you may, if so disposed, favor him with such remarks thereon as you may deem called for.\n\nAs you will see by the tone of the paper, I am fully impressed with the justice as well as the expediency of disposing of the question at the earliest possible period. The Minister has pronounced no opinion on the subject, but I think he is disposed to consider favorably, in a general way, the suggestions which the paper contains.\n\nKnowing how entirely Your Grace and the priesthood under you have at heart the interest of the class intended to be benefited, I need hardly say that any communication which you desire to make to the Minister on the subject would be gladly received, as soon as Your Grace shall have had time to give it your attention.\n\nI would be glad to be placed in possession of Your Grace's estimate of the probable number of souls comprising the half-breed population of the North-West, which you may be able to give me, approximately at least. It would be well, I think, to distinguish, if possible, those half-breeds who gather, for the greater part of the year, at all events, in settlements along the line of the Saskatchewan\u2014including, of course, the settlement at Big Lake and Ste. Anne\u2014from the half-breeds of the plains.\n\nWith kind regards, believe me, my dear Archbishop,\n\nVery truly and respectfully yours,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS.\n\nHis Grace the Most Reverend the Archbishop of St. Boniface, Man.\nRemarks on the Condition of the Half-breeds of the North-West Territories.\n\n(Confidential.) DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 20th Dec., 1878.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully submits to the Minister that it is expedient, with as little delay as possible, to deal with the claims to consideration preferred by the half-breeds of the North-West Territories.\n\nThese half-breeds are of two classes: first, the half-breeds of the plains, and second, those who, while spending part of the year in hunting buffalo, possess settled homes.\n\nThe class first alluded to differ but little, excepting in name, from the Indians. They have the tastes, habits and instincts of the Indian, and the only respect in which they differ from him consists in their occasionally building huts or shanties to winter in. Even these, however, they usually abandon the following spring.\n\nThese people are found in bands of a number of families together, and usually frequent the neighborhood of the Wood Mountains or the Cypress Hills, although other bands are found in certain parts of the Territories. Their only subsistence is the chase; their movements, like the movements of the Indian of the plains, being principally governed by the migrations of the buffalo, in proximity to the herds of which they are generally to be found, intent upon supplying from these animals the wants of themselves and families, in the way of food and clothing.\n\nThe second class may be illustrated by reference to those half-breeds who are found at Edmonton, St. Albert, St. Ann's, St. Laurent, Victoria, &c., &c., who have habitable\u2014and in some cases good\u2014houses, where they reside and cultivate the soil to a greater or less extent; but still, mainly depend for their means of living upon the buffalo. The subsistence afforded to the half-breeds by the buffalo is, of course, intended to imply, in addition to the daily food supply, other necessaries of life, such as are obtained from traders in exchange for pemmican and robes.\n\nSome uneasiness is felt by the half-breed element in the Territories in consequence of no steps having yet been taken towards the recognition of the demands put forward on their behalf. It must be freely admitted they have a claim to favorable consideration; and the question is\u2014how is that claim to be satisfied, so as to benefit the half-breeds, and, at the same time, benefit the country? Certainly the experience gained in carrying out the policy adopted in regard to the half-breeds of Manitoba\u2014that is, absolute grants of land to the parents and children, respectively\u2014has not been such as would justify a similar policy with regard to the half-breeds of the North-West Territories. Indeed, it is anything but probable that a proposition of that nature could be again carried in Parliament. What, then, are we to do for them? They have, as natives, as good a right to the protection of the Government as the Indians, and, unfortunately, they are very little better able than are the Indians to take care of themselves.\n\nIt is therefore evident that one or other of three courses must be pursued with respect to them:\n\n1. To treat them as wards of the Government in effect, make a treaty with them, as with the Indians, and look forward to their remaining for many years in their present semi-barbarous state.\n\n2. To give an absolute issue of scrip, to a reasonable extent, to each individual, and then let them take their chances of living or starving in the future; or\n\n3. To offer them certain inducements to settle on land and learn to farm\u2014especially to raise cattle.\n\nThe course first suggested would, in the opinion of the undersigned, be in the interest neither of the Government nor of the half-breeds; indeed, it is very doubtful if the latter would consent to it if it were proposed.\n\nThe second alternative, if followed, would result in the last state of the recipients of the scrip being worse than the first, for the reason that the half-breeds, having no idea whatever of thrift, or of the necessity for making provision for the future, by locating his scrip and securing land for the benefit of his family, would, as our experience in Manitoba proves beyond all doubt, sell the scrip for whatever he could\nget for it, which, in most cases, would be a mere trifle. The result, therefore, would be, that on the extinction of the buffalo\u2014an occurrence, unfortunately, but a few years in the future\u2014we would find ourselves face to face with a formidable, nomadic, semi-savage element in the population, which, from the fact of being deprived of its natural means of subsistence, would prove a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of the Territories.\n\nThe third course, above referred to, remains open to the Government to adopt, and the undersigned is of opinion that in following it it will be found a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. Whatever might be the result, eventually, of settling the half-breeds on land, or, in other words, whether that policy might or not, in the end, prove successful\u2014and the undersigned, in view of the effect on the half-breed mind of the rapidly decreasing supply of buffalo, cannot but think that it would be successful\u2014the immediate effect would be, assuming that the half-breeds themselves are willing to give it a trial, that we should have the whole of this element in sympathy with the Government in dealing with the plain tribes of Indians. In this way we should attract to our side a moral power, which, in the present critical relations of the various tribes of Indians towards each other and towards the Government, would prove of the greatest value to the Dominion.\n\nAs an evidence that the half-breeds themselves are favorably disposed towards such a mode of dealing with the question under consideration, as is here suggested, it may be stated that during the past season a memorial, purporting to be signed by 272 half-breeds of the Cypress Hills, was addressed to the Governor and Council of the North West Territories, in which the memorialists express their desire to lead a more civilized life, and ask to have a tract of land set apart for them with that view. Their demands, however, are in some respects unreasonable. They ask (1). For a reserve of 150 by 50 miles in extent, which, assuming the population in question to number 2,500 souls, would give an area of five square miles to each man, woman and child. (2). That they should be free of taxes, if not for ever, at least until such time as they can pay them, without detriment to their families. (3). That they should be provided with school houses and teachers. (4). That they should also be provided with churches and priests. (5). That they should have instructors sent to teach them the various trades, such as blacksmithing, carpentering, shoemaking, &c.; and (6) that for the first five years they be provided with seeds, free of charge.\n\nThe Council of the North-West Territories, having given consideration to the memorial, passed the following resolutions respecting the same:\n\n\"That the Lieutenant-Governor be requested to forward the petition to the Dominion Government, together with the following suggestion, which they respectfully but strongly urge may receive the early and earnest attention of His Excellency the Governor General in Council:\n\n\"1. That it would be injudicious to set apart reserves of land for the half-breeds of the North-West Territories, or to give them negotiable scrip.\n\n\"2. That in view, however, of the fact that grants of land or issues of scrip were made to the half-breeds of Manitoba, towards the extinguishment of the Indian title to the lands of that Province, there will, undoubtedly, be general dissatisfaction among the half-breeds of the said Territories unless they receive some like consideration.\n\n\"3. That this consideration would most tend to the advantage of the half-breeds were it given in the form of a non-transferable location ticket for, say one hundred and sixty acres, to each half-breed head of a family and each half-breed child of parents resident in the said Territories at the time of the transfer thereof to Canada\u2014the ticket to be issued immediately to any half-breed eighteen years of age, or over, on furnishing evidence of claim, and to every child on arriving at that age, on furnishing the necessary evidence.\n\n\"4. That each half-breed holding such a location ticket should be allowed to locate it upon any unoccupied Dominion lands, but the title of the land so entered should remain in the Crown for ten years; and if, at the expiration of three years...\"\nafter such entry, the half-breed locatee has made no improvements on the land, his claim thereto shall be subject to forfeiture.\n\n\"5. To induce the half-breeds, who now procure their livelihood by hunting on the plains, to abandon their present mode of life and settle on their locations, by which course it alone appears possible to avert the great destitution with which they are threatened, owing to the imminent early extinction of the buffalo, that aid in agricultural implements and seeds be allowed them for three years, but only once for each family that may settle within that time.\"\n\nThe conclusions arrived at by the Council are, in short, as follows:\n\n(a.) Each half-breed should receive non-negotiable scrip for 160 acres of land, which he or she should be at liberty to locate on any vacant Dominion lands, but no land should be reserved for that purpose, and the patent should not issue for ten years after the selection has been made.\n\n(b.) That aid, in the form of implements and seed grain, should be issued to such half-breeds to a reasonable extent.\n\nThe undersigned is of opinion that encouragement, additional to that recommended by the Council, would be required to induce the half-breeds to become settlers, and he fully believes that it would be in the interest of good government in the North-West Territories to grant the same.\n\nHe would, accordingly, respectfully suggest that the half-breeds, where wished for, should be permitted to take up their land in such a way as to enable them to settle together or in bands; and whenever a band of fifty or more families form themselves into one community or settlement, they should be provided with a school and teacher for a term of years, such teachers to be selected with a view to being able to instruct them in the raising and care of stock, also in practical agriculture, including the use and care of implements.\n\nThe undersigned regards the state of affairs in the Territories, in relation to the Indians and half-breeds, as calling for the serious consideration of the Government, in view of additional complications, which are not unlikely to arise, owing to the presence, on our soil, of large numbers of armed Indians, refugees, for the time being, from the state of war in the adjoining Territory. He is of opinion that further measures should be adopted to cultivate and maintain relations with our Indians and half-breed populations, calculated to attach them to us, and to convince them that the Government is desirous of fulfilling its obligations to them in the utmost good faith. In no way could we more advantageously or more certainly effect this important object than by affording facilities for instructing them in farming, cattle raising, and especially in the mechanical trades, thus preparing them to become self-supporting when their present means of subsistence, the buffalo, shall be no longer available, and paving the way for their emancipation from tribal government, and for their final absorption into the general community.\n\nThe only way to obtain this desirable result would appear, to the undersigned, to be by means of industrial schools.\n\nNumbers of such institutions have been put into operation by the Government of the United States among its loyal Indians, and with the happiest possible results. It may be stated, too, that although the Indians have shown themselves apt and quick in picking up a knowledge of the use of farm implements, they are specially well adapted to succeed in raising cattle, for which the climate, and abundance of nutritious grasses in the Territory, affords every encouragement; moreover, they have a natural bent in the direction of mechanical work, in which, with a moderate degree of instruction, they would become proficient. One or two such schools, established at convenient points in the Territories, where a certain number of young Indians and half-breeds, intelligent and willing, selected from the different tribes or bands, would be taught some practical farming; some the care of stock, and others the various more useful trades\u2014would prove most powerful aids to the Government, both morally and materially, in their efforts to improve the condition of those people, and to gradually lead them to a state of civilization. The expense of such schools would be trifling compared with the value of the results which would be obtained from\nthem. In fact, the opinion of the undersigned is, that in a short time they might, by good management, be rendered, to a considerable extent, self-sustaining institutions, and he respectfully but strongly recommends the scheme to the favorable consideration of the Minister.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully requests, for the whole question discussed in this memorandum, the early consideration of the Minister of the Interior, in order, if thought desirable, that a measure may be prepared, embodying such policy as may be decided upon, in good time, for the ensuing Session of Parliament.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nRight Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD, &c., &c., Minister of Interior.\n\nOTTAWA, 2nd August, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Acting Minister of the Interior to instruct you to open the Dominion Lands Agency at Prince Albert for the homestead pre-emption and sale of Dominion lands within the surveyed townships in your district, and for the registration of claims to lands not yet open for entry. I enclose you a copy of the regulations of the 25th May last, governing the disposal of the Dominion lands. You will be guided by these regulations in all the transactions of your office. None of the lands in your district come within the limits of the 24-mile belt.\n\nAll books, forms and maps, other than those you have already received for your office, will be promptly forwarded.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. RUSSELL, Acting Surveyor-General.\n\nGEORGE DUCK, Esq., Dominion Lands Agent, Prince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, 22nd July, 1881.\n\nMEMORANDUM re Land Office at Prince Albert.\u2014Unless the Surveyor-General is aware of some reason why it was inexpedient to open forthwith the land office at Prince Albert, for the purpose of dealing with such of the lands in that district as may be ready for disposal, it is suggested that he should give the necessary orders to Mr. Duck to open his office, furnishing him with the necessary plans and instructions.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nOTTAWA, 14th July, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, by direction of the Hon. the Acting Minister of the Interior, to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 131 on 426, of the 14th ult., transmitting, in compliance with a resolution passed by the Council of the North-West Territories on the 10th ultimo, a petition and memorial of Rev. Father Andr\u00e9 and Lawrence Clarke, Esq., praying that the land office at Prince Albert may be opened for the purpose of entering claims for land at as early a day as is conveniently possible, and to inform you that the matter will receive the Acting Minister's early attention.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories,\nBattleford, N.W.T.\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, BATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 14th June, 1881.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor, in compliance with a resolution passed by the Council of the North-West Territories on the 10th instant, to forward to you, to be laid before His Excellency the Governor General in Council, copies of a petition and memorial\nof Rev. Father Andr\u00e9 and Lawrence Clarke, Esq., praying that the land office at Prince Albert may be opened, for the purpose of entering claims for land at as early a day as is conveniently possible.\n\nApart from the representations in the memorials in question, I am aware that serious disputes are arising in the Prince Albert, St. Laurent and Duck Lake settlements, regarding claims to land, and I would therefore respectfully urge that, in so far as it may be consistent with the policy of the Dominion Government, the prayer of the memorials may receive early consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDAVID LAIRD, Lieutenant-Governor North-West Territories.\nRight Hon. the Minister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nCopy of a Memorial from Lawrence Clarke, Esquire, member of the North-West Council, to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n\nCOUNCIL CHAMBERS, GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\nBATTLEFORD, N.W.T., 7th June, 1881.\n\nYour Honor and Gentlemen,\u2014The undersigned has the honor to represent,\u2014That the section of country known as the electoral district of Lorne is rapidly becoming filled with settlers, and in parts has for many years been settled with enterprising men, who now have well-fenced fields and cultivated farms.\n\nThat a large portion of the district was, in the years 1877 and 1878, surveyed by direction of the Dominion Government, and in the year 1878 Mr. George Duck was appointed resident land agent at Prince Albert, the natural centre of the said district.\n\nThat the fact of survey and the appointment of a resident agent hastened the progress of the country, immigrants arriving rapidly, while the earlier settlers, who had located in advance of the survey, but in hopes the publicly expressed statements of leading members of the Government that survey would be made and provisions for carrying into effect the liberal assurances contained in the Dominion Lands Act, would soon be realized, such surveys and the establishment of a lands agency gave an impetus to advancement, and encouraged the people to improve their homesteads and to erect thereon good and substantial farm buildings.\n\nThat recently a registrar for deeds, Mr. Sproat, has also been appointed for this section of the country, but as the lands office is not yet open for receiving entries or making sales, nor any other method in force for obtaining land grants, such registrar is powerless.\n\nThat serious disputes between neighbors about boundaries of claims have at times arisen, which the judicial officers of the North-West Territories, as it is understood, are unable, for want of title, to adjust, and in some instances recently serious quarrels, with threats, in more than one instance, to use weapons, arising from such disputes, have with difficulty, by personal persuasion of intermediates, been for the time prevented.\n\nThat the undersigned, viewing the existing state of affairs in the electoral district of Lorne as serious, respectfully recommends an appeal through Your Honor in Council to His Excellency the Governor General for such early action by the Dominion Government Lands Branch at Ottawa as may enable settlers to obtain, not only official recognition, as provided for homestead by the Dominion Lands Act, but when the proper settlement duties have been performed, titles for the lands they have converted from natural wilderness into well-cultivated farms, thereby affording means for effectually adjusting disputes between neighbors, and a feeling of security similar to other settlements in the territories to the eastward, not now at present possessed by the settlers in this district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Your Honor and gentlemen,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nL. CLARKE,\nMember North-West Council for the Electoral District of Lorne.\n\nCertified,\u2014A. E. Forget, Clerk of the Council.\nHis Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, Battleford,\nCopy of a Petition from Rev. Father Andr\u00e9, of Duck Lake, to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n\nTo His Honor Lieutenant-Governor Laird and to the Hon. Members of the North-West Council.\n\nGentlemen,\u2014In presenting this petition to your honorable body, allow me to observe that I came to Battleford, urged not only by my own grievances, but by the entreaties of the half-breed population about Duck Lake and St. Laurent, and they join their earnest prayers to mine to call your special attention to the unsatisfactory state of the lands question in the country. Disputes and difficulties are continually arising, touching the limits and rights of property of landholders in the country, and there is no proper authority to settle these questions, however conducive to the peace and tranquility of the country. The land has almost entirely been surveyed in the electoral district of Lorne for now over two years, and a land office has been in existence at Prince Albert for nearly four years, but, as the land agent is not authorized to enter claims or to issue patents, the settlers have no way to secure the lands they hold in possession, and which they have improved through considerable expense and much exertion; and besides, as the stipendiary magistrates seem not invested with the legal authority to try cases of boundary between neighbors on lands for which no entry is made, the anxiety of the people of the part of the country where I am living is very great, and calls for your immediate consideration. It appears to be in the power of any evil-designing man to disturb the peace of a settlement and to create bad feelings between neighbors. I beg your indulgence to be obliged to make you acquainted with a grievance of mine, which, however, will give you an idea of the state of things calling for a prompt remedy. I hold at Duck Lake a tract of land of about 200 acres, of which I have been in peaceful possession for over seven years. The land was fenced in, and cost me a good deal of money, and was always respected as the Catholic mission's property at Duck Lake. I was one of the first settlers at that place, and through my exertions the settlement increased rapidly, and nobody ever troubled me in my lawful possession of that land, until last March, when a man by the name of J. Kelly jumped my claim, and, notwithstanding my protestations, claimed the land as his own, and put the frame of a house upon it, depriving me, in that manner, of half my property. And this is not the only occurrence of the kind at Duck Lake.\n\nAs your honorable body is now assembled at Battleford to legislate upon such measures as will, in your prudence and wisdom, be more suitable to promote the good and welfare of this country, allow me to call upon you to use all your influence and authority to draw the attention of the Government at Ottawa upon this state of things, and to urge upon them the necessity of taking such prompt measures as will relieve the people of the burden of this grievance, because, if not promptly attended to, things may become grave and serious.\n\nWishing the best success for your good will to promote the welfare of this country,\n\nI remain, your most obedient servant,\n\nFATHER ANDR\u00c9, Missionary at Duck Lake.\n\nCertified, A. E. Forget, Clerk of the Council.\n\n(Telegram.)\n\nBATTLEFORD, 8th July, 1884.\n\nFred White, Ottawa.\n\nLouis Riel arrived at Duck Lake, with family, brought in by half-breeds. They brought him, it is said, as their leader agitating their rights.\n\nL. N. F. Crozier.\nReport from Battleford.\n\nREGINA, 2nd August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward, for your consideration, the enclosed copy of a letter which has been addressed to me by the officer commanding at Battleford.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. G. IRVINE.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 27th July, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to inform you that Riel has held meetings at both Prince Albert and Duck Lake. I am informed that his meeting at the first named place was an open one. Some little difficulty took place, but was promptly put down.\n\nAt Duck Lake his audience was composed of French half-breeds and Indians. He is said, though I have no official information to that effect, to have told the Indians that they had \"rights\" as well as the half-breeds, and that he wished to be the means of having them redressed.\n\nI am also informed that he expressed a wish to confer with the Indian chiefs. I have already reported that I believe the Indians sympathize with the half-breeds, nor could anything else be expected, being close blood-relations and speaking the same language.\n\nWhat may be the result of this half-breed agitation, or what effect it may have upon the Indians, of course I cannot foretell. I before said, and still think, precautionary measures should be taken such measures as will not only prevent turbulent spirits carrying their schemes to an extreme, but prevent both Indians and half-breeds even making an attempt to resist authority or organize for illegal purposes, for these constant \"excitements\" must have a most injurious effect upon the country and, among those effects, not the least a sense of insecurity among settlers.\n\nI believe now that Big Bear and his followers would have been upon their reserve but for the emissaries of Riel, who, it is said, invited him to meet that person at Duck Lake.\n\nCertain it is he has gone there, and that after having promised and received provisions to go to Fort Pitt, he had proceeded with the camp some distance on the road, but they turned back after hearing from Riel.\n\nThere are very many rumors about as to what Riel has said to the Indians, that, if true, are intended to cause discontent among them as to their present condition.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL.

CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nReports re Half-breeds, Battleford.\n\nREGINA, 21st August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward, for your information, the enclosed copies of reports from the officer commanding at Battleford, in respect of the proceedings of Indians and half-breeds within his district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nR. BURTON DEANE,\n\nSuperintendent and Adjutant for Commander on Duty.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 9th August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward, as hereunder, contents of telegram from Sergeant Brooks, at Prince Albert, forwarded to me in cypher from that place, viz.:\u2014\nPRINCE ALBERT, East, 8th August, 1884.\n\nReturned from Duck Lake last night; Big Bear in council with ten other chiefs. Riel has held several private meetings at the South Branch, attended by leading half-breeds; he has not seen Big Bear.\n\nBig Bear's camp, with twelve lodges, is forty miles S.S.E. of Fort Pitt. His son is with the camp. It is reported to me that Big Bear will go to Prince Albert after he leaves Duck Lake.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nCommissioner North West Mounted Police, Regina.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 12th August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose you copy of a report from Sergeant Brooks on the matter of events at Prince Albert and Duck Lake.\n\nFor several weeks I have had a man stationed at Duck Lake to report what transpires there, particularly as to the half-breeds and Indians. The same point is visited frequently by the non-commissioned officers and men from Prince Albert also. I also received from the non-commissioned officer at Prince Albert despatches, by letter or cypher telegram, of anything that he may become aware of that he deems of importance.\n\nI have this day sent a non-commissioned officer and three men to patrol in and about Duck Lake and the settlements thereabouts, with a view to detecting, if possible, the presence of horse thieves, as it is supposed there may be some in that vicinity.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nCommissioner North West Mounted Police, Regina.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 5th August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014In reporting to you as to what is transpiring here, at Prince Albert and vicinity, I would say that since I have been here I have found everything very quiet. There is very little talk about Riel. The principal part of the people who seem to agree with him are people who are hard up, and think they must do something to cause a little excitement. I have heard very few who are in any way well-to-do speak favorably of him. There is no doubt but what all the half-breeds swear by him, and whatever he says is law with them. As near as I can learn, he is advising them all very strongly to remain peaceful. Big Bear is still at Beardy's reserve. Whether he intends to see Riel or not I do not know. I have given Constable McDiarmid orders to watch his movements, and if he has a meeting with him I will let you know at once, by wire. As regards having a man at the South Branch, I think it is best, at least for the present.\n\nMcDiarmid is a good man, but I am afraid he is pretty well known as a policeman. I will write you every chance I get, and will let you know all that is going on.\n\nW. A. BROOKS, Sergeant.\n\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 14th August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report, for your information, the following extracts from report of Sergeant Brooks, at the south branch Saskatchewan, dated 10th August.\n\nRiel is across the river, opposite here, at Batoche's house. He addressed a meeting today, as the people were coming from church. From what I can learn he\nmust have got very excited. One thing he stated was that the Indians' rights should be protected as well as their own. He has not had a meeting with Big Bear, but I am afraid that he has some private way of communicating with him. He is to cross the river to-morrow, and I believe is to remain on this side about a week, as he has asked Tomkins, the Indian farm instructor, to meet him at Duck Lake, for what reason I do not know. There is a man of the name of Jackson here, who came from Prince Albert (he is a brother of the druggist), who seems to be a right-hand man of Riel's. He is with him at present, and has been for some time. He has a great deal to say, and I believe he does more harm than any breed among them.\n\nThere are a great many people through the country who have what they call grievances, and seem to agree with Riel. Whether they really do or not it is hard to say. I have been speaking to a number of people at Prince Albert, and men who signed the petition for him to go there and speak simply did it because they thought it would draw the attention of the Government to the place. There is no doubt but that everyone is hard up, and they thought they must do something to draw their attention.\n\nThe Indian agent at Carlton invited Big Bear and chiefs to go to Carlton and hold their council there. He said if they could come there he would give them grub.\n\nThey accepted the invitation and are now in council at that place. They expect to finish the council to-morrow night, and Big Bear says he is going back to Battleford, that is, if he does not change his mind and come to Prince Albert. The sergeant concludes by stating that John Nolin left here some few days ago for Swift Current to get freight, and Batoche, another leading man, leaves for Winnipeg to-morrow.\n\nThese two men are half-breeds.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nOTTAWA, 3rd September, 1884.\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to submit for the Minister's consideration that in view of the possibility of additional Mounted Police being required in the North Saskatchewan District, it is desirable that steps should be taken to secure accommodation for men and horses, beyond the capacity of the Mounted Police post at Battleford, and it is suggested that arrangement might be made with the Hudson Bay Company for the use, for police purposes, during the coming winter, of their buildings, or a portion thereof, at Fort Carlton, which is about fifteen miles northwest of Duck Lake, about fifty-five miles west of Prince Albert, and one hundred and twenty miles east of Battleford.\n\nFRED. WHITE, Comptroller.\n\nREGINA, 5th September, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to enclose herewith, for the information of the Department, copies of reports from Inspector Dickens, Fort Pitt, Sergeant Brooks, Prince Albert, and Sergeant Keenan, Duck Lake, forwarded me by Superintendent Crozier.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. G. IRVINE, Commissioner.\n\nF. WHITE, Esq., Comptroller, Ottawa.\n\nFORT PITT, 25th August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to inform you that Big Bear's youngest son and The Lone Man, with one lodge, arrived here on the 14th inst., and remained here until the 18th, when Big Bear's son returned to his camp on the prairie, and Lone Man went north to Frog Lake. This morning, Lucky Man, with Big Bear's two youngest sons, and twenty lodges, arrived on the opposite bank of the river, where they will\nremain until Big Bear's arrival. They say that Big Bear may be expected at any day; I do not think that Lucky Man has been to the Indian reserves, but I am having private enquiry made about him and about Lone Man, and will keep you informed as to the movements of these Indians, and as to their intercourse with the Indians on the reserves.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCIS DICKENS, Inspector.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 21st August, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014Since I last wrote, nothing unusual has occurred, with the exception that both Big Bear and Riel have been in town. The former arrived on the 15th and Riel on the Sunday following. Their being in town caused very little excitement, and people did not seem to pay much attention to them. Riel stayed at Jackson's, the druggist, and before he left he and Lepine held a conference with Big Bear, the result of which I have not been able to learn. Riel, of course, claims that he will have nothing to do with the Indians, and Big Bear says he did not come here to see Riel. However, they were at Jackson's house and had a talk, Riel leaving the next day for the South Branch and Big Bear the day after for Battleford (at least, so he said).\n\nI have heard it stated on pretty good authority that Riel has given up the idea of going back to Montana and intends to remain in the Territory, which I think is quite likely, although he has stated to different parties that he would leave for Montana about the 1st September.\n\nI received your telegram too late for Corporal Fowler to return with the team, but I think I can get a passage for him with Mr. Reid, who leaves for Battleford to-morrow.\n\nI will forward returns, showing the number of half-breeds and Indians in the vicinity, by mail which leaves Duck Lake on Monday next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. A. BROOKS, Sergeant.\n\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nDUCK LAKE, 7th September, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014On coming from Batoche here, for the purpose of mailing my other correspondence, I learned from the telegraph operator, who has just arrived from Saskatoon that 18 lodges Teton Sioux Indians are camped there, and are making themselves very disagreeable to the settlers. He says that about 20 Indians, under Black Moon, armed with rifles and swords, rode about the settlement demanding grub, and threatening to take it if it was not given.\n\nThe people there are greatly alarmed, and think there should be a detachment of police sent there. These Indians were here a few days ago, and I noticed they were well armed, but of course they were very civil while here.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nH. KEENAN, Sergeant.\n\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nBATOCHIE, 7th September, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to state that since my last report nothing of importance occurred here, with exception that on Friday last, 5th instant, a meeting of Riel's supporters was convened at St. Laurent (about 7 miles from here) at which nearly all the half-breeds in the surrounding settlements were present.\n\nThere were also a number of half-breeds and white men from Prince Albert, including Messrs. Jackson, Scott and Isbester, three of Riel's strongest supporters in that district.\nThe meeting, I believe, was called for the purpose of carrying on the work. Speeches were made condemning the Government generally, and Mr. Jackson stated that this country belonged to the Indians and not to the Dominion of Canada.\n\nI met Riel a few days ago, and during our conversation he told me that the Government, through Bishop Grandin, had offered him a seat in the Council or in the Dominion Senate.\n\nI have the honor to be, &c.,\nH. KEENAN, Sergeant.\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 2nd October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward for your information copies of reports received by me from the non-commissioned officer in charge at Duck Lake.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER.\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATOCH\u00c9, 25th September, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to state that since my last report all has been quiet here. There has, however, been frequent meetings of Riel's committee held in different parts of the settlement. It is almost impossible for me to obtain any information as to what transpires at these meetings, as they are conducted with secrecy, and no person, except the members of the committee, is allowed to take part in them. At all the public meetings Riel and his supporters have been very moderate, or rather cautious, in their utterances; but I learn that they appear in disguise at these open gatherings, and advocate very different measures in their councils.\n\nThe last meeting was held a week ago at the house of Batiste Boyer, one of the chief supporters of the movement.\n\nCharles Nolin, another member, and one of the most unreasonable, proposed that the half-breeds make certain demands on the Government, and if not complied with, they take up arms at once, and commence killing every white man they can find, and incite the Indians to do the same. I obtained this information from an old country Frenchman who belonged to the committee, and left it on account of the extreme and unreasonable measures it advocated.\n\nThis man Nolin is the most dangerous of the half-breeds for the reason that he is strongly in favor of tampering with the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nH. KEENAN, Sergeant.\nMAJOR CROZIER, Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nIndians at Fort Pitt.\n\nREGINA, 6th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward herewith the enclosed copy of a report from the officer commanding at Fort Pitt, forwarded by the officer commanding \"D\" Division, relative to the state of Indian affairs at Fort Pitt.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nR. BURTON DEANE,\nSuperintendent and Adjutant for Commander on Duty.\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nFort Pitt, 24th September, 1884.\n\nI have the honor to report that the Indians are all quiet. There are twenty-five lodges of Big Bear's band, and fifteen lodges of stragglers from other bands, in for the payments, camped near this place.\nBig Bear's Indians have enough to eat, and are contented. There is, however, a good deal of difference of opinion in the camp as to the question of settling on a reserve. \"The Lucky Man\" told the Assistant Indian Commissioner that they had not decided whether they would settle at the \"Two Big Hills,\" 18 miles north of Pitt, on the Frog Lake trail, or go to Vermillion Creek, 40 miles south. He said that they would decide after the payments.\n\nBig Bear says he will ask for his reserve after the payment.\n\nHe is very reticent, but from what I hear privately, he appears to think that the Indians do not receive enough from the Government.\n\nI think that he will ask for his reserve, but at the same time will ask for many things that he is not likely to get, and may, after all, refuse to go on his reserve. The future conduct of the Indians of his band will depend upon the supply of food. As long as they have enough to eat they will give no trouble; if the rations happen to be stopped they may give some trouble, but they are not numerous enough to do any serious harm, and would not receive any assistance from the Indians on the reserves, who are contented and quiet.\n\nI am, &c.,\nFRANCIS J. DICKENS, Inspector.\nOfficer Commanding \"D\" Division, Battleford.\n\nReport from Fort Pitt.\n\nREGINA, 9th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward the accompanying copy of a letter from the officer commanding at Fort Pitt, forwarded by the officer commanding \"D\" Division, relative to the situation of Indian affairs at that place.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nR. BURTON DEANE,\nSuperintendent and Adjutant for Commander on Duty.\nThe Comptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nFORT PITTS, 27th September, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that the situation here is unchanged since I wrote you last. The Indians are waiting quietly for the payments. Big Bear went to Frog Lake for rations. He keeps his own counsel, and it is impossible to say what he will do. I think, however, that there will be a good deal of difficulty in getting him to settle down, as he will perhaps bring forward some extravagant claims.\n\nThe money for the payments arrived yesterday. I shall proceed to Onion Lake with Corporal Sleigh and party on Tuesday.\n\nShould anything important occur during or after the payments, I will inform you by special messenger.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCIS J. DICKENS, Inspector.\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nFORT PITTS, 17th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report the payment of Big Bear's band was brought to a close today.\n\nThe presence of Little Poplar had a bad effect. He took the lead in the council, and persuaded the Indians to insist upon being supplied with beef, the sub-Indian agent having orders to issue bacon this year at the payments.\n\nLittle Poplar made a long speech, stating that he had heard how badly the Indians were treated, and that he had come over to set matters right, and that he would telegraph to have all the Indian agents dismissed and good men sent in their place.\nplaces. Big Bear complained that the Government had not kept its promises; that the Indians were not paid enough, and were starving.\n\nAnother question that arose was about \"Lucky Man.\" The Indian Commissioner having ordered this man to lose his chief's pay for having started back south last autumn, many violent speeches were made by the chiefs and head men. At last, after talking for two days, they gave in, and consented to take flour and bacon and to receive their money.\n\nThe sub-Indian agent told them that there was no question of starving, as he had rations for them, but had no beef to give them.\n\nThere would have been no trouble about the payments had it not been for Little Poplar. He starts back for Battleford tomorrow.\n\nHe is just the kind of a man who might cause serious trouble, but when he is gone these Indians will be quiet, as long as they have enough to eat.\n\nLucky Man was the most reasonable of all of them. When he took his money he said that the councillors of the band had talked a great deal of nonsense and had told a good many lies, but he hoped no one would mind what he said.\n\nBig Bear talks of now going on a reserve in the spring. He and his people have a great objection to having to work, but they cannot go on in this way forever. Probably next year the experiment of cutting off both pay and rations may have to be tried.\n\nThe Indians are all quiet now, and are beginning to spend their money.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCOIS J. DICKENS, Inspector.\nOfficer Commanding \"D\" Division, Battleford.\n\nIndians and Half-breeds in Northern Districts.\n\nREGINA, 12th November, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward the accompanying copies of reports received from the officer commanding the northern district, respecting the movements and doings of the Indians and half-breeds therein.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nR. BURTON DEANE,\nSuperintendent and Adjutant for Commissioner on Duty.\nComptroller, North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 30th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward copies of reports, dated 25th and 27th instant, from the officer commanding Fort Pitt detachment.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\nCommissioner, North-West Mounted Police, Regina.\n\nFORT PITT, 25th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to inform you, that the total number of Indians paid in Big Bear's band amounted to 504, classified as follows:\n\n- 58 men,\n- 126 squaws,\n- 162 boys,\n- 149 girls,\n\nTotal........ 504\n\nThe total number of treaty Indians in this district amounts to 1,190.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCIS J. DICKENS, Inspector.\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\nFort Pitt, 27th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that everything is quiet at present. Big Bear's Indians have been waiting for the arrival of Mr. McLean, as they wish to settle questions of credit, &c. Big Bear will soon proceed to Frog Lake, and the camp will probably soon be broken up, as several hunting parties are going out. Five lodges have started up the river already.\n\nWhen Little Poplar was here he said that he would probably go south, but the Indians appear to expect him back again, and say that he will probably winter with Big Bear.\n\nHe may endeavor to persuade some of the young men in the Battleford reserve to join him, as he wishes to be looked upon as a big chief.\n\nI will obtain from the sub-Indian agent the exact number of the Indians paid in Big Bear's and Lucky Man's bands, and forward a return for your information.\n\nFifteen of Big Bear's Indians have Winchester rifles, and some twenty have smooth-bore muskets.\n\nThey are short of Winchester ammunition.\n\nThe loud talk in which Lone Man and some other Indians indulged before the payments was simply meant to endeavor to frighten the officials into complying with all their demands, but when they found that talking had no effect they gave in.\n\nUnless the rations are stopped I do not anticipate trouble.\n\nShould, however, the sub-Indian agent receive orders to discontinue the issue of rations, the Indians might, and would, probably, try to help themselves from the store, in which case there might be a collision between them and ourselves.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFrancis J. Dickens, Inspector.\n\nOfficer Commanding \"D\" Division, Battleford.\n\nBattleford, 30th October, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014The following, an extract from a report received by me from the officer commanding at Prince Albert, and dated the 20th instant, is forwarded for your information.\n\nI beg to state that Constable Elliott returned from Carlton on the evening of the 15th, and reported to me that a man named Tomkins, who is employed by the Indian Department at that place as interpreter, had told him that Riel was drilling men at St. Jerome, and that a large meeting had been held there on the 12th, at midnight.\n\nHe further told him that a chief from \"Muskeg Lake\" had been sent to see Big Bear, to request him to attend a meeting of Riel's, to be held at Batoche in two weeks' time.\n\n\"I sent a man in plain clothes to the vicinity of St. Jerome to find out, if possible, truth of reports; he returned yesterday, and reports all quiet. He states that there is a rumor of a large meeting to be held at Batoche in two or three weeks\u2014as soon as all the crops are in. He could find out nothing about any drill having been performed. I have stationed a man in plain clothes in the vicinity of Batoche, who will keep me informed regarding the movements of Riel.\n\n\"Riel came into town on the morning of the 15th and stayed with Jackson, the druggist. He left for his home this morning, at Lepine's Crossing, at which place he now lives.\n\n\"The half-breed population are in a very discontented state, principally attributable to the utter failure of their crops.\"\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. Crozier, Superintendent.\n\nCommissioner North-West Mounted Police, Regina.\nBATTLEFORD, 14th November, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward herewith a copy of a report I have just received from Inspector Dickens at Fort Pitt.\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa,\n\nFORT PITT, 9th November, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to submit a report of events that occurred during the month of October. Owing to the fortnightly mail, I have been unable to forward it at an earlier date.\n\nFrom the 1st to the 11th I was absent on a tour around the reserves, on the occasion of the annual treaty payments of the Indians. The payments passed off quietly, as I have already reported. On my return I found that Little Poplar had arrived at Pitt, to be present at the payment of Big Bear's band.\n\nFrom my previous knowledge of this man, I expected that his presence would have a bad effect on the other Indians. He appears to have more influence with the Indians than was possessed by any of the chiefs.\n\nA council was held on the 13th and 14th, at which the sub-Indian agent and I were present. Little Poplar asked for beef and increased rations. When the sub-Indian agent told him that he could give only what he was ordered, Little Poplar made a long speech, which was very impertinent but very amusing. He said that he had heard by the telegraph that the Indians were badly treated, and that he had come over to set matters straight; that he was going to whip the telegraph and send a message requesting the Government to dismiss all the Indian agents and put good men in their places.\n\nHe again asked for beef. Upon being refused he ordered all the Indians out of the rooms, and drove them before him as a dog does a flock of sheep. Big Bear said very little, but when the council met on the following day he made a long speech. He said that the Indians did not get enough money, land or rations, and had sold their country too cheaply; that they had always had beef at previous payments, and would wait until the agent gave them beef; that the Government had promised to feed them, but that they were starving. He also asked that Lucky Man should receive a chief's pay, the Commissioner having ordered his chief's pay to be stopped, owing to his having returned south.\n\nThe other Indians talked for some hours in the same manner.\n\nThe sub-Indian agent was very quiet with them, but at the same time very firm. He told them that there was no question of starving, as he had rations to give them; that he had tea, sugar, &c., and the money, but he could not give them beef, and would abide by his instructions. Seeing that loud talk had no effect the Indians gave in, and after talking for two days and a-half, consented to receive their money.\n\nA curious instance of the fickle and changeable disposition of these Indians is afforded by their conduct towards the Hudson Bay Company. During the Council Big Bear violently attacked the company. He said they were swindlers, and robbed the Indians, and that they had decided not to pay off their old debts, and would have no more dealings with the company. After the payments, however, they crowded into the office, paid off their debts, and in one afternoon spent one thousand dollars in the store. The Indians had a big dance in the fort after the payments, and appeared to be quite good humored again.\n\nThe camp has moved to Long Lake, about seven miles north of Pitt; they will probably make their way slowly to Frog Lake.\n\nBig Bear now talks of taking a reserve in the spring. As long as they receive rations I do not think they will give trouble during the winter\u2014that is, I do not think that they have at present any intention of so doing. There is always, of course, the possibility of some quarrel occurring between some members of the band and the officials of the reserves, which might lead them to become excited, but if Big Bear\u2014\nhas any idea of committing any hostile act it will not, I think, occur here, or during\nthe winter, unless he has entered into any secret compact with Riel; of which neither\nthe Indian agent nor myself have any information.\n\nThe number of the persons paid in the bands of Big Bear and Lucky Man is as\nfollows:\n\n|       |       |\n|-------|-------|\n| Men   | 58    |\n| Women | 135   |\n| Boys  | 162   |\n| Girls | 149   |\n\nTotal ........................................... 504\n\nThe total number of treaty Indians is 1190. Of Big Bear's Indians 15 have\nWinchester rifles, and 20 smooth bore-muskets. On the reserves, about one man in\nfour has a flint-lock trade gun.\n\nI have the honor to be, &c.,\n\nFRANCIS J. DICKENS, Inspector.\n\nOfficer Commanding \"D\" Division, Battleford.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 20th November, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I received your telegram to-day, and reported everything to Mr.\nAgent Rae.\n\nI found at Duck Lake that Beardy and Big Bear have agreed to have a general\ngathering this summer, and to have the Qu'Appelle Indians come up, also the Crees\nfrom west, as far as Edmonton district. Beardy stated to me that Big Bear said that\nfor his part he would not find any difficulty in coming down, and if we have the\ngathering at Duck Lake, it will be a central point for surrounding friends to come.\nBeardy has Jack E. Cane as his messenger; he is now here. I was told to-day that\nhe said he was going to see Little Pine and Poplar, also Big Bear and the rest of the\nother chiefs, to find out their intention. Beardy and Big Bear are going to have a\n\"thirst dance,\" as Beardy told me, but I think it is only a blind, so that the Govern-\nment officials would not dread them to kick up any disturbance. Attackakoop and\nMustowasis stated to me that William Badger went to their reserves on behalf of\nLouis Riel, and demanded Chief Attackakoop and Mustowasis if he would be\nallowed to speak. He was told that he could not say anything, as they did not wish\ntheir names to appear among people who were trying to make trouble. Attack-\nakoop said it seems only yesterday that I took the Governor's hand as my friend, and\nI cannot think of doing anything contrary; so Badger had to go away. Badger finds\nto-day that he made a mistake, and feels sorry. Poundmaker stated to me yesterday\nthat he will never join any other band of Indians, he would only attend to his own\npeople, as he was always blamed if any trouble arose; he also states that Little Pine\nasked him to go and see the Blackfeet Indians. In asking Little Pine what he wanted\nhim to do there, Little Pine told him that he was much dissatisfied with the agents,\nas when he demanded anything he could never get it, and he was going to see the\nBlackfeet Indians, to see what council they could arrive at. Poundmaker, hearing this,\ndeclined to go. Poundmaker assured me that he will not interfere with any of\nthose Indians who are going about to make trouble, and should any of them come to\nsee him he will tell me all they say and what they intend to do. He states that\nthere are many Indians going about with some tobacco, and he thinks that they will\ntry and make trouble. In regard to Mustowasis, I have given a full report to the\nagent, and I know that he has written to you in full. Beardy's messenger I will\nfollow up, and get to each camp as he leaves, so that I can find out all he does\nand says. Beardy cannot complain; he has a pretty fair crop and gets good help.\nDuring my visit at his reserve I found every family had a fair supply of food.\n\nI would recommend that when the Indian Act comes into force to have some of\nthese leading men put in the lock-up, to make an example of them. I will stay some\ntime among Big Bear's people, and will do the best I can to prevent him to join these foolish Indians, and hope I will be able to do with him, as I think I have done some good to Poundmaker, by talking to him and explaining everything to him for his own good.\n\nI think, if I mistake not, Poundmaker will again make a good Indian. He promised me in the name of God he will not interfere with any of the other Indians, but only his own. If he proves himself to be a good Indian this season, I only hope some small inducement be shown him during seed time. He states that the Indians are sending tobacco from camp to camp, and should he hear of what is going on he will tell me everything he hears.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nHon. the Indian Commissioner, Regina.\n\nTelegram to Comptroller North-West Mounted Police.\n\nCARLTON, N.W.T., 2nd January, 1885.\n\nRiel proposed to Macdowell to go States if Government would give him assistance in money.

CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nCARLTON, 31st December, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that on the 9th December there was a large half-breed meeting, called by Riel, at St. Laurent, for the purpose of again talking over their Bill of Rights.\n\nOn the 22nd, Mr. Macdowell, member for the North-West Council, accompanied by Father Andr\u00e9, Roman Catholic priest at Prince Albert, proceeded to St. Laurent, at the request of Riel, who desired to see and talk with Mr. Macdowell, as member for the district.\n\nOn Mr. Macdowell's arrival at St. Laurent, Riel informed him that he wished to make a proposition to him, of which he wished representation made to the Government.\n\nHe first stated that he was very poor, and that he did not know what would become of him; was afraid he would starve, and starvation made men desperate; that he had great power over the half-breeds, and that he could influence them, politically or otherwise, as he thought fit. He said he was tired of Canada and wished to return to Montana, but had not the means to do so; that if the Government would give him pecuniary assistance, and something to settle on his wife and family (Mr. Macdowell thinks $5,000 would be accepted by him); that if the Government grants his request, he will at once leave for Montana, and remain there. He would guarantee to give up all connection with the half-breeds in the country; and having, he says, such great influence over them, he will guarantee that all claims they now have against the Government will be at once dropped. By this he means that he will throw over all his half-breed supporters and return to Montana himself.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJOSEPH HOWE, Inspector.\n\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\nRe Half-breeds in Northern District.\n\nREGINA, 9th January, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward the accompanying copy of a report from the officer commanding at Carlton, on the subject of the half-breeds in the district under his command.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nA. G. IRVINE, Commissioner.\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 26th December, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014Attached please find copy of confidential report just received from Superintendent Gagnon, Carlton.\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\nCommissioner North-West Mounted Police, Regina.\n\nCARLTON, 23rd December, 1884.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that during the last month the half-breeds of St. Laurent and Batoche settlements held a public meeting, to adopt a petition drawn up by a committee, and that this petition, signed by the settlers of both settlements, has been forwarded to Ottawa. This meeting, from all reports, seems to have been very orderly.\n\nSeveral other smaller re-unions have taken place during the same period, but all had reference to school matters. The half-breeds are pressing Riel to settle amongst them, and have given him, as a token of their gratitude for services rendered, a house well furnished, and will further, on 2nd January next, present him with a purse.\n\nThese testimonials are for the good will of the majority, and would go towards denying certain rumors, which say that several are lacking confidence in their leader, that his way of acting and speaking denote a very hot head, and that he does not agree with their priests. There is no doubt that a great number are still led by him, and would act on his dictates. Some time ago I sent several men to the South Branch to have horses shod. The river being full of floating ice, they could not cross. Some way or other, the report was brought to the east side of the river that these men were sent to arrest Riel, who was then at the crossing. Within half an hour, over one hundred men had collected to protect him.\n\nThere is a certain amount of suffering amongst the half-breeds, but not to the extent it was expected to reach. Large quantities of supplies are required for this part of the country, and all who have horses can make a living by freighting them.\n\nAs far as I can see, the chief grievance of the half-breeds is that they are afraid the Government will not sanction the way they, amongst themselves, have agreed to take their homesteads\u2014ten chains frontage on the river by two miles back.\n\nThe Indians are quiet.\n\nThe sub-agent here reports that one of the southern Indians, who makes it a business to run from band to band, trying to create mischief, is now in Beardy's Band.\n\nThe agent has a criminal charge to prefer against him, and as soon as the guard room is fitted up I will have him arrested.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nS. GAGNON.\nMajor L. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\nRe Indians in Northern District.\n\nREGINA, 30th January, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward the accompanying copy of a report from the officer commanding \"D\" Division, relative to the movements of the Indians in the northern district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nR. BURTON DEANE,\nSuperintendent and Adjutant for Commander on Duty.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 14th January, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014On my return from Carlton and Prince Albert I was informed that a party of Indians had gone west to Edmonton, and would notify, on the road, all the Indians, that there would be a large gathering at Duck Lake next spring (I presume the annual \"sun dance\" being the occasion of the gathering). On further enquiry I find that they went only to Red Pheasant's reserve, at the Eagle Hills, and from that they returned to Duck Lake, being persuaded to do so by one of the leading Indians there.\n\nThis is the second time Indians have come here on the same mission, that I know of; others may have gone on. Certainly there is an effort being made to have a large gathering at Duck Lake next spring. I was informed, also, that there will be an effort made to get the Qu'Appelle and other Indians in the south-easterly part of the Territory to assemble there. Little Pine, too, it appears, when at the Blackfoot Crossing, tried to arrange to get as many as possible of Blackfeet and southern Indians to come north in the spring. He has told Indians that he has arranged that many of them will be there. Poundmaker says that Little Pine told his young men not to dispose of their guns, and he furthermore says that Little Pine has come to some understanding with the Blackfeet, but is not sure as to its nature; he (Poundmaker) says when Little Pine recovers his eyesight he will get full particulars.\n\nIt would seem from this that Little Pine is not so reliable and contented as was imagined. On the other hand, Poundmaker is apparently doing admirably.\n\nI have great confidence in him, and believe that he can be, with proper management, always relied upon as one of our best Indian chiefs. He is well worth having as a friend, too, for he is a clever man, and of great influence among the Indians, either for good or evil, as he may choose.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER, Superintendent.\n\nCommissioner North-West Mounted Police, Regina.\n\nREGINA, 25th February, 1885.\n\nTo Fred. White, Department of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nGagnon telegraphs half-breeds held a meeting at South Branch yesterday; object to beg Riel to stay in country; he will stay; evidently his own meeting. Orderly.\n\nA. G. IRVINE.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 5th February, 1885.\n\nAttached please find copy of report received from Inspector Dickens regarding Indians in his district.\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER.\n\nComptroller North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nFort Pitt, 2nd February, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to submit a report of occurrences at this post during the month of January.\nInformation having been received, that there were several half-breeds at Turtle Lake, some 70 miles east of this post, who were in communication with Riel, I caused a private enquiry to be made at that place, and ascertained that there were some half-breeds from Taylor's settlement engaged in fishing; but no half-breeds from any other part of the country had been there.\n\nLittle Poplar had been camped at the lake up to the end of December, but had gone into Moosomin's reserve with a load of fish.\n\nAt Frog Lake, Big Bear and his Indians have been cutting wood and hauling logs for Indian Department. Big Bear's councillors, with one exception, are in favor of taking up a reserve. Many of Big Bear's Indians have applied to be allowed to leave him and to join one of the bands on the reserves.\n\nShould he refuse to take up a reserve in the spring, I think that the band will split up, and that he will have very few followers. He talks in his usual manner, and says he is going \"slowly, slowly\" to his reserve.\n\nThe Indians on the reserve are quiet, and appear to be contented. Several of them have had hay and potatoes to sell, and have been able to procure some comforts during the winter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCIS J. DICKENS, Inspector, Commanding Post.\n\nOfficer Commanding North-West Mounted Police, Battleford.\n\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE, REGINA, 13th February, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to forward, for your information, the accompanying copy of a report from the officer commanding at Carlton, relative to half-breed matters in that district.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nA. G. IRVINE, Commissioner.\n\nThe Comptroller, Ottawa.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 30th January, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014Attached please find copy of report received from Superintendent Gagnon, commanding at Carlton, relative to half-breed matters in that district.\n\nL. N. F. CROZIER.\n\nComptroller, North-West Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nCARLTON, 26th January, 1885.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to report that during the last month nothing of importance has occurred amongst the half-breeds of this district.\n\nThey had, after New Year, a social meeting, at which they presented their chief, Riel, with the sum of sixty dollars ($60) as a token of their good will.\n\nThe meeting was very orderly and loyal, and no allusions were made to the actual troubles. It seems that Riel has had difficulties in getting enough supplies for his own family lately, and had to beg assistance from the Roman Catholic missionary at St. Laurent, who assisted him. It has been stated to me that the petition prepared had been sent to Ottawa, but it appears that only a letter, preparatory to sending the petition, has been forwarded. The petition is undergoing being signed, and will be forwarded next month.\n\nAn Indian named Jakerman was arrested during the month on a charge of attempting to obtain money under false pretences, and discharged, no evidence of a crime having being committed being adduced.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nS.
