As it happened my letter arrived just too late and I missed the chance to accompany a friend of mine, Harold Speers to Messinesse.\n\nI have Interim First Class Certificate number 27289. This past year I have been a student at the University of Toronto and I expect to go into a course in Honours Geography and Economics next term. My examinations were completed on May 11 and I am free until the fall term commences late in September. I have taught at Missanabie, White River, and Campbellville, Ontario, all big schools (White River was graded, the others ungraded) for nearly four years, my last inspector being L.L. Skuce of Milton, Ontario. I am able to assume a principal's position if desired, and like to do special art, and craft work although I have no special certificates. I have also taught music and theory.\n\nI am a young man of twenty six years, six feet three inches in height, of Scotch ancestry; neither smoke nor drink, and have experience in the north, and with Indian children, whom I liked very much. I am prepared to go wherever I am needed.\n\nIf you are relieving teachers in any of the residential schools perhaps you will write me as soon as possible. I would be glad to send further information as desired. I enjoy teaching and would welcome a chance to teach this summer, beginning at once or etc. I am enclosing a picture so that you may have an idea with whom you are dealing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge W.

C. Williams of Rupert's House, which I arranged for her.\n\nWill you kindly reply immediately, my lord, in this matter. The matter of remuneration is of specific importance, of course, and if it is acceptable, this lad is willing to rough it anywhere in the North for the summer.

I am willing to teach during these summer months as I plan to return to the University of Manitoba early in October. You have my letter and form of application in your files regarding teaching at Fort Resolution and Fort Franklin last July.\n\nReferences can be obtained from Mr. M. Duncan, principal of the above school. I have now a B.A. and diploma in Education; i.e., an interim Collegiate Certificate.\n\nI would prefer a Catholic community if there is a choice in the number of summer schools available, perhaps for a spot where a winter term teacher could not have been secured. I've been accustomed to teaching in isolated settlements in Northern Manitoba where I had to learn to \"batch\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. E. Schmidt\n(High School Teacher)\nESKIMO SCHOOLROOM\n\nThe teacher who chooses an Eskimo schoolroom is apt to face problems that are unique. Solutions have to be just as original.\n\nEskimo hunters and their families follow the caribou; spend much of the year on the move, and they prefer to travel as a family rather than to leave their children behind at the settlement to go to school. This means that school hours in the Arctic frequently have to adjust to the migratory habits of the caribou.\n\nLast winter one teacher in Eskimo country had only a small class all season. Then in June, as holidays drew near, additional children began arriving from the south. Just as school was about to close for the season the newcomers decided they wanted it to stay open. After a busy winter on the trail learning to hunt, fish and help harness up the family dog team, the Eskimo youngsters were ready to learn to read and write. So the teacher kept school going all summer.\n\nIn spite of such occasionally reversed schedules, education is making good headway in the Arctic. The federal government, through the Northern Administration Branch of the Department of Resources and Development, operates schools at Coppermine, Coral Harbour, Fort Chimo, Port Harrison, Cape Dor-\nTNA474 13 NL COLLECT=STRATFORD ONT 31=\nPHILIP PHELAN=\nSUPT OF EDUCATION OTTAWA=\nCANNOT ACCEPT POSITION AT LAC SUEL STOP TRAVELLING EXPENSES\nARE TOO HIGH=\nJAMES MILLER=..\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIS YOUR MESSAGE COMPLETE?

His address is 89 Charles Street West, Toronto, Ontario. He is a member of the United Church, single with no dependents and 21 years of age. He states that he intends to attend the College of Education in the fall of 1932 and would be interested in teaching in an Indian Seasonal school. He informs us that he has lived and worked in the North for a number of years.\n\nWe would be prepared to offer him the Deer Lake Indian Seasonal School at a salary of $175.00 a teaching month. The Department does not pay transportation expenses of Indian School teachers.\n\nWould you be prepared to nominate Mr. Buck for this Seasonal school? An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has recently been brought to my attention that many of your northern schools are in session during the summer months. Because I am greatly interested in Indian children, having lived near the Waywayseecappo Reservation for most of my life, I was wondering if you could give me information regarding this matter.\n\nI am twenty years of age and am taking third year Arts at United College. After I obtain my degree, I plan to enter the teaching profession so should find the experience very beneficial.\n\nYour attention to this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIris Macdonald.\nJanuary 5th, 1952.\n\nMiss Iris Macdonald,\nSparkling Hall,\nUnited College,\nWINNIPEG,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Miss Macdonald:\n\nWe are attaching for completion by you one of our standard application forms. The completion of this form obligates you in no way.\n\nIt is very difficult for us to place female teachers in our Indian Seasonal Schools. Most of these schools are situated in remote districts. However, we shall be pleased to keep your application on file and contact you if a suitable vacancy does occur.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM: GFB\nOttawa,\nJanuary 9th, 1952.\n\nMiss Doreen M.

Most of our seasonal schools are very isolated.\n\nWe are attaching one of our standard application forms which we would like you to complete and return. If a suitable vacancy occurs, we shall be pleased to contact you and give you the necessary details.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nThe Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIs this the Branch of the Federal Government which has the responsibility of the welfare, health, education, etc., of the Indians and the Eskimos in the Northland?\n\nI am very much interested in working among the Eskimos and Indians, and I have been wondering what possibilities there might be during the two summer months to obtain a job in some Northern community. I was thinking especially of Moose Factory or at least somewhere around Hudson Bay.\n\nI am a teacher, twenty years old. I graduated from North Bay Normal School last June, so this is my first year of teaching.\n\nI am wondering if during July and August of this coming summer (1952) if there would be any jobs opened, jobs centered around Social service work or that of teaching.\n\nThis has been my ambition to work in some Northern Community among such people. I believe it would be so very beneficial and so educating.\n\nI hope to have a reply from you shortly.\n\nThank you.\n\n(sgd) Doreen M. White.\nJanuary 10th, 1952.\n\nMr. T. A.

At the present time, I am attending the Dominion Business College in Toronto, preparing to enter the Normal School here next fall. Among other subjects, I am studying Senior Matriculation English.\n\nI have completed a three year course of Bible studies in preparation for possible missionary activity.

A number of our University and Theological students who are preparing themselves for missionary work are anxious to complete their plans for the summer and I have mentioned to them the possibility of teaching in one of the Indian schools through the summer months.\n\nAre you likely to be requiring a number of students to teach during the coming summer and, if so, would you kindly send me full particulars and application forms if necessary.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nD.

Renison and Rt.Rev. J.Lofthouse for Indian Seasonal schools within the diocese of these two Bishops. May we suggest that you contact them and inform them that it will be possible for us to supply them with the names of seasonal school teachers. For your convenience we are sending you a number of application forms.\n\nBishop Lofthouse has nominated teachers for the following schools:\nBear Skin - Lac Seul - Fort Severn and Trout Lake.\n\nBishop Renison has nominated teachers for the following schools:\nCat Lake - Collins - Fort Hope - Lansdowne House and Pickle Lake.\n\nIn Manitoba there is one Seasonal school requiring an Anglican teacher -- Shantytown. Perhaps one of your students would be interested in this position.\n\nThe Department does not pay transportation expenses of teachers and the usual salary allowed is $165.00 a teaching month.\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to Rt. Rev. R.J. Benson and Rt.Rev.J.Loftus who, no doubt, will be pleased to receive from you the names of students who are interested in this employment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nFebruary 1st, 1952.\n\nRight Rev.

He recommends that an energetic male teacher should be sent to Fort Severn this summer. It would be an advantage to nominate a teacher who has had previous experience to fill this position. May we have nominations for the Bear Skin, Fort Severn and Trent Lake Indian Seasonal schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nDIOCESE OF KEEWATIN\n\nRt. Rev. J.

In a recent letter, Bishop Lofthouse advised us that both Cat Lake and Shamattawa were in his Diocese and we have therefore requested him to nominate the teachers for these schools.\n\nWe presume that you received a copy of our letter of February 1st addressed to Reverend Canon L.F. Wilmot of St. John's College, Winnipeg, in which we suggested that he contact you regarding the names of students who were interested in teaching in Seasonal Schools.\n\nAs in the past we would be pleased to receive from you nominations for the following Seasonal schools:\n\nMistassini\nWaswanipi\nFort George C.E.\nMoose Fort\nNemiska\n\nHorne Payne\nCollins\nFort Hope\nPickle Lake.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could receive a list of nominations in the near future in order that we may contact the applicants.\n\nWe have on file an application from Mr. Hugh James Allan of St. John's College, submitted by Canon Wilmot.

Rev. Neville Clarke, my Suffragan Bishop, who lives at Moose Factory and he is in touch, not only with the various missionaries on the Bay but also with Mr. Allan, your Superintendent for that district.\n\nI will take the stations which you mention in your letter of February 22nd, in that order:\n\n1. Albany. The Rev. Cyril Elliott has been in charge there for the last four years. I believe that he is a very faithful, and competent teacher, who is willing to teach both morning and afternoon. He was away for nearly three months last fall, in Ireland, and returned on Jan 1st. His work was carried on by John Wesley, who is a competent teacher for the junior classes. He is the son of a clergyman.\n\n2. East Main. The teacher there is our missionary, the Rev. George Neilson, M.A., a graduate of the University of Nova Scotia. I understand that he is very satisfactory.\n\n3. Old Factory River. The teacher now is the Rev. Samuel Iseroff, an old fashioned Scottish Indian, who has the reputation with the inspectors of being the best Indian teacher on James Bay. You will remember that the Rev. Redfern Louttit was in charge of this mission for several years. I will refer to him again at Lansdowne House.\n\n4. Rupert's House, is in some respects the most important Indian settlement on James Bay. The Rev. Albert Williams and his wife have been there for nearly three years. He is a veteran of the first war. His wife is a competent nurse, but I do not think that he is happy in his present post. I intend to move him as soon as possible in the spring and bring him out to civilization. I have made inquiries about your statement that there are no records since July. I know he was away for six weeks but I understand that a substitute took his place. At any rate there will be a change there shortly.\n\n5. Lansdowne House. This post is the largest to be found in the head waters of the Albany River, three hundred miles inland from James Bay. I particularly wanted to send Mr. Louttit there because this place is growing and will be the center of that whole district. Unfortunately Mr. Louttit arrived late last fall. Mr. Bolyea, a university student from New Brunswick, who has taught for us for the last four years had a crowded school all last summer. The reason for Mr. Louttit's delay was the fact that he had a serious accident to his hand and almost lost his thumb while chopping wood. He is now all right but the Indians did not know that he was coming and therefore several families who were to be left there for the winter, went off to the bush.\nI just wanted to report to you that Mr. Louittit, who is a college graduate and speaks Indian perfectly has been travelling by air throughout the whole district and I have just heard that he is moving for the winter to Fort Hope, where he is teaching school every day. If we make allowance for the fact that this place is over 100 miles from civilization I think that he did the right thing to carry out the spirit of his appointment, although he should have asked permission first. But my plan is that he will go back to Lansdowne in the spring and develop a permanent school there. He is very influential with the Indians, who like someone who can talk to them in their own language.\n\nI am going to write to you tomorrow about the summer schools. I have a complete list of them and I have volunteers for more places than I may be able to fill. A great number of University students all over the country have heard of what the Government is doing for Indian Education and it may be that I will be able to offer you some volunteers that I am not able to place myself.\n\nYou will remember that I wrote to you some time ago about the possibility of having a permanent school at Mistassini and perhaps Waswanipi but, on second thought, it occurs to me that it might be wise to send summer teachers to those two places for this year and we will have a better opportunity of sizing up the situation before the winter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Robert Renison,\nBishop of Moosonee\nMarch 13th, 1952.\n\nMr. J. O. Bark,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency,\nPort Arthur,\nOntario.\n\nRE: Pays Plat Day School\n\nThe question of operating the Pays Plat Indian Seasonal School has arisen. May we have your recommendations before we contact applicants for this position.\n\nPhilip Phalen\nSuperintendent of Education\nMarch 13th, 1952.\n\nMr. J.A. Marless,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency,\nSturgeon Falls,\nOntario.\n\nRE: Temagami Indian Seasonal School\n(Bear Island)\n\nThe question of operating the\nTemagami Indian Seasonal School has arisen.\nMay we have your recommendations\nbefore we contact applicants for this position.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a month ago I wrote to Rev. Spillman at Hanxel, Ontario asking if there was any possibility of doing summer work among the Indians. I understand that the government was asking for students with a least tenth grade of school to go and teach for three months. I have taken tenth grade except for the last two months, also a six month business course and two years of training at Bible College. At present I am attending the Eastern Pentecostal Bible College in Peterboro. I am very much interested\nin this type of work.\n\nAny information regarding the length of time I would work up north and anything else you think I should know would be greatly appreciated. Thanking you for your cooperation I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n(miss) Davies Brown\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nNOTE: This slip to be used for passing correspondence when the main file is charged out or is not required, and must not be removed but will be attached to the main file as soon as possible.\n\nRecords Service Division\n\nSlip No. ........................................

Unfortunately, I have been laid up for a week and I hope that my delay has not disturbed you.\n\nThe following is my list of summer schools, which I hope will be available for 1952.\n\n1. Mistassini - I know that you are familiar with this very important district. There are probably six or seven hundred Indians in the Mistassini Band. For several years we have been fortunate enough to be able to appoint two teachers for this school. A man and his wife is the ideal arrangement, because at least one half of the children are girls, and for obvious reasons, it would not be possible to send a man and a woman who were unmarried, to take charge of the work. I propose to recommend two university graduates for this school and I would like to add an interpreter, who is available and would be exceedingly useful, and might be obtained for a very modest salary.\n\n2. Naswanipi - is also a large mission. There are between three and four hundred Indians there. I have two university graduates available, and in this place also, I would suggest an interpreter who has acted in that capacity before.\nBISHOP OF MOOSONEE\nRT. REV. R. J. RENISON M.A. D.D.\n\n3. Namiska - This is a comparatively small post, with about 100 population. We have had a school there for several years and we are building a day school this year. It is about halfway between Rupert's House on James Bay and Waswanipi. The school is very deeply appreciated by the Indians. I have a man ready to go.\n\n4. Fort Hope - In the upper Albany River - three hundred miles inland from Albany. It is an old post and it is growing. I have a man for this place.\n\n5. Ogoki - I have written to you about this place before. It is true that we have never had a teacher there but the Indians are entitled to that privilege. The majority of the people there are members of our church and I am very anxious to put a man there this summer because our people have wondered why they have been overlooked. I have a man available for this post.\n\n6. Osnaburgh - This is one of our important places where we have had a teacher every year. It is not far from Pickle Crow. I believe that the Government are building a school this year. I have a teacher available who was there last year.\n\n7. Central Patricia & Pickle Lake - This is a mining District which has grown rapidly in the last few years but Central Patricia Mine is closing down which will mean that the Indians will be pouring in here in greater numbers than ever before. I have available a very fine student from the University of Western Ontario, who has spent two years there in the past. It may be necessary for the teacher to have two schools - one at each end of the settlement. He could teach morning and afternoon if necessary - dividing his classes.\n\n8. Collins - Last year Mr. Thomas Masson was in charge of the school at Collins. I am not quite\nBISHOP OF MOOSONEE\nRT. REV. R. J. RENISON M.A., D.D.\n\ncertain how it originated. It is on the railroad station west of Nakina. The Indians somehow or other have drifted down to this point from Fort Hope and Lansdowne. They speak Ojibway and it seems to be a permanent place now. I have a man who has volunteered to spend the summer there.\n\n9. Hornpayne - is on the southern branch of the Canadian National Railroad. In the last few years it has become an important center for the Indians. Mr. Robert Ross was there last year and had a school of 50 children. The Church of England has provided a hall, with desks and furniture. We need a man there this summer.\n\n10. Pagwa - This is a small settlement on the English river, about 50 miles west of Calstock. The Government has been trying vainly to persuade the Indians there to move up to Calstock. Eventually they may do this, but, in the meantime, during the summer, there is no provision for teachers at this point, and the children have had no opportunity of attending school. I would very much like, after speaking to Mr. Vallis, who is the head of the Calstock School, to make an experiment by opening a school for the Indian Children at Pagwa River during the summer months. I think it is worth consideration.\n\n11. Moose Factory Day School - During the last few years the Department has sent down one or two teachers to Moose Factory for service during the summer months. Of course the regular school term is ended during that period but nevertheless, there are always a number of transient families who come to Moose Factory from the Interior during the summer months. There is a day school available and if one or two teachers were sent down there it would be an experience for them and a help to deal with an unavoidable condition which changes from year to year.\nI would like to receive your instructions with regard to dealing with the volunteers whose names and whose qualifications have been submitted to me. Obviously you would like to know the qualifications of each teacher who has volunteered. I have informed them all that they can only be appointed by your Department and I would be very glad if you would let me know what action to take now. I am very anxious to notify the men but, before writing to them, I wanted to have your instructions.\n\nI venture to enclose a form which I sent last year to each of the teachers for their information and action, and I now await your instructions before writing to them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\n\nR/W\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SUMMER TEACHING\nFOR THE INDIAN SCHOOLS IN THE\nDIOCESE OF MOOSONEE\n\nTO BE READ CAREFULLY\n\n(1) The Indian Schools, including the\none to which you will be sent, are part\nof the Missionary work of the Church of\nEngland, in Canada in the Diocese of\nMoosonee. Most of them are held in distant\nplaces, where the Indians gather for\nthe Summer Months, after living in the\nwoods all winter. In nearly every place\nthere is a little church.\n\n(2) On my nomination you have been\nappointed as Teacher, by the Indian Depart-\nment for the Summer, on the understanding\nthat you will take a real interest in the\nReligious Life of the Indians. The native\ncatechist will probably be holding a\nservice every evening. They have their own\nIndian Books, but you should be there\nand help, if possible, for some of the\npeople understand English.\n\n(3) You will be paid by the Indian Dept.\nwho will provide School Equipment, and\nyou will send your reports, carefully,\nregularly, to the Superintendent of Educat-\nion, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nAt the end of the Summer, I would\nlike you to send me a general report of\nyour work and experiences.\n\n(4) Sometime during the Summer, The\nBishop will be visiting the Indians at\nyour post, and spend a day or two with\nyou. You might help the Indian Catechist\nto teach the boys and girls and prepare\nthem for confirmation.\n\n(5) Instead of Travelling expenses your\nsalary will be paid from the date you\nleave for your post till you return home.\n(6) Remember, that there are no hotels or boarding-houses. You should have some rough Camping Clothes. A Sleeping Bag for the Summer is a great advantage.\n\n(7) You will be instructed how to travel to your Destination. You should apply for a half-fare Clerical Certificate, to the College or to the Bishop.\n\n(8) In order to cover railroad fare there is an unwritten understanding with the government as to the date when you should begin your report and end the same for the summer. You should consult the missionary in charge, who understands this matter. The Diocese will pay your actual flying costs as their contribution. This does not mean the chartering of a private plane. You will have to wait for a regular flight and simply charge the passenger rate to the Diocese. The bill should be sent to me.\n\n(9) Consult the Principal of the College who will advise you as to details. You can always write to me.\n\n(10) Let me know as soon as possible when you can leave home and when you must return home again.\n\n(11) Send all enquiries as to your plans to:- The Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope,\nSchumacher, Ont.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBishop of Moosonee.\n\nRobert J. Moore.\nc/o Hudson's Bay Company,\nMistassini Post,\nc/o Mont Laurier Aviation Co., Ltd\nSt. Jean de Brebeuf,\nRoberval,\nFebruary 20th, 1952.\n\nRight Rev. Robert J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nBishopstone,\nPorcupine Highway,\nSchumacher,\nOnt.\n\nDear Bishop Renison,\n\nReplying to your letter of January 3rd regarding employment of Louise at the local Indian school this coming summer.\n\nMy daughter Louise is now in 10th grade high school with another year to go. She was sixteen years of age last November. She has been doing very well at school. Her marks are usually between 78 and 85%. I am sure that she would be able to handle the young children and also render service as an interpreter.\n\nThe Rev. Matthew Shecapio is in good health and getting on fine. He has been receiving his monthly stipend regularly. He now receives an old age pension of $40.00. The agent is now sending him his family allowance cheque each month instead of holding them for the summer. The monthly ration he was getting has now been cancelled because of the monthly old age pension.\n\nAll is well at Mistassini. I shall soon be starting my spring buying trips and will call the Indians.\n\nI hope I shall something favourable from you regarding Louise. We would like her to have some useful work during her summer holidays. Kindest regards from us all.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. Jefferys\n1. Waswanipi -\n   I am recommending for Waswanipi two men from Huron College in\n   the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario: Mr. Robert E.\n   Adams has been one of the best Northern teachers we have had. He has\n   spent two years as a full time teacher at the Sioux Lookout school\n   and at Pickle Crow. He is willing to go to Waswanipi this summer and\n   I would like to send with him, Jack Baldwin of Huron College. They\n   are great friends and would like to work together. I am asking both\n   of them to write to you.\n\n   As Waswanipi is also a large Mission with a great many small\n   children, I would like to suggest that Miss Kathleen Gull, who lives\n   in Waswanipi might be given a position as Interpreter and Kindergarten\n   teacher. She would be a great help to the teachers and I think that\n   she would be satisfied with an honorarium or $25.00 per month. I know\n   that whether she is paid or not, she will help as much as she can.\n   She is a graduate of one of our Indian schools.\n\n2. Osnaburgh School - (Cote Lake)\n   This is one of the places that you forgot to put on your list,\n   probably because you have it under a different name. I have much\n   pleasure in recommending Mr. George Hamilton of Huron College, London,\n   for this school. He was in charge of the school last year and did\n   excellent work.\n\n3. Hornepayne -\n   I am nominating Mr. H. J. Allan of St. John's College, Winnipeg,\n   who was nominated by the Warden of St. John's College to be the\n   teacher at the Indian School at Hornepayne for the summer. I will ask him\n   to make application direct to you.\n\n4. Pickle Lake -\n   For this school I am nominating James Francis of Huron College.\n\n5. Collins -\n   Mr. Grant Darling, Huron College, London, Ont.\n\n6. Fort Hope -\n   William Baldwin, Wycliffe College, Toronto. Last year he was\n   appointed to the Mohawk Institute.\n\n7. Moose Factory Day School -\n   John H. Bell, 14 Prince Arthur Ave., Toronto; The Ontario College\n   of Education.\n\n8. Namiska -\n   Howard Rose, Bishop's University, Lennoxville, P.Q.\n\nI have not made any nominations for Pagwa or Ogoki but I would be\nglad to hear whether you would consent to allowing us to make\nexperimental appointments for this summer in these places.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education, INDIAN AFFAIRS\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have your letter of March 10th in answer to my requests with regard to nominations for the seasonal Indian Schools.\n\nThere are two places which you have omitted. The first is Ugaburgh where we have had a teacher every year for a long time and the Indians there are members of our own church. In fact I understand that the Government were arranging to build a new school across the lake last year. This is one of our important Missions.\n\nThe other place to which you do not refer is Ogoki. I admit that we have not had a school there but the Indians are demanding that they should have a teacher and I feel that at least for this year we should be given an opportunity to show what can be done.\n\nSome of the places to which you refer in the Diocese of Keewatin, under Bishop Lorthouse are unknown to me and sometimes the names are confused.\n\nI will forward you a list of nominations which I hope may be satisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison\nBishop\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent or Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have three names which I wish to add to my list of recommendations. They are as follows:\n\nMiss Margaret Foster - a very capable and experienced kindergarten teacher, who has volunteered for service as a teacher in the hospital at Moose Factory. She has been working for many years in the Japanese settlement at Crow Creek near Kapuskasing. I understand that when the Inspector of your Department visited the hospital lately, he mentioned her name as being an admirable person for such a position.\n\nI understand that she would be expected to live in the hospital and has many psychological qualifications for this work. She would be willing to go in May, and I expect to see her this week.\n\nThe second person I would recommend as a teacher for the summer is Miss Beverley Edith Baker of St. John's College, Winnipeg. In your letter of March 10th, you mention her as having been recommended to you by Canon Wilmot or St. John's College. I would recommend her as a teacher at Moose Factory for the summer school.\n\nThe third name is for the school at Namiska. It is an alternative for Mr. Howard Rose, whom I recommended. There is a possibility that he may be ordained in June. If he cannot go I would\nBISHOP OF MOOSONEE\nRT. REV. R. J. RENISON M.A. D.D.\n\nrecommend a friend of his, Mr. James Fisk of Bishop's University, Lennoxville, P.Q. You will hear from one or the other of these men.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison,\nBishop of Moosonee\nMarch 19, 1952.\n\nMr. R.R. Adams,\nHuron College,\nUniversity of Western Ontario,\nLondon, Ont.\n\nMoosehead Indian Seasonal School\n\nDear Mr. Adams:\n\nBishop Renison has written to us informing us that you are willing to teach at the Moosehead Indian Seasonal School this summer.\n\nIn view of your past experience, the Department is prepared to pay you at the rate of $185.00 per teaching month.\n\nYou may obtain full details of the school and instructions on how to travel to it by writing to Mr. H. Lariviere, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Amos, P.Q.\n\nWe would like to have your acceptance of the position in writing. We are attaching the following documents:\n\n1. Application form\n2. Tax 1 Income Tax forms in duplicate\n3. Reporting on Opening and Closing Dates form\n\nPlease return the first and second forms immediately and use the third form as indicated in the instructions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Sholto,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 20, 1958\n\nRev. Mr. A.J. Doucet\nRev. Mr. Lavigueur\n7/4-38-321\n7/4-38-324\n\nRev. Mr. R.J. Benison, M.A., B.D.,\nBishop of Moosejaw,\nBishop's Office,\nMoosejaw, Ont.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has approved the appointment of the teachers whom you have nominated for the following two schools:\n\nHistassini - Mr. Gordon N. Hodge - $175\nMr. Gordon N. Hodge - $135\n\nAssinipi - Mr. D.M. Adams - $165\nMr. Jack Shibly - $175.\n\nYou have been sent copies of our letter to them. Would you please request them to write to us confirming the fact that they have accepted the positions. If they withdraw their application, it will be necessary for us to contact other applicants as soon as possible. It is important, therefore, that we have assurance that they will be reporting for duty.\n\nWe regret that no provision has been made for the employment of interpreters at the Histassini and Assinipi seasonal schools, and we can not authorize the payment of salary to Louise Jefferys and Kathleen Gill as requested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Rehn,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 20, 1938.\n\nMr. John H. Bell,\n14 Prince Arthur Ave.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Bell:\n\nBishop Benson has informed us that you are interested in teaching in an Indian Residential School and has nominated you for the Moose Fort Indian Day School.\n\nThe employment at this school would be from July 1 to August 31, 1938 inclusive, and your salary would be at the rate of $175.00 a teaching month. The Department does not pay transportation expenses. You may obtain full details of the school and information on how to proceed to it by contacting Mr. H.G. Minney, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, Room 223, Austin Building, 737 Church St., Toronto, Ont.\n\nWe would like to have your acceptance of the position in writing. Please complete the attached Application Form and Tax Form I Income Tax Form in duplicate and return them immediately with your letter of acceptance. We are also attaching a Reporting on Residential School Opening and Closing Dates Form. You will note that Letter I must be sent in when you report for duty and Letter II when you close the school to ensure prompt remuneration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Nelson,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nBISHOP OF MOOSONEE\nRT. REV. R. J. RENISON M.A. D.D.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI was glad to have the opportunity of speaking to you on the telephone about Miss Margaret Foster. She came down to see me from her Northern post and is quite prepared to undertake the position in the Moose Factory Hospital. I told her that I was awaiting confirmation from you.\n\nThere was one nomination which you mentioned in your letter of March 10th, for Fort George. Unfortunately Fort George happens to be in the Diocese of the Arctic, where Bishop Marsh is in charge. I happen to know that they would like to have a day school there for the summer when the boarding schools are closed. I will send the information to Bishop Marsh and ask him to write to you, if he wishes to make a nomination.\n\nI have just heard from Principal O'Neil of Huron College, that he has a very good young man, a Mr. Somerton, whom he considers one of the best available. I would be very glad if you would put him on your reserve list for a possible appointment. It may be that Mr. John Bell might not be able to go and from what I hear, Mr. Somerton would be a very useful man.\n\nI have your decision about Ogoki. I can quite understand your point of view but I promised the Indians to do what I could.\nBISHOP OF MOOSONEE\nRT. REV. R. J. RENISON M.A. D.D.\n\nI have instructed all the men and women, whom I have nominated, to write direct to you and forward their qualifications.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Renison\nBishop of Moosonee\n\nR/W\nMarch 28, 1952.\n\nMiss Louise Brown,\nEastern Pentecostal Bible College,\n49 Argyle Ave.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear Miss Brown:\n\nWe regret to inform you that we have already made commitments for all teaching positions in our Indian Seasonal Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. F. Davey,\nAssistant Superintendent of Education.\nMarch 25th, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI understand that the Right Reverend R.J. Renison,\nBishop of Moosonee, has been in touch with you about Robert\nAdams, Jack Billy, George Hamilton, James Francom and Grant\nDarling serving as teachers at Summer School under your direc-\ntion.\n\nI should like to heartily recommend each of\nthe above mentioned young men. Some of them have served in the\nnorth before and the new men are enthusiastic and well qualified.\n\nThere is an additional name. I wrote to Bishop\nRenison a few days about Kenneth Somerton. Mr. Somerton is just\ncompleting his third year in Honor Philosophy at the University\nof Western Ontario. He is a pre-divinity man and is a splendid\ntype of chap in every way. I strongly recommend him and hope\nthat you will be able to place him at one of your Summer Schools\nthis year.\n\nPermit me, Sir, to express to you our grateful\nthanks for your helpful cooperation during recent years. Our\nstudents have benefitted greatly in experience and as far as\ntheir economic budgets are concerned as a result of their ser-\nvice in the north land.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nApril 2nd, 1952.\n\nReverend A.H.O'Neil, M.A., D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nHuron College,\nUniversity of Western Ontario,\nLondon, Ontario.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of March 25th, 1952, in which you recommend the University students who will be teaching in our Indian Seasonal Schools this summer.\n\nWould you be kind enough to request Mr. James Francis to write to us letting us know definitely whether he has accepted the position at the Pickle Lake Indian Seasonal School. We have already received letters of acceptance from Messrs. R. Adams, J. Bielby, G. Hamilton and G. Darling.\n\nIt is possible that Rt.Rev.J.Lofthouse, Bishop of the Diocese of Kewatin, Kenora, Ontario, would be willing to nominate Mr. Kenneth Somerton for either the Bearskin or Fort Severn Indian Seasonal Schools. We suggest that you write to him.\n\nAttached is an application form which you may have Mr. Somerton complete and return to us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nEriksdale, Manitoba\nMarch 24, 1952\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nEducation Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMiss Grace L. Hagglund and Miss J. Horeen McConnell, presently teaching in the intermediate and primary rooms, respectively, of the Ashern school, have asked me for reports which you require in connection with applications for positions in your schools.\n\nWe do not customarily provide our teachers with reports in this province but prefer to send them direct to those concerned.\n\nBoth of the above-named teachers have done good work in their respective classrooms and I believe that both should have little difficulty in adapting themselves to the conditions found in Indian Schools, even in the far north.\n\nMiss Hagglund, with 3rd year University standing, possesses an excellent background. She uses modern teaching techniques, conducts discussions ably, and maintains a satisfactory degree of discipline. She is resourceful and possesses the degree of confidence needed to succeed with children. Despite the fact that she has no professional training, she is rather successful in all phases of classroom management.\n\nMiss McConnell, although a little reserved, is a conscientious and capable teacher. During the course of the year she has had considerable success in discovering the needs and abilities of her pupils and teaching them accordingly. The work done by her pupils in both Grades I and II compares favourably with any in the Division that I inspect. She is a student teacher teaching her first year. She has 2nd yr. University standing but no professional training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Schools\nMarch 27, 1952.\n\nP.N.L. Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAre you likely to be able to use any of our students in Indian summer schools this next summer? I believe that Dunning and his wife have been at Pekangekum for two summers, are available. I suggested that Dunning write direct to you and he may have done so. Miss Presant, who was at Moosonee last summer, is also likely to be available. Two of our other students are also very anxious to be considered. One is a girl, Miss Joan Wickware, a class-mate of Miss Presant's. It is only fair to say that she is not as competent a person as Miss Presant, but she is a steady, reliable, common sense youngster, who would do a worthwhile job. The other student is a boy, Mr. L.A. Lundy. Lundy is a third year honour student, likewise a class-mate of Miss Presant's and Miss Wickware's. Lundy is a very sincere young man who can be relied on to do whatever he is told in a reliable way. He is younger than some students and has not shown a great deal of drive or initiative. In other words, he is the type of man who would do a methodical and honest piece of work without getting into trouble. I am not sufficiently familiar with the young men whom you normally draw on for these summer schools, but I think that Lundy would measure up to the requirements though he will never set the world on fire.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F. McIlwraith\n\nP.S. Two other students, whom I do not know, also came in to see me about how to apply for summer jobs. Miss Audrey Tournay, III Pass, 41 Glenbrae Ave., Leaside, tells me that she plans to go to normal school with a view to a teaching job in an Indian school. The other is Miss Lorna Callahan.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 1-1-1S VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT APPLICATIONS FOR POSITIONS AS TEACHERS IN SEASONAL SCHOOLS\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM FEBRUARY 1949 TO MARCH 1952\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see FILE 1-1-1S VOLUME 2\n| Reference | By | Remarks | Date | PA or BY | By | Date | For Records Use |\n|-----------|----|---------|------|----------|----|------|-----------------|\n| 14276     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 14863     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 29457     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| memo      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 9323      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 8236      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| Check from Miss Moore |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| April 21  |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 16776     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 2241      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 7109      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 7737      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| Note 67   |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 7432      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 9602      |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 10583     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 11325     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n| 14617     |    |         |      |          |    |      |                 |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n| Reference | No. | Remarks | Date | Disposal |\n|-----------|-----|---------|------|----------|\n| E SM 20233 | 2/1/1946 | 2/1/1946 | | |\n| E EM 117 | | | | |\n| E SM 87 | 8/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 41256 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 13575 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 12777 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 11790 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 4351 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 4321 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 3215 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 4245 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 14756 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 5260 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 16953 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 1818 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 2220 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 3172 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n| E SM 6872 | 10/1/1946 | | | |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\nMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT made this ........... day of ................\n\nBETWEEN: ................................

Armstrong          J.A. Morris\nM. McCrimmon          B.F. Neary\n\nIn view of the fact that cash advances are made for travel purposes sufficient to take care of the cost of railway transportation, etc., perhaps you would consider the recall of the books in question.\n\nThe case of Mr. G. Armstrong should, however, be considered in a somewhat different light from that of the other officers. The warrants he has were never intended for personal travel purposes but rather for issue to Indians as a welfare measure in certain circumstances.\n\n(sgd) W. Lauchlan\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nTRANSPORTATION WARRANTS\n\nI am anxious to retain the warrant book presently in my possession, as we use it to provide transportation for Indian pupils going to the Spanish Residential School and for Golden Lake children attending high school in Ottawa. We also use it for our own officials, as often they prefer to have transportation by warrant rather than by accountable advance. There is then less trouble with the retention of ticket stubs, writing out of expense accounts, etc.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel Neary -\n\nMajor MacKay wishes to have your comments on the attached memorandum.\n\n7/12/49.\n\nC. Hannum\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDecember 1, 1949\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOnce again, it is time to start planning for the employment of university students at the end of the academic year. Although many veteran students have already graduated there will still be exceptionally large classes, due to the presence or veterans, in 1950 and 1951. It is obviously important that employment be found for them - permanent for graduates and temporary for undergraduates.\n\nIt may seem rather early to introduce this subject but dealing with the problem involves several months' work and an immediate start is therefore imperative. The full resources of this Department and the National Employment Service will be used to assist in filling your requirements and in finding positions for students seeking them. However, your assistance is vital; without it the problem could not be solved. It would be greatly appreciated therefore if you would list your estimated requirements on the enclosed form and return it to the address given at the top of the form. It is requested that, in listing requirements you supply as full information as possible on such items as remuneration, types of training, whether you will consider applicants from all universities or on some more restricted basis, etc. Complete information will greatly assist in efficient selection of applicants.\n\nEven at this early date you will no doubt be able to give a fairly close estimate of the 1950 graduates you will require. It is realized that at this time it may be more difficult to judge exact requirements for summer employees. However, it will be most helpful if you will list known openings now and indicate a date when further information will be available. Officers of the National Employment Service will then get in touch with you at the time indicated.\n\nShould you make a practice of visiting universities to make your own selection of students, this letter will serve as a reminder that it is time to consider your planning on student employment. It is also a request that employers who make a direct approach will nevertheless furnish the National Employment Service with information as to how many students will be engaged so that the general picture of available openings will be known. Lastly, it is to advise you of assistance available from the National Employment Service in such matters as arranging interviews on the campus, etc. At the Prairie universities, full time N.E.S. offices operate on the campuses throughout the academic year. At other universities, N.E.S. liaison officers work in co-operation with university staffs.\n\nWhen you avail yourself of this service, it would greatly increase the efficiency of the whole scheme if, when positions are filled, you would immediately notify the N.E.S. local office in your city. When this is done, all offices will be notified and be governed accordingly.\n\nYour co-operation in this matter will be of great assistance and will be appreciated by the students themselves and the university authorities, as well as the government organizations concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir:\n\nAnother interesting subject will be under discussion at the next meeting of the Group, which will be held on Thursday evening, December 9.\n\nDr. H. L. Keenleyside, Deputy Minister of Mines & Resources, will be in the Chair and will lead the discussion on \"Canadian Policies and Administrative Activities in the North\".\n\nOther speakers will include G. E. B. Sinclair, Chief of the Lands Division, J. G. Wright, Chief of the Arctic Division, and B. F. Neary, Superintendent of the Indian Affairs Education Service, all of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nDr. Keenleyside and his associates will deal with various aspects of the administration of our Northern natural resources, the Government's activities in the Eastern Arctic, native education and welfare, and other interesting problems that arise in connection with the development of our vast northern reaches.\n\nDate - Thursday, December 9\nTime - 8:00 p.m.\nPlace - Room 231, Centre Block (Railway Committee Room)\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Perry\nR. H. Taber\nProgram Committee.\nMemorandum:\n\nColonel\n\nIn compliance with your request I am attaching hereto a statement showing the annual holiday leave credits of the Indian Education Division Staff for the current year 1949-50, also overtime credits.\n\nEnc.\n\nPersonnel Section\nNovember 30, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Rioux attend the next meeting of the Panel on Indian Research and if you wish, I will phone him directly and arrange to have an interview so that I can explain how our Panel is working.\n\nI will shortly be sending to you the minutes of the first meeting of this Panel.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Since I have no means of publishing the revisions, it occurred to me that you might be interested in publishing this booklet for your schools. If you were interested I could get the revised edition typed out and sent to you for examination.\n\nIn Kelowna, we have made an attempt to sell Canadian Currency to both New and Old Canadians, and I think that your success has been achieved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Bann, Teacher\nP.O. Box 445,\nKelowna, B.C.\n10 December, 1949.\n\nMr. J. M. Barre,\nTeacher, Kelowna Junior High School,\nP.O. Box 448, Kelowna, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have read with much interest your mimeographed bulletin on \"What a Canadian Should Know\".\n\nHave you sent a copy of this to the Citizenship Branch? I believe they would be interested in this edition.\n\nI do not know how useful this type of material would be in our Indian schools. From your own experience, you will realize how difficult it is to get Indian children interested in historical or geographical facts. In fact the most useful book of this kind which we have used is \"A Story Workbook in Canadian History\". In this book the trend is away from a factual presentation of facts towards the storybook type of history.\n\nWe might possibly try out the use of this bulletin in, say, the Kamloops Residential School. In fact I am sending Father O'Grady, the Principal, a copy of this letter, in the hope that you will write to him with a copy of your bulletin so that you may get his reaction and that of his teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n134 Confederation Bldg.,\nOttawa, Dec. 10, 1969.\n\nDr. K. L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Resources,\nLangovin Block,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nJust a few lines to express our appreciation to you for taking time out of a busy day to help with Thursday evening's meeting of the Group. Everyone was sorry that you could not stay but, as you predicted, Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Wright and Col. Henry led a most interesting and stimulating discussion.\n\nI am sending you and each of your colleagues the sole honorarium which you will be getting for the effort you expended, namely, the speaker's identification cards, for which you may find some use. One of the men at the Printing Bureau has these cards made for each meeting and, for some reason which I have not yet learned, they are always done in duplicate. Hence I enclose your card in duplicate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD.) R. H. TABER\nfor Program Committee.\n\ncc: G. R. B. Sinclair,\nJ. G. Wright,\nB. F. Henry,\nJ. H.

Keenleyside, Esq., Ph.D., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nThe 'History in the Making' series of weekly commentaries on current international developments, sponsored jointly by the Adult Education Committee of Carleton College and the Ottawa Branch of the United Nations Association in Canada, is resuming on Thursday evenings beginning January 12.\n\nA considerable number of regular members of the group are officers of the three Services working towards promotional examinations. They have suggested the usefulness of an evening on Canada's Northland, and I am writing to ask if you could suggest some member of your Department who would be prepared to talk for 35 or 40 minutes about the topography, resources, development and future prospects of this area, and to answer questions from the group. The date suggested is Thursday, January 19, at 8.15 p.m.\n\nThe previous meetings in this Series have been of a high level of discussion, and we would like to have this atmosphere continued by the most authoritative meeting we can provide. May I therefore ask your help in securing a speaker for this date?\n\nWe would also welcome any suggestion you might make for a speaker on the St. Lawrence Seaway Project (tentative date, Thursday, February 2).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Gibson\nProfessor of History.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR.\n\nUnless notified to the contrary, I will be available for the evening of January 19 for the talk referred to in the attached correspondence.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nNovember 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department directs your attention to the necessity of the most careful examination of application forms in favour of Indian children who are presented for admission to residential schools. I have, therefore, to invite your attention to, and compliance with, the subjoined facts and instructions.\n\nOn the \"Application for Admission\" form the agent signs the following declaration: \"I hereby approve of the admission of the above child and certify that he is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\"\n\nThere is a departmental ruling to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life or a reserve are eligible for admission to the boarding and industrial schools, or, more fully: \"While it was not considered that the children of half-breeds proper of Manitoba and the Prairie Provinces should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents or other siblings live as Indians, even if they are not entitled to vote, should be eligible for admission to the schools. However, every case must be handled against every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a half-breed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been adopted by or otherwise brought into association with Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\"\n\nAt the time you forward an application, write a covering letter in the case of half-breed or non-Treaty children, giving your reasons for believing the child to be a charge on the Indian Department.\n\nWhen you have reason to believe that the accommodation of the boarding or industrial school is limited, preference should be given to orphan children or those that are neglected by their parents.\n\nExercise every care to ensure the placing of the child in a residential school under the auspices of the religious denomination to which the parents adhere. No Roman Catholic child shall be sent to a Protestant school, and vice versa. You will please adhere strictly to this provision of the Act. (See Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act). Concerning the age of applicants for admission to our residential schools, only in very exceptional cases will the Department authorize the admission of any child other than between the ages of 7 and 13 inclusive.\n\nCheck carefully all applications that come before you, giving particular attention to the age, religion and status of the applicant before asking the Department to admit them as grant-earning pupils to a Boarding or Industrial school.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDear Editor,\n\nPlease be good enough to read and accept this article.\n\nI should be glad to take up any copies of the publication containing it. Yours sincerely H.L.Bergman.\n\nIII.\n\nWhat is the best method of teaching primitive people?\n\nThe same as that of teaching primitive children, not by making them listen to lectures but by making them work.\n\nThey should take an active part in the work of the class.\n\nPostures are more important than words. Doing something is more important than listening to a lecture.\n\nDaily exercise will improve their health.\n\nThey should know something about the geography of the world and move from place to place, from country to country.\n\nIn this way they will easily learn all that they are being taught.\n\nI applied these principles in my world-class. For this reason I bought a plot of ground (50 yards long by 30 yards wide) in 1908.\n\nThe pupils of my class laid out a world-garden. In it this garden was, as it were, a large map of the world.\n\nEach of the pupils had a little plot of ground of his own which represented a certain country.\n\nThey sold the products of their own countries and, if possible, grew them in their own gardens.\n\nThe world and their own countries were their \"textbooks\" for years and years.\n\nIn this way every teacher can use his own textbook.\n\nThe pupils will be more receptive than in the old class.\n\nThey will work in this world and the teacher will give them a useful general knowledge of this world instead of a dangerous knowledge of special subjects.\n\nH.L.Bergman, Holland, 1-1-49.\nWhat is the best method of teaching primitive people?\n\nThe same as that of teaching primitive children which method is this? The method of working hard. The best method for primitives demands few new words and ideas, no jumping from one thing to another, one structure, only one building-up-factor, which word unites the education from the primitives to farther, practically and theoretically. This word is \"work\". Movement, hard work is the base of the worldclass. Why an education without base? Without fundament? One word, unitywork is needed. The worldgarden will give an idea of this work.\n\nHow to make clear that hard work is needed? How to make clear that hard work is needed for the rise of peoples? The answer is: by numbers. Numbers which demonstrate that hard work is the corner-stone of the building (rising) of generations and the world. Numbers as hardily-factors... not by making them listen to lectures but by making them work. They should take an active part in the work of the school. Gestures are more important than words. Especially primitives are poor in words, but movements can say much. A gesture to ear, eye, or mouth can say sentences like: hear, see, be silent.\n\nThe method of movements becomes productive, instead of reproductive. For in the art of teaching, the great art of teaching primitives, can these movements be made ten times more instructive? By movements in the worldgarden, the world is reviewed from 20 different points of view. (Branches of the curriculum).\n\nThere is consequently some repetition which will serve a useful purpose as revision and production, instead of reproduction. Idleness is the root of all evil. Movements are the root of saying, writing, eating, breathing. To see and say sentences like the above mentioned is double as instructive. The productive method is worth twice as much as the reproductive. Movements from place to place can be doubled as instructive again, for the memory of place is the strongest, especially with primitives. Even flat movements are tenfold instructive within the worldclass.\n\nMovements can be twice as instructive as reproduction from books. Four times more instructive can be evoluted, when going from place to place. This quadruple instructiveness is doubled if the place lies in a fixed, regular, symmetric structure like the worldclass. These movements for primitive is ten times more instructive than the reproductive idea of teaching.\n\nA number of experts have come to this conclusion here.\n\nI put these principles into practice in my worldgarden and worldclass. For this reason I bought a plot of ground (50 yards long by 30 yards) in 1968, the pupils of my class laid out a worldgarden in it. This garden was, as it were, a large map of the world. Every pupil occupies his country, has his place, which is indicated by a number denoting the longitude and latitude of the country. On a square or field if need be without frontiers this plain or field represents the world as a world-wide farmland representing the grasslands, etc., in 32 countries in 30 places or pupils on the field or in the classroom without the gap-character.\n\nGiven without frontiers for the world the class can play there all branches. The pupils are the food, flatively or in reality. They are instructed in order to become servants of the Uncsoo. They sell their product and keep their book (book-keeping).\n\nHow to make the reproductive method productive? One of the pupils e.g. lives in San Francisco, California; his name is chosen from the environment and his surname, last from one of its products. Cal Fut. From this name the class evolves a sentence from 33 names, 23 sentences, self-made. This lesson in 10 tens, 10 persons, 10 forms, with 10 determinations (adjectives), consequently so in 10,000 forms is an introduction to the book \"The World\".\n\nAfterwards in 4 languages. Every teacher can type and multiply his own book. His mind has a natural tendency to reject the other books. Translations of the book are to be learned in one tenth of the time, for the movements are known, the succession, the composition too.\n\nStadskaan, Holland, .. H.J.Bergman. 1-9-49.\nSchool, food and people.\n\nFundamental education. Movement is the fundament.\n\nHow are we to fight famine in this devastated world? How are we to cultivate enough food for the rapidly increasing population of the world? How are we to secure a higher standard of living? How can we prevent slumps and unemployment? In short how can we build a better world, create mutual understanding and secure a feeling of safety?\n\nBy a change in food production. Hard work. The change that would most increase food production would be to transform the present predominantly peasant type of rural economy to a mixed farm type as adopted in the more advanced countries.\n\nWhile increases in food production can be confidently expected, they will certainly involve considerable work and much scientific study. There is no prospect of easy living.\n\n100 million of people suffer from food shortage now.\n\nEvery year the population of the world increases by 1%. But every year the area of food-producing soil decreases by 2%.\n\nWhat will the situation be like after a century? After a comparatively short time the population will be doubled, the cultivated soil halved, the need quadruples.\n\nHow can double the population be fed on half the cultivated soil?\n\nThis is possible, if:\n\n- first - the food shortage is fought now,\n- secondly - the farmer-to-be (peasant) not is disaccustomed from hard work, from vigorous movements,\n- thirdly - the farmers are given an agricultural-scientific education, prepared in the primary school,\n- fourthly - we prevent the hoarding of food for the next war, if the world restore this as world as unity.\n\nIn 1870 the war was won by the teacher. In 1970 the war will be won by the teacher who gives his pupils a good technical education (electricity, etc.). The pupils should be taught, not only to fight in a military war, but also to fight food-shortage and unemployment.\n\nUnemployment increases with the poverty in the world. The more-sold of the U.S.A. was every year 400 million dollars.\n\nIn June 1949 there were four millions of unemployed laborers.\n\nThis proves that even the richest nation of the world cannot fight unemployment successfully in its own country.\n\nUnemployment is an international problem.\n\nIf new agricultural countries produce and sell more agricultural products, they can buy more and fight unemployment.\n\nHow to increase this production? In 1650 Mr. van Hoek came to Noord-Brabant, a province of the Netherlands, as a teacher of agriculture. At that time there was only one dairy-factory in the whole province. In 1877 there were 125 dairy-factories, with a large export-trade, and less unemployment also in the other parts.\n\nTo increase the number of these factories in this district from 1 to 125 takes up less energy and time than to raise that number from 125 to 250. Therefore the best plan is to begin with the development of undeveloped regions. Unesco tries to educate the backward nations. They should be quickly educated. Their soil should be cultivated and their agriculture be developed.\n\nThis is an international experiment of the greatest importance, because national experiments are bound to fail.\n\nSound agricultural instruction is essential. The guidance of the Unesco is necessary. The agricultural instruction should be adapted to the country where it is given already in the primary school. Physics and biology should more frequently be taught.\n\nThe elementary school will give this preparation without to be technical. With the view to education in agriculture and hygiene the class is as a worldwide mixed farm in the classroom. The pupils, the desks are the countries, small countries, symmetric, regular, in the same structure as the numbers. One structure and not more.\n\nBy more structures there are orders and contra-orders with the physical distress, the psychological press with the stuttering, with the destroy instead of the consumption.\nJanuary 17th, 1950.\n\nMr. B.F.

Following its first phase Indian boys and girls are gradually introduced to special training - the boys to shop work which includes mechanics, woodwork, gardening, farming, metalwork and leatherwork - the girls to Domestic Science which includes cooking, housekeeping, sewing, weaving, gardening and leatherwork. As soon as these students show aptitude and desire they are placed in provincial or privately operated trade schools. Indian girls and boys have been encouraged to complete their academic training and take business training such as nursing and teaching. The Department employs Indian teachers in its own schools, while a number of Indians are teaching in provincial schools. The Department also employs Indians in its other services.\n\nIndian Affairs endeavours to guide Indian pupils into channels for which they are best suited. In many cases these Indian children adjust themselves quite well to the new method of life and are making successes of their careers.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE SECRETARY\n\nRE: International Labour Office.\n\nWith regard to your request of December 17 for details of the development of programs of vocational training among indigenous populations, I am pleased to submit the following report:\n\nIndian boys and girls are introduced to vocational activities by an integrated program of studies. Following this first phase, these pupils are gradually introduced to special training. The boys begin their shop work which includes mechanics, woodwork, metal work, leather work, gardening and farming. The girls begin their various activities in domestic science which include cooking, housekeeping, sewing, weaving and gardening.\n\nAny students showing special aptitudes and desires are placed in provincial or privately operated trade schools. Often these are schools receiving funds through the Canadian Vocational Training Plan. Those boys and girls who take well to secondary education, are encouraged to complete their academic training and we particularly try to guide them into two professions, namely nursing and teaching.\n\nThere is a great need for nurses and teachers on their home reserves and we feel that trained Indian workers can accomplish much in improving home conditions, etc. The Department now employs about 50 Indian teachers in its own schools while\na number of Indians are teaching in provincial schools. Some Indian girls are now employed in the hospitals of the Department of National Health and Welfare as nurses while others have been trained as nurses' aides. Our Branch endeavours to guide Indian pupils into channels for which they are best suited. In many cases these Indian children adjust themselves quite well to this different mode of life and become assimilated into the communities of Canada.\n\nBernard F.

MacKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nIt has not been possible to set up a departmental administration branch, but a skeleton organization is available for your service.\n\nMr. W.M. Cory will be our legal advisor.\n\nMr. E.

Bethune, Administrative Officer, may be contacted in connection with general departmental administration matters.\n\n(sgd) Laval Fortier\n\n(Laval Fortier)\nDeputy Minister.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nREDUCTION IN ESTIMATES\n\nWhen the Deputy Minister and yourself are called before the Treasury Board, I would strongly suggest that you might point out to them the changes which education, particularly in a day school, can bring to an Indian community. The attached newspaper article describes the work of our welfare teacher at Fort McPherson. Three years ago there was no school at Fort McPherson and most of these Indians had never been educated.\n\nI will let Miss Hinds' article describe the changes which have resulted since the little day school has been established for these Indians and their children. I would emphasize that we are trying to do more than merely educating the Indian children. This article should convince the members of the Treasury Board that communities such as this are desperately in need of educational facilities - we have been able to provide them at Fort McPherson - we can only provide them at similar Indian communities elsewhere if funds are available. Mr. Bryce and the other members of the Treasury Board might also read with profit the article which recently appeared in the Toronto Star on \"Higher Education at Caughnawaga\". There they will read how we are trying to educate the Indians of the southern regions into Canadian citizenship. There our problem is entirely different and it is a matter of providing facilities for higher education for Indians rather than the simple elementary education provided in such places as Fort McPherson.\n\nIt might be also pointed out that our schools have for years lagged behind the provincial schools. We are now\ndevoting every effort to improving our educational standards. That we are succeeding is best illustrated by the article on Caughnawaga - entirely unsolicited and written without prior knowledge of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN OFFICE MANAGEMENT\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n1. Origin of this course:\n\nThis course came into being as a result of a recommendation made by a sub-committee of the Interdepartmental Committee on Staff Training. It was originally prepared by Officers of the staff of the Comptroller of the Treasury and presented to their employees holding supervisory positions. It has now been revised by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission to adapt it for presentation to Civil Servants throughout the various government departments across the country.\n\n2. Purpose of the course:\n\nThe course has been designed to give personnel employed in a supervisory capacity and personnel who look forward to such responsibilities, some practical instruction in management techniques to help them acquire the knowledge and ability to handle an executive position more efficiently.\n\n3. Structure of the course:\n\na) Papers - The revised course is made up of twenty papers with a detachable assignment at the end of each. These assignments are of the objective type, namely: True-False, Multiple Choice, Completion or Matching types. A proper time limit for the completion of each assignment is two weeks. In this way every registrant will be able to have completed the necessary papers by the dates set for the Term-Tests. The corrected assignments will not be returned to candidates.\n\nb) Term Tests - A mid-term test will be forwarded to each candidate immediately after Paper X has been completed. This test will be of the Essay Type and candidates will have two weeks to handle it. To be eligible to write this test, all of assignments 1 to 10 inclusive must have been received for correction by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission, Ottawa.\n\nA Final Test will be administered under supervision at specified centres across Canada. This test will be held about two weeks after completion of Paper XX. This test will also be of the Essay Type and will be devised to ascertain whether candidates have applied or can apply to specific tasks the principles advocated in the course. To be eligible for this Final Test, all of assignments 11 to 20 as well as Mid Term must have been completed by each candidate.\n\n4. How to study:\n\nInstructional matter contained in each paper should be mastered fully before attempting the assignment at the end of each paper. Likewise, time spent on studying references listed below would be time well spent. The assignments are done on your own and you should be able to answer questions without back-tracking to the paper itself. This is most important in order to derive maximum benefit from each paper. Where two or more candidates are located in the same area they may benefit by setting up a study group of their own. Suggested topics for such study groups are to be found at the end of each paper.\n5. References\n\nMany interesting and enlightening books have been written on Office Management and Personnel Management. It is recommended that you study at least a few of these to supplement instructional matter contained in the twenty papers. Students are referred to the following which are probably available in departmental or public libraries.\n\nThe Office Supervisor - by Henry E. Niles and Mary C.H.

Jackson,\nDirector of Administration & Personnel,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nRe: Correspondence Course - Office Management\n\nFollowing a recommendation made by a sub-committee of the Interdepartmental Committee on Staff Training, the Officers of the staff of the Comptroller of the Treasury prepared a correspondence course in Office Management. The course was offered to their supervisory personnel with gratifying results and the basic material of the course was made available to the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission who have adapted it for presentation to supervisory employees of all government departments across Canada. The course is available in English and the subject matter is to be translated into French so that during subsequent enrolments it will be available in both languages.\n\nTo facilitate the setting up of records and controls and to give each department an opportunity of offering the course to its senior supervisors before junior personnel are enrolled, it appears desirable to enrol candidates on a quota basis rather than to advertise the course by means of posters. Such a procedure will also permit the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission to obtain comments from senior employees before the course is offered to others.\n\nAllotment of courses has been made on a per capita basis and your quota has been set at 30. Candidates for the most part should come from the supervisory group but this does not preclude the enrolment of potential supervisors if they are recommended. Quotas should be equitably divided between Ottawa offices and offices outside Ottawa.\n\nThe course will start on February 28th, 1950 and allowing for a two month summer recess and for a two week Christmas holiday, the Final Examination will be held in February 1951. For more details about the mechanics of this course, please refer to the attached \"General Information\" and \"Course Outline\" which will be forwarded to each student by the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission when registration is completed.\n\nTo help students put theory into practice, instructional matter of each paper will be followed by topics for group study. This is an important aspect of the course. It will help students to apply the principles advocated in the course and will supply them with an opportunity for exchanging valuable ideas with civil servants from other sections of their own department or with members from other departments who encounter similar problems. Staff Training Officers in the field will be able to assist in organising and coaching these study groups.\n\nMay the names and home addresses of your candidates be prepared by your department and forwarded to the Staff Training Division of the Civil Service Commission not later than February 15, 1950.\n\n(Sgd) G.K. Smith, Training Officer.\nOttawa, 4 February, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO MR. MACKAY\n\nEnc. I attach hereto a copy of a letter dated January 11, addressed to Mr. C. J. Jackson, Director of Administration and Personnel, Department of Mines and Resources by the Training Officer of the Civil Service Commission on the subject of a correspondence course on office management. Also attached are copies of a mimeographed memorandum furnishing general information in regard to the course. Of the quota of 60 set for Mines and Resources, 30 have been allocated to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and I believe that of this number 10 might be assigned to your Branch.\n\nIt is desired to make full use of this course and I would be glad to have the names of those officers that you think would benefit most from participating therein and as a result would become more useful members of our organization. For the initial course, at least, it is thought that senior officers should be given the preference but this may have to be varied to meet special circumstances.\n\nThe course may be taken by those located at Ottawa and away from Ottawa, and there should be a fair division of your quota.\n\n(sgd) Laval Fortier\nDeputy Minister\nCitizenship and Immigration\nOTTAWA, 10 February, 1956.\n\nThe attached material on the Correspondence Course on Office Management being conducted by the Civil Service Commission is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the time factor, would you please advise immediately the names of employees in your service who wish to be candidates in the first course. These names must be available not later than Monday noon, 13 February.\n\n[Signature]\nfor Director.\n\nAttached.\nProfessional Institute of the Civil Service of Canada\n\nEducation and Training Group\n\nFebruary 7, 1950\n\nAn Education and Training Group has been organized in the Professional Institute of the Civil Service of Canada.

Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: School Hours - Day Schools\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nI beg to inform you that there seems to be a lack of uniformity in school hours in the Day schools, Hobbema Indian Agency.\n\nCould I please receive an outline of the required teaching hours per day and also any deviations that may be made; for example, closing hours on Friday afternoons or late starting hours in winter months.\n\nIt would be appreciated if an indication was given of the time that is to be allotted to religious instruction by the various missionaries, per day or week.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nHobbema Indian Agency\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\nPROGRAMME OF STUDIES FOR INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nThe programme of studies herein prescribed shall be followed by the teacher as far as the circumstances of the school permit. Any modifications deemed necessary should be made only with the sanction of the Branch.\n\nTextbooks: While in the case of most subjects, Provincial textbooks are used, it should be noted that the Indian Affairs Branch prescribes certain books which have been found specially suitable for Indian Schools. Particulars regarding these books may be obtained on application to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRequisitions: When preparing requisitions for school material ask only for those texts authorized above. The Indian Affairs Branch requires you to adhere strictly to this rule. Teachers will please note the instructions on the \"Requisition for School Material\" form No. 413. Indian agents will supply these forms.\n\nTEACHING \u2014 NOTE THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS\n\nLanguage: Every effort must be made to induce pupils to speak English and to teach them to understand it. Insist on English even during the supervised play. Failure in this means wasted efforts. (In some schools in Quebec, where French is the classroom language, the word \"French\" should be substituted in the above instruction where the word \"English\" appears.)\n\nReading: Do not hear the children read, teach them to read. Do not use the phonics method to teach beginners unless it is for children with serious disabilities. Remember reading is a basic skill. Great care should be taken to teach it properly. The primary division members should be grouped and regrouped for reading practice upon the basis of their reading ability and not upon the time spent in school. Pupils should be tested at the beginning of each year and grouped accordingly. Apply remedial measures whenever necessary.\n\nVocational: Teachers are expected to emphasize the importance of vocational instruction\u2014rural. Dressmaking, crochet work, knitting, hand loom weaving, elementary domestic science, gardening and care of poultry are recommended for girls; and elementary carpentry work, general shop, Indian handicrafts, gardening, and poultry raising for boys. At residential schools the care of live stock, auto mechanics and cultivation of land should be emphasized. Cultivation should conform to the requirements of the home of each pupil. This is especially true of residential schools where pupils come from different reserves.\n\nPhysical: Lay stress on physical activities that will strengthen the body and improve health. Special attention should be given to outdoor group games, supervised play and exercises, accompanied by singing, to afford variation and improve physique.\n\nVocal Music: Simple songs and hymns; the theme of the former to be interesting and patriotic; the tunes bright and cheerful.\n\nReligious: Scriptural reading, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Instruction: Life of Christ, etc.\n\nCharacter: Teachers will strive to develop the spirit of responsibility among the children, giving responsibility in turn, even in small things; gathering books, pencils, etc., for the smaller ones. Give greater responsibility as the child advances in age. Demand success and tactfully reprimand failures. Teachers will stress obedience, courtesy, cleanliness, self-respect, thrift, self-maintenance and patriotism. Cultivate honesty and the spirit of fair play. Teach respect of law, order, authority and public property. Explain the relation of the same as to labour, laws and public duties.\nThe object of health education is to have the pupils form worthwhile habits. Habits cannot be taught in the traditional way as book-learning, but must be acquired by constant practice. Methods must be worked out by the teacher, who will have the pupils make health posters, join classroom health activities and health games, etc. It is of the utmost importance that Indian pupils be taught to recognize the value of a well-balanced diet. Recommend the use of meat, milk and vegetables. The teacher should stress the relationship of such diet to physical fitness, growth and general health.\n\nGreat care must be exercised by the teacher to see that the school-room is kept thoroughly clean. The floor should be swept daily and scrubbed frequently. The air in the schoolroom should be completely changed during recesses and at the noon hour, even in the coldest weather, by the opening of windows and doors. Spitting on the floor, or inside the school building, should not be allowed. Cleanliness in the classroom as well as in the surrounding buildings and school yard is a definite phase of health education. Great stress will be emphasized on these by the teacher.\n\nGeneral: Whenever possible the teachers will employ the activity program. Teachers must keep in mind that the text-book is but an educational instrument. Pupils must be well grouped according to their ability. Objective achievement tests should be used as frequently as necessary.\nMarch 3, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nSchool Hours - Day Schools\n\nReference your 112-6-3 of February 21\n\nThe hours of instruction and the arrangements for religious instruction will normally be the same as for schools under provincial control.\n\nDuring most of the year in Indian schools the hours will be:\n\nMornings 9.00 - 12.00\nAfternoons 1.30 - 4.00\n\nThrough November, December, January and February by arrangement between the Superintendent and the teachers the hours may be as follows:\n\nMornings 9.30 - 12.00\nAfternoons Terminating at 3.30\n\nYou will note the exceptions that may arise concerning the length of the noon intermission. During the months when the weather is severe and the daylight of shorter duration, as the children usually bring lunch to school, the noon intermission is usually reduced to one hour. In other months a longer noon intermission is usual, and it is expected that there will be supervised play.\nIt may be, however, that at some schools in your jurisdiction there exist certain conditions which require modification of the length of the noon hour. You should discuss these with the teacher and decide upon the schedule which seems to suit the particular situation best, so that, allowing for a recess of 15 minutes each morning and each afternoon, the hours of instruction may be:\n\n|        | Summer | Winter |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mornings | 2\u00bd hours | 2\u00bd hours |\n| Afternoons | 2\u00bd hours | 1\u00bd hours |\n\nDenominational religious instruction is allowable for one-half hour session each week. This period is to be regularly scheduled, and you should arrange, accordingly, with the missionary workers and teachers concerned that the visits of missionaries adhere to a regular schedule i.e., always on the same week day and at the same time, preferably the last half-hour of the afternoon session.\n\nWhere there are two or more denominational groups, arrangements should be made for them to receive instruction simultaneously. For example at Hobson the United Church minority could receive instruction in the nearby mission. At Louis Bull the Roman Catholic minority could be sent to the nearby mission. At Montana there is no minority to be considered.\n\nYour attention is invited to the Department's suggestions to teachers as printed on the back cover of the register. A copy of these suggestions is attached. Under \"Religious Instruction\" an indication is given of the inter-denominational religious instruction recommended for those schools where denominational differences are\nnot accentuated and where specialists are not available to give instruction. In implementing these suggestions the teacher must ensure that nothing is included in the opening exercises or other lessons to all the pupils that would be a cause for disharmony.\n\nBernard F.

I have on hand two samples of minerals, which were given to me by two Indians and they would like to have them assayed. I have heard that I can have them tested in Ottawa by the Government. I understand that the Dept. of Mines will make the assay. I would like to know to whom may I address the samples and how much would the test cost. One of the samples contains tin and I have seen the territory where the samples were taken. I expect the Indians back from the trap line this month and they will stay around a few days and then go back for muskrat trapping; they would like to have news of the assay before they leave for the North.\n\nI have heard that the Indian Dept. intends to establish a new Agency at Nakina; if this is so, my we have a Catholic Agent.

Henry, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration.)\n\nDue to the time limit of ten minutes the speaker divided his talk into ten questions and answers covering the points most commonly asked about Indian education.\n\n1. Q. How many schools are operated by this Division?\n\nA. There are nearly 450 day school classrooms in operation, mainly one-room schools; there are 70 residential schools, 7 hospital schools and about 20 seasonal schools. There are also a few schools jointly operated with the provinces.\n\n2. Q. How many children are receiving education in these various schools?\n\nA. About 23,500.\n\n3. Q. What kind of schools are operated by your Division?\n\nA. The day schools are for Indians living on settled reserves. The residential schools are for welfare cases and the children of Indians whose parents earn their living by trapping and similar occupations. The hospital schools are for both children and adults in Indian hospitals. The seasonal schools are for Indians particularly in Northern Quebec and Ontario, who come out to trading posts for three or four months in the summer holidays. The joint schools are increasing in number and are operated for both Indians and Whites.\n\n4. Q. Where are these schools situated?\n\nA. They are located in each of the provinces, in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. The majority of the schools are in Ontario and British Columbia, which two provinces have the largest Indian populations.\n\n5. Q. How are the Day schools operated?\n\nA. By the Department with teachers being classified as Civil Servants mostly on a seasonal basis (ten month year).\n\n6. Q. How are the Residential schools operated?\n\nA. These are conducted for the Department by various religious denominations. A per capita grant is paid for the maintenance and education of each Indian child.\n\n7. Q. How many teachers of various types do you hire?\n\nA. There are over 450 teachers hired with nearly 400 being classified as school teachers and 30 as welfare teachers. These latter teach in the hospital schools and on isolated reserves where their duties are many and varied. We also hire a number of seasonal school teachers and part-time teachers.\n6. Q. What curriculum do you follow?\n\nA. With few exceptions we conform to that of the province in which the school is located. Special emphasis is of course paid to health and physical education and the stress in social studies is on Canadian history and geography.\n\n9. Q. What are your urgent educational problems?\n\nA. (a) Supervision and inspection of a widely scattered school system.\n(b) The building of schools in isolated districts.\n(c) The hiring of good teachers when the schools are isolated and so far from stores, doctors, etc.\n\n10. Q. How many Indians are receiving tuition benefits for higher education?\n\nA. There are nearly 400 Indian children receiving provincial secondary education including vocational training, teacher training and enrolled in university courses. There are also nearly 200 Indian children enrolled in secondary grades in our own schools.\nEDUCATION OF CANADA'S INDIANS\n\n(Summary of talk given to the Professional Institute of the Civil Service of Canada on March 13, 1950 by B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration.)\n\nDue to the time limit of ten minutes the speaker divided his talk into ten questions and answers covering the points most commonly asked about Indian education.\n\n1. Q. How many schools are operated by this Division?\n\nA. There are nearly 450 Day school classrooms in operation, mainly one-room schools; there are 70 residential schools, 7 hospital schools and about 20 seasonal schools. There are also a few schools jointly operated with the provinces.\n\n2. Q. How many children are receiving education in these various schools?\n\nA. About 23,500.\n\n3. Q. What kind of schools are operated by your Division?\n\nA. The day schools are for Indians living on settled reserves. The residential schools are for welfare cases and the children of Indians whose parents earn their living by trapping and similar occupations. The hospital schools are for both children and adults in Indian hospitals. The seasonal schools are for Indians particularly in Northern Quebec and Ontario, who come out to trading posts for three or four months in the summer holidays. The joint schools are increasing in number and are operated for both Indians and Whites.\n\n4. Q. Where are these schools situated?\n\nA. They are located in each of the provinces, in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. The majority of the schools are in Ontario and British Columbia, which two provinces have the largest Indian populations.\n\n5. Q. How are the Day schools operated?\n\nA. By the Department with teachers being classified as Civil Servants mostly on a seasonal basis (ten month year).\n\n6. Q. How are the Residential schools operated?\n\nA. These are conducted for the Department by various religious denominations. A per capita grant is paid for the maintenance and education of each Indian child.\n\n7. Q.

There are nearly 400 Indian children receiving provincial secondary education including vocational training, teacher training and enrolled in university courses. There are also nearly 200 Indian children enrolled in secondary grades in our own schools.\nAs you know, considerable discussion has been carried on lately in the newspapers concerning changes in the Ontario curriculum which possibly will result in the elimination of entrance examinations.\n\nFor a number of years, children from the Quebec side of our Agency have been writing entrance examinations in Cornwall to qualify them for admission to Ontario high schools. If such Ontario Departmental examinations are now going to be discontinued, how will our children from our Quebec schools qualify for admission to an Ontario high school.\n\nI would be interested in obtaining all the information I possibly can concerning these changes as they affect our schools.\n\n[Signature]\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nOttawa, March 25, 1950.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nChanges in Ontario Curriculum\n\nReference your 33/25-1 of March 20\n\nThe projected changes in the Ontario system of education amount to the introduction of a junior high school. I understand that the Entrance examinations will still be held this year and that the elimination of these tests will not take place until 1931.\n\nI will be seeing the officials of the Ontario Department of Education in Toronto in April, when I will further discuss the problem of children from the Quebec side of your agency being qualified for admission to Ontario high schools.\n\nIn view of the fact that most of your pupils attend Ontario high schools, it might be advisable to have all your schools follow the Ontario course of study. This of course would be a serious change and we would require more detailed information than we have at the present time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 27, 1950.\n\nRegistrar,\nSeacrest College,\nRural Centre,\nCrossville, Tennessee.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOne of our teachers has attended your Rural Centre and has written favourably to our Department concerning the courses which you offer there.\n\nCould you please send me the bulletin of your courses so that we may advise any other of our teachers who might wish to attend your college during the coming summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFH/MMcH\nOttawa, March 25, 1949.\n\nHonorable:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1939-1949\n\nMany changes have taken place in Indian education during the past 10 years. The following statistics will show the growth of the Indian school population during that time:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total (All Schools) |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1939-40     | 9,179      | 8,276       | 9,573      | 6,232              | 16,752    | 14,508            | 77.36                  |\n| 1940-41     | 9,348      | 8,345       | 12,511     | 10,320             | 21,863    | 18,759            | 85.33                  |\n\nYou will note that the total includes more than the pupils at the residential and the day schools as there are a number of children attending joint schools.\n\nThe greatest growth in school population has taken place during the past 3 years. For example, in the year ending March 1949, the enrolment at day schools had increased by 1,529 pupils.\n\nIn addition to the 21,863 pupils shown above, there were 925 Indian children in elementary grades and 377 in secondary grades in provincial schools. This meant a total of 23,165 Indian pupils enrolled in educational classes. It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of school age children until the next census is completed. The 1944 census showed 28,429 children between the ages\nof 7 and 16. It is therefore safe to estimate that there are now about 35,000 of school age. This means that there are over 7,000 children for whom no educational facilities are yet provided.\n\nPercentage of Attendance\n\nDuring the past few years there has been a steady increase in the percentage attendance. This is particularly noticeable in Indian day schools where formerly the pupils attended irregularly. The day school attendance, however, is now improving steadily as a result of family allowances paid, the better calibre of teachers employed, the improvements in classroom techniques and equipment, and finally the awakening interest of Indian parents in the education of their children. We intend to stimulate this interest by the formation of Parent-Teacher groups, adult education classes, and other community movements.\n\nEducation in Association with other Children\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, we have been accomplishing major changes in having more Indian children admitted to white schools. In British Columbia alone the number has increased from about 200 in September 1948 to nearly 700 in September 1949. We will continue to work towards the admission of more Indian children to provincial schools in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee.\n\nErection of New Schools\n\nThe number of new schools erected can best be illustrated by the fact that the Department hired 285 day school teachers in 1946 and is now employing nearly 450. This growth represents the opening of new schools and also additions to existing facilities.\n\nAt residential schools we have erected several classroom blocks and one dormitory block. One new residential school is presently under construction and the tender has been let for the erection of another. Both of these are in northern Canada.\nImprovement in the calibre of teachers\n\nUnless good teachers are appointed to fill the new classrooms being provided, educational progress among the Indians will not continue to improve. Therefore, the Department has been constantly weeding out unqualified and insufficient teachers and replacing them with certificated teachers as conditions permit.\n\nIn spite of the great teacher shortage which presently exists, we have been able to accomplish a great deal during the past 3 years. A review of the situation can best be presented graphically as follows:\n\n| Day School Teacher Percentages | January 1948 | January 1950 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grade 1 (Third Class or No certificate) | 34 % | 22 % |\n| Grade 2 (Second Class Certificate) | 30 % | 25 % |\n| Grade 3 (First Class Certificate) | 27 % | 39 % |\n| Grade 4, Principals and Welfare Teachers | 9 % | 14 % |\n\nTo summarize the above statistics, you will note that we have reduced the number of non-certified teachers from one third of our staff to nearly one fifth of our staff in a space of 3 years. During the same time we have increased the number of teachers with First Class Certificates from 27% to 39%.\n\nSecondary Education\n\nThere has been a steady increase in the number of Indian children who are enrolled in the secondary grades. In the academic year ending June 1949 there were 777 children in high school grades in provincial schools and 284 in our own schools.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 31, 1950.\n\nHandwritten:\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION 1939-1949\n\nMany changes have taken place in Indian education during the past 10 years. The following statistics will show the growth of the Indian school population during that time:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total (all schools) |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance |\n| 1938-39     | 9,179     | 6,276        | 9,573     | 6,232        | 18,752    | 14,508        |\n| 1948-49     | 9,348     | 6,245        | 12,511    | 10,320       | 21,863    | 16,759        |\n\nYou will note that the total includes more than the pupils at the residential and day schools as there are a number of children attending joint schools.\n\nThe greatest growth in school population has taken place during the past 3 years.

The 1944 census showed 28,439 children between the ages...\nof 7 and 16. It is therefore safe to estimate that there are now about 31,000 of school age. This means that there are only 7,000 children for whom no educational facilities are yet provided.\n\nPercentage of Attendance\n\nDuring the past few years there has been a steady increase in the percentage attendance.

Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 27, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL ACLAND\n\nEducation of Indians\n\nPlease find attached a statement of statistics which should do a great deal to correct the misstatements made by Brigadier Martin.\n\nThe figures show that we have reduced now to about 6 or 7000, the number of children for whom educational facilities are provided. The number of day school classrooms has risen from 285 to nearly 450 within the last three years.\n\nWe can not provide statistics for the qualifications of teachers in residential schools as these are controlled by the denominations concerned. In the day schools, however, we can definitely report on the improved qualifications of our teachers.\n\nIn 1948 we hired 352 day school teachers of whom 120 (or 34%) had only teaching permits, licenses or no certificate. We had 97 teachers (or 28%) with First Class Certificates and 120 (or 34%) with Second Class Certificates.\n\nIn January 1950 we were hiring 432 teachers of whom 95 (or 22%) were Grade 1 teachers, 172 (or 40%) were Grade 3 teachers and 109 (or 26%) were Grade 2 teachers.\n\nA review of this situation can be presented graphically hereunder:\n\n| Teachers | January 1948 | January 1950 |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grade 1  | 34%          | 22%          |\n| Grade 2  | 32%          | 26%          |\nTeachers\n\nJanuary 1948 | January 1950\n---|---\nGrade 3 | 28% | 40%\nGrade 4, Principals and Welfare teachers | 6% | 12%\n\nIn other words, we have reduced the number of non-qualified teachers from 1/3 of our staff to 1/5 in a space of two years. We have increased the number of teachers with First Class Certificates from 28% to 40%.\n\nSECONDARY EDUCATION\n\nWe have noted Brigadier Martin's statement concerning part-time education. This did apply to our schools three years ago but we have greatly reduced the number of schools in which the children are not fully occupied in classroom work. By the introduction of labor-saving devices such as peeler peelers, washing machines etc. and by the large increase in the per capita grants we have attempted to make the school management less dependent on the use of children for work in the schools.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs I was dictating the above information, there was placed on my desk a letter from the Canadian Education Association outlining the shortage of teachers in schools across Canada. Several provinces report schools closed because of the lack of teachers and the number opened but without qualified teachers is indeed a revelation. There are 750 such schools in Nova Scotia, 703 in Saskatchewan, 609 in New Brunswick, 603 in Manitoba and even 300 in Ontario. I, therefore, feel that our day schools have little to be criticized in this regard.\n\nBernard F.

They represent new teachers coming into our service mostly for the first time. You will particularly note a large number of appointments effective the first of September, 1949. This is the opening of the academic year, and naturally, there is a considerable turnover in our teaching force during the summer months. We have been replacing non-qualified teachers by certificated teachers, and such turnovers during the summer months will continue until we have replaced the non-certificated teachers.\n\nBernard F.

Officer.\n\nCopy sent to [signature].\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your l-l-l (2), March 25th, please be advised that for a number of years we have found it necessary to follow as closely as possible in our Quebec schools the Ontario course of studies. This has been possible, of course, through the splendid cooperation given by Mr. Wescott who has been our inspector for a number of years and is thoroughly conversant with our situation here. What would happen should Mr. Wescott ever be changed to another district would be hard to predict. I might add that Mr. Matthews, the Ontario Inspector, has been very sympathetic as well in this matter. No doubt if a permanent solution could be worked out it would be much better for all concerned.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn of any further developments following your interview with officials of the Ontario Department of Education next month.\n\nT. M. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nMarch 3, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nSchool Hours - Day Schools\n\nReference your 112-6-3 of February 21\n\nThe hours of instruction and the arrangements for religious instruction will normally be the same as for schools under provincial control.\n\nDuring most of the year in Indian schools the hours will be:\n\nMornings 9.00 - 12.00\nAfternoons 1.30 - 4.00\n\nThrough November, December, January and February by arrangement between the Superintendent and the teachers the hours may be as follows:\n\nMornings 9.30 - 12.00\nAfternoons Terminating at 3.30\n\nYou will note the exceptions that may arise concerning the length of the noon intermission. During the months when the weather is severe and the daylight of shorter duration, as the children usually bring lunch to school, the noon intermission is usually reduced to one hour. In other months a longer noon intermission is usual, and it is expected that there will be supervised play.\nIt may be, however, that at some schools in your jurisdiction there exist certain conditions which require modification of the length of the noon hour. You should discuss these with the teacher and decide upon the schedule which seems to suit the particular situation best, so that, allowing for a recess of 15 minutes each morning and each afternoon, the hours of instruction may be:\n\n|       | Summer | Winter |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| Mornings | 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) hours | 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) hours |\n| Afternoons | 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) hours | 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) hours |\n\nDenominational religious instruction is allowable for one-half hour session each week. This period is to be regularly scheduled, and you should arrange, accordingly, with the missionary workers and teachers concerned that the visits of the missionaries adhere to a regular schedule i.e., always on the same week day and at the same time, preferably the last half-hour of the afternoon session.\n\nWhere there are two or more denominational groups, arrangements should be made for them to receive instruction simultaneously. For example at Hobbsma the United Church minority could receive instruction in the nearby manse. At Louis Bull the Roman Catholic minority could be sent to the nearby mission. At Montana there is no minority to be considered.\n\nYour attention is invited to the Department's suggestions to teachers as printed on the back cover of the register. A copy of these suggestions is attached. Under \"Religious Instruction\" an indication is given of the inter-denominational religious instruction recommended for those schools where denominational differences are...\nnot accentuated and where specialists are not available to give instruction. In implementing these suggestions the teacher must ensure that nothing is included in the opening exercises or other lessons to all the pupils that would be a cause for disharmony.\n\n(sgd.)

Neary,\nSuperintendent, Education Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 15, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR:\n\nRegional Inspectors of Indian Schools\n\nSince our conversation of yesterday evening, I have just received a letter from Mr. Ostrander, our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan.\n\nAs a result of a letter sent to him by me, Mr. Ostrander has had each of his Superintendents submit a report on the various Day School teachers in their agencies. On the basis of these reports he is recommending the dismissal of eight teachers. I can best present his viewpoint by quoting from his letter as follows:\n\n\"In each case the Indian Superintendent has given his frank opinion of the teacher, and in no case do I feel inclined to disagree with him. It is my opinion that the following teachers should be replaced at the beginning of the next term:\n\nAbsalom Halkett, Shoal Lake Indian Day School,\nMr. John L. Lowe, Red Earth Indian Day School,\nMrs. W.F. Donaghy, Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School,\nMrs. M. Burbridge, James Smith North Indian Day School,\nMr. James A. Gardner, Kinistino Indian Day School,\nMr. F.C. Monaghan, Poorman's Indian Day School,\nMr. Robert Hick, Bay Star Indian Day School,\nMr. G.R.J. Chouinard, Meadow Lake Indian Day School\n\nConsideration might also be given to replacing Mr. W.F. Cavanaugh, at the St. Francis Indian Day School. Mr. Cavanaugh is doing fairly good work, but is quite aged, and is doing nothing but strictly classroom work.\"\nI believe that the time has been reached when we should discontinue employing aged teachers at Indian day schools. It is beginning to appear to me that Saskatchewan teachers are now realizing that salaries at Indian day schools are fairly good, and the number of applications from well qualified teachers is gradually increasing. However, there is also another increase which is not so promising, and that is the increase in the number of teachers who, having retired from Saskatchewan schools, on pension try to get into our service. If they are too old to teach white schools they are certainly too old to teach Indian schools. It is time for us to start weeding out our present employed aged teachers and to refuse to accept any more of them. In this connection I refer particularly to such cases as the case of Mrs. B.G. Eugenie Thomas, referred to in Department letter of March 17th, 1926, File 1-1-1-(3), who is applying for a teaching position, and such teachers as Miss Moore, Mrs. Stewart, Mr. Donahy, Mrs. Burbridge, Mr. Cavanaugh, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Monaghan, and Mr. Hick, to mention some of them.\n\nWe need teachers with their careers in front of them, rather than behind them. This fact is especially emphasized at this time because of the fact that our teachers, if young and well qualified, can become permanent Civil Servants, making a career of their work, and having a substantial superannuation at the end. There is also the other important factor which must be considered, and that is the fact that most of these teachers who have retired from Provincial schools have done so because they were too old to want to, or be able to, comply with new and improved teaching methods. They come to our service hoping that we are so old fashioned that we won't ask them to change their methods. If there is any one thing needed more than any other thing in our Indian education, it is a willingness to continually change for the better.\nIt is very difficult for elderly people to change, at least they do not, whether we hope they will, or not.\"\n\nWhen you are discussing this matter with the Deputy Minister I feel that Mr. Ostrander's views should be presented to him.\n\nIt is very difficult for the Department to decide in each of these eight cases as some of the teachers may be doing good work in the classroom but not impressing the Indian Superintendents in other ways. Naturally our Indian Superintendents are not professional educators and are not qualified to report upon the teaching efficiency of these various teachers. This places me in a difficult predicament in that we have only non-commissioned Provincial School Inspectors' reports on most of these teachers. I need a frank report from one of my own School Inspectors so that a proper decision can be reached on the proposed replacement of each of these eight teachers.\n\nWe are now employing 478 teachers in this Division, and with no adequate supervision system, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the efficiency of our educational system. The need for these Regional Inspectors is so apparent that even the Civil Service Commission Investigator has recommended the establishment of such positions.\n\nBernard F.

Ontario School Inspectors' Association\n\nThis meeting took place on Monday April 10 and as usual, the officials from this Branch were made welcome to these meetings which are restricted otherwise to Ontario school inspectors. The main discussion was on the new curricula for grades 7, 8 and 9. Reports were received from the various committees which had been established for each subject of the courses of study. There was heated discussion from the floor concerning the revised curriculum and we were able to get valuable advanced information concerning the changes in the Ontario course of study.\n\nAt the annual luncheon of the Ontario School Inspectors' Association we were very pleased with the reception given to the choir from the Six Nations No. 2 Indian Day School. There were only 6 girls in this group but they performed most admirably under the direction of their teacher, Miss Jamieson. We received many personal compliments from the school inspectors after the luncheon concerning the fine singing of these Indian girls.\n2. Education Association Lectures\n\nThe three outstanding lectures were given by Dr. A. S. Artley of the University of Missouri, Sir Alfred Zimmern of Oxford University and the Honourable Dana Porter, Minister of Education for Ontario.\n\nDr. Artley is a specialist in the teaching of the language arts and his two lectures on \"Helping Children Become Independent in Word Attack\" and \"Vocabulary Development\" were most applicable to our Indian schools. I was able to obtain valuable notes and will later write an article for our Indian School Bulletin on the information thus received.\n\nSir Alfred Zimmern's lecture was on \"Education for Life in the Atomic Age\". His address was given before several thousand people and was an outstanding example of the ability of a trained lecturer to hold the attention of even a large audience. His philosophy of education is exemplary for all teachers in a democracy and his lecture left a vivid impression of the importance of the work of the teacher.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Porter's address was concerned with the new curriculum for Ontario.\n\nI also attended other lectures on social studies in the primary grades and on rhythmical activities in the junior grades.\n\n3. Meetings with Officials of the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nAs every school inspector is required to attend this meeting, I was naturally able to solve many problems with regard to our many Indian day schools in this province. Their co-operation is always most keenly appreciated and much correspondence can be avoided by this annual meeting.\n\nI attended a meeting with Dr. Brown, the Registrar of Teachers, and Mr. Elborn, the Superintendent of Professional Training. At the present time, teachers in Ontario can obtain teaching certificates after two years of teaching, two good\ninspectors' reports and two professional summer schools. However, such teachers are required to sign a statement certifying that they will teach for at least one year in a provincial school after obtaining such a certificate.\n\nI was able to gain a valuable concession from this regulation and in future our Indian school teachers will be able to obtain certificates without signing such a declaration. As I have at least five teachers in this predicament now, I feel that this effort was indeed worthwhile.\n\nI also met Dr. Gannau, the Superintendent of Elementary Education, concerning joint schools in the northern part of the province, and Mr. J. C. Walsh, concerning future plans for joint schools.\n\n4. Meetings with Officials of Church Denominations\n\nI met Dr. Dorsey and Mrs. Lovejoy on Wednesday April 12 and will submit separate reports concerning the various schools and problems which were discussed.\n\nUnfortunately, the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church was absent from Toronto on holidays and I was unable to meet her, as I usually do.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI have just discovered that you are a friend of Dr. Gait shell's (I taught Indian craft on his Summer Course for teachers two years ago) so I phoned him today to enquire whether you ever had headquarters in Toronto. He said not but that you did come to Toronto occasionally. I suggested I should write a card whether you might care to see me or would perhaps very kindly let me know when you would be in Toronto.\n\nI came to Canada ten years ago to study Indians, I named a Treat Indian and am a member of Lake Nipissing Reserve. I put a brief in the Project Manual Committee re Indian craft.\n\nAt present I am collecting information for a Who's who of talented Indians which I hope to reproduce in mimeograph.\ncopies later - under the heading of each province will be lists of Indians talented in crafts, painting, writing, leadership, woodcraft, featherwork, sewing etc. - a list Indian organizations & a list of white people actively interested in Indians.\n\nThis would provide some centralization by which both Indians & whites could hear or talented Indians & contact them.\n\nI am doing this as much as possible directly through Indian organizations in order to achieve it in Newfoundland. I am also collecting paintings by Indians - that is if it is easy to send them in to me - for exhibition - e.g., Gaitshull would like to show them at his summer course.\n\nI am greatly interested in Indian affairs in general - a subject which I would greatly appreciate an opportunity of discussing with you. Various commercial Indians have suggested that I contact you - the whole subject of two\nSorry for letter.

Brown, Director, Junior Red Cross, Halifax, N.S.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEnclosure\n\nBFN/HM\nApril 14, 1950.\n\nMrs. Ryland H. New,\nLakehore East,\nOakville, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. New:\n\nAs I discussed with you in Toronto, I am attaching the list of Indian agencies in Ontario with the populations of the Indians as shown in our 1946 census. You will note that there are 32,421 Indians in Ontario.\n\nThe total population of Indians in Canada is now over 125,000 and the next province to Ontario in the number of Indians in population is British Columbia with 25,315.\n\nUnfortunately, it will take a few days to break down the schools by agencies as we do not readily have such statistics. However, I know you are anxious to obtain the number of Indians by agencies and I am therefore sending you this information immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\n| Agency                  | Total Number of Indians |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Abitibi                 | 70                      |\n| Cape Croker             | 470                     |\n| Caradoc                 | 2,039                   |\n| Chapleau                | 936                     |\n| Christian Island        | 342                     |\n| Fort Frances            | 955                     |\n| Georgina Island         | 157                     |\n| Golden Lake             | 202                     |\n| James Bay               | 1,986                   |\n| Kenora                  | 1,123                   |\n| Savanne                 | 480                     |\n| Manitoulin              | 2,939                   |\n| Norviam                 | 314                     |\n| Nipissing               | 1,134                   |\n| Parry Sound             | 750                     |\n| Port Arthur             | 2,005                   |\n| Rama                    | 349                     |\n| Rice Lake               | 600                     |\n| Sarnia                  | 728                     |\n| Saugeron                | 482                     |\n| Sault Ste.

This has resulted in a total increase during the one year of 2,015 (including children enrolled in combined schools).\n\nIn tables 2 and 3 are listed the Indian children enrolled in provincial and private schools. There are now 285 Indian children in elementary grades and 377 Indian children in secondary grades in such schools. Added to the totals above, this means that there are now 23,293 Indians enrolled in educational classes.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of attendance from 80.3% to 85.33% is also noteworthy. Children have been much more prompt in returning to Indian residential schools after the summer holidays. At Indian day schools, the attendance has steadily improved as a result of family allowances payments, the better salaries of teachers employed and improvements in classroom equipment and materials.\n\nThe building of new day schools and the opening of classroom blocks at residential schools has continued at a steady pace. The number of day schools increased during the year from 285 to 300 and entire classrooms were added to several schools. In all, nearly 50 more classrooms were provided in day and residential schools.\n\nThe Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons appointed to continue and complete the examination and consideration of the Indian Act, in its Committee of Proceedings and Evidence\nNo. 5 covering the period Tuesday April 13, 1948, to and including Monday June 21, 1948, made the following recommendation concerning the operation of Indian schools:\n\n\"Your Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nTherefore, the Education Division has been negotiating with School Boards and Provincial Departments of Education for the training of Indian children in provincial schools. The following statement shows the enrolment of Indian children in such schools in the elementary grades:\n\n| Province       | Grade I | Grade II | Grade III | Grade IV | Grade V | Grade VI | Grade VII | Grade VIII | Totals |\n|---------------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Nova Scotia   | 7       | 1        | 6         | 3        | 4       | 4        | ...       | 1         | 26     |\n| New Brunswick | 3       | 3        | 5         | 5        | 4       | 4        | 2         | 1         | 27     |\n| Quebec        | 5       | 6        | 6         | 12       | 15      | 13       | 12        | 8         | 77     |\n| Ontario       | 44      | 32       | 46        | 39       | 27      | 28       | 10        | 10        | 256    |\n| Manitoba      | 36      | 8        | 9         | 3        | 2       | 5        | 1         | ...       | 60     |\n| Saskatchewan  | 13      | 9        | 10        | 9        | 3       | 2        | 2         | ...       | 48     |\n| Alberta       | 19      | 5        | 9         | 5        | 5       | 4        | 1         | 3         | 47     |\n| British Columbia | 99    | 61       | 51        | 37       | 36      | 28       | 24        | 19        | 377    |\n| U.S.A.        | 1       | 1        | 2         | ...      | ...     | ...      | ...       | 3         | 7      |\n| **Totals**    | **257** | **166**  | **136**   | **113**  | **98**  | **88**   | **55**    | **42**    | **925** |\n\nThe number of Indians receiving secondary education continues to increase at a satisfactory rate. In addition to the 268 pupils enrolled in our own schools (as shown in table 4) the following summary shows the Indian children attending provincial and private schools in the secondary grades. This brings the total of Indians attending secondary schools and universities to 661.\nThe standard of teachers employed in our Indian day schools continues to show improvement. The number of non-qualified or Grade I teachers decreased by 16 and the number of teachers holding First Class certificates increased by 24. This trend in the hiring of day school teachers will continue as a departmental policy and we hope for the eventual elimination of non-qualified teachers entirely from our schools. At the present time the implementation of this policy is made difficult by the serious shortage of qualified teachers across Canada.\n\nThe supply of school textbooks and materials is now much better and we are able to provide our schools with teaching aids which have been difficult to obtain during the immediate past-year years. Our teachers are advised of the availability of this equipment through the medium of our teachers' magazine, the \"Indian School Bulletin\".\n\nThe provision of school lunch supplies has been extended and many day schools are now serving a hot meal daily. The distribution of vitamin biscuits was again made to day schools in Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe following tables include a summary of attendance, sex, religious and grade distribution, and a breakdown of attendance by provinces:\nEDUCATION\n\nThe table of pupil enrolment and attendance follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Residential Schools | Day Schools | Total (All Schools) |\n|-------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n|             | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Enrolment | Average Attendance | Percentage of Attendance |\n| 1939-40     | 9,027     | 6,643        | 9,369     | 6,417            | 18,396    | 15,060            | 81.87                |\n| 1940-41     | 8,774     | 6,243        | 8,651     | 6,110            | 17,425    | 14,353            | 82.37                |\n| 1941-42     | 8,840     | 6,283        | 8,441     | 5,837            | 17,281    | 13,114            | 80.63                |\n| 1942-43     | 8,830     | 6,046        | 8,046     | 5,395            | 16,876    | 13,441            | 79.04                |\n| 1943-44     | 8,729     | 7,902        | 7,858     | 5,355            | 16,587    | 13,257            | 79.92                |\n| 1944-45     | 8,865     | 8,006        | 7,573     | 5,199            | 16,438    | 13,165            | 80.09                |\n| 1945-46     | 9,149     | 8,266        | 9,532     | 6,691            | 18,805    | 15,043            | 79.99                |\n| 1946-47     | 9,304     | 8,192        | 10,161    | 7,344            | 19,622    | 15,541            | 79.91                |\n| 1947-48     | 9,986     | 7,863        | 10,982    | 8,178            | 21,010    | 16,151            | 80.34                |\n| 1948-49     | 9,368     | 8,345        | 12,511    | 10,320           | 21,983    | 18,759            | 85.33                |\n| 1949-50     | 9,316     | 8,593        | 14,093    | 12,060           | 23,409    | 20,653            | 88.23                |\n\nThe enrolment at residential schools has decreased slightly but there has been an increase in the day school enrolment of 1,582. Since 1947 there has been a total increase in day school enrolment of 3,111 pupils.\n\nIn tables 2 and 3 are listed the Indian children enrolled in provincial and private schools. There are now 1,180 Indian children in elementary grades and 465 Indian pupils in secondary schools. Added to the totals above, this means that there are now 25,024 Indians enrolled in educational classes.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of attendance reflects the effect of better teachers, schools and equipment and the increasing realization of the Indians of the need for education.\n\nThe building of new day schools has continued and the effect of this programme can be seen in the increase in day school enrolment of over 3,000 pupils within the last two years. We are reducing the number of children for whom educational facilities are not provided and are building new schools in the northern sections of the provinces and in the Northwest Territories. Previously, many of these Indian children had no schools whatsoever.\n\nTable 2 shows an increase of nearly 200 children enrolled in provincial schools. New agreements are being negotiated now to further increase the number of Indian children attending such schools.\n\nIn table 3 it will be noted that the number of Indian children receiving secondary education continues to increase at a satisfactory rate. We now have 465 children attending secondary grades in provincial and\nprivate schools. In our own schools (as shown in table 4) we have a total of 369 children. This raises the total of Indians attending secondary schools and universities to 834 as compared with 661 pupils last year.\n\nTeachers at Indian Day Schools\n\nA steady improvement is shown in the qualifications and experience of teachers employed in our Indian day schools. The number of non-qualified or Grade One teachers decreased by 7 and the number of teachers holding First Class Certificates increased by 39. The raising of the standard of teaching has resulted in improved attendance and a reduction in \"drop-outs\". This is shown in table 4.\n\nVocational Education\n\nThe Supervisor of Vocational Education has reported that the Proficiency Badge system has proven quite successful. A total of 7,645 badges have now been distributed to Indian pupils for proficiency in various basic operations.\n\nIn day schools it is often difficult to encourage a programme of manual training because so many of our schools have but one teacher. In order to help these teachers and also other manual training teachers, two booklets have been prepared entitled \"First Year Woodwork\" and \"Second Year Woodwork\". A third book is in course of preparation.\n\nIn residential schools we are gradually securing the services of more and better qualified instructors. We are also beginning a programme of erecting small manual training shops at the larger schools.\n\nPhysical Education and Recreation\n\nA new supervisor has been recently appointed and is now conducting surveys at various reserves and schools. We have purchased considerable supplies of sports equipment and have encouraged athletic activities of various kinds. Our school teams have been particularly successful in hockey and several bantam, midget and juvenile championships have been won.\n\nA programme of adult education has been started and we intend to encourage further courses, particularly at day schools. Some home and school associations have been started and this new official will encourage the formation of others. It is felt that Indian parents must be encouraged to take an active interest in the education of their children.\nOttawa, May 25, 1950.\n\nCOLONEL NEARY:\n\nOne copy of statement on this file was sent to Miss E.

The nature of the sources will determine to some extent how the subject is approached.\n\nCanon Cook has suggested that I write to you. I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know if anything has been done on this subject recently, and what materials are available.\n\nIn the event that I am able to work on this topic, I should like to spend the month of June, which is my vacation, going through the material.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nThe Rev. Floyd Freeston\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Henderson,\n\nThis is the letter we discussed in the phone.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nReference your 1-1-1 (one) of February 8;-\n\nThe convention here lasts until Saturday, but I'll be calling on you on Monday, February 14th.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nW. Greening\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 22, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR,\n\nReport on School Openings, Southern Ontario.\n\n1. Mohawk Institute:\n\nI arrived in Brantford at noon Sunday May 14, and there met Mr. Morris and Colonel Randle. We visited a new brick four-room school being constructed at Princeton, near Brantford. This is the type of building which Colonel Randle wishes for an intermediate consolidated school at Chateaugay. I will submit a separate recommendation on this proposal.\n\nWe found things improved at the Mohawk Institute with Mrs. Zimmerman in a better state of health. I would recommend that we proceed with the principal's residence as soon as possible. We are wasting valuable space in the main building and are further jeopardizing her mental health by leaving things as they are.\n\nThe work being done on the upper dormitories is proceeding satisfactorily. The workmanship is good and I am particularly impressed with the use of Masonite panels instead of plaster. I feel that we could use this on all the lower walls in dormitories hallways, etc., in future.\n\nWe are including an amount for further work on this building in our Supplementary Estimates as we can now proceed with the many repairs required to the walls in the various rooms.\n2. Diocese of Huron\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to see the Bishop of Huron as their Synod was in session. However, I did meet the Diocesan Commissioner and discussed various matters with him. We naturally discussed Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman.\n\n3. Back Settlement School\n\nThis opening was held at 10:30 a.m. on May 15th. There was a good crowd of Indians in attendance. The Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Caines, Mr. Joblin and Mr. Morris all spoke well. Pictures of the building indicate the good workmanship. This was erected by Indians under a white foreman-carpenter.\n\n4. Osida No. 2 School\n\nThis opening took place at 2:30 on the same afternoon. There was an even larger crowd of Indians. The school was opened by Mr. H. McCubbin, M.P., Mr. W. Smith, the Provincial School Inspector for this section of the reserve,\nspoke very highly of the building. Mr. Joblin, Mr. Morris and some of the Indians also spoke. This is an even better building than Back Settlement with electricity and running water. The teacher, Mrs. Johnstone, had it beautifully decorated and all the visitors were noticeably impressed. The concert put on by these children was very good.\n\n5. Hareviantown\n\nThis opening took place at 2:30 Tuesday May 16. It was held outside and attracted a very large group of Indians. This building is undoubtedly the best of the four we opened. There was very little white supervision and the Indians really put in many extras in their work. I have already sent you a newspaper account of this opening and attach additional photographs. The children put on a very fine Chinese play. Mr. Barrett, the Provincial School Inspector and other white officials spoke well but the Indian Chief here was most outstanding. His address was exceptionally fine and sincere. Mr. Spence proved a good chairman and this opening was a great success.\n6. Walpole Island\n\nThis school was built by contract and the finish is not as good as on those buildings erected by Indian labour. You will note that there is no basement, due to the low lying land surrounding the building. It is not possible to have a proper basement on Walpole Island. This opening was held indoors and the school was packed. The Provincial School Inspector, the Mayor of Wallaceburg, the Principal of Wallaceburg High School and the Indians all spoke. Mr. Stallwood proved a very capable chairman and the programme put on by the children was diversified and interesting. The Indian number shown in my photograph was particularly good. The other photograph shows the Provincial Policeman playing with the children after the opening.\n\nI would like to recommend that the Deputy Minister be given an opportunity of looking at this report, particularly of the buildings erected by Indian labour. I feel that we are getting exceptionally good value in these buildings and that the finishing details are better than those erected by contractors.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThe attached report from Colonel Heary, on the recent opening of the new Indian day schools in Ontario, is forwarded for your information.\n\nI should appreciate return of the report in due course.\n\nDirector.\nMay 22, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR.\n\nReport on School Openings, Southern Ontario.\n\n1.

Downing.\n\nFirstly, Mr. Thirion, my former principal, whom I was anticipating a statement from. It appears that he is no longer principal of that institution, and refers me to Mr. A. McGee, B.A. This procedure would necessitate an additional interval of more than a week.\n\nSir, may I state that during my last years in school I was studying grades 10 and 11. Circumstances of a domestic nature, a few weeks prior to final exams, necessitated my departure from school. I have no leaving certificate. I should like, also, to state that I have studied extensively various courses issued by Inter National School of Correspondence.\nIt is rather unfortunate that I am not able to exhibit a statement of higher merit and attribute the absence of such to the fact that my scholastic career, most particularly during its infancy, suffered numerous, unavoidable interruptions and reverses of a disturbing and arresting nature.\n\nI should like to mention that in view of the knowledge required, it is my sincere belief that I am not incapacitated for such a task as my request involves.\n\nI do believe that a patient sympathetic nature, coupled with talent and a slight knowledge of child psychology, in my case, would compensate for the deficiency in educational requirements.\n\nIt would be with the greatest enthusiasm of joy and pleasure that I would accept any opportunity to the children.\n\nThe work as a remunerative basis would hold a most remote place in my mind and aspirations; but rather as a field to promote\nprogressing and perpetuate good to those\nin need.\n\nI shall mention that I am a\nnon-catholic of the Protestant Faith.\nInviting to an early response,\nand thanking you,\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\n\nGeo. F. Downing\n\nGeo. F. Downing\nM. Jervis Siding, Ont.\nOttawa, September 21, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Downing:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and to thank you for the additional information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the fact that you have not had normal training, it would be exceedingly difficult for me to justify your appointment to an Indian day school under existing regulations. We have at this date only a few vacancies, and I am of the opinion that we shall experience little difficulty in filling these with fully qualified teachers. However, in view of the fact that you appear to be deeply interested in securing a position as teacher among Indians, it occurred to me that you might be able to secure a position at an Indian residential school, particularly if you are unmarried and have no dependents. These schools are operated by the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and United Churches. If you are interested you might apply to any one of the following:\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., representing the Roman Catholic Church - 518 McDermot Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., Secretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, 59-45 The Bible House, Alexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ont.\n\nMr. Geo. F. Downing,\nMcInnis Siding,\nOnt.\n\np.t.o.\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nMissionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Boulevard, Toronto, Ont.\n\nIf you do this, I feel confident your application will be sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n382 Rideau St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSept. 17, 1942.\n\nMrs. R. A. Nally,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am today in receipt of your letter concerning our conversation on the 16th instant.\n\nApparently you did not refer to the agent's opinion regarding the situation in that particular school. I was looking forward to his reply, hoping against hopes perhaps, that I would be accepted. It was very considerate of you to inform me about this school at Golden Lake but I'm afraid I cannot accept it since there are no private living quarters provided for the teacher. If such a school is still available in western Ontario, I will gladly accept it. My reason for desiring such is for the sole purpose of devoting all my spare time to study alone. I have quite some work to catch up with after being away from teaching for three years.\n\nIf you should happen to contact such a school as I've mentioned before Oct. 1st, please do not hesitate to inform me. I will be forever grateful to you. Wishing you all possible success.\n\nI remain, Yours Truly,\n\nMary F. Bernette Gallant.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Gallant:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant, in which you intimate that you would not be prepared to accept the position of Indian day school teacher at the Golden Lake Indian Reserve, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\nI may state that immediately following our conversation of a week or so ago I communicated with Mr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont., in respect to the two vacancies in his Agency. I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Down, dated September 15, 1942, in which he states that prior to the receipt of my communication he had succeeded in securing two local teachers for his schools. In this connection, however, Mr. Down states:\n\n\"The possibilities of a male clerk for this Agency seem very remote and any man with the required qualifications would not have to come to Muncey and, if he did, he would not stay. For this reason, and providing she has the background, I am suggesting that you offer the position of clerk to the young lady you have in mind.\"\n\nThe position referred to by Mr. Down is a temporary Grade 3 position in his office. Should you accept the position you would be the only clerk in the Agency. In this case you would also have to secure board and lodgings, probably outside the reserve. If you are interested, however, I should be glad to pass on your application to the official in charge of personnel. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Mary B. Gallant,\n362 Rideau Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n1-114 Chapeau, Que.,\nSept. 22, 1942.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am a school teacher and would appreciate knowing if there is a vacancy in the Indian schools at St. Regis or any other Reservation and to whom I could apply.\n\nI possess an English, Bible, Superior Diploma and have eight years teaching experience.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAnn Poirier\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Poirier:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you submit a formal application for a position as teacher at an Indian day school.\n\nI regret to state that there are no vacancies at this date at the St. Regis Reserve. We have, however, two vacancies in the Nipissing Indian Agency, Ont. The Indian Agent is Mr. J.A. Marleau, Sturgeon Falls, Ont. These schools are the Dokis and the Whitefish Lake Indian Day Schools. The salary paid at each of these schools is $200.00 per month, plus cost-of-living bonus which amounts, at this date, to approximately 17%. There is no teachersage available at either of the schools but board and lodgings can easily be secured in the vicinity. We are anxious that these schools should open on October 1 and not later than October 5, if at all possible. If you are interested, you might communicate with me at once and, if possible, send forward any recommendations you may have from your Inspectors in respect to teaching ability, etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Ann Poirier,\nChapeau, Que.\n362 Rideau St.,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nSept. 25, 1942.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter dated the 22nd of Sept. 1942, in which you state that subsequent to our conversation you communicated with Mr. G. W. Down who wishes to engage a temporary Grade 2 Clerk in this Agency.\n\nI have thoroughly considered this and have come to the conclusion that if Mr. Down is willing to wait until Nov. 1st, I will be prepared to take over the position. I haven't had any holidays for two years, except one week in July 1941. I feel that if I went home now for approximately three weeks, I would be well rested and better prepared to tackle whatever may be in store for me. By the way, I haven't been home to Prince Edward Island for over three years.\n\nI would feel more confident if Mr. Down would state more emphatically just what qualifications he deems necessary. Nevertheless, with my ten years of teaching and office experience combined, I feel justified in accepting.\n\nIt was most considerate of you to inform me of this position and I am indeed interested. I should be very happy if you would inform the official Agent in charge, of my sincere desire to accept. If Mr. Down would prefer\ncommencing these duties sooner, I could, perhaps, arrange to have my holidays cancelled until Christmas, but frankly speaking, I do need them now.\n\nI shall be looking forward to the official's reply and awaiting further instructions. Thanking you in anticipation for your kind consideration on my behalf.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Bernetta Gallant\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 6, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Gallant:\n\nYour letter of September 25, 1942, addressed to Mr. R. A. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, has been referred to me for attention.\n\nWith respect to your application for employment in the office of the Indian Agent for the Caradoc Agency, Munsey, Ontario, I have to say that the position of Clerk, Grade 2, for this Agency, has recently been advertised by the Civil Service Commission. A copy of the poster is enclosed, from which you will see that the closing date for receipt of applications is October 8, 1942.\n\nPending the outcome of this competition, we are employing there as Clerk, Grade 2, a young lady who previously was the Teacher of an Indian school in the Caradoc Agency and who will resume her teaching duties when the position is filled as the result of the competition.\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, an application form which you may complete and forward to the Civil Service Commission if you wish to do so. I cannot say, however, that you will be considered for assignment to the Caradoc Agency. Preference in this competition will, of course, be given to male candidates who have had overseas active service, and to residents of the locality.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMiss Mary B. Gallant,\n325 Rideau Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n1-1-17\n\nShenbora Hubbs\nJan. 21, 1943.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nOn account of a recent illness I have been discharged from my job and forbidden by the doctor to work in doing any more. And I have been told to try and see if I can get a school for September of 1943.\n\nI have no diploma, but I have an Elementary certificate and have also completed my second year in High School.\n\nIf you can take me please answer at once.\n\nHoping you will extend your help in my favour,\n\nM. Douglas Morris\nShenbora\nN.C.\nOttawa, January 27, 1943.\n\nMr. Douglas Morris, Sheenboro, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I regret that there is no vacancy in any Indian school to which you could be appointed.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Miss,\n\nI have heard that you are very anxious to teach during the time of war and I was wondering if under this condition I might be accepted. I will faithfully do my utmost to teach them.\n\nI took a mathematical course in high school until some commercial and main. This year I am taking a special Child Study Course provided by the Evangelical Church Training Association. In it we learn much on how to teach and train children.\n\nI will be free on the first of April and I trust that I may be considered.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa,\nFebruary 19, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have just received the enclosed letter from Mrs. Squire of Indian Head, Sask., applying for appointment as teacher in an Indian school. I am not acquainted with this lady but, in view of her statement that she has taught approximately five years in both Indian and white schools and the further fact that she mentions two of your Principals, I thought that you might be interested in communicating with her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 19, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, applying for appointment as teacher of an Indian day school in British Columbia. I understand from your letter that you do not possess any professional teacher's certificate and under these circumstances I regret that we cannot give favourable consideration to considering you for appointment as teacher of an Indian school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Are there any vacancies for the September term and where should I send my application?\n\nThank you for any information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIrene Ethel La Beach,\nTeacher - Red Willow School.\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department is not aware of any Indian day school conducted under Catholic auspices in the Prairie Provinces to which you could be appointed. However, there might be vacancies in some of the Catholic Indian residential schools. I suggest that you communicate with Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., Ottawa University, Ottawa, giving him your qualifications. He represents the Oblate Order in Indian work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Irene E. Labrash,\nTeacher,\nRed Willow School,\nPeterson, Sask.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nFederal House,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to make inquiry as to whom I must apply to receive information about being placed as teacher in Indian Schools in Ontario. I hold an Ontario Second Class Certificate with Special Certificate in Elementary Agriculture from Guelph O.A.C. Is there a possibility that I might receive an appointment for fall term? I have not taught in Ontario since 1927. Have been teaching here in Saskatchewan for last 6 years. I am very truly,\n\nMrs A W McKenzie\nHanley\nSask.\n\nApril 30th 1943.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, please let me know your age and religion. My reason for asking the latter is that where the Indians are adherents of the Catholic Church we only employ Catholic teachers and where the Indians are Protestants we only employ Protestant teachers.\n\nYou should also state if you are a widow or if your husband is living. If the latter, would he go to the reserve with you in the event of our appointing you as teacher at a school?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. A.W. McKenzie,\nHanley, Sask.\nWhite Rock, B.C.\nJuly 14th\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been a Day School teacher on the James Smith Reserve and Onion Lake in Sask.\n\nBoth in the white and Indian Schools my work has been most satisfactory. I am over age but in good health and just as able and capable to do the same good work. I have been told that there is a shortage of teachers for work in the Day Schools. I would again like to take up the work and in this way would be doing my bit to aid in the war work.\n\nIf you have need of my services you could refer to Archdeacon Paul, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs) Amy M. McFarlane\nMrs. A. McFarlane Born 28 May, 1879\n\nJas Smith - Sept 1/32, June 80/37\nOttawa, July 13, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, applying for appointment as teacher at an Indian day school, I suggest that you communicate with\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Amy M. McFarlane,\nWhite Rock, B. C.\nOttawa, July 13, 1943.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Amy M. McFarlane, White Rock, B.C., applying for appointment as teacher of an Indian day school. Mrs. McFarlane taught successfully for us at the James Smith Indian Day School, Dusk Lake Agency, from September 1, 1932, to June 30, 1937. The only drawback that I see regarding her is the fact that she is now approximately 65 years of age. However, teachers are hard to secure and if her health is good it is possible that she could handle a school for another year or so. I am therefore writing to her today, suggesting that she get in touch with you. I understand that Mrs. McFarlane is an Anglican.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nWorkers Wanted For Indian Schools\n\nThe urgent needs of the war service have depleted the staffs of the fourteen Indian schools functioning in northern Ontario and the western provinces under the Indian Residential School commission of the American church, and it is appealed for help as farm instructors, engineers or assistants, and women as teachers, supervisors, and assistants in kitchen, dairy, carpentry, and sewing room. Those of earnest Christian character, resourcefulness and varied abilities who desire any of the positions could be filled acceptably by those experienced in the various tasks of ordinary family life.\n\nThe Dominion government has built these schools and has accepted wardship of its Indian citizens, and workers here are performing work of national importance. A moderate salary is paid workers, and much of this can be saved, as everything needed at the Bible House, Winnipeg, will answer enquiries.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour file 1-1-1 X\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th ultimo advising that Mrs. Amy M. McFarlane of White Rock, B.C., has applied for a position as teacher of an Indian Day School, I would advise that I communicated with her and she informs me that she is 69 years of age. I am also informed by Mr. Indian Agent Simpson at Duck Lake, Sask., that she was retired as teacher of the Fort a la Corne Indian Day School in June 1937 as the work was more than she could properly handle due to her age.\n\nIt would appear to me that it is unlikely that any of the Catholic Indian Day Schools available would be suitable for a woman of her age as they are somewhat isolated. However, I expect a call from her some time during the present month.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOct. 6, 1943.\n\nMr. J.

I am married and have three children; a boy aged ten yrs., two girls, one aged five, and the other three years old.\n\nI have nine years' experience in teaching, two of which were in a bilingual school in Quebec where I received my Teacher's Certificate; the other seven in Indian Schools and can furnish excellent recommendations if necessary.\n\nWere I given my choice, I should choose Big Lake, but, if you are interested in my application, and are still in need of a teacher, would you please send me the necessary\ninformation concerning them each of the schools.\n\nAre school and residence, the one building? distance from nearest railroad station and means of transportation to and from the schools, in summer and winter.\n\nAnticipating an early reply, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. Lawrence Butler,\nManitowaning.\n\nOct. 7th.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing an application for the position of school teacher received from Mrs. Lawrence Peltier of Manitowaning.

I have a First Class Teacher's License from the New Brunswick Normal School.\n\nI would appreciate any information or advice you might offer in helping me to secure a post.\n\nAlso- Would you have any idea as to where I could make application for a post in teaching in the Eskimo Schools of North West Territories or Yukon?\n\nIn the event of my not being fortunate enough to obtain a post in teaching in an Indian School, I would be interested in the Eskimo Schools of Northern Canada.\n\nThanking you\n\nSincerely\n\n(Miss) Catherine Rideout\nMuncey, Ontario,\nMarch 4th, 1944.\n\nDear Miss Rideout,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your undated letter, and note with interest that you wish to return to Canada and take up teaching in one of our many Indian Schools. In this connection I have to advise that it is more than likely that we can successfully use your services.\n\nIt is also noted that your present contract expires in June. That fits in very well with our requirements as the summer term in the province of Ontario, for all Public Schools, ends in June. We have one vacancy at the moment but, of course, you are not yet free to interest yourself.\n\nI am particularly interested in your application and feel sure that we can place you. Please write again and I will furnish information as to salary, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nMiss C. Rideout,\nSt. Georges,\nBermuda.\n\nGWD/3C\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1944.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing copies of correspondence between your office and Miss Catherine Rideout.\n\nFrom the information that she gives regarding her teaching experience, it would appear that she would be eligible for appointment at one of our schools and, unless there is a decided improvement in the teacher situation within the next few months, there is no doubt that we can find employment for her for the academic year 1944-45. Under these circumstances I suggest that you write and advise her the approximate salary and deductions that are made. Before engaging her definitely we would like to know her age and religion.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nInverglen, Sask.\nMarch 23, 1944\n\nMr. M.

In the event of your desiring to make an application for appointment as teacher, you should forward to this office full particulars regarding your age, religion, qualifications and experience. The reason we mention that you should state your religion is due to the fact that some of our schools are operated under Catholic auspices and others under Protestant auspices.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nWithin the last few months we have received several letters from Mrs. Isabelle Gingras, Box 16, Manitowaning, for appointment as teacher of an Indian day school. Mrs. Gingras's maiden name was Isabelle Pettier and several years ago she taught for us at Wikwemikong, Batchawana Bay, Goulais Bay and Moose Deer Point.\n\nOur information is that she is now 58 years of age.\n\nTeachers are hard to obtain and it is possible that she might be suitable for some one of our schools, but before offering her any appointment I should appreciate having your advice in the matter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nJune 2, 1944.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated May 29, 1944, relative to the advisability of the appointment of Mrs Isabelle Gingras as teacher in one of the Indian schools.\n\nAs you possibly are aware, Mrs Gingras's husband was a white man and has either deserted her or is dead; I understand she commuted her interest in the Manitoulin Island Unceded Land several years ago and is having a rather difficult time to make her living. She has been making her home with her parents on the reserve ever since I have been Agent here, and they actually need her as they are both over eighty years of age and the mother is quite an invalid now.\n\nI am unable however, to give any information as regards her qualifications, or ability as a teacher, but from my own observations I would judge she would not get along well with the people in her own Reserve; I have really had very little opportunity of forming an opinion, as she never comes in this office to discuss any matters, but prefers to correspond direct with the Department.\n\n(Trudeau) I might inform you that Mrs Adam Corbiere, formerly Rita Sambinna, a first class teacher is back on this reserve and would take a school next term, and I understand Mrs Agnes Wakegijig who is now at Garden River would prefer to take a school on this reserve.\n\nC.

I would like to get an idea of the qualifications required and special certificates. If you have not a complete list would it be possible to secure a list for the Parry Sound District.\n\nThere is a school fifteen miles away at Baying Inlet will be vacant in June and I thought of applying for it. I would like to know the qualifications of the present teacher in order to compare for salary basis.\n\nAre the schools inspected by the inspectors for the district. If so who would...\nInspector for the Barry Sound District School? Are they all separate schools?\n\nI have a first class certificate, auxiliary (last) musical ability, manual training but not a certificate. I also have a Business Course, two year course General Accounting, Radio Course given by government. I would not look for less than $1500 with teacherage furnished.\n\nAt present I am teaching in a French-Italian settlement and the grade work is very heavy. I have three grades and one half the pupils are auxiliary pupils. I would rather take a small school where I would be able to do my own cooking.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) Elba Lynch\n\nBrett, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 8, 1945.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, the Magnetawan Indian Day School at Byng Inlet is inspected by Dr. J.M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector. For Indian schools we endeavour to obtain teachers with the same qualifications as are required in the provincial schools. I note that you would require a salary of at least $1,500.00 a year, plus living quarters. We are not allowing so much salary at Magnetawan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. Celia Lynch,\nBritt, Ont.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMr. Bennett informed me as to the chance of getting a position at the Shawanaga Day School. I wish to thank you for considering the request.\n\nOnce more, I make a request. Probably my explanation will not be quite clear but I will make it as comprehensible as possible.\n\nIs there any kind of work that the Department will grant in the way of visiting the Indian Missions, in the home, school etc.? I am quite certain from what I know of these Indians (Chief Pauing, Sand, Agnes) and from what I have seen of the soil, here, Shawanaga, what I have heard of Parry Island and other Rivers, that I could get them interested in gardening.\n\nHave heard this was attempted before but proved unsuccessful. Was anyone appointed to see to the supervision of the soil, the planting of the seed, the care during the growing season, the harvesting? Mrs. Smyth is wrong in her statement.\n\nIf such work could be given to me, I could still go to a missionary charge, and,\nI will, with all my ability, possible, to make my undertaking a success.\n\nI will be in Ottawa, the latter part of the first week in July and I hope to be able to see you.\n\nTrusting you will consider my request with other members of the Department and let me know as to their decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Morris.\nOttawa, June 8, 1945.\n\nDear Miss Morris:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant and note that you hope to visit Ottawa early in July, at which time we can discuss the matter further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Mary Morris,\nByng Inlet, Ont.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1945.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Acting Indian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ontario.\n\nI enclose a letter which has just been received from Miss Marion Grace Kent applying for an appointment as teacher of one of our Indian schools.\n\nI am not particularly impressed with her application. It is possible that she might be satisfactory in one of our Indian schools and I thought that if she lives in your vicinity you might make inquiries and let me have any information you can obtain about her ability as a teacher. You will note that she has been teaching at Sniderville, U.S.S. #7, Nama and Dalton. When replying you should return the attached letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 25, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to an application you have received from a young lady who lives at Longford Mills.\n\nPossibly you refer to Miss Marion Grace Kent, who sent an application to this office last week. While she has qualifications, her application did not impress me very strongly. However, I sent the letter to our Indian Agent, Mr. H.J. Featherston, Longford Mills, Ont., and requested him to make enquiries and report. I have not yet received his reply, but, as soon as it arrives, I will communicate with you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nBox 24, Longford Mills, Ont.,\nJune 16, 1945.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI would wish to offer myself to you to be a teacher on any of the Indian Reserves where one is needed.\n\nThis year has been my second year as a humble beginner in the profession. The qualifications are few, however, save that for one year I worked as a Junior (Poveshell Clerk) at E. Long Ltd., Engineering Works, Orillia, Ont., under employer H. B. Lovell.\n\nLast year in the teaching emergency with only my Jr. Matriculation and seven (7) subjects in Sr. Matric plus the two programmes of study and my normal I worked at a new spot called Liederville, U.S. #3, Kama & Dalton. Last summer I attended\nthe Summer Normal Course in Toronto. Consequently my teaching certificate is a Deferred Interim Second Class.\n\nFor this past year we have struggled along in U.S.H.G. Hanna, Longford Mills Public School. It is here, on the fringe of Hanna Indian Reserve, that first we met the Indian children, of which almost half our school is comprised. They are very clever. I like them. But I would prefer to be on an all-Indian station.\n\nThis morning the urge came to me. Hence I felt I must direct myself to you. If you need me, I'll do my best, wherever I am. Let be the North (I hope it is) even if it might be lonely, it's majestic, grand.\n\nIf it were even out west or anywhere, that still would be just right.\n\nI have my St. John's Ambulance First Aid Certificate, and one in Home Nursing. I can cook well enough.\nto get, tame, myself altogether.\n\nWork half hours.\n\nSoon school will be over.\n\nIt is not definite yet whether this person will be accepted for Summer Normal Session or not. Our Inspector, J. H. Pickering, (Box 39, Uxbridge, Ont.) assured me though, that if not he would willingly allow me a Teacher's Permit.\n\nMy home address after June 21, is R.R. # 3, Coldwater, Ont. As to other information, I am a girl, aged twenty-one, born August 13, 1873, of United Church membership.\n\nI offer my services. Do with them and me as you see fit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMiss Marion Graeber.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 19th with which was enclosed a letter from Miss Marion Grace Kent, I would advise that Miss Kent is teaching in the Rama Township school at Longford Mills and so I am fairly familiar with her work. As you may have gathered from her letter, she is a visionary individual. She has not been successful in her present position and is not being retained. The school was in splendid condition when she started a year ago and if she can not succeed under those circumstances, she is not likely to handle an Indian school.\n\nFor your information in the matter of salaries, I may state that Miss Kent is getting $1200.00 per year. She only has about eighteen children.\n\nI am returning Miss Kent's letter herewith.\n\nH.J. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nOttawa, June 27, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI wrote you recently with reference to an application which you stated you had received from some person at Longford Mills. As I stated in my letter, I presumed this was a lady named Miss Kent. I have just received the following report from our Indian Agent, Mr. H.J. Featherston:\n\n\"Miss Kent is teaching in the Rama Township School at Longford Mills, and so I am fairly familiar with her work.

During the school year\nending in June, nineteen forty-five I\ntaught in Peldi Gau, Ontario. While there,\nI became very much interested in the\nIndians. I would like very much to\nteach in an Indian school. The Indian\noffice at Sioux Lookout advised me to\nwrite to you.\n\nI am twenty-three years of age and\nan honour graduate of Toronto Abbey, Toronto\nHighlands, Toronto. I have had four years'\nSuccessful teaching experience and I would be willing to go anywhere in the Dominion to teach.\n\nIf my services can be of use, I shall be grateful if you will let me know as quickly as possible how I can serve.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMiss Patricia M.

If there are any open positions, I would be grateful if you could inform me.\n\nI am presently teaching Class 6 at the school. I have been certified for that position. I also have experience in Mathematics and some other subjects.\n\nI have taught school since the age of fourteen, which was nine years ago. I am a married man with a family and am residing in a Roman Catholic town.\n\nMy qualifications are as follows:\n\nPlease reply by return mail, as I am anxious to hear from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Leeder:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, applying for appointment as teacher of an Indian Day School in Saskatchewan. We have no vacancies at Indian Day Schools in the Province in which you would be eligible.\n\nWe have need of Catholic teachers in some Indian Day Schools in Northern Ontario. If you care to pay a visit to this Department we could discuss the vacancies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. John Z.

I have already accepted a non-\nremunerative position in Northern Ontario. I had hoped to be posted somewhere in the North-West Territories. If such an opening should come for next year I shall appreciate it if you will consider me for the position.\n\nSincerely yours,\nPatricia H. Nadoru.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the fact that the minimum teacher's salary in this province is now $1200.00 per annum. This has resulted in the Churches which have the nomination of teachers having great difficulty in finding any at the salaries which are being paid at the present time. It has also resulted in dissatisfaction amongst the teachers already employed.\n\nI beg to enquire whether anything can be done about this.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 7th September, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Agencies,\n414 Federal Bldg., Regina, Sask.\n\nThe contents of your letter of the 29th ultimo were discussed with the Director yesterday afternoon. As far as we are aware there is only one school vacant in Saskatchewan at the present time namely the Day Star School in the Touchwood Agency.\n\nActually the lowest salary we are paying in Saskatchewan at the moment is $90.00 a month plus a bonus of 17% which brings the salary to $1,053.00 a year. This rate has been in effect for two or three years and teachers who have been in our employ during that time have benefited by it. Teachers whose salary is $95.00 or $100.00 are drawing more.\n\nIn addition, it should be kept in mind that we supply residences at most of our schools and generally speaking a teacher is under less expense than when teaching at a white school and having to pay for room and board.\n\nAre there any specific cases where you consider an increase in salary should be allowed? At the present time it is not our intention to make a general increase to all teachers of Indian Day Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. Laurent, Grandin, Sask.\nNov. 24, 1945\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nSince my acquaintance with Rev. Father Latour, Principal of the Duck Lake Industrial School, I became very interested in the Education of Indian Children.\n\nI would be very glad to become teacher in an Indian School and work to the utmost of my ability to raise their standard. I have twenty-five years of teaching experience and I believe that the different methods I have acquired during these years of service would help me very much.\n\nI have a First Class Permanent certificate in Saskatchewan.\n\nI also hold the three diplomas from Quebec Laval Normal School.\n\nI can speak both languages English and French.\n\nI am a Roman Catholic.\n\nI feel confident that with your help, my request will be granted, and very soon I will receive a favorable answer.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. Lucien Demers\n\nP.S. Will it be possible to transfer my superannuation fund and years of service from Regina to Ottawa and so keep intact the protection I have now in the Province.\n\nL.D.\nOttawa, 4th December, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, the Department does not appoint teachers at Indian Residential Schools. The Church concerned engages all members of the staff.\n\nAt the present time we have no system of superannuation for teachers in Indian Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. Lucien Demers,\nSt. Laurent Grandin, Sask.\nDecember Eleventh, 1945.\n\nW. S. Arnell Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Arnell:\n\nOn October 11th at our Teachers' Convention in Paisley the following resolution was presented by a teacher from one of the Indian schools:\n\n\"As a teacher of Indian schools for the past few years, I feel that changes in the curriculum in History and Science would greatly benefit the Indian child. That, unless the pupil is definitely going on to High School, these subjects should be touched but lightly and Physical Education and Personal Hygiene emphasized instead. Resolved that this matter be considered by teachers of Indian Schools and Inspectors.\"\n\nSince then I have four other Indian teachers comment on the resolution. Their comments and suggestions are given on attached sheets. The names of the teachers have been omitted.\n\nI might say that my opinion coincides very closely with that expressed by teachers No. land 2.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. Game\n\nJ. M. Game\n\nJM/W Incl.\n\"COMMENTS BY TEACHER #1\n\nRegarding changes in the curriculum in history and science:\n\nWhile I think that physical education (within specified limits) and personal hygiene should be given great attention, I do not think that history and science should be touched on but lightly. I think that these subjects should be given their proper place on the Programme irrespective as to whether the pupils are going on to high school or not.\n\nMy experience in teaching those subjects has proved to me that Indian children (as well as others) show keen interest in them and I think them most useful to any child.\n\nIt seems to me that without at least a fair knowledge of history one has but a meagre idea of the political and social life of the world and its people. This I believe every child should have.\n\nThe course in science as outlined in the curriculum is, I think, not only necessary for those going on to high school since it takes in the all important and everyday knowledge which any child should have.\"\n\"I shall endeavour to make a few comments on Resolution IV.\n\nWhat our children need is more and better teaching in every subject on the curriculum and there is a danger here in lowering our standards instead of raising them.\n\nI believe the Indian children need the same things taught to them as other children in our land. We believe we have an interesting course of study in Social Studies and I have found the children enjoyed it, so why should an Indian child be deprived of going to Africa with David Livingstone; or to Mexico with Cortez; to Peru with Pizarro or down the rivers and across the mountains of Canada with the explorers? Why should they not know the facts concerning the history of their own land?\n\nLast year I followed the course in Science outlined by you and always had their keenest attention. It was no trouble for them to learn about the planets, the sun, the moon, the cause of the seasons, how coal is formed, etc., etc. I can't see why they shouldn't learn this.\n\nNow regarding personal hygiene and physical training, I found I could only go a certain distance in teaching personal hygiene and then they resent it. I tried to teach those topics on the health course such as foods, clothing, bacteria, means of controlling communicable disease, cleanliness, etc. The result should be the same as with white people\u2014it should affect the way they live.\n\nI can go to the end of my rope in teaching Personal Hygiene and Physical Training along with following the course in Social Studies and Science.\n\nWe should consider also the location. What I am saying is meant for this Reserve not one in some remote part of the north. There is a real need here for progress in education and I think the teachers should be made to feel this and try as much as possible to reach the required standards of the Department of Education of Ontario.\"\n\"I was very much interested in the resolution submitted to our recent convention by a teacher from an Indian school. After a period of eleven and one-half months in an Indian School and somewhat longer in various 'white' schools, I should like to submit the following comments:\n\n(1) I believe we are not justified in (mentally or otherwise) segregating the Indian children or in comparing them adversely with (so-called) 'white' children. I believe their situation parallels that of most under-privileged 'whites.' It is true that social workers often find training in 'personal hygiene' advisable and necessary for under-privileged groups, but they have also found that with improved self-respect and a higher standard of living habits of personal cleanliness and physical well-being have usually improved proportionately. As some wit has tersely warned us, we should be careful not to 'put the cart before the horse.'\n\nThe English difficulty, common to all non-Anglo-Saxon children in Canada, requires that English practice be given a proportionably large place on the time-table, but much of this can also be learned incidentally through suitably chosen games and more careful supervision and help in oral and written work in the other academic subjects. With these two exceptions, I believe no distinction should be made between 'Indian' and 'white' schools as such.\n\n(2) If any change in curriculum is advisable for Indian children who are not expected to continue their education after Grade VIII, the same should also apply to 'white' children in this category both in rural and in urban schools.\n\nA more 'utilitarian' course, including a larger proportion of less-academic subjects such as Household Training and Manual Training certainly has proved a boon, I believe to such students who have had the opportunity for this type of training. In this way they have been able to 'make good' and in some line in which they have ability. Such results are noticeable in special schools, such as Bolton Avenue School for Girls and Edith L. Groves School (and the corresponding Boys' School) in Toronto, and should also be seen in the Indian residential schools if they were open to all who wished or needed this type of training, and not just a home. I believe the resolution might well encourage more schools of this type (for both Indian and 'white' indiscriminately) with the removal of the 'low mentality' and 'broken home' stigmas respectively.\n\n(3) Many Indian and other rural (and urban) children who at present cannot attend High School are prevented not so much by lack of academic ability or interest as by lack of financial means to pay for board and/or transportation.\n\n(a) The formation of High School districts should solve their transportation problems.\n\n(b) The provision of may more adequate scholarships and grants, and also library and other bursaries, should be encouraged to aid those who require financial assistance. (From my personal observation of the operation of scholarship and bursary systems at the University of Toronto, I am convinced that the same principles could profitably and should be extended to the Secondary schools.)\n\nWith such improvements within sight, and the promised renewal of grants to Indian children continuing to High School, Indian teachers should encourage more of their children to continue their education, and therefore will need to intensify rather than minimize their teaching of some academic subjects (particularly those that present language difficulties), so that those who graduate to High School will be academically prepared to progress normally in the higher grades.\n\nIt may be that we as Public School teachers in this 'era of expansion' will need to be better informed about the present trends in Secondary School Education, including the types of courses open to students, and the background of knowledge necessary for each.\n\nIn conclusion, I should like to repeat that I heartily agree that any course of study (in elementary school especially) should admit of some adjustment (as our Ontario Programme does) to the needs of the individual pupil; but I also believe that with increased transportation facilities and financial assistance more of our pupils will be encouraged to continue their education after Grade VIII, in some line in which they are interested. Also I should like to emphasize my conviction that the same principles should apply to 'Indian' schools and 'white' schools indiscriminately.\"\nWith respect to your letter re resolution:\n\nI have checked the course of study in Natural Science and I find that at different times I have used about 75% of the topics listed. Grades 1-2-3 get very little outside of family objects and tracing and colouring drawings of nature. Grades 4-5-6 seem to absorb about 50% of these lessons, possibly most of the work for Grades 1-2-3 responses are very poor.\n\nI have taken lessons using magnets, bells, coffee perk--anything to arouse interest. They liked these mechanical lessons fine. They know what most tools are for and how to use them. One lad took his bicycle apart and everyone helped, this was enjoyed by all. Many parts of this course must be omitted but I think my children like and enjoy most of these lessons.\n\nAs for Social Studies, Grades 1-2-3. It is impossible and useless in my school to lessons on this subject as the children cannot understand. I use pictures of peoples of other lands. If they get anything from it, they only know. (The Indian people in my section don't bother to talk to their children about school or anything else.)\n\nGrades 4-5-6 taken mostly together do not take to history stories and I have had no luck in teaching them. It's like pulling teeth to get answers.\n\nThe greatest drawback is the fact that the parents won't put themselves out to talk in English. There is no discussion of school work at home with the parents.\n\nThe children do not get away from home often enough to get an interest in outside affairs. One family speaks English at home and are about 75% brighter than the others but go past their simple understanding and the Indian nature shows up--result no answers.\n\nI think that unless the Indian child comes from a home where English is spoken and they wish to continue school, this part of Social Studies should be removed.\n\nWe all take a certain amount of physical drill or games. The children would rather do this than think or write.\n\nI think we can do much to aid in personal hygiene but the fundamentals must be taught by the parents at home. If this is not done, what chance have we?\n\nYou can see that there is no privacy or moral uplift in a one or two-roomed house where animal instincts take their course. Marriage laws do not hold out here and the Indians trade unions or just go and live with someone else.\n\nThe only remedy for Indian children of this reserve to get an education and amount to something would be to adopt them into a home at about 6 months old so that they would have no contact with home until their education was complete.\"\nDear Mr. Phillips,\n\nI don't suppose you remember me. I was there several years ago when Mr. Bill was at Keith's Point.\n\nYou must take a badly and must take a\nfor some time but in the meantime I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nRespectfully and sincerely,\n\nAngela Haunau\n\nI prolonged a much needed rest. I left Forest 1944 and returned to Toronto to get my Ph.D. I had hoped to get into something somewhat less strenuous. I rounded myself up the present result.\n\nDo you think I could get a school in your department next year, if you have ready teachers? I would prefer in Manitoba Island\u2014Possibly you could find a place for me in the department at Ottawa.\n\nI won't be ready to work\nOttawa, January 10, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Hannan:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to securing an appointment at an Indian day school.\n\nWe will likely have vacancies for the academic year 1946-47, and I suggest that you write to me again early in June, stating your qualifications, experience and religion. The latter information is needed, as the Indian Act requires that Catholic teachers be appointed where the Indians are Catholic and Protestant teachers where the Indians are members of any of the Protestant denominations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Angela Hannan,\n255 Willow Ave.,\nToronto 8, Ont.\nBeaver Crossing Alta\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa Canada\n\nJan. 12, 1946\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you in regard to following.

Would you mind giving me the information regarding these schools.\n\nI taught school for several years in the Public and Separate schools of Ontario, and am taking a few months off now. I would like to be where there is good accommodation, and living conditions. I have experienced many poor boarding houses, and thought I would like to board myself.\n\nI have a Second Class Permanent certificate, also Agriculture and Kindergarten-Primary. I am 45 years of age.\n\nKindly give the names of the Inspectors of these schools too. I prefer the Ottawa Valley, if there are schools there.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAgnes B. Carey\nOtta wa, January 25, 1946.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I am not in a position to state how many vacancies we will have in Indian Schools for the academic year 1946-47. You should again apply early in May stating your age, religion and professional qualifications. You should also give the number of years experience you have had in white schools and also the number in Indian schools. We would also like to know the names of the Indian schools in which you have taught.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. A.C. Buddrus,\nBeaver Crossing, Alberta.\nOttawa, January 25, 1946.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in which you make application for appointment as teacher of an Indian Day School.\n\nWe will probably have vacancies for the academic year 1946-47 and you should write to me during the latter part of May. When writing you should state the number of years experience you have and also your religion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Agnes B. Carey,\n610 Longueuil Street W.,\nMontreal, Quebec.\n\n---\n\nOttawa, January 31, 1946.\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith report forms indicating the number of teachers employed at Indian day schools, their age, academic and professional qualifications, etc.\n\nI am sending forward also Education Bulletin No. 1, 1946, secured by me from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.\n\nI regret that the time at my disposal has not enabled me to undertake a study of this information, which has been prepared by the Chief of the Training Division. It has occurred to me, however, that in view of the shortage of teachers at present employed, lacking professional standing, plus the many who have reached an age ordinarily looked upon as too old for employment, it would be exceedingly difficult to recognize the claims of the members of either of these groups for permanent appointment in the civil service or for superannuation purposes. In addition to this, it would be exceedingly difficult in view of the present shortage of teachers prevailing throughout the country to secure teachers at this time to take their places; should these teachers be discharged from their present positions, there would be much work to be done and the prevailing shortage of teachers insure that the full shortage is likely to remain for a period of at least ten years.\n\nI am submitting this information for study and review. In so doing, I find it exceedingly difficult to see how the adjustments we have in mind can be made in time for the opening of the regular academic year of September 1st. However, it is to me a source of great personal gratification...\nto note that the matter is now receiving careful study and that certain adjustments seem satisfactory to the Government and to the teachers will be worked out in due course.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby wish to make application for school in Indian Reserve (preferably on Reserve South of Wainwright) for term 1946-47.\nI have several years experience in teaching.

Mr. David Nannawin is now in attendance at the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, taking training. He is a returned soldier who lost his eyesight in the war. He is an Indian and a member, I think, of the Norway House Agency. The question has been asked whether, if he were to take training as a teacher, the Department would consider his appointment to an Indian day school, preferably in the Norway House Agency. We should, I think, be prepared to nominate him, if he had sufficient training, even though he did not have standing as a teacher. He is very anxious to serve his people, and he has done, I think, a little work around the Norway House School, but about this I shall make further enquiry. I promised Miss Wilson of the C.N.I.B. and Mr. Nannawin that I would write you about this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 15, 1946\n\nREGISTERED\nChippewa Hill, Ont., March 26, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to Department letter dated February 28th, regarding a letter received from Miss Jessie German for appointment as teacher at the French Bay School.\n\nThis applicant is Mrs. Jessie German; she is married and has a daughter about nineteen years of age. She, her husband and daughter reside in Southampton during the winter months and at the Double Beach during the summer, where they own a number of cottages.\n\nMrs. German has a third class certificate and had five years' experience under Mr. Inspector McColl.

Earlier in the week we had a letter from the Principal of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, requesting that we provide educational facilities for this man's two children.\n\nOn making enquiries in this office, I found that in view of an application made by Nannawin last year, he was enfranchised by Order-in-Council P.C.

I had no idea of suggesting that the Department should help this man get further education. My question was directed at discovering whether the Department would appoint him as a teacher with or without our nomination. That would be on the basis that, though he might not be technically qualified, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind would vouch for his ability to do the work of a teacher.\n\nPerhaps you would not want to commit yourself or the Department. In that case, I should like to have an idea of what might happen if we did nominate Mr. Namawin, quite off the record and without prejudice, as the lawyers say.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.D.

I am interested, very enthusiastically, and, this is why therefore, this letter, and here I am.\n\nWhat's in view for a female, single, free, white and twenty-two? The reason I offer my services at all, is because I have ideas on education which I should like to practice, without any ifs, ands, or questions. The Indians, points, for the most part, aren't interested enough to think too rapidly, let alone question.\nPerhaps that sounds as if I wanted to do something bizarre. I don't really, but what I want to honestly try to perform an experiment of my own strictly in the books and in the grove and prove to me that I can and that it's truly worthwhile. My certificate in August will be fifteen, with two subjects on my permanent. I don't care where I am sent, preferably first. If I were working in conjunction with a mission could it be preferably United Church? For my salary is concerned, I would like to go to University and need to save money. With board and travelling expenses paid by you, for a period of two years, with salary not more than $6 per month, I could save lots. I like travelling and meeting new people, don't grow tired of my own company, prefer a teaching where I can cook my very own meals, and don't care two hoots who\nin Canada, you send me East,\nNorth, South, West.

The present set up may be likened to \"In Again, out again, on again, Flanagan.\" With infrequent mail service, monthly reports do not reach the agents sometimes for three weeks after the close of a month; and by the time a cut-off reaches the Family Allowance Branch another two or three weeks may have elapsed, by which time the child has returned to school and its attendance has improved to the point where the account is put back into pay and so the merry-go-round goes on. We have children who have been cut off and put back as many as five or six times in a school year. At Bella Coola a card index system has been installed and this will be put in at Prince Rupert this fall. I believe that a form should be devised similar in size to the M.S.S. Form 180, with carbon inserted. These could be filled out by the teachers for accounts to be put in or not put in pay. The original to be mailed in direct to the Family Allowance Regional Director, two copies to Agency and one for parents. They could be worded so that the average teacher could handle them with ease. They would do away with the monthly reports of attendance (which can be checked in registers by Agent's on patrol) and the teacher would have to deal only with cases of actual truancy of children from school who are resident in the village during the month in question. It is my opinion that if children accompany their parents to canneries or traplines where there are no school facilities, they should not be penalized for Family Allowance. It is ridiculous to expect parents to live in an Indian village without work merely to have their children attend school and to obtain Family allowance payments. The schools will have to be extended on a seasonal basis in more canneries, similar to the set-up at Port Edwards and Sunnyside canneries at Skeena Agency.\n\nLiving costs today are such that an Indian cannot afford to spend the winter in his home village unless he has access to employment at the same time.\n\nThe situation with regard to teachers in the Indian schools is still unsatisfactory. In the two Agencies administered by the writer, twenty-seven classrooms should open in September and for them fourteen teachers are now appointed.\n\nY.

The day school teacher is the one best suited for this work. Most of our day school teachers are neither capable of organizing the clubs nor willing to add these duties to their school work without more remuneration.\n\nJ.P.B.

Bernard Neery,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neery,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 15th,\n1-1-1 X W T, and take this opportunity of congratulating you\non your appointment as Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\nI trust that before long I may have the pleasure of making your\nacquaintance and that our contacts will be as happy as those\nI have enjoyed in the past with your predecessor.\n\nI have studied the above form and think it is ad-\nmirably planned for its purpose. Possibly in actual use some\namendments may appear to be desirable but at the moment I have\nnothing to suggest.\n\nMay I take this opportunity however of making plain\nthat this Commission is concerned with residential schools only.\nWe have been concerned with the day school on the Sarcee Reserve\nnear Calgary but only because this was formerly a residential\nschool. I think it well to avoid confusion that we should return\nthe supply of forms as it will be better for the directions in\nregard to their use to come from your office rather than from\nours. I enclose a list of the Bishops to whom I think a letter\nwith forms should be addressed.\n\nI have noted in the evidence given before the Parli-\namentary Committee of Inquiry the assumption that too many\nteachers are being appointed without the necessary qualifications.\nI can assure you that as far as this Commission is concerned it\nhas consistently been our endeavour to secure fully certificate\nteachers. I find that in the last school year only about three\nof our teachers lacked teacher training certificates and in each\ncase there were educational or other qualifications which balanced\nthe lack of a formal certificate. We are finding it a little\ndifficult now to maintain this standard for the coming year but this is not surprising when Provincial governments are issuing many hundreds of temporary teaching permits and not a few Indian day schools have been closed for lack of teachers.\n\nWith every good wish, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 22nd inst., enclosing forms of Application for Employment in Indian Day Schools, which same I welcome as most useful in securing necessary information regarding applicants for the position of teacher.\n\nMay I make one comment? The term \"Religion\" might be made more definite by the question \"Religious Denomination\" which I presume is the information required. The answer to the question as to religion would or should be Christian or otherwise, while what we would desire to know is what branch of the Christian religion the applicant embraces or follows. It is perhaps a small matter, but experience has taught that the more specific question is desirable, and its answer more helpful.\n\nMay I say that I have advertised for a week in the two daily newspapers of Winnipeg for teachers for Jack River and Hollow Water River Day Schools in separate advertisements, and though two weeks have passed I have not received any applications. Through this portion of Western Ontario, and throughout Manitoba, there is a definite shortage of rural teachers, and it is increasingly difficult to secure teachers for remote areas.\n\nOur missionary at Big Trout Lake informed me a week or so ago that the Indians at that centre and also at Windigo Lake have asked him to appeal to me for teacher schools and teachers. There are also other bands, such as Cat Lake, and also Duo Lake, 175 miles north-west of Churchill where we should have schools. It is our hope that a Residential School will be provided near the Hudson Bay Railway as promised in 1939.

I have a suggestion here and I want to have you look into it. I had no consideration from the Indian Agent an the principals of the schools not that I am a bad boy. Maybe they are ole fashion minded about having the new generation healthy.\n\nI wanted to instruct Physical training to both schools and perhaps make a club on the Reserve for boys. I mean a good and perhaps I might be able to make top athletes in track and field. Like the Gleichen pupils, there's a man that is appointed to teach them P.T. I was a physical Instructor in the Army and the folk's have the utmost confidence in my. I was in the Army for over five years, part Infantry Corp. the Calgary Highlanders, was discharged March 3rd, 1946, so I thought that might be good idea, and with your co-operation behind it, it would sure reinforce my Ideal, and for nothing to teach them games sports, field and track and even plays, and I am sure the children will simply enjoy than and that will keep them healthy, and I end with luck, Cheerio.

The circular is quoted in full:\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ONTARIO\nPUBLIC LIBRARIES BRANCH,\nTravelling Libraries Service\n\n\"The object of these travelling libraries is to supplement the\navailable book stock of smaller public libraries as well as to serve the\nwomen's institutes, farmers' clubs, study clubs and schools in communities,\nrural and urban, where public library service is not accessible. Requests\nfor special titles or special types of literature will always be filled so\nfar as possible; for example, agriculture, household science, travel,\nbiography, economics, boys' and girls' books. A case holds from forty to\nfifty volumes.\n\nOccasionally requests are made for cases entirely of fiction.\nSuch applications cannot be granted, since the libraries are chiefly for\neducational purposes.\n\nFor practical reasons no catalogue is published. New books\nare being purchased every month, worn-out volumes are being withdrawn,\nand much of the collection is always in circulation throughout the\nProvince.\n\nCost -- None, except carriage charges. The borrowing community\nis asked to pay the charges on arrival; the Department will pay for the\nreturn. A case of books weighs approximately seventy-five pounds. The\ncase should be returned by the same mode of transportation used by the\nDepartment.\n\nPeriod of Loan -- The regular period for a loan is four months,\nthough cases may be returned as soon as the books are read, and another\ncase procured but only one case may be procured at a time.\n\nThe Department prefers to lend through an organized association\nof some kind. The books must be available without charge to the entire\ncommunity and not only to the members of an association, club or church.\nArrangements must be made for a suitable custodian.\"\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has very limited funds available to\ndefray the cost of transportation or loss of such travelling libraries.\nSeveral schools are already using this service and are meeting the small\nexpenses involved by raising funds by community efforts such as concerts,\nbazaars, etc. If such community contributions are not readily available,\nthen application can be made through the Indian Agent for necessary funds.\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

If you have not already accepted the position mentioned in your letter, I will expect to hear further from you concerning which part of the country you are most anxious to go to.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Patricia M. Nadon,\nJack Fish, Ontario.\n87 Whitehall Road\nToronto 5, Ontario\nMay 9, 1947\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey-\n\nAs I was not accepted for a position in one of the Indian schools for the summer, I gather that I did not have sufficient qualifications. I should very much appreciate if however, if you would keep me in mind for next summer, at which time I shall have completed my second year in college and be more qualified for such an important undertaking.\n\nIt would be of great assistance to me if you could tell me just what is needed for such a position as perhaps there is some outside work which I could do that would be of value in future work of this kind.\n\nAs the need for closer cooperation between Whites and Indians will follow as a result of the changes brought about by the revision of the Indian Act, there will be a greater need for properly trained people with a real interest. This should mean new openings and new positions not at present in existence. If there is to be properly trained staffs then it is rather necessary to know just what courses in University would be the most likely to give part of this training, and what additional training would be necessary. Also just how much experience is necessary to qualify for positions in the government at Ottawa or on the reserves.\n\nI know that it is a pretty big question and that there are many problems to solve. I think that both Indians and Whites feel that since your coming to office there has been some definite improvement, and it is to be hoped that some day the Indians will be working side by side with the white people in the government as well as elsewhere.\n\nThank you very much for sending me all the information on the committee investigating the Indian Act. It has been a great help in understanding better the problems that face both the government and the Indians.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Miss) Beatrice Sanderson\nOttawa, May 15, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Sanderson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 9, addressed to Mr. Hoey.\n\nWe were very fortunate this year in obtaining teachers for our summer schools who were practically all qualified.\n\nIn answer to paragraph 3 of your letter may I say that there are two main fields into which a person wishing to enter our service should be trained, (a) education, (b) social welfare. I do appreciate your interest in this work and if any sudden opportunities arise we will contact you at once.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Beatrice Sanderson,\n87 Whitehall Road,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\nSt. Francis Xavier University,\nAntigonish, N.S.,\nMay 3, 1947\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nDept. of Welfare and Training\nDept. of Mines and Resources.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I filed application for a position in an Indian day school I was under the impression that it was strictly a summertime job and that there were vacancies in the Maritimes Provinces. From your letter I understand that this is a permanent job and circumstances do not permit me to accept your kind offer as I am returning to university next fall for further study. However I have handed your letter to our Veteran's Counsellor and should he find a qualified person he will refer him to you.\n\nIf however, I have misinterpreted your letter and it is a summertime job and a vacancy occurs in some location I should like to hear from you again. It is impossible for me to travel outside of the Maritimes to work.\n\nI hope you will appreciate my position and retain me in your goodwill.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAllen E.

You do not mention allowances for travelling, which would be quite expensive in my case, as I would want to be posted somewhere in the vicinity of Dawson City or at least in the McKenzie River area. I have been led to understand that living there is expensive so unless some additional provision is made, I do not feel that the salaries offered are adequate. If my information is incomplete I shall be grateful if you will add to it. However, if I can expect only the salary named in the schedule for a Grade three teacher with six years' experience, I must regretfully withdraw my application.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPatricia M.

I have had ten years' experience teaching public schools, holding a second class normal school certificate also certificates in agriculture and manual training.\n\nI am at present employed as instructor with the Shaw Schools Toronto. I was brought up on a farm and prefer the country to the city.\n\nMy wife died seven years ago and I have my own furniture and would prefer to live by myself instead of boarding with an Indian family.

Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs\n\nI have been asked to bring to your attention the qualifications of Mr. Daniel Burton Angus, A Senior Schoolmaster, Permanent, in the Naval Service and to inquire if there is a possibility that there might be an opening in the Indian Affairs Branch for Mr. Angus. According to the records of the Commission, Mr. Angus was born on September 17, 1896 and is a graduate of Acadia University where he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1917. He is entitled to preference for service in the great war having proceeded overseas in 1917 and he was discharged in 1919.\n\nAs a result of a general competition in 1921 Mr. Angus was declared eligible for and assigned for duty as Schoolmaster, Naval Training School at Halifax, N.S. His services have been satisfactory and he was promoted in April 1938 to Senior Schoolmaster, Naval Training School. He enlisted in the armed forces in the Royal Canadian Navy on September 1, 1940 where he remained on duty until March 31, 1947. As the Navy has now instituted an Instructor Branch this civilian position is being abolished. At the time he communicated with the Commission in February his address was H.M.C.S. Warrior, c/o F.M.O., Esquimalt. At that time he stated that he would prefer appointment in Nova Scotia. The Department of National Defence has confirmed Mr. Angus' statement concerning his release and has reported that there is no other suitable position in that Department in which his services could be utilized. Presumably he is still at the west coast.\n\nIt is suggested that he might be interviewed by the Commissioner for Indian Affairs for the Province of British Columbia, Major D.M. McKay and a report on the possibilities of his employment secured. I respectfully give this matter prompt attention.\n\nR. Gosselin,\nAssociate Secretary.\nOttawa, April 12, 1947.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDaniel Burton Angus -\n\nI attach for your information a self-explanatory letter which has been received from the Civil Service Commission concerning the above schoolmaster. Would you please write to the Senior Naval Office at Esquimalt to ascertain if Mr. Angus is still stationed there and if you can arrange the interview as requested. I attach extra copies of letters for your convenience in contacting the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\n\nRef/EM\nDr. Hugh L. Keenleyside, Deputy Minister, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nI would refer you to my letter of April 5 in which I brought to your attention the qualifications of Mr. Harold Burton Angus, a permanent Senior Schoolmaster in the Naval Service. In that letter it was suggested that Mr. Angus be interviewed by the Commissioner for Indian Affairs for the Province of British Columbia, Major D.M. McKay, on the possibilities of his employment in your Department. Since that date a letter has been received from Mr. Angus with the Post Office address Rockingham Station, Halifax Co., N.S.\n\nMay I be advised, please, if it was possible for Major McKay to interview Mr. Angus before he left for Eastern Canada.\n\nR.

Morgan, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\n\nBFN/MGD\nMrs. T. A. Hoey, Director\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Mrs. Hoey,\n\nAt present I am going to university, and will eventually be taking a teacher's course in the hope that I may some day be able to work on an Indian Reserve. It does seem to me however, with four free months that I should be able in some way to gain a little experience which would be of real value later.\n\nI realize that you have summer training courses, but what I was wondering was whether there are no other opportunities as the course seems to be filled with more qualified people while it only proper.\n\nI notice that there is often mention of shortage of clerical help in the agency keeping the agent tied down when he could be making more use of his time. Would it not be possible for students who are genuinely interested, to help out during their vacations, particularly in agencies where obtaining permanent help immediately presents some difficulties? In this way the student could gain valuable experience. He would also become familiarized with the difficulties facing...\nthe Department and Agent as well as gaining a knowledge of Administrative methods. He would gradually learn how the Agent solves the problem facing him, gain a knowledge of the problem as seen from the Indian's point of view as well as relieving the Agent of some of the burden of clerical work.\n\nIt would also give the Department a chance to see if the person were suited to the work and in what position eventually he might prove most useful. This would mean a potential staff in the future, and alleviate the necessity of waiting so long in order to find the right person for the job. The student could return each year for four or five years and thus would have sufficient time for the Agent to become thoroughly acquainted with the student. At the end of this time (taking for granted that the student has proved satisfactory), a full report could be sent to Ottawa.\n\nIf this plan would not seem feasible I should very much appreciate it if you could tell me if there is any kind of work, either at Ottawa or in the field (the latter preferably) which might be available within this summer or next.\n\nI have just completed my first year of college in Social Science with first class honors. I have three years working experience in typing, bookkeeping, and general office work, as well as reception work. I have had a good deal of experience with children, having taught an incoming and nursing school.\nand have been quite successful in my work with them as I am exceedingly fond of both children and adults.\n\nI have spent a short time around Indian Reserve and have many Indian friends. I am also teaching myself Cree, and short hand, and studying the reports on the investigation of the Indian Act by the Senate and House of Commons. Trusting that I may be of some help, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Miss) Beatrice Sanderson.\nOttawa, June 25th, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Sanderson:\n\nI have read your letter with much interest after it was handed to me by Mr. Hoey. We were able to obtain qualified teachers for practically all of our seasonal schools. The reason for this was that many veterans, both men and women who are qualified teachers are now attending university and welcomed the opportunity of doing such work during the summer holidays.\n\nYour comments concerning the clerical positions are worthy of note. However, the Civil Service Commission makes all such appointments and usually these are made within the local preference area concerned. This precludes the sending in of outside employees such as you suggest. We are now employing two University students at our own head office but in both these instances they are Ottawa residents.\n\nI have taken the liberty of sending a copy of your letter to the Reverend Mr. Zimmerman, Principal of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford in the event that he will be looking for a staff to help him out this summer. We have many Indian orphans who remain at this school during the holidays and with his usual staff going on vacation, Mr. Zimmerman often has difficulty obtaining replacements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss Beatrice Sanderson,\n87 Whitehall Rd.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nbfn/mgd\nOttawa, June 25th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nUnfortunately all our seasonal schools are now filled. Therefore, we were unable to give any indication of future employment to the writer of the attached letter.\n\nHowever, it occurred to me that you might be looking for someone to fill in during the summer holidays and, therefore, I am sending a copy of her letter to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\n\nMr. W.J. Zimmerman,\nMohawk Institute\nBrantford, Ontario.\nToronto, Ont.,\nJune 18, 1947.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nDept. Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI had not told the President of the schools of my intention of resigning but I had to tell him after I came back and he felt bad that I intended leaving.\n\nThe President and the Principal of the school finally persuaded me to stay, so I am evidently a fixture here.\n\nI thank you for the kind hearing accorded me, also for the return of the school papers.\n\nSorry to have given you any trouble in connection with the matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nS.H. Neice\nOttawa, June 28, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Neice:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 18 and regret that you will be unable to work in our schools during the next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The starting salary in this position would be $1,560., increasing annually by $60. amounts to $1,800.\n\nHowever, this is one of the few schools for which we do not provide living accommodation. I am mentioning it to you because of your stated preference for a place where you would not have to cook for yourself. This school is just on the edge of the city and there is good bus transportation to and from town.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. B. Chapman,\n1048 Mackay St.,\nMontreal 25, P.Q.\n\nBFN/MDG\n1048 Mackay Street,\nMontreal (25),\nJune 27, 1947.\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nREQUEST FOR\n\n(1) AN APPLICATION FORM;\nAS WELL AS\n(2) SPECIFIC DETAILS REGARDING THE POINT MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH TWO BELOW.\n\nI am an experienced teacher holding a first-class permanent certificate, B.A., B.Ed., (gold medal for general proficiency) \u2014 together with commercial specialist's certificate and special training in music, especially in piano and children's vocal work. I am interested in your advertisement which appears in the current issue of the Montreal Daily Star.\n\nShould I find the type of position for which I am looking, it would matter little in which province the school was located. Years ago I knew in Winnipeg a very fine lady, rather elderly, who had served as nurse in the residential school at Norway House. (Please do not misunderstand and imagine that I am so stupid as to look for a post in an Indian Residential Church School in a list of day school vacancies furnished by the Department of Indian Affairs). I remember distinctly, however, the good lady explaining that the day school teacher at Norway House, who had of course engaged and paid by the Dominion Government, lived with the staff of the residential school; in fact, there was a working arrangement whereby the two co-operated so as to provide more intelligent grading, and so forth. THAT IS THE TYPE OF POSITION FOR WHICH I WISH TO APPLY.\n\nAnd now a confession or two. Perhaps I could cook well enough to keep myself alive \u2014 for a while \u2014 but I would be a very short while. Next, during the war years I forsook the teaching profession, following business interests which proved somewhat more remunerative than any high school principal's post. I am well to do, but I have a tremendous fondness for children \u2014 especially underprivileged ones \u2014 and I feel that in addition to presenting intelligently the various subjects of the curriculum I might be able to spread something in the way of sunshine for the benefit of those boys and girls, whose later lives are likely to be dark enough.\n\nI am an Ontario-born Protestant. I'm no flaming evangelist, but inspection reports have led me to believe that I am a capable teacher. As a teetotaler,\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H.R.) B. Chapman\nOttawa, June 30th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Betts:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 26th and I enclose for your completion, a copy of our application form.\n\nUnfortunately, our salaries for non-certificated teachers are very low, the beginning salary being $1,000 a year, plus house, fuel and light.

It is unlikely that we will have many vacancies in this part of the country and in fact, several of the teachers have requested to be placed in schools in the West. The only schools in the Prairie Provinces in which we are employing technical teachers, are the residential schools. Would you be interested in such a post?\n\nMore and more, however, we are insisting upon qualifications for our teachers. This of course means a year spent at Normal, at least.\n\nWe are now beginning to employ welfare teachers who combine the duties of welfare workers and those of teachers. But still we require a teaching certificate. It has been found by long experience that no matter how sincere and earnest people are, they usually have difficulty in teaching Indian children unless they are properly trained. I hope to hear further from you with regard to your plans.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of the Fire and Lighting,\nProvince Office Branch,\nDept. of Municipal Services,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAfter submitting a civil service application for the position of clerk in the Dominion Land Office, they have informed me that there will be vacancies for some time. They wrote the very able advice of Mr. W.M. Wood, O.T.S., Superintendent of Works and Mr. G.H. Gordon, D.C. of Public Works, 507 Public Building, Ottawa, Canada. These gentlemen advised me to inquire about the opportunity that may occur or in the future apply in their department of the Dominion Office Branch of the civil service.\nMost of my schooling was obtained in Toronto District, which is still the home of my parents. During this time I obtained a Grade 7 diploma from Central Technical School, the course taken being the Aircraft Mechanics Course. I found out that the academic subjects appealed to me much more strongly than the technical work that was also taught here. The course included many new subjects such as Carpentry, woodwork, bricklaying, etc., and the teachers covered each subject with great practical application. The technical work included History, Composition, Grammar, Mathematics, Botany, and Chemistry; all written subjects were covered during the school term.\n\nDuring the war while serving with the R.C.A.F. in Canada and Overseas we were required to...\nI wrote earlier to bring our grade\nstanding to the junior matriculation\nlevel.

POSITIONS HELD AND FACTS NOT ALREADY COVERED (Cont.)\n\n4. Sept. 1940 - Dec. 1942, I was in charge of the Science Department, Aubury College, Ottawa, Ontario, preparing the Senior Students in Natural Science: Biology, Chemistry and Physics, including laboratory work.\n\nI also taught German.\n\nReason for leaving: decrease in number of Senior Students on account of their enlistment in the Armed Forces.\n\nAppointed by the Department of Education, Province of Ontario, Toronto, I was Associate Examiner in Senior Matriculation Chemistry for said Province, 1942.\n\n5. April 1937 - Sept. 1940, I was Statistical Clerk, Dominion Unemployment Relief, Department of Labour, Ottawa, my work including preparation of reports in social research, and statistics, especially on the problems of Youth.\n\nReason for leaving: the abolition of the Dominion Unemployment Relief Branch.\n\n6. Oct. 1927 - March 1937, The United Church of Canada, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, used my linguistic ability and my knowledge of Social Science and Welfare in connection with their 'All-Nations' work among the new Canadians.\n\nI was stationed at Toronto, Ontario, 1927-30, where I was ordained a Minister on June 9, 1929, and at Hanna, Alberta, from 1930.\n\nReason for leaving: my work had to be closed because funds were not available due to the 'depression'.\n\nWhile I was in Toronto, Ontario, June 1929, Mr. Wm. J. Beaton, K.C., Barrister, 372 Bay Street, of said City, then Vice-Consul for Sweden, recommended me as his successor when he resigned from this position.\n\nWhile I was in Hanna, Alberta, January 1933, the Department of Justice of the province of Alberta appointed me a Notary Public.\n\n7. 1918 - 1922, During the summer months, 1918 - 1922, when the Colleges were closed, I was attached as Statistician to the Economic Research Bureau of the General Agricultural Society of Sweden, Stockholm, where I prepared reports on economic research, and statistics.\n\n8. 1914 - 1918, During the First Great War I was attached as a Clerk to the Office of the Chief of the General Staff of the Swedish Army, Stockholm, Sweden, where I gained experience in office routine and statistics, as well as in translation and interpretation work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nWilhelm Schulte Tigges\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to say that I have known Dr. Wm. S. Tigges for just over six months, both as a colleague and a friend. During that time I have been most impressed with his conscientious work both in school and out of school activities.\n\nThe very great interest he has shown and the practical help he has given to our sixty English boys has been one of the most spontaneous and Christian acts I have known. The boys all find his Science lectures most interesting and more than that, he has made their leisure periods, when home-sickness could not have been far away, both memorable and interesting, from an educational and an enjoyment point of view.\n\nIn my own frequent contacts with him I have always found him very helpful and courageous and never put out. I have the greatest admiration for the way he handles boys and I would not hesitate to recommend him for any position which required steady conscientious work and integrity of character.\n\n'Sgd.'

Tigges has been on the Staff of Ashbury College since September, 1940. He has been responsible for the Science Department of the School and in addition to teaching certain Junior School classes, has taught Upper and Middle School Matriculation Chemistry and Physics. He has also taught some German and Spanish, the former in Middle School Matriculation.\n\nHe has shown himself a very keen enthusiastic member of the Staff, both in and out of school, with a real knowledge of his subjects and an obvious liking for boys.\n\nI should think he would prove well capable of acting as Associate Examiner of Matriculation papers.\n\n'Sgd.' N.M. Archdale\n(COPY)\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK\nDepartment of Mathematics\nFREDERICTON, N. B.\n\nApril 30, 1946\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to state that I have had the privilege of working as a fellow professor in this Department with Dr. Wm. S. Tigges, from the first week in January, 1946 to this date. During this four months' period, Dr. Tigges himself taught a full year's course in Mathematics to two large groups.\n\nIn my experience he is the finest teacher I have ever observed. I have stood by with wonder as the students hung onto every word and gesture of this man, who had so outgrown the vanity of his vast learning, as to elucidate the great principles in simple terms that even untrained scholars could understand with ease.\n\nDr. Tigges is a humble Christian gentleman, whose conduct and manners were, throughout the period of our association, always a model of correctness.\n\nAny appointment which Dr. Tigges may accept in the future, can hardly add much to his already distinguished record -- such would, rather, add lustre to the position to which it might please him to lend his great gifts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n'Sgd.' G. E. N. Fox\n\nG. E. N. Fox\nProfessor of Mathematics\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK\nDepartment of Chemistry\nFREDERICTON, N. B.\n\nJuly 31, 1946\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nI have known Dr. W. S. Tigges for the past three months during which he has held the position of acting Assistant Professor of Chemistry and has been in charge of the laboratory work in Freshman chemistry (a full year's course).\n\nI have found Dr. Tigges to be a competent and careful instructor, with a marked ability to gain the confidence of his students and unusual zeal and tirelessness in coaching them.\n\nHis classes have been composed of ex-service men and women and I believe it is largely due to his self-sacrifice and devotion that they have done well.\n\nSgd., F.

Last week I noted your request for teachers for rural day schools in various provinces. I myself am an experienced teacher and am at present a supply\nschool in Chatham, going to Boston the following year where he became skilled in his special field of printing. In 1941 he enlisted in the Canadian army and rose to the rank of Captain. While overseas he had command of the only mobile printing unit (R.C.A.S.C.) on the continent. Since leaving the army last year he has been employed in the printing business but would prefer an executive or teaching position. Because of his army training in the Service Corps he has had experience in the transport and maintenance of supplies.\n\nAs for myself I am an American, born and educated in Boston, Mass., and a graduate of Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Mass., with a degree (A.B.) in Biology. All my work in this and allied fields was done under Harvard University professors. For teacher in Barrie. My husband has had no teaching experience but has worked with young boys as a Cub and Scout leader and committee man so that I believe he could teach the lower grades very successfully, or perhaps you might have some other type of work that he could handle where we could all be together.\n\nPerhaps a resume of our individual backgrounds would help you to tell what we might be best suited for.\n\nMy husband, a Canadian who has had most of his business experience in Boston, Mass., was born in Manitoba and educated in Moncton and Chatham, New Brunswick. He graduated from high\nTwo years after graduation I had charge of lab work for Biology classes in a private school in Boston and a college in New Hampshire. I was also a native counselor at camp for two seasons. In the last five years I have worked as a volunteer adviser for a group of Chinese girls at the Booth Y.W.C.A., and for the last year I have acted as a supply teacher in Maine.\n\nAs for preference of province\u2014because our education has been elsewhere\u2014neither of us holds an Ontario teaching certificate\u2014therefore that would seem to eliminate this province. Depending on regulations we would prefer British Columbia or Ontario. We would appreciate an answer as soon as possible, telling us what possibilities there might be that would fit our qualifications.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean W. Johnston\nConrad V.

The outline of your qualifications as contained in your letter gives a suitable background of your experience, but upon receiving the application forms, we will be able to definitely decide where we can offer you positions. Your husband may have a little difficulty at first, but in the Province of Ontario now, a teacher can obtain a certificate by attending summer sessions. It is possible that he might be able to qualify for a certificate in this manner, after he has had some actual teaching experience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

I have had little teaching experience, apart from a few months instructing Radar while in the services. To effect this, in anticipation of acceptance by your department, I intend, this winter, to study methods of teaching for elementary grades. Would it be possible for you to recommend to me any literature or teaching manuals the Department thinks applicable to the position I am applying for.\n\nAs for remuneration, next summer vacation I shall be quite content if my wages will be able to cover the expenses that will be incurred by my family and I when travelling and during my tour of duty with your department.\n\nI am very desirous of doing Indian work, and of gaining sociological experience in dealing with primitive peoples.

I have never had that experience, and I know very little about Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAug. 30/47\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6003, File 1-1-IX, part 8)\nSchool Files\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI know I had a very hard time at the school last year. It was really too much for me. I felt so lonely and isolated there.\n\nAnd who is this teacher? How far is he/she from here? Is he/she coming by train or bus?\n\nThe teachers living in the dormitories treated me well. They were very kind and caring.\n\nI have been working very hard to improve my writing skills.\nI learned to be free\nknowing distinctly until\nThursday morning\nyear came of the school.\n\nThe salary is fair,\nbut I needed much more,\nand asked $1800.00\nstay where I was last\nyear. And I was\nlearning in my own\ntown.\n\n(That) what church\nis church? Are we\nPresbyterian? Or a\nProtestant.\nI know I - el think\nI do not - this thing\nAnd he, I believe\nThat this letter will\nkind a lie but is\nsupposed & ought\nin me not that kind\nI wrote it neither.\n\n(Miss) Fawcett\n\n(Poor Copy)\nColonel Neary\n\nTeachers for isolated schools.\n\nFurther material for that file to which Inspectors Barry and McKennon are also giving attention.\n\nClosed Manitoba Schools\n\nEighty Manitoba schools were unable to open their doors this fall for the fall term. The reason was that no teachers were available to conduct classes. In addition, 20 teachers were still needed to fill out vacancies in secondary schools. These gaps remained to be filled in spite of the fact that 58 permits had been issued to persons not yet qualified to teach, and another 60 permits were in the process of being issued.\n\nIn all probability 700 permit teachers will preside over Manitoba's isolated classrooms before the educational system is in normal operation for the 1947-48 term.\n\nWhile this situation is far from satisfactory it is an improvement on last year, when approximately 800 permits were issued. It is also an improvement on Saskatchewan where, according to reports, 300 schools failed to open because of a shortage of teachers.\n\nEven though there is some improvement, however, it is clear that the day when Manitoba teachers can get along without the help of those willing and daring enough to teach on permits is a long way off. The provincial Normal School enrolment is substantially below what the institution can accommodate. The Normal School can provide facilities for 500\u2014yet so far this year only 360 have registered for courses. The number of teachers needed in classrooms in the province is about 4,350.\n\nThe factors which brought the shortage of teachers about are well known. Low salaries, lack of prestige in the community, insecurity of tenure, inadequate prospects for orderly advancement and unwarranted interference with individual privacy by some school boards are responsible for the plight of Manitoba schools today.\n\nDuring the last few years salaries paid teachers generally have increased. It is true that certain rural areas still offer teachers financial rewards for their efforts which can only be described as discouraging. By and large, however, the salary situation is improving.\n\nSince progress has not been made in removing the other grievances which moved thousands of able young persons out of the profession in droves when the opportunity presented itself, the best hope of effecting a remedy lies in grievances seems to lie in wider adoption of the larger unit of school administration. Within the larger unit prospects of advancement are assured, and adequate salaries offered. There is less possibility of unwarranted interference with the private life of the teachers in the larger area. The financial strength of the large area offers more chance for security of tenure. As the result the position of the teacher in such a district carries with it a more satisfying place in the community.\n\nIt may as well be recognised once and for all that the day when the teacher was something like a family retainer who was expected to be content with small pay and a great sense of \"mission\" is gone. The community's contribution to education will have to be greater from now on.\n\nWhen we do not supply items 4 & 5, plus light, it has been suggested that we pay the person who provides quarters for the teacher. Ration or ration allowance is something else! Both allowances affect income tax.\n\nThe problem stands out sharply where our teaching is already occupied and an added teacher has to board.\n\nCat Clark\n\nManitoba offers:\n\n1. $50 a year over the scale\n2. One term free tuition at Normal $25\n3. Four months free room & board while at Normal ($40)\n\nThese inducements are heard to the holders of \"permits.\"\n\n4. Teachorage with furniture (including)\n5. Fuel\n6. Some districts pay part of the transportation.\n\nPOOR COPY\nFort Frances, Ont.,\nOct. 4, 1947.\n\nBernard F.

That fact and rationing forced me in 1942 to discontinue my work at that place. Would your Department consider the transfer\nof superannuation payments, withheld from teachers' salary, to the provincial superannuation fund?

I should like very much to do this and expect to be in Ottawa on November 20 and 21. As I have other meetings at that time, perhaps I could telephone you on my arrival to make an appointment.\n\nI shall be interested in the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee upon the Indian Act.

Murray\nOttawa, November 6, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Allard:\n\nI was very pleased to receive your letter of November 1. The unfortunate thing is that at the present time we do not have a vacancy for two teachers for a two-room school. We have one-room school vacancies in Ontario (Lake Superior region), in northern Saskatchewan, in the Northwest Territories and in British Columbia. I presume from your letter that you both want to teach. I enclose two application forms, which I would like to have completed and returned here by airmail. You might also tell me if you would be willing to accept a one-room school at the present time, with the understanding that we could try to put you in a two-room school when such a vacancy occurred.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

However, I understand that references will be necessary before any definite application is considered.\n\nI am really more interested in a school in the Yukon or North West Territories rather than B.C. or Alberta. If you would kindly keep my application in mind, should such an opportunity arise, I would be glad to hear from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Mrs.) Joan Adams\nOttawa, November 8, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Hunter:\n\nI have received your letter of October 29. Upon examination of our files I find that you taught for one year at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School (1942-43). It is noted that you have a second class Manitoba certificate. However, in order to bring your more recent qualifications to our attention, would you please complete the attached application form. This will also enable us to classify you on our teachers' salary schedule.\n\nI have sent a telegram to Inspector Hamilton to check on the vacancies in our Manitoba schools.\n\nWe might also have a vacancy in the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School, near Montreal. I have just been informed by one of our inspectors that a teacher at present on sick leave of a month, may not be able to return. We have no other vacancies in the East at the present time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. M. B.

There is also a vacancy at the Chossewun Indian Day School, in northern Manitoba, near The Pas. If we are unable to get you into the Yukon this winter, because of the lateness of the season, would you be willing to take over this school until we can send you north next year.\n\nAdded to the difficulty of getting you in to Old Crow is the problem of sending in an adequate supply of necessary school materials. However, Mr. Indian Agent Neek will advise concerning this, also.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. John H.

They are brother and sister, namely, Terry Allard and Leona Allard. They each have two years teaching experience. The girl has had infantile paralysis and can walk only with crutches. Therefore, she wishes a day school where she can either be with her brother or at a distance not greater than fifteen miles from him.\n\nAs you know, we are very short of Catholic teachers in British Columbia and I wired our Commissioner about these two teachers. Unfortunately, our schools are widely scattered in British Columbia and we have not been able to place them in two schools that are close together.\n\nTherefore, I am writing to you in case you have something in mind for them.

Added to these facts was the point that only twelve Indian children were left in the settlement this year. By far the largest number of the Indians have left for the trapping grounds and will not be back until late Spring. Therefore, we would only require one teacher at this point.\n\nHowever, we are trying to negotiate a transfer in Ontario at Manitoulin Island. There one of the teachers of a two-room school has just resigned. If we can move the remaining teacher elsewhere we will then have a vacancy for your brother and yourself to take charge of this two-room school.\n\nIn conclusion may I assure you that we will do everything possible to place your brother and yourself in suitable positions.

Since we have had no further word, we were wondering if you had received it. We are very anxious to have definite instructions as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. Allard.\nOttawa, December 1st, 1947.\n\nMiss Irene Rossor,\nPelaguet, Ontario,\n\nDear Irene,\n\nI regret the unavoidable delay in answering your letter of November 17th, which was due to my absence in the field. I have just returned from an extended trip to Chapleau, Elliot Lake and Port Arthur area, and then on my return I had to visit Bemidji for a few days before settling down at home.\n\nMy delay in replying prevents you from reaching a decision in time to resign before December 1st. I am sorry for that reason, for your School Board at Pelaguet have made too many changes in recent years to be a smooth running organization.\n\nAs far as Indian Affairs are concerned, we have very often openings for teachers, in fact I would say every year for September classes. Many of our teachers have from ten to twenty years service, while others seem to change often, particularly in recent years with the existing shortage of qualified teachers.\n\nOur salary schedule appears to be as follows: the maximum starting salary for a qualified teacher entering the Service is $1,560.00, which salary raises annually to $3,280.00. A new teacher entering the Service, regardless of her years of experience, cannot get more than $1,560.00, so it could be that a younger teacher with perhaps less experience, but with ten years in the Indian Service, is getting $1,980.00. This was the reason for Mr. Phelan not answering your last letter. He had a feeling that with your experience, and the great demand for teachers, you could do much better than the offered $1,560.00, and that further correspondence was futile. I had a chat with him this morning, and he regrets that in the rush an explanation was not given.\nI am looking forward to seeing you at Markham during the Christmas holidays, when we can have an opportunity to discuss the matter at a greater length. In the meantime, Anne joins me in sending our best regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW. S. Arnall,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario.\nHalifax, Oct.,\nNov. 19/47\n\nDear Mr. Principal,\n\nI got your address from Mrs. Daniel, as you know, I nearly went to Kettle Point Indian School. I was most thoroughly investigated and it took such a long time. I came here while the investigation was on. Then I was told I was placed in Grade 3.\nKettle Point school is teacherless. I do say a matter of course. She has no certificate. I wrote a nice letter & offered her a place & (signature) letters & this little personal Mrs. Phillip Phillips in Ottawa, like a tremendous help doing her teaching here. Now she's going to get her aunt & do something there. Write all this. I think perhaps she should be accepted as teacher sometime in the future.\nIf I knew I could do something so good as I know, it would give me quite a thrill.\n\nAnd if I leave here by Feb. 30th, I don't have to worry about my teaching next year.\n\nI can't leave before the end of June and then they be quite a time this winter.\n\nYou can judge.\nI am writing to you to express my heartfelt gratitude for the opportunity I have been given to teach at the school in the town of [town name]. It has been an honor and privilege to be able to share my knowledge and skills with the students there.\n\nI have been teaching for over 15 years now, and I have always found it to be a rewarding experience. The students are very intelligent and eager to learn, and I am grateful for the chance to be a part of their education.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support and encouragement throughout my career. Your kindness and generosity have been a constant source of inspiration for me.\n\nThank you again for this opportunity, and I look forward to many more years of teaching and learning together.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nDecember 9, 1871\n\nDear Col. Henry,\n\nI am returning the book on the Indians in North America and thank you very much for lending it to me. I found it very interesting and learned a good deal, enough to make me want to know more. I hope that I shall be able to learn the Indians in a more formal way.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nConstance Hayward.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st., your I-I-Ix (WT) to Miss M.B.Searson of Hyndford Ont.\n\nI have received a letter from Miss Searson and judge she is anxious to take over one of our schools. I am well acquainted with this teacher's ability. After considering all angles I feel she would be better suited for Cornwall Island E. School but the question is what can be done about the present teacher.\n\nWould you consider transferring Mr. Ryan to Pic Indian Day School and placing Miss Searson on Cornwall Island? I think this would be a good move as I know Miss Searson can handle the situation much better here than the present incumbent as she is well used to teaching in areas where the competition is quite keen. On the other hand Mr. Ryan is steadying down now but will never be able to handle this school here. I would suggest arrangements be made to transfer Mr. Ryan to Pic School even if necessary to defray transportation and have Miss Searson take over the school here during the new year. It would hardly seem fair to make any other arrangement insofar as Mr. Ryan is concerned but I do not think he would mind the transfer and with his experience here and being out of such a competitive district as this there does not seem to be any reason why he cannot render valuable service at a more remote school.\n\nI would like your views re the above.\n\nA.J.Bennett\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 18, 1947.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nBox 967, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 11 concerning Miss Searson. We had previously planned to send Mr. Ryan to the Pie Indian Day School last August. However, he could not accept this position, due to the fact that the school is in such an isolated area as to prevent the purchase of fresh milk for his baby. We are thoroughly aware of the situation and are keeping him in mind for a possible transfer elsewhere. To date there have been no resignations from Roman Catholic teachers in Ontario or in Quebec.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 19, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nSalaries of Summer School Teachers -\nMooseonee Diocese.\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 15th. I have investigated the four cases into which you reported Summer School teachers have not as yet received their salary cheques:\n\n1. Osnaburgh - Reverend R.H. Bridle, teacher. No return of attendance, form I.A. 409 has been received to date.\n\n2. Fort Hope - Mr. Douglas Strachan - teacher. Mr. Strachan was requested on November 5th to forward his Income Tax T.D.1 form. This letter was sent to Mr. Strachan in care of you. To date no reply has been received to this letter. Form I.A. 409 is on file but payment of salary ($125.00 a teaching month) has not been made as our Treasury officials can not make out the cheque unless they know the amount of Income Tax deduction should be made.\n\n3. Lansdowne House - Mr. W.E. Vollrick - teacher. A voucher requesting payment for the period June 19th to September 16th inclusive at $125.00 a month was received here on December 10th and forwarded to Treasury on December 16th. This cheque should have reached you by now.\n\n4. Waswanipi - Mr. Eric B. de Pendleton - teacher. A voucher requesting payment for the period August 1 to September 4th at $125.00 a month was forwarded to Treasury on September 9th. The cheque was issued September 23rd.\nMr. de Pendleton was paid for the previous period of June 1 to July 31 by voucher which was forwarded to the Treasury Branch on August 20th, 1947. His cheque was issued on September 8th.\n\n5. Mistassini - Reverend John Evans - teacher. No return of attendance form I.A. 409 has been received to date.\n\nCheques for salary are always drawn in favour of the teacher and sent c/o Right Reverend R.J. Renison, Bishop of Moosonee, Bishopstope, Schumacher, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing a few extra copies of Form I.A. 409 in the event that these teachers have neglected to send the forms in. I would like to hear further from you so that these accounts may be settled.\n\nIn closing may I extend to you my personal greetings for a Happy and Prosperous New Year and that you may have continued health and success to carry on your missionary duties.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. R.J. Renison, M.A.D.D.,\nBishop,\nDiocese of Moosonee,\nBishopstope,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM.\nDecember 15th, 1947.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have just been checking the reports of our summer school teachers who worked under your department this year.\n\nI have your letter of May 26th confirming the appointment of four of them, and I arranged for the man at Mistassini, the Rev. John Evans, earlier. The following is the list:\n\n1. The Rev. T. H. Bridle, teacher of the Osnaburgh seasonal school.\n2. Mr. Douglas Strachan, who went to Fort Hope.\n3. Mr. W. E. Vollick, at Lansdowne House. In your letter you had him for the Albany seasonal school. Lansdowne House is on the Upper Albany.\n4. Mr. Eric B. de Penneleton, who was at Waswanapi school.\n5. The Rev. John Evans, Mistassini school.\n\nThese men carried out their contract. Their travelling expenses and salaries were paid by the Diocese, in accordance with our arrangement.\n\nI find that Mr. de Penneleton is the only one for whom we have received any payment from the Department. As far as I know, every one of them turned in the required reports to the Agent. I would like to know whether there has been any\nmistake or misunderstanding.\n\nOur accounts for the year are being made up, and I would be grateful if their cheques could be sent as soon as possible. If by any chance these have already been sent out, could you tell me to whom they have gone?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Moosonee\n\nEnc.\n\nP.S. I wrote a letter to Mr. Phelan on November 15th on this subject. I enclose a copy.\nNovember 3rd, 1947.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI wanted to make some enquiry about the reports of our Summer Student Teachers during the last summer.\n\nWe have received cheques for Mr. E. de Penhaleton of Maswanapi, but there are several others concerning whom we have heard nothing. As far as I know, these reports were sent in September. The names are the Rev. John Evans, Mistassini; Mr. W. Z. Vollrick, Lansdowne House, via Nakina; Mr. William Strehen, Fort Hope; and the Rev. T. H. Brindle, B.A., who taught school at Pickle Lemong for the Osmundsen Branch.\n\nIn case there should have been some oversight with regard to the reports, I thought I should bring the matter to your attention, and if it should go to some other department I would be glad if you would attend to the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. J. Renison.\n1. Osnaburg (Cat Lake) - Rev. T. H. Brindle - Teacher.\n   No return of attendance, Form IA 409, received to date.\n\n2. Fort Hope - Mr. H. B. Strachan, teacher, requested on Nov. 5 to forward his T.D. form. Letter was sent to Mr. Strachan, c/o Bishop Renison. No reply has been received. Form IA 409 is on file, but payment of salary ($125.00 a teaching month) has not been made, as we are awaiting his reply.\n\n3. Lansdowne House - Mr. W. E. Vollick, teacher.\n   Voucher requesting payment for period June 19th to September 10th, inc., at $125.00 a month, was forwarded to Treasury on 16/12/47.\n\n4. Waswanipi - Rev. E.B. de Pendleton - teacher.\n   Voucher requesting last payment - August 1 - Sept. 4 - at $125.00 was forwarded to Treasury on 11/9/47. Previous period - June 1st to July 31st - covered by voucher which was forwarded to Treasury 20/3/47.\n\n5. Mistassini - Rev.

I read that it was vacant last year for lack of teachers.\n\nWhat qualifications are necessary? I have been for many years a Public School Teacher, Ont., with Second Class certificate.\n\nLooking to hear from you, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) Mary E.

Doolan with reference to securing teaching position at Kettle Point.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge Mrs. Doris Orr and Mrs. Norreen Clemens intend to continue at Kettle Point and there is no vacancy there.\n\nAt St. Clair School on Sarnia Reserve there is no vacancy at present although a few weeks ago the Principal, Mrs. Williamson, mentioned that she might resign at Christmas, but to date has taken no action in this respect.\n\nI have not replied to Miss Doolan's letter, but the Department might wish to engage her for some other Indian day school.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 18th, your file l-l-l X (wr). The milk question does not appear to be too great an obstacle. When Mr. Ryan came to the Island he, like a lot of other people who are starting to raise families, was under the impression that the only way to keep a baby alive could be by means of fresh cow's milk. However, like the majority of people, he is using canned milk on the recommendation of the Doctor. I do not know, of course, whether the latter is obtainable at the Pic School and I am only forwarding this on for your information.\n\nIf our other plans do not materialize it would seem a good bet to put Miss Pearson in charge of the new Chenail School when it is ready. There is a possibility that she would remain with us for possibly a couple of years and by that time teachers might be more numerous. Insofar as Miss Terrance is concerned, undoubtedly she could be placed in some other Indian school at another Reserve, that is if she will take a transfer. It may be that she just can not work with her own people. The girl has the training and possibly on another Reserve she might be very successful as a teacher.\n\nT. L. Bunnah,\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 30, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Doolan:\n\nIndian Agent McCracken has forwarded to this office your letter of December 12th with reference to securing an appointment as teacher in an Indian day school.\n\nI enclose one of our regular application forms which you should complete and return.\n\nWe have vacancies occurring frequently and it is quite possible that we can give you an appointment in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This school is now under construction and we hope to have it finished within the next three or four months. To date Mr. Bonnah and I have been unable to interest any Order of teachers in this school as they would be unable to attend daily Mass because of the distance from the nearest Church.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Pearson,\nHyndford, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 2, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Doolan:\n\nFurther to my letter of December 30, we are now in a position to provide details with regard to a vacancy in Ontario.\n\nWe are opening a second classroom at the Moraviantown Indian Day School near Highgate, Ontario. The school will be conducted in the council hall which is just around the corner from the present school. We understand from Indian Superintendent Spence that you could either board with Mr. and Mrs. Dodson (the present teacher and his wife) or at a house approximately a half mile from the school.\n\nIf you are interested in this position I would like to hear further from you, enclosing the application form sent you in our original letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I have also taught for a few years - one of these in the Northwood Indian Day School at Inklisep in British Columbia.\n\nWhile I enjoyed living among the Indians and teaching at Inklisep, I could see little future in it for me, especially in the art field. At that time there seemed to be no concerted programme for arts and crafts education throughout the Indian school system, although many schools did exceptional work and individual teachers such as Anthony Walsh at Inklisep did a tremendously good job. It seemed a great pity to me that some overall attempt to keep all the schools informed on the best art and craft procedures was not established along with some agency to help teachers instigate up-to-date teaching methods to activate the great creative potential of the Indian child and to vitalize the traditional crafts of the various Indian communities.\n\nIf you will excuse my presumption, I would like to say that if such a programme has been instigated since I have taught or if there is any chance of one being included in your system I feel that my training and background would qualify me to handle a position in area supervision, as a travelling helping teacher or in curriculum planning. I would be grateful if you would write to me if you are at all interested in my proposals or if there are any positions in the Department in which you might think me interested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Lidstone\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nWould you please check inspector's reports on these gentlemen.\nMiss Mary E.

I am feeling well and anxious to get back to work but thought it over and decided I had better do as the doctor advised and be better fitted for the work later.\n\nI appreciate very much all\nthe information you have given me re schools, and shall no doubt return to the work at a later date when there is a vacancy.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIda Fairweather\n1/1/47 Richards St.,\nBrockville, Ont.,\nJan. 8, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I wrote regarding an appointment in an Indian day school, I wondered what requirements were necessary.\n\nMy case, perhaps, needs explanation. I resigned voluntarily here in April from the Public School teaching staff, after twenty years' service, thinking I was eligible for an \"A\" pension, as I had taught forty years and six months.\n\nI taught four years of this time in Alberta. I believe there was a new regulation this year in Ont., concerning teaching experience outside the province, but when I resigned I didn't know of this change. To receive an \"A\" pension, I had to be retiring age and had to pay in over a thousand dollars! I didn't do this.\n\nI have two more years to teach to be retiring age, and that is why I thought I might teach in an Indian day school, as I had seen in a circular that a school of this kind in Ont. wasn't open last year, because there was no teacher available.\n\nYou can understand that at my age I couldn't expect a new Board of Education to engage me, except younger teachers were not available.\n\nI received your wire from Ottawa this morning.\nand wish to thank you.\n\nBefore considering applying, I should like to know what subject I would be expected to teach, the size, age and grade of the class, the salary and living accommodation, and whether this teaching experience would count for superannuation.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nYours very truly,\nMary E. Doohan.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nJanuary 10, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Doelman:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 6 with regard to the vacant position at the St. Clair Indian Day School.

You are actually more interested evidently in an administrative or supervisory position rather than a teaching post.\n\nWe have added new positions to our Education Division but these have all been filled. We have not as yet established a position of Arts and Crafts Supervisor. If such a position were to be established and advertised, it would be through the Civil Service Commission.\n\nThe probability of establishing such a position is dependent largely on the outcome of the Parliamentary Committee at present at work revising the Indian Act. Definite progress has been made with regard to our day school teachers in that a regular salary schedule has now been established for them. They are also eligible to apply for superannuation privileges under the Civil Service Act of the Dominion Government. This, as you probably know, provides them with a higher rate of pension than do provincial teachers' superannuation plans.\n\nIf there is any possibility of an Arts Supervisor position being created I will gladly let you know. However, we are working more closely with the provincial\n\nJohn Lidstone, Esq.,\nRoom 2050, Army Hall,\nCity College of New York,\n1560 Amsterdam Ave.,\nNew York 31, N.Y., U.S.A.\ndepartments of Education and it is possible that a decision may be reached with regard to greater co-operation between provincial school systems and the Indian school system.

We will be writing to you concerning this matter under separate cover.\n\nHowever, it serves to introduce the problem of vacant Indian day schools which exist in the various provinces. The number of these schools has been greatly reduced since the introduction of our salary schedule and we hope to further reduce it this year. In fact our aim is to eliminate these vacancies entirely.\n\nOur records show that the following schools are vacant in Saskatchewan:\n\n- Little Red River Indian Day School\n- Chitek Lake\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise us as to the completeness of the above list. It is also suggested that further contact be made with the denominations concerned with the appointment of teachers at these particular schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nI have had an opportunity of reading the attached memorandum concerning Mrs. Dykstra. So far our policy in the appointment of teachers to Indian hospital schools has been the selection of only those who are qualified professionally.\n\nIt would seem evident that Mrs. Dykstra is more interested in Red Cross procedures along occupational therapy lines in hospitals. Rather than infringe upon this type of work, which is definitely within the sphere of the Indian Health Services Division, I would recommend that this matter be referred to Dr. Moore.\n\nI am not prepared to make a recommendation with regard to Dr. Keenleyside's comments under (a).\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nW. Wallingford\nMcMaster University\nHamilton, Ontario\nJanuary 13, 1947\n\nMr. B. Murray\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nIndian Affairs Branch\nAltona, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Murray,\n\nAs you were such a great help to me last summer in supporting that work at Mt. Zion mission, I thought perhaps you could help me again. I loved working with the children, but this year I would like to get\nJanuary 19, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Sanderson:\n\nI have received your letter of January 13th. We will soon be considering the hiring of staffs for our seasonal day schools. Unfortunately for you, most of these schools are on very isolated reserves and we usually employ male university students.\n\nHowever, there are a few located in more accessible places and we would be glad to consider you for one of these posts.\n\nPlease find attached one of our application forms which are used in such instances. Be sure to state your experience at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Beatrice Sanderson,\nW. Wallingford,\nMcMaster University,\nHamilton, Ontario.\n\nBPN/MGD\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nVacancies - B.C. Indian Day Schools -\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter dated January 10th, 1948, concerning the above:\n\nThe following amendments should be made to the list included in the above mentioned letter:\n\n1. Chehalis - This school is no longer vacant. The position was filled by the transfer of Mr. Francis Grist from Redstone Meadows to Chehalis at the end of October, 1947.\n\n2. Boothroyd Indian Day School - There are insufficient pupils on the Boothroyd Reserve to warrant the re-opening of this school at the present time.\n\nThe following additions should be made to the list:\n\n1. Massett Indian Day School - Two teachers are required for this school at the present time.\n\n2. Ucluelet - One teacher required.\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRegina, January 17th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of the 10th instant, File No. 1-1-1 X (WT), regarding vacancies in Saskatchewan Indian day schools.\n\nThe Little Red River and Chitek Lake Indian Day Schools are the only ones vacant at the present time. The Little Red River School was opened with Mr. Smith at the beginning of the last term but he was medically unfit for the work and resigned of his own accord. Whether or not we will get another teacher for that school within the present term is very doubtful. Please refer to letter of Indian Agent Mr. E.S. Jones, of the 27th ultimo, File No. 1594-7-31, on the subject.\n\nWith regard to the Chitek Lake Indian Day School, there has been considerable correspondence in this connection and I should remind the Department that while there is actually a vacancy for teacher at that point, the old buildings are not fit for habitation. It was hoped that a new combined classroom and teacherage could be erected this year but it has been found impossible. We must not appoint a teacher and ask the teacher to live in the present buildings as the classroom and teacherage are absolutely unfit to use.\n\nJ.P.B.

I understand that accommodation is very limited at this hospital and that they have had to rent an additional building to provide nurses' quarters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard V.

Glimmon,\n416 A Seventh Avenue S.,\nLethbridge, Alberta.\nFebruary 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER,\n\nP.O. 219/48.\n\nThe above Treasury Board Minute is a recent one that deals with the hiring of temporary Civil Servants who are past the age of sixty-five.\n\nCould you please advise me whether or not it will be necessary to obtain further authority for the hiring of my school teachers who are past the age of sixty-five.\n\nI have this authority for those who are past this age up to June 30, 1948. I find it difficult to interpret the marginally noted Order-in-Council and, therefore, request your advice concerning it.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSir,-recently there spoke over this desk the University student, Pat O'Connor, who criticized the C.C.F.'s educational policy by quoting the fact that in Saskatchewan, 850 persons teaching with valid certificates held invalid certificates, and \"had the schools been properly financed under the C.C.F. government, our boys and girls would be developing in conditions they should use.\"\n\nNow Mr. O'Connor, no doubt, could have made Saskatchewan citizens not hold very well paying jobs, but he could easily find elsewhere in Canada to fall for his line. He would like to believe Saskatchewan is the only province with a shortage of teachers.\n\nThe figures I have as of June show that Nova Scotia, Alberta has 642 permit teachers, or ten percent, while Prince Edward Island has twelve percent. Manitoba, under a Liberal - Progressive-Conservative Coalition government, seven percent unqualified teachers. Ontario has fifteen percent, New Brunswick, Ed- ward Island has eighteen percent as compared to teachers holding on a permit.\n\nSo Mr. O'Connor's straw man cannot simply collapse and stand as the cause of the teacher shortage. If we look at the record of the Lib- erals during their heyday of 1937, there were 1,600 teachers owing $2,000,000 owing them on their salaries of salaries of $600 to $600 per year.\n\nIs it any wonder that teachers are leaving the province? If ever the Liberals should return?\n\nI wonder why Mr. O'Connor does not ask what the C.C.F. would do to solve this school shortage. Let us look at the record in 1944. The Liberal Government paid $2,000,000 in school grants. The C.C.F. Gov- ernment in the year ending March 31, 1948, paid $3,500,000 in school grants. And teachers' salaries are much higher than they were under the Liberal regime.\n\nThere are some who contend that the tax is cheaper than the school unit. Here are the facts: In my constituency, in the larger school unit, the tax is $21, whereas the same property in 1929 under the old system, paid $23.45 per quarter section in another school district. A neighbor of mine whose house lies in the town of Napier taxes which were $80 lower in Napier than in the present unit, in 1929 under the old system.\n\nWhere is the assessment of lands value? Is it not the case that the taxes may be biased? Isn't the average rate of taxes lower when we take into consideration the increased costs of goods, materials and the tendency for people to get under the larger school units?\n\nIf the Liberals and Progressive-Conservatives certainly have lots to kick about in the school situation. When they took the excess profits tax off the farmers, the Progressive-Conservatives wanted to continue it, but the farmers took them off. Now they are both happy with it.\n\nThe Liberals threw the coarse grasses away in order to jump in with because the rye futures were too high; over 800 pounds. The exchange boys were on the scene to rescue the government came to their rescue. The result\u2014our hogs and herds reduced. Is it any wonder that this was the front page of our daily newspapers\u2014\"For Sale\u2014Pigs\u2014Cattle\u2014Steers\u2014Rams\u2014Goats\u2014Up to 200 pounds.\" That is the rec- ords of a Minister of Agriculture trying to save the government and the speculators at the same time.\n\nGlencoe, Sask.\n\nThere is no room for such seating accommodation. So that when you were seated down and looked down on the crowd on the floor below which was the fire escape, you felt quite unique. There were 12,000 red blooms on all sides of the display.\n\nBut returning to the Chicago show, I for one was very much disappointed to see cows and iri- tiy livestock. What they looked to me to be just about as much uninteresting as the straw in the grain show. In fact, they allow cows to be in the building, but Canadian authorities would not permit. For instance, they had allowed the horses used for unloading. Horse stalls were so arranged that when you tried to enter, between rows or stalls you found yourself up against the wall. So, you had to retreat your steps. There were no fences around the end so you could come up the new alley and so on. What a disaster! Fire regulations here are strict. Spec- tators find themselves? Then, com- pared to the cow barns, the alleys or passageways in Chicago were surpassing the best of examples as helpers did their work, tables of feed, light trucks, and tools and all the things necessary to Toronto all feeding scale, public light truck, etc., were needed. These were all stored right in front of the spectators. The cow barns and show buildings were all well-painted or calcimined, clean, neat and airy. There was only one roofless building and dirty. You could buy hot dogs there. There were many more animals from big fat steers. \u2014Those E. Brown, Cassilis Alta.\nMr. B.F.

During most of that period she has been senior technician in charge of the analytical service rendered by this Department to the Kingston General Hospital, and as well has been responsible for the preparation of reagents, etc., for the work done in the laboratory by the medical students as part of their formal training in Biochemistry. In connection with this work she has had to do some instructing of other people, particularly in connection with chemical technique. I have had, therefore, an opportunity of observing Miss Cowie's capacity and ability from a number of viewpoints.\n\nI am happy to be able to say that I believe that she is particularly well suited to be a teacher and executive administrator. She has a pleasant and charming personality. Being physically both large and strong, she possesses great energy and drive. She has demonstrated an ability to work with others and to have them work for her.\n\nI am convinced that your service would have difficulty in finding many young women more suited than Miss Cowie to undertake teaching and other social service work in a pioneer community.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Do you have any residence schools?\n\nI am interested in teaching for the summer, but I also have to save a little money to help me to continue in my university course.

I have a second class permanent certificate for Saskatchewan which obtained in 1924 after attending normal in Regina. I also wrote subjects giving me first class standing in Science, History, and English.\n\nI taught Math, Geography, in some Saskatchewan districts with excellent results.

I plan to draw up one very much the same for our use, and I am going to suggest to Mr. McKinnon that whenever we receive an application form from a teacher we make a duplicate and file it with you so that you may be informed as to what applications we have on file.\n\nH.

Administration,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the course of a conversation with Miss Marion Cowie of Queen's University this morning, I learned something of your plans for supplying qualified teachers for the Northwest Territories.\n\nI am a qualified Public School teacher in Ontario and have had eight and one-half years of experience in our public schools. At present I am in Queen's University completing a Bachelor of Arts degree and will be ready to return to the teaching profession this fall.\n\nI am definitely interested in the situation in the N.W.T. and would greatly appreciate further information as to location, transportation, salary, etc., at your earliest convenience.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAllan R. McNab.\nRoad End\nVictoria Beach, Man.\nFebruary 2, 1948.\n\nHonorable James Glenn,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI listen each week, very intrigued, to Northern Messenger on my radio, and have wondered about several things. After hearing your New Year's greeting to these far outposts I decided you were the person to whom to address inquiries.\n\nAre there schools other than church schools? I am a teacher and have always been strongly attracted to the north. Could you give me information on schools and teachers in the far north, please? And to whom, should one apply for a position in such a school? Is the whole area administered from Ottawa? Would one accepting a position be required to stay any certain number of years.\n\nAny information will be most gratefully received.\n\nI am\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Mrs.) Grace Anderson.\nThe Supt. of Education for the N.W.T., N.W.T. and Yukon Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKimmon:\n\nI was talking today at the University to Miss Constance Watt. She graduates in April, and is majoring in Economics and Psychology, with English and History as minors. I am personally quite impressed with her; she seems to be a mature type with plenty of backbone and determination, and what interested me most was that she said she would like to get into some form of social welfare work, but not the ordinary kind. I thought of some of things you had said about your plans for the Territories, and it seems to me that she would fit well into a pioneer job. I am writing to give you her address, for I believe, if you have any openings in mind for such a girl, she would be a very worthwhile one to get.\n\nI often wish you had an opportunity to come here and talk to some of these people yourself. I am taking major work in English in third and fourth year, and I am daily in contact with an admirable group of people, many of whom would be suitable for some or the work, that we, in common with you, would like to see begun in the Territories. I really believe, if you would care to make such a trip, that you would have quite an impressive story to tell, and it would have quite a telling effect.\n\nThe address is Miss Constance Watt,\n388 Wortley Road,\nLondon, Ont.\n\nI believe it would pay if you wrote to her personally, if you think you have any opening at all for such a girl.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nsgd.

Miss Comeau's scholastic standing was excellent always; she was the class leader in 1943.\n\nMiss Comeau has been teaching Grades VI and VII for the Campbellton School Board in the Andrew Street School under my supervision for nearly two years.

Leeder,\n9 Apple Street,\nBrockville, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Leeder:\n\nI understand from Mr. B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education for the Indian Affairs Branch, that you are interested in securing a teaching position in one of the Indian Schools in B.C. At the moment I know of three vacancies which will be open at the beginning of the new academic year which I list below:\n\n(1) Sliammon Indian Day School - This school is located about six miles from the Town of Powell River and is connected to it by a good road. This is a small school with an average enrolment of about sixteen, made up of grades one and two. A furnished heated teacherage is provided and is also equipped with a telephone.\n\n(2) Shalalth Indian Day School - This school is located close to the white community at Seton Lake in the Bridge River country. The school has been closed for several years for lack of teacher and I have no information as to what the actual enrolment would be. Living accommodation consists of two rooms at the end of the school and would not be suitable if you are a married man.\n\n(3) Penticton Indian Day School - This school is located about two miles from the City of the same name in the Okanagan Valley. A furnished heated teacherage will be supplied. This building is rather old but I believe will be quite comfortable.\nOf the three schools listed above I believe that Sliammon would be most suitable for a married man. The wife of the former teacher acted as Field Matron and I believe received a small remuneration for her services. As you will realize I am very anxious to secure a married man for this location.\n\nIf you are single either Shalalth or Penticton would be suitable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nO.C. to Mr. B.F. Neary.\nMr. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI had an interview with Mr. MacKinnon a few days ago with regard to the vacancies for teachers in some of the schools in the N.W. territories. Mr. MacKinnon obtained full particulars regarding my qualifications, and also examined original copies of school reports. He asked me to write to you, and he particularly mentioned the school at Fort McPherson in case that position is not filled.\n\nPlease inform me as to the amount of salary paid to experienced teachers, and also the additional amount supplied for living allowance. I presume\nthere would not be much difficulty about obtaining supplies.\n\nAs the cost of transportation to the northern points would be considerable, I assume that transportation would be provided each way for the person, and also for any personal goods necessary. In the latter case, there would likely be a weight limit, if sent by air. Kindly give full information on these, and any other points I may have missed.\n\nIf necessary to fill an application form, please send one to me at above address.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Edgar\n29 Alfred St., Brantford, Ont.\nMay 10, 1948.\n\nCol. A.S. Neary\nDept. of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI dropped in to see Col. Randal at the Indian Office here, and it is at his suggestion that I am writing you to inquire into the possibility of securing employment in your department.\n\nI am a member of the Six Nations here and from 1937-41 I was on the teaching staff of the Reserve, holding an Ontario first class teacher's certificate.\n\nIn 1941 I joined the R.C.A.F. and served at home and overseas until 1945. On being discharged I enrolled under D.V.A. at McMaster University, Hamilton, taking a Pass History option. If all goes well...\nI shall graduate with a B.A. degree this spring.\n\nI expect to go back to teaching but before making any arrangements I thought it might be worthwhile to contact your department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHarold V. English.\nMay 28, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. English:\n\nI have not answered your letter of May 10. I purposely delayed answering in the hope that I would meet you at Brantford at the School Sport Day on May 24.\n\nHowever, as we did not notice you there, I would like to forward you one of our standard application forms for completion.\n\nI presume from the tone of your letter that you are rather more interested in an administrative position than actually in teaching. However, you can clarify this point in your answering letter.\n\nI note that you hold a first class teacher's certificate and have had three or four years' experience. On our new Teachers' Salary Schedule this would entitle you to a starting salary of either $166 or $174 a teaching month.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

He seems to be quite happy there and his only worry is that he be given an opportunity of visiting his parents on Hudson Bay this year. I am taking this matter up with the Indian Health Service to see if this can be arranged.\n\nI am writing to our local Agent with regard to your letter and plan about the Pickerel school. Our big problem there is that undoubtedly the Indian Affairs Committee is going to recommend that we do not in future build separate Indian schools where Provincial schools are available. This is, of course, confidential as yet but the tendency is to have the Indian children educated as much as possible along with whites with whom they are going to have to live in future years. However, each situation has to be considered as a separate problem and we will certainly do what we can at Pickerel.\n\nWe have just had our new salary schedule approved by Treasury Board. Teachers with second class certificates will have a range of from $1,440. to $1,920. Teachers with first class certificates will have a range\nof from $1,500. to $2,220. If you run across any Catholic teachers who are interested in teaching Indians, either in Ontario or in the West, I would be only too glad to have you give them my address so that I can send them application forms.\n\nWe are particularly short of Catholic teachers in British Columbia and are only too glad to have teachers with certificates granted by such a fine province as Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Beaudry,\n\nOur visiting teacher Mrs. O'Grady who taught Harry Whiskeychum at the General Hospital in Toronto had a letter from him yesterday, the first she received since he went to Spanish School. He wrote and said he told her how much he enjoyed the school already. I thought you should know his reaction.\n\nI visited the Peepesh Indian School (Lower French Reserve). Please see my report which I will submit today to the Dept. of Education Toronto. The old shack is being used for a school for more than 3 years and should be replaced. These will always be Indians familiarized and they should always have a little school of their own. Merging them with the whites in the public school will not benefit them. Hence couldn't a neat little school be built with a kitchen and sitting room be built? Plenty of unused lumber at your disposal here. Do please do what you can. Father Porcheron is doing nothing less than to save to rebuild it near the present school.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJ.M. Bennett\n38 Patterson St.,\nCampbellton, N.B.\nMay 29, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F.

We now have a vacancy which I think will interest you.\n\nDuring last winter we completed a new two-room school on the St. Regis Reserve, near Cornwall. This school is completely modern in every way and attached to it is a comfortable teachers' cottage with two bedrooms, living room, kitchen and inside toilet and shower. We are installing an oil-burning range in the teachers' quarters.\n\nThe whole building is on a full cement basement and is heated with a hot air furnace. The attached picture does not do justice to the building as it was taken on a wet and cloudy day when I recently visited the school, then under construction. As I told you in my letter of May 26, your salary there would be \u00a3174.00 a teaching month. The second teacher will be Miss Francis, an Indian girl who is a graduate of the Valleyfield Normal School. She has a very pleasant personality and is a good primary teacher. The Priest is Reverend Father Jacobs, S.J., also an Iroquois Indian. He has a very fine reputation and has done a great deal for the Indians at St. Regis.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Superintendent, Cornwall, Ont. If there are any other details about the school which you would like to have, I would\n\nMiss R. M. Comeau,\n33 Patterson Avenue,\nCampbellton, New Brunswick.\nask you to write directly to him. When you are satisfied concerning all aspects, please write to me advising me of your decision in regard to this appointment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 17, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. English:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 14 concerning employment in our Educational Division.\n\nWhilst teaching appointments in Indian day schools are handled by the Department, appointments to the Educational Division are in the hands of the Civil Service Commission. At the present time we do not have any vacancies in the Division but there is always a possibility that such vacancies will occur in the future. Naturally, I am not in a position to make any definite statements about employment in the Indian Affairs Branch. However, I am sending a copy of your letter and application for employment form to the Civil Service Commission. If, in the meantime, you are interested in a position in one of our day schools, I would ask you to either write Colonel Randle or contact me directly. In our new salary schedule, with your experience and qualifications, you would be entitled to a starting salary of $185.00 a teaching month.

Reid,\nCivil Service Commission,\nJackson Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEmil.\nJune 17, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Driscoll:\n\nReaders for Grade 4.\n\nYou will recall my previous discussion with you advising that the Provincial Departments of Education had not yet been able to agree upon a Reader for use in Grade 4 in the various provinces.\n\nWhile they all have agreed upon the Basic Readers for use in Grades 1, 2 and 3, there is some difference of opinion concerning the reader for Grade 4. You will recall that the Reader formerly used was the Highroad Reader (called the Treasury Reader in Ontario). Because we were aware of the fact that these Highroad Readers were about to be discontinued by the Provinces, we have hesitated to ask you to stock them.\n\nWe have today received the list of prescribed text books issued by the Province of British Columbia. This Province has decided to adopt as its authorized Reader for Grade 4 a book entitled \"Young Explorer\". This text is one of the Canadian Parade Readers and is published by J.M. Dent and Sons, Toronto.\n\nI would, therefore, ask you to place in stock the following quantities of this new Reader:\n\n300 copies \"Young Explorer\"\n50 \" Teachers' Manual \"Teaching Reading Today\".\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Unfortunately this Administration has no other school for which you could be considered.\n\nHowever, we have discussed your case with Col. B.F.

Murphy,\nTeacher of Swamp Island Reserve for the past three years.\nJuly 15, 1948.\n\nDear Mrs. Murphy:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 9. At the present time we have two vacancies for Roman Catholic teachers in Ontario. There are none of which we are aware in the Maritimes.\n\nBoth the above mentioned vacancies are on Manitoulin Island. One is at a one-room school with attached teacher's quarters, at Rabbit Island, near Wikwemikong. This is in a rather isolated part of the country but the school is comfortable and clean. The attached teacher's quarters are adequate and quite well furnished. There are some thirty (30) odd children in grades one to eight.\n\nThe second position vacant is that of a senior teacher at the two-room West Bay Indian Day School. This school is near Mindanoya, on Manitoulin Island and is more accessible than the first mentioned. However, the teachers' quarters are not as comfortable nor as warm as the first mentioned school. The other teacher is a Miss Bruyere, who taught in this school last year.\n\nThe difficulty in both these instances is, of course, that we cannot pay your transportation. You are also aware of the fact that present regulations make it very difficult for us to employ anyone who has reached the age of 65. Therefore, we could offer you such a school for the 1948-49\n\nMrs. L. Murphy,\nPort Hill, P. E.

In the case of Mr. H. R. Lambert a copy of the letter submitted with the application is also forwarded. It may be that you can accommodate some of these applicants in the schools under your direction.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\n49 Westbrook Crescent,\nNew Barnet,\nHertfordshire, England.\n\n3rd July, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMany thanks for your encouraging letter of 12th June. Thank you also for the duplicate application form which I have completed and returned herewith, and for the admirable handbook on the Territories which I received by the same mail.\n\nI am extremely sorry to hear that all your school appointments for the ensuing year have been made. Does this mean that there is definitely no chance of my commencing work in the Territories before September of next year? That there is no possible chance of an unexpected vacancy occurring before then? If not, would you kindly consider me for an appointment by next May? I am quite prepared to wait, and continue in my present position until required. My authority requires three months' notice of termination, will you kindly bear this in mind? Also, that while I am at present teaching in a Primary School (age range of 9 to 11 years), I am qualified to teach all grades, besides having some considerable experience with adult and further education? Thus I am at your disposal for any appointment you may require me to fill. I would, however, beg one favour if possible. I am a very keen amateur anthropologist, and would deem it a very great favour if I could be appointed to either an Indian or Eskimo school. To that end, I wonder if it would be possible to borrow a textbook on Eskimo from the Department (there isn't one listed in the bibliography of the handbook) or failing that, a copy of the system of syllabic writing used by the Eskimos of the Eastern Arctic. However, if you can only offer an appointment in a non-native or mixed school, it doesn't really matter, the children come first, whether they are white, African, Indian or Eskimo.\n\nMy religious denomination is Church of England, and while I lay no claim to being a theological expert, I am a sincere believer in religious instruction. I shall endeavour to attend as many Ministry of Education Courses as I can before leaving England. I am attending one in September in methods employed in teaching su-\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN DAY SCHOOLS OPERATED BY THE DEPT.

There was a one-room high school at which he was Principal. He served in the School District of Tamarisk which operates a two-room school from 1924 to 1926. In 1930 he became Principal of a four-room graded school. Since then he has been with the Winnipeg School Board as a substitute teacher.\n\nDuring his period of service Mr. Emerson has had an excellent record. Extracts from Inspector's reports are as follows:\n\n\"He has done work of a very high order.\"\n\"An excellent disciplinarian.\"\n\"Personality impressive and pleasant.\"\n\"A faithful teacher doing good work.\"\n\"Steady, capable, efficient.\"\nOf his work in Winnipeg Mr. H.

Naturally, I was thinking\nof our talk in Quebec about a Supervising Principal\nand, of course, one or two years of High School on\nthe Reserve to eliminate this terrific and increas-\ning cost of sending our children out.\n\nWhile Damasse is not familiar with\nour educational set-up, he expressed great interest\nin our plan and a desire to enter our service at\nSt. Regis.\n\nWhile no commitments were made, I am\nwondering if you feel it advisable for me to keep\nin contact with this young man with a view to\nobtaining, if possible, his services in the fall\nof 1949.\n\nKindest personal regards.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Clark\nSurvey Officer for Indian Education\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am interested in the possibility of an Indian Residential School being opened at McMurray. I thought I would try to locate you as I wish to find out if there would be any chance for me to get employment there.\n\nI have had a letter from Mr. Gordonham, but at that time he did not know what would be done about it as yet.\n\nI usually do office work, however, I have supervised in two rural schools. Last fall I taught grades 1 and 2 in the Edmonton Residential School and liked the children especially those I had in my room very much. I only stayed there two months because of other matters in the school which made it so that no one could stay there that could get much of a job elsewhere.\n\nHave you ever tried to open a non-sectarian school? I would be interested in the 1st and 2nd grades also as matron. I mean teach 1 and 2 and act as matron.\n\nI am middle aged and have taught in daily Vacation Bible School. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. Thank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Barbara Black\nOttawa, August 23, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Block:\n\nYour letter of August 3rd was delayed in handling as it was inadvertently directed to the High Commissioner for India.\n\nFrom your brief experience at Edmonton, you would know that our Residential Schools and some of our day schools have a denominational relationship.

Brown,\nWindsor, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I am interested in Indians, I have been following the various newspaper articles.\n\nI have made enquiry about the possibility of an Indian Residential School being opened at McKerray. However, Mr. Robertson of Winterburn told me he did not think anything would come of it.\n\nAre there no barracks along the Highway to Whitehorse or at Whitehorse that could be used for a Residential School?\n\nI am interested in a non-sectarian Residential School. I would like an opportunity to run one. I have had experience in work in daily Vacation Bible School when I was quite young.\n\nOther experience has been office clerk, bookkeeper at Smoky Lake Hospital and receptionist to the doctor-superintendent, (Dr. A. Dobson, whom I have a recommendation from). I have been a correspondent supervisor in two rural schools and taught grades 1, 2 and three in an Indian Residential School for two months. Under this school's system they are unable to keep a staff.\n\nI would like to teach the lower grades myself and have qualified teacher or teachers, depending on number of children.\n\nMy experience in Residential School was that I had seats for 57 children and had, I believe, 67, this making two to one small seat in some cases.\nI can also sew and do housework quite well. I have had some hospital training some time ago.\n\nWould the Government foster such a school and furnish beds, bedding, etc., from war assets and have it run on the order of other Residential Schools or like what they had in mind in regard to McMurray.\n\nI am 40, single, neat and have good character.\n\nPlease let me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) Gertrude Block.\nSeptember 20, 1948.\n\nMiss Gertrude Block,\n10251 - 106th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Miss Block:\n\nYour letter to Mr. Don F.

If the application is sent in with part of Section VII left blank, we will inform you of the salary you would receive in our service).\n\nAugust 20, 1948 (date)\n\nPatricia Ann Darling (Signature)\nOntario (Address)\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nSince you stated in your letter of August 10 that you could not send a single girl of my age into those areas mentioned if you had positions vacant in a two-room school where my friend could teach, it would be a suitable arrangement. If such is the case, shall send any further information and references necessary. The friend of which I spoke has eight Upper School subjects and I have nine Upper School subjects.\n\nSincerely yours,\nPatricia Dooling.\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter. We were away on vacation for two weeks and have just returned. Therefore, I suppose the vacancy you referred to has already been filled, so I did not fill in the application.\n\nI would not care to go as far north as Chapleau. The position at Wallaceburg would interest me if there were living quarters large enough to accommodate my husband and two boys. Also, we would be satisfied to rent a place near there if one could be obtained; as you said Miss McLean also used the residence.\n\nI have a permanent second class certificate, all my upper school subjects and two summer courses in Home Economics. I have taught seven years in Indian schools and four in Public schools. What salary would I receive with these qualifications?\n\nIf this position is filled, I would like to hear from you as early as possible next year as I will be available then and would have more time to prepare for the work.\n\nThanking you\u2014Yours respectfully,\n\nBertha W. Anderson\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nEducational Division\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nShirley Koon\nP.O. #2\nPort Lambton, Ontario\n\nSir:\n\nWhile vacationing near Walpole Island this year, I was led to understand that, due to the shortage of teachers for the Indian schools of Walpole Island, high school graduates are being allowed to teach lower grades.\n\nThis fact interested me greatly because, besides having a great interest in missionary work done among the Indians, I have always wanted to teach\u2014even though I was not able to attend college. This desire has led to teaching a Sunday school class at my church, and I seem able to make friends with and hold the respect of...\nAlthough I spend a great deal of my spare time in this, my mother's home country; I am an American citizen. I graduated from Cass Technical High School, of Detroit, Michigan, in January, 1947. I feel that my grades were high enough to continue my schooling, if that were necessary.\n\nWill you please send me any information that you have, regarding the qualifications of an applicant for such a position?\n\nI would appreciate your sending said information to me at the following address, where I shall be after October 1st.\n\n5017 Trumbull Avenue\nDetroit 16, Michigan\n\nSincerely,\n\nShirley W. Kroon\nFenton, Manitoba\nOctober 7, 1948.\n\nColonel Henry,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nBank St., Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Henry:\n\nMrs. Beaver, who was teaching at the Brandon Sanatorium suggested that I write to you about my desire to find an opening as Welfare Teacher. I sent a tentative application to Miller Bay Hospital as they had advertised for a handicraft worker. I thought this might include teaching but Dr. Selbrand informs me that they have two teachers but need someone to open an occupational therapy dept. He also sent me a civil service form which I completed.\nand returned but there has been no definite arrangement. Having heard that there might be an opening for a teacher at North Battleford I sought several like further information. I have my second class teacher's certificate and taught in a Rural School for a year (undated) then became a patient at Pinette Sanatorium where I wrote off most of my grades etc., and became interested in handicrafts. Since then I have had 18 months experience in bookkeeping and general office work in a small town office. The owner was a local pioneer of integrity and kindness and the Indians often came in for advice or a chat. I worked for 6 months in the local Municipal Office where the Indians came for predator bounty and the Town was a pioneer interested in their welfare. The Indians\nor mostly the girls and women can be around to sell baskets &c. We ask for clothing. My interest has been increasing and I wondered if I could be of service. I am 38, single, and belong to the United Church.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or suggestions.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBlodger S. [Last Name]\nOctober 15, 1948.\n\nDear Mrs. Anderson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of September 26, which arrived here when I was absent from Ottawa, inspecting schools in Manitoba.\n\nI note that you would not care to go as far north as Chapleau. The position at Walpole Island has been filled, temporarily. Unfortunately, the living quarters would not be large enough to accommodate your husband and two boys. However, there is a possibility of renting a house near the school. I am attaching one of our standard application forms which I would like you to complete and return here, if you are further interested in the possibility of a vacancy occurring at Walpole Island.\n\nIt is noted that you have a second class certificate and that you have taught 7 years in Indian schools and 4 years in provincial schools. In view of the fact that you have attended two summer school courses, you would be entitled to classification as a Grade II teacher at a salary of $195.00 a teaching month.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. R. J. Stallwood, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Walpole Island, so that he will be aware of the fact that you are interested in teaching in this school either this year or next year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard T. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMrs. Bertha W. Anderson,\nBox 49, Willshire, Ohio, U.S.A.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Stallwood\nOctober 15, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Kross:\n\nYour letter arrived here when I was absent on an inspection trip of our schools in Manitoba.\n\nAt the present time we have been able to place qualified teachers in our schools on Walpole Island. There is a possibility we might have to use non-qualified teachers elsewhere in Ontario. However, it is our policy to hire qualified teachers wherever and whenever possible. Please find attached one of our standard application forms which I should like you to complete and return directly to me.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMiss Shirley M. Kross,\n3017 Trumbull Avenue,\nDetroit 16, Mich., U.S.A.\nOctober 15, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Methven:\n\nI have received your letter of October 7 and note that you are interested in teaching in one of our Indian Hospital Schools. We already have an applicant in mind for the North Battleford Hospital School.\n\nIf you are interested in teaching in one of our Indian day schools in Manitoba, we have two vacancies which might interest you. I would suggest that you arrange to interview Mr. R. S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Post Office Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba. I am sending him a copy of this letter so that he can anticipate hearing from you.\n\nI am also sending you, attached hereto, one of our application forms which I would like you to complete and return directly here. I feel certain that we will be able to use your services in either a hospital or a day school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMiss Gladys I. Methven,\nKensington,\nManitoba.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. R. S. Davis\n\n[Handwritten note]\nNHR/2M\n331 South Brodie St.\nWilliam, Ont.\nA.M.\n\nDear Mr. Henry,\n\nI have, on the date received your letter of August 3rd, it had been overlooked at my home near Kennewick.\n\nRegret, my family hadn't forwarded your letter here earlier.\n\nBefore I left Ottawa I tried to contact you by phone but was not able to do so on those two occasions. When I haven't heard from you I presumed the case was closed.\n\nI have signed my contract here at St Patrick's High School for this year. I would not change now as I enjoy the work here very much because I am seeing my business training in commercial subjects I fell to teach.\n\nWould you retain my name for an opening next year?\nI would have taken Edmonton had I been free to do so at that time but hope to be able to again have an opportunity with your department. Should you have an occasion to visit Fort William I would be pleased to have you give a lesson to my class in Sign Language.\n\nVery truly,\n\n(Miss) Anne Fitzmaurice.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have heard from Mr. Smith that you had a position opened for a teacher in a reservation school but I was unable to attend another permit meeting in the province of Manitoba. I am unable to obtain another permit.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\n\n---\n\nOctober 8, 1913\n\nColonel Adam\n\nSchool Office Box\n\nManitoba\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have heard from Mr. Smith that you had a position opened for a teacher in a reservation school but I was unable to attend another permit meeting in the province of Manitoba. I am unable to obtain another permit.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nOctober 25, 1948.\n\nMiss Lee Lafroniere,\nBox 13, Somerset, Manitoba.\n\nDear Miss Lafroniere,-\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 6. Unfortunately, a qualified teacher has now applied for the vacancy in the school at the Brandon Hospital. Therefore, I have written to Mr. Davis today and I understand he will be interviewing her shortly and describing her duties to her.\n\nPlease find attached one of our standard application forms, which I would like to have you complete and return here as soon as possible. We have two vacancies for Catholic day school teachers at present,\n\n(1) in the senior room of the East Bay Indian Day School near Little Current, Manitoulin Island,\n\n(2) we anticipate a vacancy in the Seine River Indian Day School at Christians. It is very likely that the teacher there will be transferred to another school. This is a one-room school whereas the East Bay School is a two-room school.\n\nIf you are interested in a position immediately, I would like to recommend the two-room school to you. Our present junior teacher is Miss Brugger and I am sure you will find her pleasant company in sharing the accommodation provided. Your starting salary would be at the rate of $108.00 a month plus free house, fuel and light.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy to Mr. Davis & to Mr. Lecky\n\nRema P.

We are in civilization and already tired of it. So I am asking you what would be the best position you could offer to both of us in the Indian Dept. Will Manitoba be opened off year or would you have something else for us as Indians? That may be.\n\nI would consider it a great favor on your part Colonel Neary if you could advise me what we could fill in the Indian Dept. If it is not too much trouble.\nto let me know about the Manitoulin Affair or whatever you could have on hand.\n\nThinking you Freeman,\nYours very truly,\n\nAmelie Blackburn.\nto let me know about the Mantlekin Affair or whatever you could have on hand.\n\nThanking you & remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAmelie Blackburn.\nFort Frances, Ont., November 8, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 1-1-1 X (E)\n\nWith reference to your letter addressed to Miss E. Lafreniere, Summerset, Manitoba, in connection with a vacancy at the Seine River Day School, I wish to advise that this is not a desirable location for a lady teacher, and if one was engaged I doubt very much that she would stay for any length of time.\n\nJ. F. Lockhart,\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nNovember 16, 1948.\n\nMrs. Annette Blackburn,\nSt. Norbert, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mrs. Blackburn:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 3, which arrived when I was absent from the office. You will recall that we discussed the school at Chenaal, near Cornwall, when you visited here. Unfortunately, we can no longer offer you this position as the Sisters of Saint Ann have agreed to take over the teaching duties at this school effective 1 September, 1949.\n\nWe have also interested a married teacher in the Lakesview Indian Day School, on Manitoulin Island.\n\nHowever, we are completing other schools at which we will require Catholic teachers, especially in the Northwest Territories.

They thought it would not be long before they could find me an opening in Winnipeg in a Sanatorium however I am still interested in the Indian children and especially in teenage classes whatever their\ngrade might be an school.\n\nI have no references as I was retired at Turtle Plains before I found out I had to take a test for S.S.

My interests are and have always been the Canadian Indian and his problems. My duties here have included field trips to the Blackfeet of Alberta, and various archaeological expeditions in Ontario, as well as the care of the ethnological and archaeological collections in the Museum. Needless to say, such work has involved a rather competent knowledge of the history of the Indians of Canada and their condition. I have not been by any means as directly involved or concerned with the Museum material pertaining to non-Canadian peoples.\n\nI point out these facts by way of indicating something of my qualifications. However, it is necessary for your information to add that I graduated in Arts from the University of Toronto, and later took a Master of Arts degree from the same institution in Anthropology and History. A year's work in the graduate school at the University of Chicago again in Anthropology largely completes the record of academic work covered. Professional training involved the obtaining of a Secondary School Teachers' certificate from the Ontario College of Education.\n\nMy interests are clearly in education and the Canadian Indian. I do not feel that my present work has sufficient social value, and therefore desire to engage in that which has more direct application, such as your office is performing.\n\nIf you feel that I could be of service, and that more information is desirable, please let me know, and\nif an interview is indicated, I shall be more than happy to arrange for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKenneth E.

We are complete as to staff at the present time but there may be new positions created in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, day school teachers are appointed directly by the Department and we anticipate a number of vacancies at the end of this academic year.\n\nIn any event, I am sending you one of our standard teacher's application forms so that we may have more complete information on your qualifications and experience.\n\nThanking you for your interest, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Unfortunately, our Education Division operates few secondary schools. It is our policy to send Indian pupils, where at all possible, to high schools operated by municipal and district school boards. Our salary schedule at present in force is as follows:\n\nTeachers with first class certificates - $1500 - $2200.\n\" second \" \" - 1440 - 1920.\n\nThis scale has been recommended for amendment upwards in view of the recent salary increases given to Dominion Civil Servants.\n\nIn addition to the above, we offer free house, fuel and light in most of our day schools.\n\nI will expect to hear further from you concerning your interest in Indian education and can possibly arrange to have you interviewed by one of our officials in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This is my third year of teaching in Manitoba on permit. Per usual my permit expires in June. To enable me to teach again in this province I would be compelled to take my Normal training. However my desire to teach in an Indian school is very strong. I believe experience to be the best teacher.\n\nAny references can be secured from the inspectors in whose divisions I have been working.\n\nIf there is no chance of my obtaining a position with the Dept. of National Health, please let me know as it would enable me to make plans for the future. Sincerely,\n\nMargaret Tukedell\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAttached is a self-explanatory letter from a girl whose family were old patients of mine, when I practised in northern Manitoba.

M. Bennett, Esq., M.A., Ph.D.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Avenue,\nToronto 6, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Bennett:\n\nI have for answer your recent letter with regard to your son John. I discussed possibilities for his employment with Mr. Phelan and we have concluded that there are three possibilities:\n\n(a) In the Administrative or Agencies Division.\n\n(b) As a teacher in one of our Indian day schools.\n\n(c) As an applicant for the position of Supervisor of Health and Physical Education, shortly to be advertised by the Civil Service Commission.\n\nI gather from previous conversations that Course (b) above holds no interest for your son. Course (a) would of course mean that he will have to keep a careful eye open for Civil Service competition announcements for Assistant Indian Agents, etc.\n\nCourse (c) concerns the position which we hope that the Civil Service Commission will establish for our Education Division here. Of course the difficulty here is that we are requesting an applicant with teaching experience and also with some administrative experience.\n\nYou will also probably know that in this, as in other competitions, the Civil Service Commission is\nrequired by Statute to give preference to overseas veterans.\n\nHowever, if John wants immediate employment, we are looking for a young male teacher for the Seine River Indian Day School, in the Fort Frances Agency. We transferred the teacher formerly at this school to Hay River, Northwest Territories, after the Christmas holidays. So far we have only been able to interest women applicants, and our Indian Superintendent feels that a young man is required, due to the relative isolation of the school. We are advertising for applicants for this position now and you will probably see our advertisement in the next issue of the Ensign.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

She has completed just over one year of teaching in my inspectorial division.\n\nMiss Tweddell is a well mannered young lady with a very pleasing personality, - one who is well suited for teaching. In the performance of her work she has always applied herself with industry and sincerity. She has won the co-operation and respect of the students under her control. During her teaching she has had a very orderly class room and in the management and organization of her classes she has been very successful.\n\nBecause of Miss Tweddell's fine character, her ability to do good and cheerful work, and her sincerity of purpose, I take pleasure in presenting this reference.\n\nSHOAL LAKE, Man.,\nFebruary 5th, 1949\n\nR.W.

Kohler, Certificated Teacher,\n\nPlease find attached an application form which has been received here, as completed by Mr. Kohler. Mr. Kohler previously taught at the Berens River United Church Indian Day School for the period 1 September, 1945, to June 1, 1946. This was due to the fact that his wife became ill and it was necessary to move to Winnipeg so that she could get proper medical attention.\n\nWe do not seem to have any reference to Mr. Kohler since that time. We have had so many teachers' applications lately that I cannot recall for which school Mr. Kohler is making particular application. Unfortunately, he does not indicate on the attached employment form the school in which he is particularly interested. Your comments would therefore be appreciated and if you have no knowledge of this teacher, could you please phone Mr. Peck.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHoward L.

I feel it is important that such personal contact be made before we can further consider Mr. Mackie's application. Would you return his form when an interview has been arranged. I am writing to Mr. Mackie to tell him that one of our officials will interview him and that he will be advised by letter when this is to be done.\n\nBernard F.

I understand that we intend to ask for authority to employ supervisors or buildings in the various regions but I do not believe that we will be able to ask for salaries approaching those mentioned by you. However, I would welcome an opportunity of discussing this matter with you when you return to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nRe: C. Connolly, Indian Health Services\n\nThe attached is a self-explanatory letter, and I am rather puzzled as to how it should be answered. I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether Dr. Moore has ever discussed this situation with you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nJust a few lines to say that I am considering leaving the employ of the Indian Health Division shortly if I get a suitable offer from another source. As there was some work done by my staff at Nelson House last summer for your Branch I was wondering if all the matters had been settled. There may have been some items that I should take up for you with the North American Building Company that might have arisen since the erection and completion of that unit. Any assistance that I may be able to give you in this respect, I would be happy to do so.\n\nYou maybe surprised at the enclosed copy of a letter that I have recently sent the Director. However I have been wanting to get settled since a year now and have had no definite promise of what I might expect. So now that I have some definite marital plans, I have to settle the livelihood arrangements.\n\nIf you know of some Government opening that can use my talents, I would be grateful for the advice. I know that there are several places were I could do a lot of useful work if given a free hand. But the trouble is that I don't think the Department of the Government would pay $6000 salary. Or share $7500 with another Department, for joint employment.\n\nYou will be interested to know that we have almost completed the repairs of this Hospital. I hope that early next month to write the Director and tell him that the job is completed. He should leave me here to build a new Hospital while I have the swing of the construction crew.\n\nRegards to all especially Miss Walton. Best wishes to yourself.\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.H. & W. 196M-11-47 P. 110\nJanuary 16, 1949.\n\nDear Doctor Moore:\n\nOnce a year it is good business to take stock of one's affairs. I have come to the conclusion that I might cease to be employed with the Indian Health Service for the following reasons:\n\n1. No permanency of employment has been established for my position. This matter was discussed in a letter to you more than a year ago. Since then I have completed a competition application under Engineer Grade II advertisement. That was about ten months ago and I have not yet been advised of the results. Recently I have discussed this same subject with you and have been awaiting further information.\n\n2. This position offers a very poor salary for the responsibilities involved. A competitive position in Civil Service as chief engineer for Penitentiaries offered $6000 salary in a competition advertised last year. I referred this advertisement to Doctor Procter when discussing permanency and salary last May. Large civilian companies offer experienced superintendents higher salaries than I am paid plus a bonus from the company's profits. There is no incentive to carry on at the present salary.\n\n3. The present occupation is such that it is impossible to establish a home. It is equally unsatisfactory to supervise the scope of this work except from a central office.\n\n4. Further, it is impossible to supervise this work from headquarters office without competent and trustworthy representatives in the field who know the details of construction and maintenance.\n\nIn view of the above matters I may consider terminating my employment in this Service at the end of this fiscal year, unless a satisfactory adjustment of these conditions have been made. In the meantime I consider myself free to make enquiries about other employment in or out of Government Departments.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nThe Director, Indian Health Services,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI.

I graduated with full grammatical and practical knowledge of both English\nand French, having completed the usual mathematical and classical studies leading to a B.A.\n\nIn September of the same year, I taught at Rayola High School until the Christmas holidays.

I would not recommend to you further consideration of the position advertised in \"The Ensign\".\n\nThe school mentioned is at Seine River, near Fort Frances, and the teacher's residence is very small and could not accommodate your family and yourself. I am sending you an application form for completion so that we will have your qualifications on file. It is unfortunate that you do not hold a teacher's certificate granted by a Provincial Department of Education as this makes you ineligible for classification as a Grade Two or Grade Three Teacher. Naturally, the salaries offered to Grade One (unqualified) teachers are much lower than those offered to Grade Two and Grade Three teachers.\n\nI will expect to hear further from you with the attached application form and in the meantime will review the possibilities of employing you at one of our schools in which we anticipate a vacancy next June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

It is interesting and well written, but it deals mainly with the personalities of the Indians met by Mrs. Thornton in her travels as an artist among them. While these verbal descriptions of the Indians and their surroundings are informative and accurate, I doubt the value of the manuscript as a textbook or even as a reference book in our schools.\n\nThe vocabulary is such that I doubt if it would hold the interest of any but Indian boys and girls in the senior grades. Therefore, I feel that we could only recommend the purchase of about 250 copies for use as library books.

I have today received an application from Mr. B. Philip Belyea, P.O. Box 44, Sudbury, New Brunswick. Mr. Belyea taught during the 1947-48 academic year at the Sioux Lookout Residential School and has a Second Class Teaching Certificate for the Province of New Brunswick. He visited me en route to attending the University of New Brunswick and he is very interested in teaching in a seasonal school this year. He is an Anglican, 20 years of age and should be a good prospect for your consideration.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Belyea\nMarch 5, 1949.\n\nMiss Mae Chisholm,\nWest Bay,\nInverness Co., N. S.\n\nDear Miss Chisholm:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 28, with attached application form.\n\nI will be glad to receive your Inspector's reports and will return them to you immediately the necessary information has been obtained. With a First Class Permanent Teacher's Certificate, two years of experience in Indian schools and five years of experience in provincial schools, you would be entitled to classification on our salary schedule as a Grade Two teacher at a salary of $192.00 a teaching month.\n\nPlease note that you have only been allowed five years' credit for provincial experience as this is the maximum allowed for teaching service outside our Indian schools.\n\nThe above salary is subject to upward revision as our schedule is now being reviewed in line with recent increases given to other civil servants. Would you be prepared to teach in the province of Ontario in the event that we do not have a vacancy in Quebec.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

My religion is Church of England.\n\nI would like some information about the possibility of securing a principalship of such a school and what might be expected in the way of salary. I would be willing to wait some time for a suitable opportunity to present itself as I can secure employment temporarily in other schools, but I feel I would not be making use of my degree in agriculture.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nG.

Their salaries would be at an approximate basic rate of $150.00 per month plus an extra amount in lieu of transportation expenses. In other words, we allow more for the isolated schools which require a larger expenditure of funds on the part of the student in reaching them. I hope this will be satisfactory and that I will hear further from both of them. They can address the application forms directly to me if they are interested.\n\nI wish to thank you very much for the reprints of the annual bibliographies and you can rest assured that they will come in useful in the months to come.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P.

We anticipate a number of vacancies in Manitoba but cannot at the present time advise you as to their location. I am afraid that you may have to take a rather isolated school for the first year as most of the more accessible schools are filled by teachers with some years of experience in our work. I would therefore like to hear from you as to whether you would accept such a position on the understanding that we would move you to a more accessible school when such a vacancy occurred.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 10, 1949.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nMiss M. Omal Smith,\n\nThe above teacher is presently employed at the Campbell River Indian Day School. She has requested a transfer to an Indian day school in Manitoba.\n\nShe is 45 years of age, holds a first class permanent teaching certificate for the province of Manitoba, and has had 14 years of provincial teaching experience and two years of Indian day school teaching experience.\n\nYou will find attached copy of a letter which I have written to her and it might be possible that she would consider the Nelson House School for next year. You may also be able to recommend another school nearer to her parents' home in Winnipeg.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard P. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 10, 1949.\n\nMiss Blanche McIntyre,\nBox 624,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nDear Miss McIntyre:\n\nFurther to our previous correspondence, I have now received a reply to my letter to our Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia. As you are probably aware, we employ one Catholic and one Protestant teacher normally at each Indian hospital school. At the present time Inspector Invey advises that he has a full complement of Protestant teachers but that he does require Catholic teachers for these hospital schools. Unless a vacancy occurs between now and the end of June, he does not expect to change any of the Protestant teachers in these hospital schools.\n\nHowever, would you consider a day school vacancy in that province on the understanding that you would be given an opportunity if and when a vacancy occurred in a hospital school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 10, 1949.\n\nMr. H. A. Blackwell,\n723 Temperance Street,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of March 2\nand was pleased to note your interest in one of our Indian\nschools.\n\nAs you are probably aware, Indian residential\nschools are operated for the Department by the various denominations. We do not employ either the Principals or the Teachers\nin them. If you are interested, therefore, in a position as\nPrincipal of an Anglican Residential School, I would suggest\nthat you write to\n\nReverend Canon H. G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIf, however, you are interested in a day school teaching position,\nI would be glad to hear further from you, when I can send an\napplication form. I wish to thank you for the interest shown\nin Indian education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Canon Cook\nMarch 10, 1949.\n\nMrs. Margaret R. Scott,\nMorrisburg, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Scott:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 7. Our seasonal schools operate normally from May to September and the salaries vary with the location of the school. With regard to our schools operated during the regular academic year, the salaries are based on a regular schedule. In your case you would be classified as a Grade 3 teacher at a starting salary of $180.00 a teaching month plus free house, fuel and light in most cases. Our salary schedule is at present under revision and we anticipate being able to offer better terms in the near future.\n\nWe follow the provincial course of study in our schools and will be pleased to provide any further information as required.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 11, 1949.\n\nMr. H. E. Brett,\n105 Maryland,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 3rd, 1949. I note from your application form that you are 65 years of age. I regret that due to Civil Service regulations, we are unable to employ anyone who has passed the age of 65 unless they are presently engaged in our teaching service.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 12, 1949.\n\nMr. Travis S. Morrison,\n212 Bloor Street West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of yesterday, I have just located your original letter on the Bay River School file. It arrived during my absence from the office and as we have been advertising for several schools, I was unaware of your interest in any one particularly.\n\nWith a first class teaching certificate and three years' experience, you would be entitled to a starting salary of $165.00 a teaching month, plus free house, fuel and light. If you are willing to teach for two years in the North, we are prepared to meet your travelling expenses. We have had several applicants for this position and you will certainly receive consideration when a decision is made. In the meantime, could you please advise how long it would take you to obtain a release from your present position to proceed North.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I would not recommend to you further consideration of the position advertised in \"The Ensign\".\n\nThe school mentioned is at Seine River, near Fort Frances, and the teacher's residence is very small and could not accommodate your family and yourself. I am sending you an application form for completion so that we will have your qualifications on file. It is unfortunate that you do not hold a teacher's certificate granted by a Provincial Department of Education as this makes you ineligible for classification as a Grade Two or Grade Three Teacher. Naturally, the salaries offered to Grade One (unqualified) teachers are much lower than those offered to Grade Two and Grade Three teachers.\n\nI will expect to hear further from you with the attached application form and in the meantime will review the possibilities of employing you at one of our schools in which we anticipate a vacancy next June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I would like to be assured of a position in an Indian Day School under your jurisdiction so that I can register for this Summer School.

Also I should like to know the salary I would be entitled to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) Blanche McFutty.\nATTENTION: Mr. B.F. Henry\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your letter of March 18th, your file 1-1-11 (E) and further to our telephone conversation this date, please note that Miss Comeau would not, I believe, be interested in teaching in a one-room school. I do not know what you have in mind for her in Maritimes but if there are no vacancies existing in any of your two-room schools there, it is suggested that consideration be given to placing her in some locality where you would have a two-room school. I do not think that Miss Comeau is concerned about the locality. We have found her to be a very capable teacher and no doubt she is desirous of giving her best which, as you knew, quite often can not be done in a one-room school where eight grades are being taught.\n\nPersonally, I hate to see Miss Comeau leaving. If we had some way whereby her services could be utilized to lessen Miss Kelly's burden at the Cornwall Island West School, I would be much more pleased. The strain of such a large class and teaching under difficulties which must be met with in our Indian schools is telling on Miss Kelly and I would not be surprised if we were to lose her services. At the present time there are some children in the last end who should be going to school but it would be an injustice to crowd such a small room with more children especially during winter months when we are heating without the benefit of a furnace. It might be just possible that, after giving this a little thought, some arrangement could be worked out whereby we could utilize Miss Comeau's services.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n3611\n\n30 Biscegatti Rd.,\nToronto, Ont.,\nMarch 23, 1949.\n\nEducational Supervisor,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should be interested in learning if any teaching position available in the Indian Schools.\n\nI am a graduate of the Ontario College of Education, and hold a High School Assistant Certificate.

I understand that you are the agent who administers the territory in which these schools are located, so I am writing to ask for some information concerning these schools.\n\nI am a qualified, experienced teacher, and have had a little experience in Indian work, as I taught in an Indian day school for a few weeks last summer. I have a friend, Mr. Sam Smith, who is also a teacher interested in Indian schools, and am also enquiring on his behalf. He is a married man, and his\nwife could also teach, if granted a permit.\n\nWe would like to know what the living conditions are like in the two places mentioned, including such things as the cost of living, and availability of supplies, and conditions of living quarters. How much would transportation into these cost? Approximately how many pupils are there in each of these schools? Also to what extent do the people, particularly the school children, speak English?

I have checked the monthly attendance registered and find that we will have to give consideration to opening a second classroom. Unfortunately, we do not have a sum in our Estimates for such a building. Is there a hall or house nearby in which a temporary classroom could be established for the 1949-50 academic year?

Our policy is, wherever possible, to hire only qualified and certificated teachers for these schools. You can appreciate the necessity of our adhering to this policy.\n\nThis means that the better schools (i.e., those closer to civilization) are occupied at the present time, and it is most unlikely that we will have vacancies in them.\n\nThis leaves the more isolated schools, and I would hesitate to send a married man with a family to most of these positions.

Christie,\nAlona, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Christie:\n\nYour application for employment in one of our Indian day schools has been forwarded here. Naturally, we are interested in your application, in view of your qualifications and experience. I am today writing to Mr. Provincial Supervisor Davis in Winnipeg requesting that he arrange to have one of his field superintendents interview you. Is there any particular school in which you are interested? I note that you know the Indians in the neighbourhood of the Bob and Flow Reserve.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nApril 1, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nMr. W.F. Christie\n\nWe have received an application for employment form completed by the above teacher. He is presently teaching at Alonsa, Manitoba. He is 22 years of age, Protestant, with a First Class Teacher Certificate and two years of experience. He has a fairly good knowledge of woodwork, metalwork, etc. He has had some considerable dealings with the Indians as he worked in his father's store. He has also travelled considerably with the doctor on the Bob and Flow Reserve.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter which I have written to him. I feel that he is a very likely prospect for one of our day schools in Manitoba and would like to have him interviewed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nApril 1, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

I will write to her directly, as you request, concerning her salary.\n\nI presume that you have mentioned her name to Dr. Best as being available for Norway House or Cross Lake next year. I will ask her to phone you or see you again when she gets my letter concerning her salary.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 1, 1949.\n\nMiss Margaret Tweddell,\nVista, Manitoba.\n\nDear Miss Tweddell:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Davis in Winnipeg indicating that he feels you would be quite acceptable as a teacher in one of our Indian day schools. I note that you are interested in one of our schools in the Norway House Superintendency.\n\nOur salary schedule is at present under revision, but on our present scale, we could offer you a starting salary as a Grade I teacher (with no certificate) of $114 a teaching month. If you obtain a certificate, naturally your salary would be much higher. When our schedule is revised, I feel we will also be able to make a more attractive offer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Her class in Physical Culture was highly praised by Col. Goo. Gillaspie at the time of the Cadet inspection.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending Miss Cuddy to any School Board. She is most conscientious in her work, is willing at any time to help students who have missed some of their work through absence and is willing to cooperate with the rest of the staff in every way.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) \"A.

Kearns,\n31 Le Chavrotiere St.,\nQuebec, P.Q.\n\nDear Mr. Kearns:\n\nI have received your letter of March 29, and I am pleased to note your continued interest in teaching in one of our Indian schools. I note that you are prepared to teach in a seasonal school and would advise that one vacancy exists at the present time. This is at the Bear Island Indian Seasonal School in the Huron Falls Agency, Ontario. The salary at this school will be higher than that at one of our standard day schools because the transportation expenses to these schools are normally fairly high.\n\nIf you are interested in further details of this position, please do not hesitate to write me at once. We may also have a vacancy in the West. Are you particularly concerned with teaching in the East or would you prefer a Catholic school in Western Canada?\n\nI would emphasize that these are definitely isolated schools to which we can not appoint qualified teachers at the present time due to the shortage thereof.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 4, 1949.\n\nMiss Margaret Kirby,\nBox 321, Essex, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Kirby:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 25 and note that you are not prepared to accept the position as teacher at the Cornwall Island East Indian Day School at the present time. I note that you are interested in a position for the 1st September.\n\nWhile we will have relatively few vacancies in Ontario this summer, we are building a number of new schools in Western Canada and are certain to have vacancies for Catholic teachers there. If you are interested in teaching in Saskatchewan or Alberta, I would be pleased to hear from you. I can then give you further details as to possible openings.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMoosonee, Ontario, March 31, 1949.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould it be possible that you require any teachers for your schools during the coming year.\n\nI am a qualified teacher, First Class Professional Certificate. My age is forty-five years and have had twenty years experience in teaching, the last three of which were spent teaching Indians at Moosonee Public School. Might say that I have some knowledge of the Cree Language.\n\nAt this time I might also state that I have a daughter, eighteen years of age, Junior Matriculation, who might be interested in teaching if you happened to have a school where you required two teachers. Might also state that this girl also has some knowledge of Cree, acquired while living at Moosonee and working in the Hudson Bay Store.\n\nMajor Clarke, your inspector, paid an unofficial visit to our school and I believe he could tell you anything you wish to know as to my ability as a teacher.\n\nI also have six years Canadian War Service in the Active Army.\n\nKindly let me know if there is anything which would be suitable for either myself or my daughter or both of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Fred D.

We are already in correspondence with another teacher over this position and I doubt, if it would be very attractive to you.\n\nThis is a one-room Indian Day School with elementary grades and quite isolated. The salary would be $180. a teaching month plus free house, fuel and light.\n\nThere may be a vacancy in Southern Ontario but this would also be an elementary school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I am prepared to go teaching and it does not matter how far West I go. You will understand this, as I am alone in Canada and do not need to be tied to one place by the bonds of relationship. As regards preference, I would prefer a school in Western Canada.\n\nI would like to get going as soon as possible so would appreciate an immediate reply. By the way, will you send costs from Ontario to wherever I go? If destroyed by your department, let me know please.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJohn M.

Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Indian School Administration is in need of information concerning the person named above who has applied for a position in one of our Indian Residential Schools. It has been suggested that you could help us in this connection and we would be greatly obliged if you would answer the questions on the attached form. In view of the urgency of the need, your early reply will be appreciated.\n\nThe success of our work depends on the quality of the workers we employ and it is essential, therefore, that we make as careful investigation as possible of every applicant before appointment. The work in our schools is of an unusual nature, calling for a high degree of character and capacity. Frequently it is necessary to live in an isolated community and always there is the problem of maintaining harmonious relationships with a small group of fellow-workers. The ability to control children, ranging in age from five to sixteen, with strength but unfailing patience and kindness is absolutely necessary.\n\nWe trust, therefore, that you will be as discriminating as possible in the applicant's own interests. Relatively few people are really suited for this class of work and we have had many failures. That you say will, of course, be treated with utmost confidence and in no circumstances made known to the applicant.\n\nThanking you for this valuable assistance, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nfor Superintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Department Letter No. 1-1-IX (E) dated February 24, 1949 enclosing T.D. 1 forms covering M.K. Brown and Ivan G. Clarke.\n\nThese men were employed on the Murray Hill School and their T.D. 1 forms were forwarded to the Income Tax Branch in Ottawa with the final returns.\n\nIt is now considered these copies should be retained at this office.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nApril 14, 1949.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nI can best answer your letter of enquiry concerning Mr. D.S. Pitts by sending you a copy of a letter which I sent last year to the Principal of the school at which he is now teaching.\n\nI hope that this will prove to be the information that you require.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon H.G. Cook,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM\nApril 1st, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Morrison:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your application form for employment in one of our schools.\n\nI note that you do not hold a Teaching Certificate but only a permit granted by a Provincial Department of Education.\n\nAt the present time all our seasonal and other schools are full but we may have some vacancies occurring this summer. None of these we expect to be in the Maritimes. Would you be interested in a position in Ontario or in one of the Western provinces?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Would you be interested in a position in Western Canada as it would seem unlikely that Catholic teachers will be wanted in Indian schools in other provinces next year.\n\nThere is a possibility of a vacancy in New Brunswick but this is uncertain as yet.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

It is recommended that Mr. Defronzo be given credit for the full month of September.

Bishop Lajeunesse was recently in my office and I discussed with him your interest in teaching in another of our Indian schools. Unfortunately, the school on Manitoulin Island is now filled and I cannot offer you this position.\n\nHowever, we have been building a number of schools down the MacKenzie River, and one of these might interest you. I am attaching two photographs of the school at Roche River, and all the other schools are identical. There are five in all and we have engaged teachers for two only, although we are negotiating with teachers for the other three.\n\nThe three for which teachers are required are Arctic Red River, Fort Good Hope and Fort Franklin. From the photographs you will note that there is a teacherage attached to each two room school. At certain months of the year, one teacher only will be required. At other periods of the year we will require two teachers. As these schools are situated in the North West Territories, a Northern Living Allowance is also provided in addition to salary. I presume that you will be interested as welfare teachers on a 12 months' basis rather than as day school teachers on a 10 months' basis.\nI would be pleased to hear from you as to your interest in one of these positions, and hope that you will consider one of them. Would you please return the photographs with your answering letter. I expect these schools to be ready for occupancy by October 1st, 1949.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n25th April, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F. Siebert,\nJorden Station,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDoctor Moore has referred to me your letter of April 18th.

Would you be interested in a full time school next September? We have a school in Northern Saskatchewan at Fond du Lac which might interest you. At present, the local missionary is teaching in the school and is endeavouring to keep it open.

I had to pass by Portage la Prairie this year, but you may be sure of seeing Mr. Doucet soon.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the application blank which you should complete and return to our Superintendent of Indian Education at this office. You might also address an enquiry to Dr. C.H. Best, 441 Somerset Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba. He conducts the central office for the United Church Missionary work in Manitoba and nominates teachers for Indian schools.\n\nIt is possible that Mrs. Loveys in Toronto has not yet been notified of the following vacancies in Manitoba which are likely to arise:\n\nRossville i.e., Norway House\nCross Lake #1\nOxford House #1\n\" #2\n\nThere are also seasonal schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario in which you might be interested, but they are as hard to reach as the schools I have mentioned above.\n\nFrom time to time, however, vacancies occur in non-Catholic schools that would not involve undue expense for you to reach, and so the obvious thing for you to do is to complete and return the accompanying application blank to this office. It might be advantageous also to let the Regional Supervisor in Winnipeg (Mr. R.S. Davis) know when your services will be available.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nBoy 1438,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nApr. 30th 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Clark,\n\nYou didn't pay us a visit this year but I trust you are still with the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, and interested in the education of our Indian boys and girls.\n\nHave you any openings in Indian Schools for teachers? I wish to make a change this year and have notified the Secretary of W.M.S. Toronto to this effect. Mrs. Dewey in replying has nothing to offer me in Missionary Schools. Though perhaps you might know of a Government School which would be available by the fall term. I would like to continue\nteaching the Indians and feel that I am now much better equipped to do so. A dozen or more of my former pupils (four of them from Portage) are attending Brandon High School and, the latest report from Mr MacNeill of Brandon School, are doing excellent work. It is really surprising, even to me, how well covered the year's work in the classroom with only half days and yet have them equipped to go on into High School work. I feel very strongly that they are very much worth while pupils and deserve equal chances with white children.\n\nIf a suitable opening occurs will you kindly keep me in mind?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs E.

I have delayed replying as I have been giving much consideration to the matter of transferring to an Indian Day School in Manitoba. I quite appreciate the fact that the more accessible schools are filled by the most experienced teachers, but unless an accessible school was available I could not consider going on with the Indian work.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, has communicated with me since receiving your letter and will be advising me of vacancies that occur. Thus I shall await further information from him.\n\nThank you for your kindly interest.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Kiss) M.

After reviewing your experience and qualifications, we can then advise you as to the salary to which you would be entitled on our Indian Day School Teacher's salary schedule. The completion of the application form obligates you in no way whatsoever.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMay 14, 1949.\n\nMr. I. Harrington,\nKillaloe, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 10, 1949. Unfortunately, all our seasonal schools are now filled with teachers appointed recently. Most of them begin operation next week and you can understand why early appointments are made.\n\nI am pleased to note your interest, however, in teaching in one of our day schools next winter. Please find attached one of our standard application forms which I would like to have you complete and return here for consideration. With your qualifications and experience, you would be entitled to a starting salary of $180.00 a teaching month plus free house, fuel and light. Most of our Indian day schools have attached teacherages which are fully furnished.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you further concerning such a position.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard P. Mary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nMay 14, 1969.\n\nMr. J. E. Blackburn,\nP. O. Box 6,\nSt. Norbert, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Blackburn:\n\nI was pleased to hear from you and to note your interest in the school at Fort Good Hope. For the first year we would only be able probably to use one teacher at this school. With your wife's qualifications and experience, she would naturally be entitled to a higher salary rating than yourself.\n\nShe would be classified as a welfare teacher on a full year's salary basis. This would mean teaching for 12 months with only the normal three weeks' Civil Service holidays. In addition to this salary there would be a Northern Living Allowance for a married couple, of $1,500.00 a calendar year.\n\nApplication should also be made to have your travelling expenses paid from Edmonton, Alberta. As I am uncertain of your qualifications, I attach two application forms which I would like to have both your wife and yourself complete so that I can further advise you concerning the salary we could offer on a 12 month year basis.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard T. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nWest Bay, Niv. Co.,\nNova Scotia,\nMay 10, 1947.\n\nMr. Neary,\n(Supt. Indian Education)\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a month ago I forwarded to your attention, Mr. Neary, references and an application for position as teacher with the Department of Indian Affairs. (Day School)\n\nNow, I am wondering what my possibilities are of getting on. Do you think there might be a vacancy that I could fill in Mr. Bonnah's agency? Should I write Mr. Bonnah re possibilities?\n\nMy sister is teaching at Cornwall Island East; and, (if her work is satisfactory) I think she is going back next term. I would like to be near her. However, if that is not possible, I would be\nglad to get teaching in any Indian Day School in Ontario or Quebec; as I am interested in that type of work. I would appreciate hearing from you, at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\nMac & Nicholson\n1-1-17\n\nCHURCH HOUSE\n604 JARVIS ST.\nTORONTO\n\n12/5/49\n\n17779\n\nDear Colonel Henry in Head Welton, Esq.\n\nThis afternoon I had a long interview with a 23 year old young married man who is most interested in Indians.

Are you prepared to go to a rather isolated school and are you necessarily confined to the Province of Ontario?\n\nI have a school in the Fisher River Agency in the Province of Manitoba which might interest you. It is a new school with attached teacher's residence, and it is not too isolated. There is a good Indian hospital nearby, and the Indians are very interested in education.\n\nI would be pleased to provide you with further information concerning this and other schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Due to higher salaries in our schools, most of our teachers are remaining in our service and we have received very few resignations as yet.\n\nWould you be interested in teaching in Saskatchewan in one of our schools? There is a shortage of Catholic teachers and although we do not pay transportation costs, living expenses are low, and with free house, fuel and light provided, the offer is an attractive one to teachers who wish to see over parts of Canada.\n\nI would be pleased to hear your reaction to this offer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

At the time, I wrote to the Department of Mines and Resources in care of the Welfare Bureau (approx.) for further details, and having received no reply, I think that it may have been incorrectly addressed. Consequently I am writing to you directly, and I hope this address is sufficient.\n\nMy fiancee who is a very capable registered nurse and I who am a writer of sorts and have a degree in Arts from the University of Toronto, (and who might conceivably fill a teaching post if the requirements are not too too strict) believe that working on a frontier would be an excellent opportunity for doing a very worthwhile job.\n\nWe sincerely request further information, and if possible, an interview, with the express hope of obtaining the required posts.\n\nWe are in excellent health, of sound mind, free, white, twenty-five, and eager.\n\nWe would appreciate information as soon as it is convenient for you to send it.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Sgd.)

Unfortunately I was offered another very attractive position and thus faced with a very difficult decision to make.\n\nKnowing that your department preferred married men and the inconvenience to single men, I chose the rival position.\n\nI hope that another year I will be able to be in your service, as I am still interested.\n\nHoping that this does not inconvenience you too much, I remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nErnest S.

To date, we have yet to receive a single resignation or even indication of a resignation from a teacher in one of our hospital schools.\n\nWe would be very pleased to offer you such a position if and when a vacancy occurs. At the present time, however, I can not offer you anything definite.\n\nIf you are in Ottawa for the summer, would you please drop in to see me at my office.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Therefore, do not hesitate to write me in April or May of 1950 concerning any vacancy which we might have at that time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

However, we do not have a vacancy in a two-room school there at the present time. We are building a number of one-room schools and are interested in obtaining the services of Catholic teachers for them.\n\nThe teacherages attached to these schools will be sufficiently large for you to have a relative or companion with you if you so wish. However, I have a school in mind which is fairly close to a settlement, and here possibly you might be able to board. I am writing to the Indian Superintendent about this position and will let you know immediately I hear from him. You might get a letter directly from him; Mr. Frank Booth, Indian Superintendent, Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nChief Education Division\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nBefore me is your letter of June 14, 1948. But it really seems advisable this year to make a move, in spite of my happy and comfortable location.\n\nI will not be free until end of July\u2014my application form, menus certificate, etc., because on \"that day and age\" we did not have numbers only received slips of paper and there was no number on it that I remember. At the present it is tucked away in my belongings in London.\n\nI do not feel like doing pioneer work in some place out reach and hope there will be electric lights. I fear my eyes would not take lamp light and I would prefer Ontario if I go into day schools again. Of course, I fully realize the qualified teachers deserve and will receive first chance but if I am needed I appear to be available unless something unforeseen turns up that I am not aware of at the moment.\n\nThere is no other position I could take in your branch available, other than serving the Indians.\npeople and helping them is my chief concern. I've been in the work so long now (1942) that I hesitate to turn back at the last moment. However, if there is anything at the moment, I could stand a holiday for a few months.\n\nMr. Clark was here on a flying visit last week but it was my half-day and I missed him.\n\nTrust you and your family are all well. Did you remember Will Ricol that worked in Gordon's store in Parkhill? He died the first week May after an operation for cancer of the liver. He was buried in Forest. His sister, Anna, who taught for years, before her marriage, in Parkhill Public School died in January so that closed the chapter on that family's book as neither of them had any family.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMary B.

School,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mrs. Ross:\n\nWe received your letter of May 30th enclosing your application for appointment as teacher at an Indian day school. We will have a vacancy starting September 1st at the Kettlepoint School. This is in the Sarnia Agency approximately 5 miles from Forest Ontario, and about 25 miles from the Sarnia Reserve which is on the shore of Lake Huron.\n\nThe teacher's residence is comfortable but has no electric lights, although there is a possibility that we will be securing them in a year or so. There will be a second teacher there, as it is a two-room school.\n\nAt the present time this is the only vacancy that I know of in Western Ontario, but it is quite possible that there will be others before the end of June. You might let me know if Kettlepoint appeals to you, and if so, we will give you further particulars. If not, we will keep you in mind for any other vacancy that may occur in Western Ontario.\n\nI note your reference to the late Mr. Nicol. You may be interested to know that Willie\nGarden is now working in Ottawa, and I see him quite frequently. There is an Old Boys' celebration in Parkhill around the end of August, and my brother and I are planning to go back there for a day or two.

To date we have simply not had the resignations we anticipated from our Catholic schools in Ontario. Most of the teachers now in our positions are doing satisfactory work and are attracted to staying in our service by the higher salaries and the superannuation.\n\nTherefore, to date, the only resignations are in the Port Arthur Superintendency although I am expecting others in mid-June on Manitoulin Island and in the Sault Ste. Marie district.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have a spare copy of the Auditor General's Report listing the teachers' names, and I would suggest you write to the Auditor General for a copy.\n\nThanks for sending the letter of reference from Bishop Nelligan which will be placed with your records.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have been anxiously awaiting word of an appointment for September. What vacancies have you? I will definitely be free then, and would like to be posted favourably. Somehow the enclosed copy of a testimonial became separated from those I sent you. Am especially glad to send it on.\n\nMay I hear from you and could I have the latest copy of the Auditor General's Report containing names of schools, teachers etc.? Thank you.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nMargaret MacNally\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am glad to state that I am familiar with Miss Margaret McNulty's work as teacher at Golden Lake between the years 1942-45, and that I consider her one of the best teachers in the province. I had occasion to examine her class, and I found them to be particularly well instructed, and at the same time remarkably mannerly and well-behaved.\n\nI may mention also that she carried on a great deal of effective social work during these years among the parents and older brothers and sisters of the pupils. She had two clubs functioning in the school, the members of which worked among the aged, the sick and the needy, distributing clothing etc., and in a general way adding cheer to their lives. She had also a circulating library which contributed a great deal towards adult education.\n\n(Sgd) Most Rev., C.L. Nelligan\nBishop of Pembroke, 1937-44.\nJune 4, 1949.\n\nMiss Olen P.E.

I note that you hold the equivalent of a Second Class Teaching Certificate and that you have three years of teaching experience. Under our present salary schedule, you would be entitled to a commencing salary of $1,620.00 an academic year.\n\nIn most of our schools, living accommodation is provided for the teacher so that he or she can do light housekeeping. In this way, board costs are greatly reduced.\n\nI am writing to the Department of Education for the Province of Newfoundland concerning your Inspector's reports, and I would be pleased to hear from you as to whether you are willing to accept a position in one of our Indian schools in Ontario. We have a number of United Church schools in which you might be interested for next September.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 7, 1949.\n\nMr. P.J.

In these provinces there is a severe shortage of Catholic teachers in Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan and I would like very much to know if you would be interested in our work in one of these provinces. With your qualifications and experience your starting salary would be $1,800.00 an academic year plus free house, fuel and light.

Newell\nSuperintendent of Schools\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSubsequently to applying to (W.) Greening of our letter to obtain a position as a teacher, I have been referred to you.\n\nMy position is I have not heard from Normal School. I emigrated from England in March 15th this year. I approached the Department of Education in Toronto about vacancies in teaching, and they advised me that vacancies would not be filled till the end of June. Mr. Dutton said to apply to Mr. W.J. Greening then.\n\nIn the interim I took a position as operating room orderly at the Wellesley Hospital, Toronto.\n\nIn England before I taught under license privately usually children who were too few from the elementary school or neglected children who needed it for Matriculation.\nIn the war I was called to the army immediately being enlisted in 1940 and serving in the European theatre of war. After the war private teaching in England was reorganized under the raising of the school age act and I took a position over an accounts department in a firm of wholesale food distributors. During this break in routine gave me a wider experience and background from which to teach than a teacher in the narrow sense.\n\nIn certificates I have School certificate in English, French Latin, Greek Mathematics (Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry), Chemistry; also Matriculation in English, French, Latin, Greek, Mathematics, History, and Chemistry; Intermediate B.A. (at Manchester University), 2nd year examination) in History, English, Latin, and Greek.\n\nOf the other members of my family my four sisters are trained certified teachers in England. My mother too was a teacher in secondary schools before marriage. So I am in the teaching tradition and environment, and in line to come by any degree or advancement of methods. I like social work and am fond of teaching, and all children.\nMuch of the above mentioned it is not very convenient to forward to you at this point. My army character I do not think strictly relevant. I am enclosing a copy of my testimonial from the firm I worked for last in England. Being a man I should prefer to teach seniors.\n\nMy hobbies are cycling and hiking with the Canadian Youth Hostel Association and when in Britain the British organization (youth hostel association) of which I was an active member. I could arrange for an interview preferably weekend or public holiday though this might not suit you.\n\nI am single.\n\nI am thirty-eight years of age.\n\nI enclose stamped addressed envelope for return of a reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThomas Martin McKee\nJune 29, 1949.\n\nMr. T.M. McKeone,\n7 Wellesley Place,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 24. It is unfortunate that you do not possess a teaching certificate as this would make a considerable difference in the salary which we could offer you. However, I think we might possibly have a vacancy which would interest you and which would enable you to work towards obtaining a professional teaching certificate. Please find an application form attached, which I would like you to complete and return here. I am pleased to note that you are single as our schools are located on rather isolated Indian reserves where life is often rather difficult for women.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard T. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Miss LePage:\n\nThe nearest vacancy for an Indian teacher which we have at the present time is in northern Ontario, on Lake Superior. We are already negotiating with an Ontario teacher for this vacancy and it is presumed that we will fill this post in the near future.\n\nHowever, if a vacancy arises in the East, we will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Anita LePage,\nCharlo Station,\nNew Brunswick.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nDear Sirs -\nWould you have any openings for the next school term?

J. Ross if she will accept one of these positions.\n\nYou may recall that in conference with Dr. Dorey and myself, the matter of superannuation was discussed and from our conversation, we were led to understand that arrangements would be made with the province regarding the superannuation of teachers who had already been teaching being continued in this new setup. We had hoped that arrangements might be made with the Teachers Federation in Saskatchewan but Miss Stewart, the Secretary, tells us that to date nothing definite has been done.\n\nI have looked carefully over the June bulletin from the Department of Mines and Resources but I do not feel in a position to say definitely to any teacher that the salary which she will receive will be a certain amount. Would you be good enough to clarify these matters for me?\n\nSince we have been unable to secure teachers, we would be very glad of your assistance and we should also be interested in knowing the progress being made in the buildings.\n\nWith my kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\nJune 29, 1949\nJonqui\u00e8re, P.Q.\n\nRefer to File 1-1-X (E)\n\nMr. B.F.

Would you please write, therefore, to the local Indian Superintendent at the following address for further details:\n\nMr. E.J. Blakey,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nRogersville, Box 58, N.B.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 7, 1949.\n\nMrs. C.M. Loveys,\nHome Missions Executive Secretary,\nThe Woman's Missionary Society of\nThe United Church of Canada,\n412-413 Wesley Buildings,\nToronto 2 B, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Loveys:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 30, and I do hope that Mrs. Ross will accept one of the positions at File Hills. I would suggest her for the senior position at the former residential school block. I believe we can interest a junior teacher and will write you further concerning this. The matter of Saskatchewan teachers' superannuation will be taken up at the next meeting of the Canadian Educational Association in September.\n\nConcerning the salary offered to teachers, the beginning salary for a teacher with a Second Class Certificate is $1,440.00. Annual increments of $60.00 are allowed to an amount of $1,920.00. Teachers with First Class Certificates begin at $1,500.00 and go by annual increments to $2,220.00 a year. A maximum of five years credit only is given for teaching experience in provincial schools. We are now advertising for tenders for the new school at File Hills Colony. These tenders will close early in August, and the construction of the school should begin by the middle of that month providing the tenders are satisfactory.\n\nI do not think we need count on opening the new building until about the first of November; therefore, I would suggest that we leave in abeyance the matter of teachers for the new school until early October.\nI regret that the new building will not be ready for occupancy until November, but as you are aware, there was some delay before plans were finalized for closing the Pine Hills Residential School.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 7, 1949.\n\nMr. T.M. McKeone,\n7 Wellesley Place,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McKeone:\n\nYour application form has now been received here, and we have two vacancies at the present time in which you might be interested:\n\n(a) Gull Bay Indian Day School, Fort Arthur Agency,\n\n(b) Aroland Indian Day School, Fort Arthur Agency.\n\nBoth of these schools are in isolated communities, and in both places you will have to do all your own housekeeping. Your starting salary would be at $1,320.00 an academic year, plus free house, fuel and light.\n\nBefore writing you a long letter describing the two schools, I would naturally appreciate hearing from you as to whether you are interested in either vacancy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nShoal Brook,\nBonnie Bay,\nNewfoundland.\nJune 23, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI have just answered your letter of June 11. As I am now at my home, please send my reply here.\n\nThe salary stated is satisfactory, and I will accept as school in Ontario. Please send the name and address of the minister concerned, so that I can write him personally. Please send appointment, and the cost of living (as approximate as possible) as soon as you can. I would also like to know full details of classes to be taught.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAga P. L. Burden.\nJuly 8, 1949.\n\nMiss Olga P.E. Burden,\nShoal Brook,\nBonne Bay, Newfoundland.\n\nDear Miss Burden:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 23. Keeping in mind that you would probably not wish to go too far from Newfoundland, I have a school in Quebec which might interest you. This is on the Caughnawaga Reserve about thirty minutes' drive from Montreal. These Indians are all English-speaking and the school is conducted in that language. It is a three-room school, and we require a primary teacher for the beginning grades.\n\nIf you require further details, please write to the Reverend S. Kennedy, United Church House, Caughnawaga, P.Q. I am sending him a copy of this letter so that he can anticipate such a request from you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Wright, Chief,\nN.W.T. and Yukon Administration Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nNorlite Building,\nOTTAWA.\n\nHerewith copy of a letter received from Mrs. K. Emond, R.N., who, along with her husband, a school teacher, would like to find dual employment at a Northern location. Mr. B.Y. Hazelton, Local 6618, of our Personnel Division, interviewed them in Toronto recently. They were given a very clear definition of what we mean when we use the phrase \"remote location\". The set-up at Lake Harbour and Fort Chimo was explained. They appeared interested in both places, preferably Lake Harbour.\n\nI am advised by Dr. H.A. Procter that you have already recruited a school teacher for Lake Harbour. As there will be suitable accommodation for a family at Fort Chimo we should like to establish whether you need a school teacher there, if so, the latest date on which one would have to be sent.\n\nI might say that they impressed me during interview as persons who would be conscientious about their employment and easy to get along with. This would be very advantageous at Fort Chimo and there is the further fact that as a family they would probably adjust to the environment more readily than single persons or a newly married couple.\n\nMr. Emond had hoped to find suitable employment in the North during early summer. Unfortunately his letter was late reaching us and by the time we interviewed him it was necessary that he contract to remain as a teacher in\nhis present school until the end of December. If this date would not rule him out for any positions you intend to fill you could write him directly. On terminating the interview I promised to send them a list of whatever locations there might be where dual employment could be offered. Mrs. Emond desires to continue nursing and in our opinion her qualifications are very satisfactory for Northern outpost work.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this memorandum to Col. B.F. Neary in case there are openings in the Indian Affairs Branch at locations where we also must provide nursing services.\n\nJ.C. Rutledge,\nExecutive Assistant.\n\nBTW/RS\nEncl.\n42 Hearst Circle,\nToronto 15, Ont.\nApril 28/49.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am writing to enquire if you have a dual position for a husband and wife in one of your Northern outposts.\n\nMy husband is an ex-R.C.A.F. Flying Officer (Pilot) and is now in his second year as an Ontario Public School Teacher, holding an Interim first class certificate.\n\nI am a registered nurse (Ontario) and a former R.C.A.F. Nursing Sister. I have had seven years of experience in different types of nursing since graduation - especially obstetrics, contagious diseases and tuberculosis. At present I am doing part-time work at the Queen Mary Hospital, Weston - where I have particularly liked the Indian and Eskimo children.\n\nOur own two children - girls - are four and five years old.\n\nWe are both twenty-nine years old, members of the United Church of Canada and could supply ample references as to our character and ability.\n\nThanking you sincerely, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs. Kenneth Emond) Margaret Emond\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI.

The first two years count as the freshman and sophomore years of the Bachelor of Education program. At the end of these years I was granted a junior high school certificate, entitling me to teach grades 7 to 11.\n\nAfter University closed in 1947, I taught in a rural school for 6 weeks at Schuster, Alberta (Devona School - grade 1 & 10). The following year I taught grades seven and eight (at Cremona), and the past year, grades seven and eight (at the Valley).\n\nCentre Athabasca (1948) 8-week Leadership Course at the YMCA Athabasca (1949) which included drama, music, and sports; 4-week course at Banff School of Fine Arts (1949) in music; Conductor - McReavy Public School Choirs (1949).\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a Day School Teacher application submitted by Miss Catherine Oviatt who is now at Cardston, Alberta.\n\nMiss Oviatt wishes to teach on the Piapot Reserve but at the present time there is no opening there. Could I please be informed of the grade and salary classification she is qualified for, so that I may inform the lady and probably be able to have her placed in another school in this Province.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJuly 22, 1949.\n\nMiss Catherine Oviatt,\nBox 355,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nYour application form has been forwarded here by our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan. You will probably be receiving a letter directly from him concerning employment in one of our Indian day schools in Saskatchewan.\n\nYou can anticipate a visit from Mr. Ragan, our Indian Superintendent at Cardston, concerning employment in an Indian day school in Alberta.\n\nWe have a new salary schedule now awaiting approval. Under our old schedule you would be classified as a Grade 3 teacher at a starting salary of $1,620.00 an academic year. In most cases we of course provide free house, fuel and light.\n\nI enclose your Adjudicator's report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nJuly 22, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n305 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am writing directly to Miss Oviatt concerning employment in one of our schools. I am also mentioning her name to Mr. Gooderham so that Mr. Ragan, the Indian Superintendent at Cpriston, can arrange to interview her. I would suggest that you write also concerning employment in Saskatchewan day schools as no doubt Mr. Gooderham will wish to have her consider an Alberta school. Under the present salary schedule, she would be classified as a Grade 3 teacher at a starting salary of $1,620.00 an academic year.\n\nEdward F.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nMiss Catherine Oviatt,\n\nThe above teacher has written to Mr. Ostrander concerning employment in an Indian day school in Saskatchewan. He will be writing to her with details of such schools as are vacant for Protestant teachers. Miss Oviatt is 21 years of age, has a Junior High School Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Alberta and two years of experience. Her address is\n\nMiss Catherine Oviatt,\nBox 355, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nIt is quite possible you might wish to have Mr. Ragan interview her at once concerning employment at Big Horn or other day school in which you require a Protestant teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRaymond F.

Weekes,\n45 Wina Avenue,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nMinistiken Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Weekes:\n\nYou will recall my previous letter in which I advised that I would write again if an opportunity arose of offering you a teaching position.\n\nWe have one such school in mind but it is in the Province of Saskatchewan and not in the Northwest Territories. However, it is in quite an isolated part of the province, and you can rest assured that you will be fulfilling your desire to serve usefully on the Canadian frontier. In view of the fact that your wife-to-be is a registered nurse, we could classify you as a welfare teacher. Unfortunately, we can only place you as a Grade I welfare teacher because you have no qualifications nor experience in teaching. However, we might interest the Department of National Health and Welfare in paying a small amount for your wife's services.\n\nThis school is in the Meadow Lake District of Saskatchewan. It has been closed since November 1946 because the teacher was transferred to another school. I can provide you with other details if you are interested.\n\nAs I intimated above, I know the starting salary is low, but we have no alternative because of your lack of qualifications and experience. A furnished teacherage is provided free, and I would recommend that if you like teaching, you consider taking a year's leave of absence in future and attending Normal School in Regina or Saskatoon.\nWe have a number of men and their wives now planning such moves. If necessary, a leave of absence can be planned for you while your wife teaches the school. This will enable you to spend the necessary ten months in normal school without a complete loss of income.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in further details of this position.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E.

She won a scholarship and a number of prizes. She did not get a school around here yet but expect one, however some time she may have an idea to go west. She was Editor in Chief of our St. Anne High School year book and leading in the graduation.\n\nIn one of the other issues of the Toronto Globe and Mail there is an article on the Indians coming into their own as an Indian has been elected C.C.T member in British Columbia. I believe that this would be an opportune time for the so-called Indians to take up their proper names. We have no native Indians in North America. When Columbus landed at San Salvador he thought he landed in India mistakenly naming its natives Indians which was not a right.\nnames for their first year's labors. Cabot landed on our Island here, Cape Breton Island, landed there, the Island and all adjoining lands (just across the Strait of Canso) for the King and from England, the King promised Cabot \u00a310, $50 for the discovery. Cabot named the new land \"America\" after the Sheriff who gave him the money and who was also Cabot's friend, the name changed to America and Canada. Consequently at that time the Native of All America became American, the name used by the Norsemen was Skraelings, little people with broad faces, which were the Eskimos however the Eskimos were driven further back by the larger bodies of Melanesians, no doubt St. Brendan in 534, and Hecili Shewell had diff names for them, So the Indians can come into their real names if the Governors of the Country wish to change it.\n\nI have a little hobby of researching, have Diploma and letter of thanks from Pope Pius XII, and honorary degree of Master of Arts from St. Francis Xavier University for that kind work,\n\nRespectfully Albert Almeida\nTo B.F.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of August 2nd and form. My daughter tells me that she cannot leave the province to teach for five years, so I presume it would be a no avail to fill the form.\n\nI send you clipping from our Sydney Post-Record on the Indian. There are so many different kinds of Indians in the world that it is getting confusing to know. The old world Indians from the new world Indians, you may keep clipping.\n\nAlso have an article on the Discovery of America which \"Southwestern Architecture,\" \"Southwest Museum,\" Los Angeles, and \"City Council\" & Board considered quite formidable.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nAlbert Almon\nThe People's Forum\n\nON CHANGING A NAME\n\nEditor, The Post-Record Star:\n\nReferring to your change the name of the Church of England the author is not an authority of changing names generally church names. However, of the name \"Church of England\" is as we believe universal, it may be hoped to have it changed, and not make the change abroad. It may appear odd to some and a slight to others.\n\nThe Church of England in Canada would appear all right but the Church of England may be as also the Episcopal Church of Canada.\n\nAnother change of names that may also be of interest to us is the name \"Indians.\" Our Indians have been going under an erroneous name for nearly 400 years and it is becoming more confusing as we are having many India Indians, B West Indians, etc., besides our so-called Indians encroaching on our American continent.\n\nIn the year 498, Admiral Shinn called them Futange, in 534 St. Brendan likely had another name for them in the year 1000 the Norwegians named \"Skraelings\" (little people with broad faces). Our Eskimos who were called that name but were driven farther north by the crowds of natives from the east. The Eskimos have found the north more suitable as they have not changed since.\n\nAfter Columbus the natives got another name \"Indians.\" In 1492 Columbus landed on San Labrador, Glace Bay, N.S.\n\nLife's Window\n\nGOING BY THE BOOK\n\nI recall passing a farmer's place...\n56 Charles St.\nHalifax N.S.\nAug. 5, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\n220 Queen St.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI saw your advt. in the Halifax papers for a R.C. teacher.

Curran.\nAugust 3, 1949.\n\nDept. of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nyour \"ad\" in Western Producer enticed me to volunteer for service notwithstanding I have been absent from the teaching profession many years. In 1907 I attended Model School with a junior teacher (non-prof) thereby having a Third Class Certificate for Ontario and taught 1908 in Minico, North Wellington 1909 in Saginaw, South Grey then back to my former calling for 1910-11 being fortunate to have two of the greatest inspectors of those days (Rt. Baldwin of Mount Forest\u2014my birthplace\u2014and M.W. Campbell of Durham).\n\nIn Saskatchewan I was permitted equivalent license and taught terms in 1912, '13, '14, '15, '16 and '20, '21 at times in the nature of a \"supply or emergency.\"\nIn more recent years I have been farming here, in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and taken a fling at various enterprises not all successful. At present I am living on a clear-title bush farm near by this small new place (unincorporated), working on the Northern Alberta Railroad (35 miles from Grande Prairie). We have a new school under construction to serve a mixed population of Anglo-Saxon and New Canadian citizen.\n\nWhile employed as a fireman-janitor at Whitehorse, N.T., for the Canadian Pacific Airlines in 1945-6-7 and for the General Hospital there in 1948, I had occasion to meet some of our Indian people. I observed the phenomenal work of Reverend Mr. Lee and his school which I assume is under your control though not intimately acquainted. I have met Mr. Lee and also Mr. Chaffell, the rector of the Anglican Old Church. Both these gentlemen would vouch that I am a reliable character.\nFor almost a full year I have been resident here at my back door home or abode. This spring and summer am assistant clerk for my nearest general merchant (a widower) ten years my senior.\n\nAs an immediate reference possibly known to you, inquire of Mr. Solon Lee, M.P., Ottawa, Social Credit Dominion Representative for Grande Prairie... at least he could vouch that I'm not a recluse.\n\nA lifetime lameness in left foot has not improved at 65 years but I retain fair general health including alert hearing and eyesight using glasses for reading fine print and for distance, am 6'1\" weight 175 lbs.\n\nPerhaps this review gives you an introduction. In 1944-5 I personally called on the Bishop of Qu'Appelle in Regina and his colleagues volunteering to go to Furnichy but before we could get through to Rev. Gordon on storm damaged telephone a lady teacher had been chosen.\nNow, sir, you have somewhat of a sketch of my career and you may know that I'm quite aware there are not all ex-teachers can make comeback. Plenty of them have no ambition or courage to attempt it. That particular opening had special attractions of importance. Lodging and food provided and no janitorial duties of consequence, permitting me more time for home preparation and study curriculum covering about Grade 3 to 5.\n\nKindly write me your opinion and pleasure of requirements.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.D. McCut,\nWoking, Alberta.\nChurchill Road\nSavoyfield,\nHalifax, N.S.\n5th August 1949\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI read your advertisement for R.C. teachers for Indian Day Schools in Prairie Provinces in today's Halifax Mail Star, and as I am an R.C. teacher it interests me very much.\n\nI taught school in Newfoundland for one year preceding which I took a year's training at Memorial University College, St. John's, Nfld., and secured the license of Third Grade; that is Newfoundland's beginning grade for teachers.\n\nI taught Grades II, III, IV, V last year having an enrollment of forty-six pupils in all, and was intermediate teacher of the three-room school.\n\nI am 21 years old and would like to get details concerning your schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlphonse Simons\nE-1 Harwood\n\nCol.

All teachers in Regina must retire after reaching the age of sixty years.\n\nHowever, I am still quite capable of teaching all subjects except singing. Most of my teaching experience has been in the senior rooms of graded schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKatherine Strachan.\n\nMiss Katherine Strachan, holding a superior first class certificate No. 45-45, teaches 35 grade VII pupils. She does effective work but was somewhat handicapped at the time of my inspection due to a broken arm. The work in Social Studies, when I was in the room, consisted of map drawing and picture study of native homes of Mexicans, Indians, and Eskimos. I taught a lesson on picture appreciation and the responses of the pupils were good. The median test scores in this room were as follows: Spelling, 71.6; Multiplication Facts, 49.0; Division Facts, 45.5; Addition of Fractions, 44.1; and Subtraction Facts, 2.6.\n\nConverted into percentages, the fractions results are 65% and 35% respectively.\n\nThis is from Inspector Miller\n\n1947.\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, RE-CLASSIFICATION, OR SALARY REVISION AS AN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL TEACHER.\n\nI.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCamp Holland Marsh,\nR.R. # 2,\nNewmarket, Ontario,\nAugust 15 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Branch,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I take this opportunity to write to you with regards to a position of teacher at one of your Western Indian schools. For some time now I have nursed the ambition to teach at one of those remote schools, and I feel one must derive a splendid feeling of satisfaction from helping those children.\n\nHowever before I go too far I wish to state that I have no papers that state that I am a qualified teacher. I do know however that I can teach and that I like children. I did apply for Normal School admission, but changed my mind the last minute because of financial reasons.\n\nI am a veteran of the Army, age 29, single, in good health, height 5'10\" and weight 200 lbs. I have my Senior Matriculation Standing, and would be anxious to continue my studies while teaching. I would be willing to start at a minimum wage until I proved my ability as a teacher.\nFor two years now, I have directed these camps for the Department of Agriculture. The majority of our campers are students between the ages of 16 and 21, but I can handle younger students just as well if not better.\n\nI am quite versatile in sports, and have specialized in children's games, and story telling besides hiking and camping etcetera.\n\nIn any event I am quite anxious to hear from you as I feel sure that my vocation is in teaching. Possibly you could give me some advice as to where my services could be used if not with your Branch.\n\nAnticipating an early reply, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGordon A. Lavoie,\nCamp Director.\n\nP.S. Although my name is French I regret to say that I am not perfectly bilingual.\nAugust 22, 1949.\n\nMiss Christina McDonald,\nTracadie, Antigonish Co., N.S.\n\nDear Miss McDonald:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 14, we have two vacancies in Alberta which might interest you. One is at the Pelican Indian Day School near Brocket, Alta., and the other is at Hobbema Indian Day School, near Hobbema, Alta.\n\nPlease find attached one of our application forms which I would like to have you complete and return here as soon as possible.\n\nWith your certificate and experience we could offer you $2,280.00 an academic year. If you can not obtain a release at this late date, we have two schools under construction in Northern Alberta which might be finished by January 1, 1950.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I now teach at St. Agnes Convent School in New Waterford, Cape Breton, but thought I would like to go west. I have completed my Sophomore year towards my B.A. and have had a Teacher's License from Prince Edward College. I have one summer school course but need 2 for a permanent license. At summer school I took the following courses: P.E., English, Shakespeare, and Adult Education. I taught one year in the country, almost a full year departmental work at St. Agnes High School, New Waterford, 3 years, Grade 7, 8, and 4 years, Grade 10, 11, 12. I would like a position where there is a furnished teacherage, if possible. Please let me know as soon as possible what class of license I would have there and the salary, as I will have to arrange for another teacher in my place at St. Agnes.\n\nChristina McIlwain,\nTracadie, N.B., Co.\nAugust 22, 1949.\n\nMr. T.S.

In reply to this advertisement I would like to submit the following for your consideration.\n\nIn the spring of 1948 I graduated from the University of Toronto in Physical and Health Education. I intended to continue on to Ontario College of Education (O.C.E) but unfortunately financial difficulties prevented this. So I worked with the Toronto YMCA as an assistant boys' work secretary until March of 1949. Then I entered the Royal Canadian Air Force and at present am undergoing flying training.\nat RCAF Station Centralia. However my flying ability is not up to the standards required so I will be leaving the service shortly. Realizing that I do not have a teacher's certificate I am writing to find out whether or not there would be an opening in your department for a healthy, vigorous hard working young man like me.\n\nI sincerely hope you will give this letter due consideration.\n\nYours Truly\nJames Alan Gray\n\nFlight Cadet J.A.

Some day I hope to secure teaching. I am middle aged, Protestant, and hold a permanent first class certificate. For the past six years I taught in Palmerston, but I also hold an elementary certificate in Home Economics and taught as well as my regular grade in Palmerston. My hobbies are women's crafts and church work.\n\nI don't think I could teach a one-room Indian school if these schools are in isolated districts. Would there be any opening in day schools where I hope to have the opportunity to help other teachers? Are there teachers for more than one teacher? What would my salary be with twenty-seven years experience? Does the government pay all teachers' transportation to the schools? I am interested in living Saskatchewan and Alberta. For how many years must one sign up?

August 18, 1949\n\nHerbert F. Henry, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education, Indian Affairs Br.,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant asking for my opinion on the ability of Mr. Albert P. Nicholas to fill a teaching position.\n\nMr. Nicholas taught in Aylmer High School on two occasions, about 15 years ago he taught a part term as a substitute for one of our regular teachers who was ill and three years ago he taught for the full term.\n\nOn both occasions his work was satisfactory and he was well liked by the pupils and would do extra work with them at any time it was required.\n\nHe is well qualified and I consider him capable to fill any teaching position for which he would apply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.K. Edey, Sec.-Treas.\nSechelt, B.C.,\nAug. 18, 1949.\n\n10307\n\nRe: Day School Teachers.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nThere are two vacancies in Day Schools at present in my mission area. I have brought this problem to the attention of Mr. Arneil, the Commissioner, Fr' O'Grady, and the other day, to the attention of Rev. Father Bird, our Provincial. He told me to write to you. He said that you had a very nice ad in the \"Ensign\", and I thought, perhaps, that you might steer some of these answers out to B.C.\u2014If there are no further applications on hand would you please consider advertising again in the \"Ensign\" and this time make a special appeal for teachers willing to teach in Catholic Indian Day Schools in British Columbia. Mention could be made of the wide varieties of climates to consider in the different areas where these Schools are located; (a very alluring consideration\u2014if they only knew B.C.)\n\nThe two Schools in my area (all coastal missions 150 miles up from Vancouver) are Churchouse and Sliammon. Both these Schools have a teacherage and there should be a man and his wife at each place.\n\nChurchouse is 150 miles up from Vancouver\u2014the P.O. is Stuart Island, B.C. located at the entrance of Bute Inlet. There are 35 or 40 children to go to School there. This reserve is not in good conditions and the School needs a good teacher and social worker to keep it coming along with present social conditions. It's the tougher spot of the two missions.\n\nSliammon is 3 miles from Powell River, the paper-mill town, 80 miles from Vancouver. There are 25 or 30 pupils of School age there. The teacher's house is about 10 min. walk from the School. There should be a man and his wife here. A good social worker, both for practical nursing and encouraging the Indians in a better mode of life is necessary in both places.\n\nHoping you can do something to fill our needs and that of the Department's in B.C., I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, RE-CLASSIFICATION, OR SALARY REVISION AS AN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL TEACHER.\n\nI.

Mr. Monaghan formerly taught at the Skawah Indian Day School near Chilliwack, B.C. for the two academic years 1947-48 and 1948-49. Inspector Davey's reports on his work were never particularly satisfactory. His report of January 14, 1948, read in part as follows:\n\n\"There was little evidence of any attempt on the part of Mr. Monaghan to organize his work or to do any lesson preparation. No time-table had been prepared, and the exercise books showed little attempt on his part to give adequate supervision. His work in general gave a very definite impression of lack of effort. His lessons showed evidence of training and experience, but this by no means takes the place of adequate preparation.\"\n\nWe have been in correspondence with Mr. Ostrander concerning Mr. Monaghan, and I have a letter of August 18, 1949, from him reading as follows:\n\n\"(1) Re Mr. F.G. Monaghan, 22 McCarthy Apartments, Regina - I know this gentleman quite well, and I know that he is interested in getting a position, but I do not feel that he is at all suitable for the Piapot Indian Day School. He was considered, last year, for one of the day schools...\"\nat the Assiniboine Reserve, when the teacher situation was much worse than it is now. Eventually, I decided to not recommend him when I found that he is quite elderly, that he is married, that his wife insists on living in Regina, and that he intended to travel back and forth between the Assiniboine Reserve and Regina, weekends, and expected to have transportation to and from the train. He informed me that he is a retired teacher on Provincial Teacher's Pension, and I do not think we should take on \"has been\" teachers if we can avoid it.\"\n\nIn view of the information contained in these two reports, it is not our intention to employ Mr. Monaghan unless the teacher situation is such that we cannot obtain the services of more competent teachers.\n\nDirector,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, August 26, 1949.\n\nMr. V.

Your telegram conflicted with one I had received from Rev. L. Lavigne, O.M.I., of St. Boniface, Manitoba.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\"The two schools in my area (all coastal missions 150 miles up from Vancouver) are Churchouse and Slilmon. Both these schools have a teacherage and there should be man and his wife at each place.\n\nChurchouse is 150 miles up from Vancouver -- the P.C. is Heart Island, B.C., located at the entrance of Bute Inlet. There are 25 or 30 children to go to school there. This reserve is not in good conditions and the school needs a good teacher and social worker to keep it coming along with present social conditions. It's the tougher spot of the two missions.\n\nSlilmon is 3 miles from Powell River, the paper-mill town, 80 miles from Vancouver. There are 25 or 30 pupils of school age there. The teacher's house is about 10 min. walk from the school. There should be a man and his wife here. A good social worker, both for practical nursing and encouraging the Indians in a better mode of life is necessary in both places.\"\n\n(Sgd.) Rev. F.J.

Please find attached one of our standard application forms which I would like to have you complete and return to me as soon as possible. I will then be able to advise you concerning the salary which can be offered for your teaching services in our Indian day schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, September 7, 1949.\n\nMiss A. Carisse,\nActing Private Secretary to the\nMinister of National Revenue,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Miss Carisse:\n\nI have had the Education Officials of the Indian Affairs Branch check the circumstances concerned in the resignation of Miss Margaret MacNulty as mentioned in your letter of August 25.\n\nMiss MacNulty has had some seventeen years of experience in our Indian Day Schools. In September 1948, she was assigned as teacher to the Cornwall Island East Indian Day School near Cornwall, Ontario. On October 13, 1948, she wrote advising that she would not be able to resume her duties at Cornwall Island East after we had granted her a week's sick leave. She advised that her doctor was not sure when her allergic condition would clear up and possibly would recur due to the climate on Cornwall Island. Miss MacNulty suffers from hay fever, and the school is in a pollen area. Please find attached a copy of a letter sent by the Superintendent of Education to her at that time. On December 6 she wrote in concerning her Retirement Fund, and she was offered a position in the Fort Frances Agency or another school in the Fort Arthur Agency. Both of these positions she declined to accept because of illness in her family.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education has gone to considerable difficulty in placing Miss MacNulty in an Ontario school this year. She did not wish to accept a school too far from her home in Kenora. It has been difficult to locate a suitable school because our teachers are no longer leaving our services but due to higher salaries, superannuation and improved conditions, are remaining in our service.\nHowever, Miss MacIntyre has been placed as the second teacher at the Sagamook Indian Day School near Neeey, Ontario. The Superintendent of Education has discussed this appointment with her by telephone. We feel confident she will be satisfied especially when the new school, now under construction, is completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.B.

T.

In the event that you do not receive satisfactory applications at this time next year, I am asking for further consideration of my application.\n\nI can assure you that you will receive from me most conscientious service. I have had, as I wrote you, experience in two Indian schools\u2014St. Michael's at Neskantaga Bay and St. Paul's at Carleton. If you were to be good enough to write to Mr. Middleton, recently retired principal at Carleton, I am sure that he will speak very favourably of my service in the school as I did, out of my deep interest in them, work very hard.\nwith my Indian pupils.\n\nThe salary paid by the Church was low as you know\u2014$50 per month increased lately to $75\u2014and so I should be glad of a year's appointment at a better salary.\n\nI should appreciate a prompt reply, & trust it will be favourable me.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nAlexandra Thomson.\nAIR MAIL\n\nSeptember 30, 1949.\n\nDear Miss Follett:\n\nMountbatten Indian Day School\n\nI hope that my letter of September 20 has reached you as I am anxious to receive your application form.\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip in Northern Ontario where I have been advised of a vacancy in a school now under construction. This is the Mountbatten Indian Day School situated on the C.P. railway near Chapleau, Ontario. The name of the railway station at which the school is located is Tophet. However, there is only a section house at this point and shopping would all have to be done in Chapleau although there are two small stores, one at Nemegos and the other at Kormack. There is daily train service either East or West on trains No. 1 and 2.\n\nYou will be quite isolated at this school and I would strongly recommend that your father live with you. There will be an attached teacherage and a full basement is provided with a furnace to heat both the classroom and the teacherage.\n\nWe do not wish to employ a teacher who has not had previous experience with Indians. This band of Indians has never had any educational opportunities before and new houses are being built for them and a school erected so that a beginning can be made to improve their general welfare.\nThis school presents a real challenge to a teacher who is not afraid of isolation and hardship. If you are interested in this position would you please write by air mail at once to Mr. J.L. Whitney, Indian Superintendent, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nHe will be able to provide you with other details. If you would prefer a position less isolated, then advise me accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss E.

During the summer of 1948 one of the teachers occupying one of these positions was Miss Florence Bomberly who is a Six Nations Indian girl from Brantford.\n\nShe had been to Normal School but as she was rather small and was a cripple, she was not a success as a teacher.\n\nI have today had a letter from her enquiring about obtaining clerical appointment with the Department in one of our offices. She has had no Secretarial Course and can not do typing or shorthand. If you wish any further details of her qualifications, I would suggest you send a Civil Service employment form to her at the following address:\n\nMiss Florence Bomberly,\nc/o Wilbur Lowden,\nR.R.# 5,\nSimcoe, Ontario.\n\nBernard F.

However, I am making an enquiry today to our Personnel Office advising them of your interest in a clerical appointment.\n\nIf you do not hear from them by the end of October, please write to me again.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Jewitt.\n\nMiss Jewitt had some contact with this office in connection with a proposed exchange for one year to Newfoundland. Although the exchange was confirmed, the Newfoundland teacher subsequently accepted permanent employment in Montreal and the exchange fell through. At that time I learned from Miss Jewitt's principal that she is extremely well regarded at Forest Hill Village School, and he values her services quite highly. She is a girl of attractive personality and above average appearance. I am inclined to think she is subject to over-enthusiasm at certain times but this is not necessarily a fault.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. K.

In the event that either of these teachers prove available, I would ask that you make it very clear that we can only retain their services on a month to month basis and that employment can not be guaranteed after Christmas.\n\nI have another teacher in mind for your school after the Christmas holidays. She is Miss Jewel Jewitt, 139 Sherbourne Street, Toronto. One of our other superintendents will be writing to her also. I would suggest, therefore, that you write in the near future describing the vacancy and suggesting that she make a trip to the school over a weekend before Christmas.

For your information, if Miss Furino is a teacher applicant, it is unnecessary for her to send an Unemployment Insurance Commission book as teachers are exempt from the payment of Unemployment Insurance. However, all teacher applicants must forward application forms.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Miss Terrance:\n\nThis will confirm the information given to you by Mr. Phelan namely that we do not have any vacancies in our schools in this section of Ontario and Quebec.\n\nWe have relatively few Catholic schools in this district and the teachers we have intend to remain in their positions. As you are aware, we do not feel that it would be advisable to have you teach again in the St. Regis Agency in view of the conditions which existed at the Chenail school during the time you were teaching there.\n\nWhen you visited here last summer, I advised you of vacancies in the Port Arthur Agency but I presume that you still do not wish to take such a position. I have teachers from even as far away as Nova Scotia teaching in this section of Ontario.\n\nHowever, if you are now prepared to accept a position in the Sioux Lookout or Kenora Superintendencies, I may be able to place you at Christmas.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M. Terrance,\nBox 31,\nHogansburg, N.Y.,\nCol.

Taylor I interviewed this lady at her new home in Brossaw on October 26.\n\nThere are some answers on her application blank that require amplification.\n\nAfter Grade XI she attended Normal School for the session 1924-25.\n\nSubsequently she taught for two and one-half years, her last engagement being for the session 1930-31. She has not taught since marriage.\n\nShe now has a daughter who must have convenient access to a high school, and a son in the junior grades.\n\nShe wants an appointment where her husband who she claims is a good handyman (including motor vehicles) can also be employed. From her point of view the Saddle Lake position, with him employed as caretaker at the nursing station, would have been suitable on all counts. But Health and Welfare want Indian helpers if possible.\n\nOn her application form she did not state her religious denomination - it is insufficient for our purposes, and often misleading, to use the term \"Protestant.\" She is a Jehovah's Witness. Her husband is a Roman Catholic. They were married by a Roman Catholic priest, but the children have not been brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. She would scarcely be welcomed on any reserve where there is a significant proportion of adherents of any Christian denomination desiring to advance or maintain their influence.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor\n\" \" Aspt., Saddle Lake Agency.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.A.V.

F. Ready,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently I was informed of the great expansion programme of education in your Branch, and would appreciate any information about same.\n\nSince 1933 I have been engaged in teaching and have had a varied experience in that field.\n\nI have a Permanent First Class Teaching Certificate to which was added a B.A. and a B.Ed. by extra mural study in University of Toronto. Until 1941 I taught in the Public School Staff of York Township, on the outskirts of Toronto.\n\nOn the advice of Dr. W. J. Dunlop, Director of Extension at the U.F.T., I accepted a position as Educational Counsellor with the Canadian Legion Educational Service, in the\nautumn of 1941. In this work I advised service personnel on courses as well as instructing classes ranging from adult illiteracy to advanced high school work.\n\nIn the following year Dr. Dunlop asked me to be his Executive Assistant at the University. I acted in this capacity until the fall of 1943 when I finally managed to enlist in the R.C.A.F. as an Education Officer. At my discharge in 1946 I was the Command Education Officer for the entire Eastern Air Command area.\n\nIn September of '46, largely due to the recommendation of Dr. Althaus of the Ontario Department of Education, I was engaged as instructor of Junior Native Baths in the Rehab. School in Toronto under Col. Wood. The academic section of this school closed in the following spring and I turned once more into the provincial system. The housing condition was such that I was forced to take schools in outlying communities. At present I am\nPrincipal of the 4-roomed school in this town.\n\nI am 37 years of age, am married and have three small children.\n\nSince my discharge, the security and opportunity for advancement which I thought would be mine have so far eluded me.\n\nI feel that I definitely have something to offer and perhaps this outline of my experience may suggest to you, some niche in your organization.\n\nThanking you for any consideration you may give,\n\nI remain,\n\nFaithfully yours,\nJoe Marshall.\nWinnipeg\n12860\nNovember 19, 1949\n\nCOL.

For example where the Provincial tax is 5 per cent a $1.25 dinner would appear as $1.31 in the claim. Deviation from the odd cent figure at once indicates to the Auditor General that the claim is not accurate.\n\n(iv) Gratuities are not to be included with, and shown as, a part of the cost of the meal but must be entered separately under the heading \"Gratuities\".\n\n(v) When field officials stay at a private house and receive meals at the same house the receipt for charges will show the cost of meals as well as the amount paid for the room.\n\n**Rooms**\n\nOn occasion, wives of officials travelling on public business accompany their husbands. In such cases the official must claim only for the single-room rate at the hotel utilized and not at the rate of a single person occupying a double-room in the same hotel.\n\nI would enjoin the co-operation of all concerned to ensure that Travel Regulations, in the matter of claims, be more carefully adhered to in the future thereby ensuring less likelihood of embarrassment to those participating.\nMiss Phyllis Deyell,\nOKOTOKS, Alberta.\n\nDear Miss Deyell:\n\nYour letter of November 28th addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs, Edmonton, has been referred to this office for reply.\n\nWe already have a teacher employed at the ranch on the Highwood River (Eden Valley) purchased from Mr. Garner and at the present time we have no vacancies in day schools in southern Alberta.\n\nI am attaching application form with some additional information on salaries, etc., of teachers in Indian schools.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. M. Roe,\n111 Ferry Road,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nBFN/IM\nDear Sirs:\n\nI should like very much to obtain some information regarding the appointment of teachers in the Indian Schools. I had been on the point of going to the Indian Residential School at Cardston, Alta., when I heard of an Indian day school being open for a teacher, at a place about 30 miles east of Chapleau. This may be only a rumor, but I should like to know if there is such a school, and whether it would be staffed with an Anglican teacher, and the qualifications which would be required.\n\nAlthough I have taught for many years, and have had a permit from the Province of British Columbia, I have never bothered getting a permanent certificate, perhaps because I already had a profession, being a graduate of the University of Toronto, in Occupational Therapy. However, I have been very successful, and have a wide range of subjects beyond the range of the average public school teacher. In the field of Arts and Crafts especially, I have had more than average success.\n\nAlthough the idea of teaching the Indian child appeals to me, I believe I would be more at home with them in a day school, especially the Indians around the Lake Superior region, as I am familiar with that part of the country, particularly the Thunder Bay region, and know and like the Indians in those parts. Moreover, I would be a great deal happier in the bush country than in an institution.\n\nPlease be good enough to let me know about your teaching service, and if there is any special field for a teacher skilled in teaching Arts and Handcrafts, and in promoting the advertising and sale of the products of such classes. I had 120 pupils a day in a camp this summer, and could see all kinds of possibilities for them.\n\nPerhaps it would be more fair to the Principal in Cardston if I could hear from you as soon as possible, so that in the event of my finding that I would be suitable for one of your day schools in the Lake Superior region, I would have time to come to some arrangement before the new year.\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss)\n1-1-17\n493 Douglas Street,\nSainte Marie, Ont.\nDec. 9, 1949.\n\n17954\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIf there should happen to be a vacancy in an Indian school anywhere I'd be grateful if you could consider giving me another chance.\n\nEspecially Oka, Que. The Inspector and Mr. Brisbois, Indian Superintendent, know me and the work I have done. But I'd be glad of another chance anywhere.\n\nI have resigned here for various reasons. Have to spend an hour and a half every day on the bus between my home and the school. The continual going up and down stairs bothers my hips. The school is so terribly overcrowded that there is no place for crafts or woodwork in which I am interested and a firm believer.\n\nIf you are not interested in this application you need not answer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDecember 10, 1949.\n\nSeveral resignations have been received in this office recently and we will require three Protestant teachers to fill these vacancies.

Smith,\n493 Douglas Street,\nBaillie Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 9. Both the schools at Oka have teachers at the present time, and I have no knowledge that any change will be made at Christmas. In fact, one of the schools has two teachers as Miss McCaig at Oka Country has a friend staying with her waiting for an opening.\n\nWe simply have not had any resignations at Christmas, and in fact, we have had remarkably few changes during the past year. With the good salaries offered and superannuation benefits being available, there has been much better satisfaction on the part of our teachers.\n\nBy a peculiar coincidence your letter arrived on the same day as one from our Indian Commissioner in British Columbia indicating that he had three vacancies in his schools in the northern part of that province. I would suggest that if you are interested in such positions, you might like to write to Mr. R.F. Dewey, District Inspector of Indian Schools, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe do not pay transportation expenses to British Columbia, but we always have a number of teachers interested in moving to British Columbia because of the milder climate.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDecember 14, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.

I have also arranged to have the following advertisement issued in the Winnipeg Free Press Prairie Farmer, the Ensign and the Western Producer:\n\n\"WANTED - Teachers for Indian Schools in British Columbia; attached teachers' charges provided free. Good salary schedule in effect. Details and application forms available R.F. Davey, Inspector Indian Schools, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\"\n\nWhile the teachers whose names I have sent you may not all be available now, I would suggest that some of them may be valuable contacts for the 1950-51 academic year. Your time will certainly not be wasted in writing to them. Miss Ramona Wood has a First Class Saskatchewan Certificate. Miss Ethel Wood has a Manitoba Certificate and several years of experience in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba. I believe she will be your best prospect, and I have been trying to interest her in British Columbia since the middle of November. She is forty-one years of age, Jewish, B.A. from University of Saskatchewan and twelve years of experience. Mr. Marsh taught in an Indian School in Manitoba and is now teaching in a provincial school but wishes to return. Miss Davell has been in contact with Mr. Gooderham about a position and, I believe, is qualified. Mr. Bailey has\na Saskatchewan Certificate and is interested in a northern position. He is twenty-one years of age and, I believe, would accept one of your schools.\n\nMiss Mellingen formerly taught at the Whitehorse Indian Day School until she became ill. She is a good teacher and wishes to return to the Yukon, but we do not have a position vacant at the present time.\n\nBernard F.

Sawatsky\n\nActing on your instructions the a/m teacher was contacted, however the interview was unsuccessful as Mr. Sawatsky informed the writer that he was dealing with the Regional Supervisor, Mr. R. S. Davis, and would not consider discussing the matter with any other individual.\n\nUpon making inquiries from persons who have been in contact with Mr. Sawatsky, I learnt that due to his injuries received whilst serving overseas he is subject to periods of depression and his subsequent actions are erratic. I do not wish to infer that the man has a \"mental\" condition - his disabilities caused by war injuries have warped the man's outlook.\n\nIt is very unfortunate and I have to report, that after taking all matters into consideration, I do not recommend that Mr. Sawatsky be appointed as Teacher in any of the Agency Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

I will give you further details as soon as I receive a reply from him.\n\nThis school will not be too isolated in comparison with Gull Bay. I have also sent an Army Message to our Inspector of Schools in British Columbia in the event that he might have a vacancy in that province. I presume you are prepared to go to Western Canada if necessary.\n\nOne thing which rather concerns me is that in your application form completed for the Gull Bay School, you stated that you were a Roman Catholic. In your application of 22 August, 1949, you state that you are Church of England.\n\nI also wish to ascertain whether you do hold an actual teacher's certificate as this makes a great difference in the salary which we can offer you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 17, 1950.\n\nMr. R.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMrs. Ellen Lee\n\nDear Bob:\n\nThe above teacher is presently employed in the Maniwaki Indian Day School. She is an excellent teacher with a First Class Teaching Certificate, five years of provincial experience and two years of Indian school experience. She is a Roman Catholic, 40 years of age and has one child. I have today received a letter from her advising that she wishes to transfer to an Indian school on Vancouver Island. She specifically mentions the vacancy at Westholme or in that vicinity but I believe she would accept a transfer to any school on Vancouver Island or the lower mainland. Her sister lives in Victoria and she wishes to be near her.\n\nI would suggest that you write to her at the following address:\n\nMrs. Ellen Lee,\nManiwaki Indian Day School,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\n\nAs you know, this school is near Ottawa and I have had an opportunity of noting her work. It is well above average and all our officials have reported favourably on her on several occasions. She takes a great interest in\nwelfare and arranged a bus trip for her children to Ottawa when they went through the Parliament Buildings, etc. She is well liked by the Indians and should prove a success in any of your Catholic Day Schools.\n\nBFN/McCN\n160, Boulton Ave,\nToronto.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nThank you for your helpful letter of Jan. 16th.\n\nThe school in Manitoba sounds very interesting. I have friends in the Winnipeg area. Actually, I'm prepared to go to any part of Canada, although owing to the small amount of money I was able to bring here, I should have to arrange for my transportation to be taken from my salary.\n\nI am a Roman Catholic. I can only think that the mistake over religion was made through an error of mine. At\nMy first school was a place of all solemnities and it was an everyday affair to have forms to fill in for them. Most of them were c. of E so we all actively held a teacher's certificate. The inspectors came by after I had visited my school. He was pleased with what he saw, and was going to arrange for me to go to summer school.\n\nAt Bull Bay I had opportunity to live and play. I am glad to continue if possible during my middle age. I held several exhibitions of Indian Chiefs Art. I am most interested in the welfare of the Inuit people.\nJanuary 20, 1950.\n\nMr. G.L. Hall,\n160 Cosburn Ave.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hall:\n\nYour pay cheque stubs for the month of February 1947 have been noted and are being returned herewith.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 17, 1950.\n\nDear Mrs. McCaig:\n\nMorley Residential School\n\nI have received your letter of January 11th and am pleased to note your interest in one of our welfare schools.\n\nThese are relatively few in number and will probably be situated mainly in Northern Alberta.\n\nI attach an application form which you requested and will be pleased to advise you concerning salary, etc., when we receive this completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A.G. McCaig,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nEnclosure\n24 January, 1950.\n\nMr. G. L. Hall,\n160 Cosburn Avenue,\nToronto Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hall:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter of January 17th in the hope I could give you more definite information concerning the vacancies in Manitoba. Both the Fort Alexander School and the Roseau River School have been now filled with teachers holding Canadian teaching certificates. I was sorry to read that you did not hold a professional certificate. This means, unfortunately, that you can only be classified as a Grade 1 teacher. Your salary would be at the rate of $138.00 a teaching month, whereas if you held a Grade II teaching certificate, you would start at $186.00 a teaching month. If you held a First Class Canadian Certificate, your starting salary would be $228.00 a teaching month.\n\nTherefore, you can readily see that it will be to your advantage to obtain a Canadian teacher's certificate as soon as possible. You can also appreciate the fact that we can obtain authority for the hiring of teachers holding Canadian certificates before those without certificates.\n\nThe only vacancy now left is at the Peigan Indian Day School in southern Alberta. Here the difficulty is that your transportation costs would be high. We cannot make an advance on salary as this is prevented by our\nregulations. Would it be possible for you to borrow funds to cover your transportation expenses? If you will let me know your telephone number by return mail, I can call you Long Distance with further information concerning this vacancy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nThank you very much for your helpful letter received this evening.\n\nI think that the school at Peigan sounds very promising and shall be most grateful if you can telephone me on Saturday morning as requested. My number is Hargrave 7791. I shall be in all the time.\n\nI am most anxious to attend a summer school to obtain the Canadian certificates. Can this later be arranged? My last Inspector in Canada was eager for me to do so. I am also studying for a B.A. Degree.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n160, Gordon Ave\nToronto 47\n\nC 156\n26 Jan/50\nMy interest in the Indians\u2014especially from the point of art and education should benefit them in several ways. I have tried to make people interested in their general welfare in my lectures and exhibitions of Indian Child Art.\n\nI think that $138.00 is a very fair salary. Would there be any dispensary work to do? I am very fond of this as well. A friend will assist me with the transportation to the West. May I thank you for all your efforts on my behalf. May I say that I consider my work a vocation in life and am looking forward to commencing if agreeable to you as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGordon Langley Hall\nJanuary 27, 1950.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\n\nRe: Mr. G.E. Hall, formerly teacher\nGall Bay Indian Day School\n\nThe above teacher has returned to Canada, and we have been in correspondence with him concerning a school in Alberta.\n\nYou will recall that he taught at Gall Bay and at that time you reported favourably upon his services.\n\nCould you please advise whether we should consider his application for further employment as an Indian Day School teacher.\n\nBernard McNeary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n: Mr. B.F. Neary\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nWe wish to thank you very much for listing your requirements for university students as requested by the Honourable Minister of Labour. Your interest in Canadian youth is greatly appreciated and we are sure that we are speaking not only on behalf of the Government but of all Canadian universities.\n\nIn order that our service to you and to the students may be as effective as possible, will you please use the enclosed form to advise us when the positions in your firm are partially or entirely filled. If you will be good enough to do this we will arrange to notify all universities and all N.E.S. offices concerned so that persons will not be referred when positions are already filled. This will, we believe, be a convenience to yourselves and to the students.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nW. K. Rutherford\nDirector of Employment Service\nExecutive & Professional Division,\nNational Employment Service,\nNo. 5 Temporary Bldg.,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nWith reference to our requirements for university students for 1950 listed with you, we wish to advise:\n\n(a) All requirements have now been filled.

His stay with us, however, was so short that I had very little chance to estimate his professional ability. More than that about him I do not know.\n\nHowever, considerable pressure seems to be being brought to bear to bring him to attention, and Mr. Superintendent Turk was speaking to me about him over the telephone only today.\n\nOur friend, Gerrie, seems to be somewhat perturbed. From what I can gather, both from first hand personal knowledge and from information received from different sources, Mr. Turk rather questions Mr. Hall's complete truthfulness, as well as his absolute honesty.\n\nHe may have already risen to a post with Indian Schools, in which case, I suppose, there is nothing you can do but follow Mr. Asquith's advice: \"Wait and See.\"\n\nHowever, if he is not yet on your pay roll, it might be to your advantage to consult your local Superintendent here before he does get on that important roll.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI shall be writing you again in a couple of days. Am rushing this letter off my air mail, just in case.\nMr. MacKean\nleft the attached\nletter today\nstating he had\nnot received you\npreviously\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAttn: Mr. B.F. Neary,\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI would like to apply for the position of teaching Indian children during the summer holidays. As a second year student of the arts course at Bishop's University, I have had six months\nexperience in teaching at a rural school.\n\nliving conditions would be no drawback since this type of work appeals to me very much.\n\nIf there is a position available, I will be glad to supply any further information that is required.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCarole Witty.\nFebruary 6, 1950\n\nMiss Jean L. Carter,\nBox 350,\nSpringhill, N.S.\n\nDear Miss Carter:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 1. We only have one Indian Day School sufficiently large to warrant the hiring of a full-time handicrafts teacher. We already have a qualified and experienced person in this position.\n\nHowever, I am sending your letter to the Personnel Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare and I am quite certain that they will be interested in your qualifications with a possibility of employment in an Indian hospital.\n\nIf you do not hear from them within a fortnight, I would suggest that you write to this Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MNeN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith application form - in duplicate - received from Mrs. Geneva G. Matern of Camper, Manitoba, who is interested in teaching in an Indian school at the commencement of the September term, 1950.\n\nWill you please write Mrs. Matern and advise me accordingly, and I will in turn advise her to contact this office in June - regarding any openings that we may have at that time.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nDecember 19, 1949,\nDerby Road,\nCrystal Beach, Ont.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAm writing this letter as a result of my correspondence with Father Oliver, Principal of Spanish, Ontario Residential School. He informed me that my qualifications might be suitable in the Indian Educational Field.\n\nAm a veteran of the R.C.A.F. and have my B.A. from McMaster University. Was taking a course at the University of Havana, Cuba this summer and was late in submitting my application for Normal School. Since that time I have been employed in my father's business but as the main bulk of his business is seasonal and because of my interest and knowledge in boy's work have decided upon teaching as a profession.\n\nHave worked with boys whose ages ranged from five to sixteen at Camp Pine Crest, in Muskoka, a camp operated by the Central Y.M.C.A., in Toronto. Also have courses in educational and vocational guidance to my credit.\n\nEnclosed find letter received from Father Oliver. Please advise if there are any openings in this field. Thanking you, I remain, Yours very truly,\n\nWilliam E. Holmes Jr.\nDecember 29, 1949.\n\nMr. William E. Holmes, Jr.,\nDerby Road,\nCrystal Beach, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 19 and am forwarding you herewith an application form for completion and return here.\n\nI presume that you do not hold a teaching certificate which would make a considerable difference in the salary which we could offer. However, I would like to have you return the attached form as we may be able to use your services as a substitute teacher.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. William E. Holmes Jr.\nCrystal Beach Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Holmes;\n\nThank you for your application. I regret that we must have a normal school certified teacher for these two grades. This would be not over but I am afraid that I slipped up in my ad by not putting in the fact that this is an R.C. school and that you might be no little inconvenience and inconvenience. You have such excellent qualifications that if you applied to the Indian Department at Ottawa and if of course you were interested in trying out Indian work which is very interesting, you could not likely get an excellent position in one of the Indian residential or day schools. The salary for a degree and the further excellent training you hold would mean a great deal. I was going to take the liberty of sending your letter on to the Indian Dept of Education but felt it would be acting little too freely. If you are interested you could write to Mr. Bernard F. Henry, Supt. Indian Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI am sure you will understand and feel sure that whatever you do, you will make a very definite success of it.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

During the eighteen years I have served here as Headman and Farm Manager and Instructor I have been in close touch with all departments of the school's work and have watched with interest the effect of its influence on the Indians of this locality. I have a sincere liking for these people and feel they are worthy of further help in solving their great problems of health and living standards.\n\nI feel I have a good working knowledge of the organization in the school here which I could apply elsewhere to advantage because I have watched its growth over so long a period. I am well aware of the increasing educational opportunities both practical and academic which the Indian Department is offering the pupils in these schools and I should study to prepare a well balanced program for any school I might have in charge.\n\nI have enjoyed the years I have spent here and I should be glad to use the knowledge and experience I have gained in a wider field if the administration should entrust me with one.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR.

Miss Parliament is at present on the staff of the Immaculate Conception Hospital at Aklavik, and is interested in either a nursing or teaching position. Indian Health Services has no vacancy in the nursing field. In case you may be interested in Miss Parliament as a Welfare Teacher, we are forwarding herewith a copy of her letter to Dr. Falconer.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nDear Dr. Falconer,\n\nI would like to make application to your department for the nursing position in Coppermine. When Dr. Harvey was in Tuk, he told me that Coppermine station might be vacant this summer and since I want to work among the Eskimos (in a station) he suggested that I write to you.\n\nIn the fall of 1947 I made application to Dr. Moore for the nursing station at Norman but by the time the delayed reply came I was employed by Dr. G. D. O'Brien as his office nurse and secretary. Last March I came here as an emergency nurse and was in complete charge till November when another Sister came back. Since then I have one floor and the laboratory and x-ray departments.\n\nI returned from Tuk emergency station February 23rd. The people asked me to stay with them till after breakup if not longer but I couldn't as Miss Robinson has the authority to dispense the drugs. I did feel very badly leaving them after taking only a few days to gain their confidence. Miss Robinson would like a nurse theretoo because I think she feels that the patients go to Father Franche to have the drugs she gives them checked and they do too. I guess because he has been with them for so long.\n\nI don't know whom to discuss the following with so am choosing you. I met you and talked with you for only a few minutes but feel that you will tell me outright your opinions. I understand Miss Robinson is leaving and I was wondering, since it is a Government school, if I might teach the grades as well as doing the nursing. I am not a teacher but feel that I could do it well with the correspondence course and applying it to the Eskimo children. If you think this suggestion advisable to whom should I write. The people are really wonderful and I would stay for a three straight year period.\n\nWould you please help me to get nursing among the Eskimos on the coast. I have tried to gain all the experience I could to apply it to a place such as Tuk or Coppermine. I love the rough outdoor life with them, and making slow progress at learning their language. My qualifications are as follows:-\nName: Yvonne Parliament\nAge: 29\nRel: R.C.\n\nPrelim.

She is nineteen years old and by religion a protestant.\n\nHer academic standing is exceptionally good. Her normal training and education has been on scholarship from the Ponoka School Division and I am sure she has above average prospects in the educational field due to superior intellect. She intends to return for future training in the summer months.\n\nI recommend that this young woman be considered for a teacher either at Hobbema or some other day school, though possibly some Indian Residential could use her services.

I am twenty years old and French Catholic.\n\nFor which provinces are these teachers required and I would also like to know the grades being taught and the enrollment. When are the duties to commence? Are the teachers required only for country schools or for town schools as well?\nDoes the teacher reside in the school or are boarding places provided? If the teacher resides in the school do neighbors live close to the school? I suppose that part of the people living near these schools are Indians, but what would be some of the other nationalities? If a French teacher is required I have taught French throughout the year. I have my grade 12 highschool French and grade 12 A.C.F.C.

Enclosed is a mimeographed form containing pertinent information concerning my educational background.\n\nHoping you will give my application consideration, I am,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n7 June 1950\nMoncton NB\n302 Robinson St.\nJune 7th 1950\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter reading your advertisement in the Ensign about wanting Catholic teachers, I've decided to write immediately for more details. Would like very much to teach in one of your institutions here.\n\nWill now give you a few details about myself. My name is Raymond Comeau (twenty-three), French and belong to the Roman Catholic Religion. For my education, I've spent three years in a Catholic University which is directed by the Fathers of the Holy Cross. In those years, I have studied a classical course. This course is concerned as a grade eleven. In other words, I'm bilingual (French-English).\n\nI never taught school before, but for my first year, I would like to take grade one to five. I could teach religion French and English very well. So I'm leaving you with these few details, until you send me, if you desire, some of your application forms.\nSome of the students who left college where I went, and could teach school, because a student leaving college with a grade ten exam was considered good enough to teach school grades without normal school license.\n\nPlease I would also like to know the salaries, and how we can get settled once arriving there.\n\nHope to hear from you real soon.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames Smith\n\nRaymond Comeau\nIndian Affairs,\nResidential Schools Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nA friend of mine, Harold Speers of Campbellville was telling me that he is going to spend the summer teaching at Mississauga on James Bay, relieving the teacher there who had not had a holiday for three years. Are any other positions of this type available? I have experience in the north and liked it extremely well.\n\nI am twenty-five years of age, physically over six feet tall, a Public School teacher of more than three years of experience. I first taught at Mississauga, then at White River, and the past two years at Campbellville, Ontario. At Mississauga the school was half of Indian origin and we got along splendidly. While there I lived in the teacherage and did all my own providing so I understand the problems and more than that enjoyed the experience. Besides teaching, I have taken a business course, can type, am a Sunday School Teacher in our own Presbyterian church, and have lived most of my life on the farm, therefore have a great deal of experience in the more practical things of life.\n\nI was thinking of taking a carpentering position, or one as camp counsellor, but if I can be of any help in this capacity I would much prefer it. In the fall I am going into Toronto University, so I need not return till the middle of September.\n\nI would be delighted if you desire more details, and if you do not require my services please be good enough to inform me. Thank you for your kind attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge H. Michie\nJune 12, 1950.\n\nMr. M. H.

The completion of this form obligates you in no way but provides the necessary information to determine the classification and salary to which you would be entitled.\n\nIf you do not have a teaching certificate and are more interested in teaching in an Indian Residential School, would you please write again to Father Scheffer advising him of this fact.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nConfidential\n\nRegina, April 6th, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have written you today, officially, reporting on a number of Indian day school teachers, but, in that letter, mentioned the case of Mrs. B.G. Eugenie Thomas, and Department letter dated March 17th, 1950, File 1-1-1X (E), who apparently has applied for a teaching position.\n\nI do not know the circumstances of her application having been received, or by whom she was originally recommended, but I wrote to Indian Superintendent McLeod to ask him to interview her, and, if possible, arrange for me to have an interview with her if he considered it worthwhile. Enclosed is a copy of his reply, which is confidential, and which I know you will treat as such. Apparently the lady, in her old age, has decided that God has called her to overhaul the Indian educational system. We have a number of old ladies in our service who have had a similar call, and, believe me, they are a headache!\n\nMr. McLeod has reached the state of mind that he is beginning to have an obsession against aged teachers, and, to him, the application of Mrs. Thomas is just one more. I would ask that you please do everything you can to persuade Mrs. Thomas to continue in her present work of teaching white children. As she says she is strong, healthy, and a \"bear cat\" to work I am sure she can do a lot of good amongst the white children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nB.F.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter dated March 24th regarding enquiry from Mrs. Barbara Gray Eugene Thomas, Principal, Island Lake School, at Davis, Saskatchewan.\n\nOn my next visit through Davis I will call on Mrs. Thomas, however, I have met this woman previously and from my observations I do not recommend that her application receive consideration.\n\nWe have Miss Moore and any additions to our staff of women, aged and with views along same lines as Miss Moore, are sufficient. We will find Mrs. Thomas is a politician and consequently will insist upon conducting an Indian day school along political lines in opposition to present Federal Political Party. While this normally would not prevent her from conducting an Indian day school, the fact remains that all her complaints, etc. would be based on political views and in addition she would prove to be another helpless aged woman in charge of an Indian day school, and dependent upon myself and Assistant for janitor services. A further report will be submitted following an interview with Mrs. Thomas at that time I will endeavour to point out to her the disadvantages of a woman of her age entering Indian work.\n\nSgd. N.J.

Please do not think that because I am of superannuation age that I am senile. The Superintendent of this School Unit, Mr. R.B. Gould, will assure you to the contrary. I am strong, health, active, and a \"bear-cat\" to work.\"\n\nI am sending her an application form but most of the information we require is in her letter.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please advise me regarding teaching positions in Indian schools.\n\nI have B.A. and B.Ed. degrees, University of Saskatchewan, and an advanced teaching certificate. I have also the Final Teaching Certificate (Parchment) of Great Britain and six classes beyond aforementioned degrees. My professional classes include Child and Adolescent Psychology, and individual and group Intelligence Testing with analyses and case histories.\n\nI have been employed in the above two-roomed school since August 1948. I teach grades VII to XI inclusive. My two previous appointments were as principal of four-roomed schools where I taught grades XI and XII inclusive.\n\nAfter June 30, I wish to superannuate and interest myself in our native North Americans. Please do not think that because I am of superannuation age that I am senile. The Superintendent of this School Unit, Mr. R.B. Gould, will assure you to the contrary. I am strong, healthy, active, and a \"bear-cat\" to work.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\n\nEugenie Thomas\n(Mrs. B.G. Eugenie Thomas.)\nJune 26, 1950\n\nMr. Leo T. Ennis,\nSummerville, P.E.I.\n\nDear Mr. Ennis:\n\nWe have received notification of another vacancy which might interest you. This is at the Aroland Indian Day School situated on the main C.N.R. line about 12 miles from Nakina, Ontario. It is located in a former Hudson's Bay post with the classroom downstairs and the teacherage upstairs. It is a sound and comfortable building and is isolated in that there are no roads nearby. Transportation is by rail. Nakina is a C.N.R. divisional point and food supplies are transported to the school by way freight. There is no electricity. I can give you other details of this position if you are at all interested. We would classify you as a Grade III teacher at a starting salary of $2,280.00 an academic year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 23, 1950.\n\nMrs. Kathleen Close,\n282 Jarvis St.,\nOshawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Close:\n\nI have answered your letter of June 21, 1950, and regret that we have few vacancies left other than in one-room schools in the northern parts of the Prairie Provinces.\n\nI am sending you one of our standard application forms in the event that a vacancy might occur during the academic year in a larger school. At present, we do not have any such vacancies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.
